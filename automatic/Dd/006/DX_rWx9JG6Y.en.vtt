basically has the ultimen that's kind of

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.679 
basically has the ultimen that's kind of
a<00:00:28.260> yellow<00:00:28.500> color<00:00:28.859> eight<00:00:29.279> times<00:00:29.880> stronger<00:00:30.300> than

a yellow color eight times stronger than
the<00:00:31.080> old<00:00:31.260> screens<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.360> up<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.350> both

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the old screens so up with that both

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.950 
the old screens so up with that both
these<00:00:34.770> juicers<00:00:35.340> look<00:00:35.820> kind<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.300> similar<00:00:36.540> you

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
these juicers look kind of similar you

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.240 
these juicers look kind of similar you
know<00:00:37.079> they're<00:00:37.260> both<00:00:37.410> kind<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.739> upright

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
know they're both kind of upright

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.790 
know they're both kind of upright
juicers<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.390> they<00:00:39.510> operate<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.260> lot

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
juicers but they operate a lot

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.030 
juicers but they operate a lot
differently<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:42.030> one's<00:00:42.239> what's<00:00:42.420> called<00:00:42.750> a

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
differently this one's what's called a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.459 
differently this one's what's called a
vertical<00:00:44.040> single<00:00:44.760> auger<00:00:44.940> machine<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.079> how

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
vertical single auger machine and how

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.080 
vertical single auger machine and how
this<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.920> works<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.640> ahead<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.850> take<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
this one works go ahead and take that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.510 
this one works go ahead and take that
apart<00:00:48.539> there<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.469> basically<00:00:49.890> has<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.250> one

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
apart there this basically has this one

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
apart there this basically has this one
huge<00:00:51.120> otter<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.809> there<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.199> whatever<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.620> put

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
huge otter in there so whatever you put

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.380 
huge otter in there so whatever you put
in<00:00:52.949> there<00:00:53.100> basically<00:00:53.430> gets<00:00:53.730> crunched<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.270> by

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
in there basically gets crunched up by

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.600 
in there basically gets crunched up by
this<00:00:54.539> auger<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.140> literally<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.370> auger

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
this auger and literally the auger

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.689 
this auger and literally the auger
compresses<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> space<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.980> produce<00:00:59.550> is

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
compresses the space that the produce is

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.610 
compresses the space that the produce is
put<00:00:59.940> into<00:01:00.059> until<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.719> literally<00:01:01.020> squeeze<00:01:01.469> it

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
put into until it literally squeeze it

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.709 
put into until it literally squeeze it
out<00:01:01.739> all<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> juice<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.640> then<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> juice

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
out all the juice and then the juice

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.230 
out all the juice and then the juice
comes<00:01:04.019> out<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.379> side<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.519> pulp<00:01:05.790> comes

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
comes out one side and the pulp comes

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
comes out one side and the pulp comes
out<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> other<00:01:06.570> side<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.619> one<00:01:07.830> runs<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
out the other side so this one runs in a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.990 
out the other side so this one runs in a
low<00:01:08.490> 80<00:01:09.150> rpms<00:01:10.140> or<00:01:10.350> revolutions<00:01:10.439> per<00:01:11.400> minute<00:01:11.610> so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
low 80 rpms or revolutions per minute so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.420 
low 80 rpms or revolutions per minute so
that's<00:01:12.180> slow<00:01:13.020> running<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.619> slower<00:01:14.010> running

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
that's slow running so slower running

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.910 
that's slow running so slower running
juicers<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.060> general<00:01:15.390> are<00:01:15.509> quieter<00:01:16.080> number

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
juicers in general are quieter number

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.530 
juicers in general are quieter number
one<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> number<00:01:17.400> two<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:17.970> generally

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
one and number two they generally

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.080 
one and number two they generally
produce<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.200> higher<00:01:19.920> quality<00:01:20.280> juice<00:01:20.880> because

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
produce a higher quality juice because

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.570 
produce a higher quality juice because
less<00:01:21.479> oxidation<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.530> occurring<00:01:22.950> let's<00:01:23.460> go

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
less oxidation is occurring let's go

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.190 
less oxidation is occurring let's go
ahead<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.790> put<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.420> back<00:01:24.659> together<00:01:24.810> real

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
ahead and put this back together real

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.320 
ahead and put this back together real
quick<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.369> side<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.000> equip

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
quick so on this side we have to equip

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.140 
quick so on this side we have to equip
mini<00:01:27.689> 1<00:01:28.020> 10.5<00:01:28.740> machine<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:29.939> what

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
mini 1 10.5 machine and you know what

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.569 
mini 1 10.5 machine and you know what
you<00:01:30.540> could<00:01:30.659> judge<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> juicer<00:01:31.680> pipes<00:01:31.950> cover<00:01:32.280> or

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
you could judge a juicer pipes cover or

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.429 
you could judge a juicer pipes cover or
actually<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:33.060> performed<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:34.170> sure<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
actually have performed so be sure to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.039

how<00:01:37.680> these<00:01:37.920> machines<00:01:38.430> juice<00:01:38.880> different

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
how these machines juice different

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.060 
how these machines juice different
things<00:01:39.570> today<00:01:39.840> we're<00:01:40.140> going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> use<00:01:40.530> tomatoes

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
things today we're going to use tomatoes

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.310 
things today we're going to use tomatoes
you<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.430> see<00:01:41.670> how<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.360> works<00:01:42.570> both<00:01:43.170> these

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you can see how it works both these

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.370 
you can see how it works both these
machines<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> long<00:01:44.280> ten<00:01:44.820> year<00:01:45.149> warranty

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
machines have a long ten year warranty

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.100 
machines have a long ten year warranty
this<00:01:46.380> machine<00:01:46.829> basically<00:01:47.520> runs<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.149> 10,000

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
this machine basically runs at 10,000

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.950 
this machine basically runs at 10,000
RPM<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.860> one's<00:01:50.040> 80<00:01:50.310> once<00:01:50.640> again<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.750> this

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
RPM so this one's 80 once again so this

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.690 
RPM so this one's 80 once again so this
one<00:01:52.110> runs<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.590> lot<00:01:52.770> faster<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:53.280> him

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700

generally<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.600> higher<00:01:54.630> rpm<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.100> louder<00:01:56.369> it

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
generally the higher rpm the louder it

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.490 
generally the higher rpm the louder it
is<00:01:56.729> plus<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.600> addition

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
is plus in addition

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.530 
is plus in addition

supervise them juicers can be you know
fast<00:04:47.800> running<00:04:48.310> appliances<00:04:49.150> so<00:04:49.480> you<00:04:49.570> should

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
fast running appliances so you should

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.340 
fast running appliances so you should
always<00:04:50.169> supervise<00:04:50.710> your<00:04:50.890> children<00:04:52.200> as<00:04:53.200> you

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
can see this one's a lot quieter what is

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.510 
can see this one's a lot quieter what is
it<00:04:55.419> a<00:04:55.450> lot<00:04:55.630> slower<00:04:55.810> speed<00:04:56.350> and<00:04:56.650> wow<00:04:57.160> you<00:04:57.220> know

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
it a lot slower speed and wow you know

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.980 
it a lot slower speed and wow you know
there's<00:04:57.700> a<00:04:57.790> big<00:04:58.060> difference<00:04:58.330> in<00:04:58.570> this<00:04:58.660> pulp

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
there's a big difference in this pulp

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.570 
there's a big difference in this pulp
coming<00:04:59.230> out<00:04:59.410> we'll<00:04:59.680> keep<00:04:59.830> it<00:04:59.980> up<00:05:00.160> up<00:05:00.310> at<00:05:00.460> the

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
coming out we'll keep it up up at the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.290 
coming out we'll keep it up up at the
end<00:05:00.730> there<00:05:02.340> well<00:05:03.340> that's<00:05:03.460> pretty<00:05:03.730> much<00:05:03.880> it<00:05:03.940> I

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
end there well that's pretty much it I

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.940 
end there well that's pretty much it I
mean<00:05:04.450> that<00:05:04.630> was<00:05:04.900> how<00:05:05.080> fast<00:05:05.410> you'll<00:05:05.740> make<00:05:05.919> a

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
mean that was how fast you'll make a

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:12.350 
mean that was how fast you'll make a
vert<00:05:06.250> juicer<00:05:06.540> juiced<00:05:07.540> 10<00:05:08.380> ounces<00:05:08.830> of<00:05:09.250> tomatoes

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.250 

so<00:05:13.360> we're<00:05:13.450> going<00:05:13.540> to<00:05:13.630> go<00:05:13.750> ahead<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:13.960> let<00:05:14.140> the

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
so we're going to go ahead and let the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.520 
so we're going to go ahead and let the
Omega<00:05:14.680> vert<00:05:15.000> 330<00:05:16.000> HD<00:05:16.479> juicer<00:05:16.840> run<00:05:17.050> per<00:05:17.229> minute

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
Omega vert 330 HD juicer run per minute

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.350 
Omega vert 330 HD juicer run per minute
and<00:05:17.710> because<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.610> know<00:05:18.700> it<00:05:18.820> does<00:05:19.030> take<00:05:19.330> a

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
and because you know it does take a

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.000 
and because you know it does take a
little<00:05:19.510> bit<00:05:19.660> of<00:05:19.720> time<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.169> basically<00:05:20.470> push<00:05:20.830> the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
little bit of time to basically push the

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.310 
little bit of time to basically push the
tomatoes<00:05:21.460> through<00:05:21.790> the<00:05:21.940> auger<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.960> get<00:05:23.140> into

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
tomatoes through the auger to get into

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.650 
tomatoes through the auger to get into
juices<00:05:23.650> not<00:05:23.830> like<00:05:24.010> instantaneously<00:05:25.000> with<00:05:25.300> a

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
juices not like instantaneously with a

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.740 
juices not like instantaneously with a
liquid<00:05:25.900> mini<00:05:26.380> 1<00:05:26.620> 10.5<00:05:27.160> so<00:05:28.030> it<00:05:28.240> looks<00:05:28.419> like<00:05:28.479> it's

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
liquid mini 1 10.5 so it looks like it's

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.230 
liquid mini 1 10.5 so it looks like it's
finally<00:05:28.990> slowing<00:05:29.410> down<00:05:29.790> the<00:05:30.790> way<00:05:30.940> to<00:05:31.000> know

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
finally slowing down the way to know

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.690 
finally slowing down the way to know
when<00:05:31.419> the<00:05:31.510> Omega<00:05:31.900> vert<00:05:32.050> 330<00:05:32.560> HD<00:05:33.040> is<00:05:33.160> completely

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
when the Omega vert 330 HD is completely

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.430 
when the Omega vert 330 HD is completely
done<00:05:33.910> is<00:05:34.090> that<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.330> pulp<00:05:34.600> basically<00:05:35.110> stops

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
done is that the pulp basically stops

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.590 
done is that the pulp basically stops
coming<00:05:35.830> out<00:05:36.010> so<00:05:36.580> pretty<00:05:36.850> much<00:05:36.910> looks<00:05:37.300> like<00:05:37.390> the

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
coming out so pretty much looks like the

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.659 
coming out so pretty much looks like the
pulp<00:05:37.840> is<00:05:38.020> stopped<00:05:38.530> coming<00:05:38.860> out<00:05:39.010> we're<00:05:39.550> going

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
pulp is stopped coming out we're going

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:40.950 
pulp is stopped coming out we're going
to<00:05:39.760> go<00:05:39.850> ahead<00:05:39.880> and<00:05:40.180> turn<00:05:40.300> off<00:05:40.479> the<00:05:40.600> machine

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
to go ahead and turn off the machine

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.630 
to go ahead and turn off the machine
next<00:05:41.680> we're<00:05:41.830> going<00:05:41.919> to<00:05:42.010> go<00:05:42.130> ahead<00:05:42.160> and<00:05:42.280> compare

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
next we're going to go ahead and compare

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.210 
next we're going to go ahead and compare
full<00:05:43.000> so<00:05:43.600> let's<00:05:43.780> go<00:05:43.930> ahead<00:05:43.960> and<00:05:44.110> take<00:05:44.530> apart

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
full so let's go ahead and take apart

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.000 
full so let's go ahead and take apart
the<00:05:45.340> equip<00:05:45.760> mini<00:05:46.030> and<00:05:46.560> show<00:05:47.560> you<00:05:47.620> the<00:05:47.770> pulp

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
the equip mini and show you the pulp

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.690 
the equip mini and show you the pulp
inside<00:05:48.250> here<00:05:50.040> we're<00:05:51.040> going<00:05:51.130> to<00:05:51.250> go<00:05:51.340> ahead<00:05:51.370> and

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
inside here we're going to go ahead and

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.880 
inside here we're going to go ahead and
careful<00:05:52.300> you<00:05:52.419> reach<00:05:52.690> in<00:05:52.900> this<00:05:53.050> a<00:05:53.110> pulp<00:05:53.590> catch

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
careful you reach in this a pulp catch

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.120 
careful you reach in this a pulp catch
container

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.430 

so<00:06:00.130> here's<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.580> pulp<00:06:00.880> out<00:06:01.060> of<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.570> equipment

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
so here's the pulp out of the equipment

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.600 
so here's the pulp out of the equipment
I<00:06:02.530> don't<00:06:02.680> know<00:06:02.770> if<00:06:02.830> you<00:06:02.889> can<00:06:02.979> see<00:06:03.220> that<00:06:03.400> it's

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
I don't know if you can see that it's

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.550 
I don't know if you can see that it's
like<00:06:03.790> you<00:06:04.449> know<00:06:04.570> there's<00:06:04.690> basically<00:06:04.930> some<00:06:05.320> big

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
like you know there's basically some big

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.529 
like you know there's basically some big
pieces<00:06:05.919> of<00:06:06.460> the<00:06:07.030> tomatoes<00:06:07.600> love<00:06:07.900> you<00:06:08.050> know<00:06:08.430> and

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
pieces of the tomatoes love you know and

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:12.360 
pieces of the tomatoes love you know and
it<00:06:10.539> is<00:06:10.630> actually<00:06:10.810> rather<00:06:11.139> wet<00:06:11.500> we<00:06:12.070> could<00:06:12.220> go

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
it is actually rather wet we could go

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.529 
it is actually rather wet we could go
into<00:06:12.580> this<00:06:13.050> container<00:06:14.050> here<00:06:14.530> and<00:06:15.270> try<00:06:16.270> to<00:06:16.330> grab

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
into this container here and try to grab

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.540 
into this container here and try to grab
some<00:06:16.690> of<00:06:16.750> this<00:06:16.870> pulp<00:06:17.169> here<00:06:17.440> now<00:06:18.130> you<00:06:18.190> know<00:06:18.400> the

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
some of this pulp here now you know the

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.249 
some of this pulp here now you know the
pulp<00:06:18.820> is<00:06:18.970> still<00:06:19.270> rather<00:06:19.479> wet<00:06:19.810> but<00:06:20.080> you<00:06:20.110> know

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:20.259 
pulp is still rather wet but you know

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:22.379 
pulp is still rather wet but you know
this<00:06:20.410> pulp<00:06:20.740> is<00:06:20.919> much<00:06:21.160> more<00:06:21.430> broken<00:06:21.910> down<00:06:22.120> and

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
this pulp is much more broken down and

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.600 
this pulp is much more broken down and
much<00:06:22.600> more<00:06:22.840> dry<00:06:23.169> so<00:06:23.830> let's<00:06:24.220> see<00:06:24.370> how<00:06:24.400> that

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
much more dry so let's see how that

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.550 
much more dry so let's see how that
translated<00:06:25.479> into<00:06:26.139> the<00:06:26.320> juice<00:06:28.080> so<00:06:29.080> here's<00:06:29.380> the

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
translated into the juice so here's the

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.590 
translated into the juice so here's the
juice<00:06:29.979> out<00:06:30.190> of<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:30.940> Omega<00:06:31.840> vert<00:06:32.970> 330<00:06:33.970> HD<00:06:34.449> and

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
juice out of the Omega vert 330 HD and

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.980 
juice out of the Omega vert 330 HD and
here<00:06:34.900> is<00:06:35.050> a<00:06:35.080> juice<00:06:35.440> out<00:06:35.680> of<00:06:35.800> the<00:06:36.160> liquidity

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
here is a juice out of the liquidity

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.830 
here is a juice out of the liquidity
let's<00:06:37.990> see<00:06:38.139> it<00:06:38.199> looks<00:06:38.320> like<00:06:38.880> the<00:06:39.880> Omega<00:06:40.419> vert

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
let's see it looks like the Omega vert

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.969 
let's see it looks like the Omega vert
330<00:06:41.680> HD<00:06:42.370> beat<00:06:43.360> it<00:06:43.539> by<00:06:43.690> like<00:06:43.960> that<00:06:44.199> much<00:06:44.440> so<00:06:44.860> it

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
330 HD beat it by like that much so it

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.560 
330 HD beat it by like that much so it
was<00:06:45.100> a<00:06:45.130> little<00:06:45.370> bit<00:06:45.520> more<00:06:45.760> effective<00:06:46.360> in<00:06:46.479> the

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
was a little bit more effective in the

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.570 
was a little bit more effective in the
yield<00:06:46.840> but<00:06:47.470> the<00:06:47.590> other<00:06:47.770> main<00:06:48.070> difference<00:06:48.490> that

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
yield but the other main difference that

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.070 
yield but the other main difference that
you<00:06:48.669> could<00:06:48.789> probably<00:06:49.060> see<00:06:49.449> as<00:06:49.630> I<00:06:49.750> hold<00:06:49.960> up

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
you could probably see as I hold up

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.500 
you could probably see as I hold up
these<00:06:50.169> glasses<00:06:50.500> that<00:06:50.860> the<00:06:51.610> juice<00:06:51.940> in<00:06:52.210> the

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
these glasses that the juice in the

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.560 
these glasses that the juice in the
Omega<00:06:53.080> vert<00:06:53.410> 330<00:06:53.949> HD<00:06:54.340> is<00:06:54.460> much<00:06:54.669> darker<00:06:54.970> I<00:06:55.330> don't

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.570 
Omega vert 330 HD is much darker I don't

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.640 
Omega vert 330 HD is much darker I don't
know<00:06:55.630> if<00:06:55.690> you<00:06:55.750> can<00:06:55.870> see<00:06:56.020> that<00:06:56.139> on<00:06:56.229> the<00:06:56.320> camera

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
know if you can see that on the camera

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.950 
know if you can see that on the camera
this<00:06:57.310> juice<00:06:57.639> is<00:06:57.789> kind<00:06:58.030> of<00:06:58.090> like<00:06:58.210> pinkish<00:06:58.690> this

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
this juice is kind of like pinkish this

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.230 
this juice is kind of like pinkish this
juice<00:06:59.199> is<00:06:59.229> like<00:06:59.530> nice<00:06:59.830> dark<00:07:00.250> and<00:07:00.430> red<00:07:00.610> now

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
juice is like nice dark and red now

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.330 
juice is like nice dark and red now
that's<00:07:01.419> because<00:07:01.750> this<00:07:02.349> juicer<00:07:03.039> the<00:07:03.220> old

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
that's because this juicer the old

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.909 
that's because this juicer the old
equipment<00:07:03.610> runs<00:07:04.539> at<00:07:04.660> 10,000<00:07:05.260> RPM<00:07:05.380> spins

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
equipment runs at 10,000 RPM spins

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.620 
equipment runs at 10,000 RPM spins
really<00:07:06.070> fast<00:07:06.190> and<00:07:06.639> as<00:07:06.760> its<00:07:07.000> spinning<00:07:07.120> its

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.630 
really fast and as its spinning its

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.140 
really fast and as its spinning its
basically<00:07:08.199> putting<00:07:08.470> more<00:07:08.710> air<00:07:08.979> or<00:07:09.400> oxygen<00:07:09.669> in

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
basically putting more air or oxygen in

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.610 
basically putting more air or oxygen in
your<00:07:10.330> juice<00:07:10.510> which<00:07:10.720> tends<00:07:10.990> to<00:07:11.110> oxidize<00:07:11.260> the

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.620 
your juice which tends to oxidize the

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.529 
your juice which tends to oxidize the
juice<00:07:11.949> also<00:07:12.340> the<00:07:12.789> reason<00:07:12.940> why<00:07:13.090> it's<00:07:13.240> pig<00:07:13.419> is

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:13.539 
juice also the reason why it's pig is

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:15.480 
juice also the reason why it's pig is
because<00:07:13.810> all<00:07:13.930> the<00:07:14.020> air<00:07:14.229> bubbles<00:07:14.590> are<00:07:14.830> breaking

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
because all the air bubbles are breaking

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.700 
because all the air bubbles are breaking
up<00:07:15.610> the<00:07:15.729> redness<00:07:16.120> of<00:07:16.120> how<00:07:16.389> it<00:07:16.570> should<00:07:16.840> be<00:07:16.870> so

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710 
up the redness of how it should be so

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.620 
up the redness of how it should be so
you're<00:07:17.889> seeing<00:07:18.070> it<00:07:18.159> kind<00:07:18.340> of<00:07:18.370> pinkish<00:07:18.970> so<00:07:19.449> it's

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.630 
you're seeing it kind of pinkish so it's

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:26.540 
you're seeing it kind of pinkish so it's
a<00:07:19.690> lot<00:07:19.840> more<00:07:19.870> up<00:07:20.289> I<00:07:20.560> don't<00:07:20.979> know<00:07:21.120> bubbly<00:07:25.229> mmm

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.550

a lot more up I don't know bubbly mmm
still<00:07:27.550> really<00:07:27.789> delicious<00:07:30.720> mmm<00:07:32.400> Wow<00:07:33.400> big

juice and you know this one's still good
too<00:07:42.070> so<00:07:42.760> hopefully<00:07:43.270> you've<00:07:43.389> learned<00:07:43.539> more

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:43.870 
too so hopefully you've learned more

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.589 
too so hopefully you've learned more
today<00:07:43.900> about<00:07:44.260> what<00:07:44.620> juicer<00:07:45.130> yields<00:07:45.909> more<00:07:46.150> when

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 
today about what juicer yields more when

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:48.210 
today about what juicer yields more when
juicing<00:07:46.840> 10<00:07:47.169> ounces<00:07:47.409> of<00:07:47.500> tomatoes<00:07:47.860> and<00:07:48.039> that

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:48.220 
juicing 10 ounces of tomatoes and that

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.689 
juicing 10 ounces of tomatoes and that
is<00:07:48.430> the<00:07:48.909> Omega<00:07:49.300> vert<00:07:49.449> 330<00:07:50.050> HD<00:07:50.740> so<00:07:51.250> be<00:07:51.400> sure<00:07:51.430> to
