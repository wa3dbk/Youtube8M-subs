ancients you will generate fury

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.650 
ancients you will generate fury
incredibly<00:00:50.250> fast<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.850> will<00:00:50.969> take<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.449> less

attention to the damage output that much

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.690 
attention to the damage output that much
this<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.870> basically<00:01:03.870> kind<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.430> my<00:01:05.430> idea

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
this is basically kind of like my idea

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.039 
this is basically kind of like my idea
of<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.180> know<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.750> with

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
of what you know you can do with

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.840 
of what you know you can do with
something<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.560> Boulder<00:01:07.920> toss<00:01:08.100> maybe<00:01:08.520> even

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
something like Boulder toss maybe even

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.469 
something like Boulder toss maybe even
Avalanche<00:01:09.510> with<00:01:09.840> lehar<00:01:10.409> where<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.520> should<00:01:12.299> be

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
Avalanche with lehar where you should be

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.910 
Avalanche with lehar where you should be
able<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.810> those<00:01:13.080> ancients<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.619> should<00:01:13.799> be

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
able to those ancients you should be

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.380 
able to those ancients you should be
able<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.159> actually<00:01:14.250> put<00:01:14.549> together<00:01:14.670> good<00:01:14.880> where

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
able to actually put together good where

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.080 
able to actually put together good where
you<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.200> do<00:01:16.320> boner<00:01:16.560> toss<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.130> avalanche<00:01:17.850> like

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
you can do boner toss and avalanche like

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
you can do boner toss and avalanche like
non-stop<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:18.990> rotate<00:01:19.140> them<00:01:19.470> over

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
non-stop you can just rotate them over

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.429 
non-stop you can just rotate them over
and<00:01:19.920> over<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.900> could<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.110> very<00:01:22.259> very

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and over so it could be a very very

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.380 
and over so it could be a very very
interesting<00:01:22.680> build<00:01:23.240> especially<00:01:24.240> since

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
interesting build especially since

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.030 
interesting build especially since
avalanche<00:01:24.900> doesn't<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.350> any<00:01:25.470> love<00:01:25.650> because

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
avalanche doesn't get any love because

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.240 
avalanche doesn't get any love because
no<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:26.460> actually<00:01:27.000> uses<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.829> so<00:01:28.829> anyway<00:01:29.100> let's

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
no one actually uses it so anyway let's

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.480 
no one actually uses it so anyway let's
go<00:01:29.369> over<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.750> build<00:01:30.750> real<00:01:31.500> quick<00:01:31.770> Boulder

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.330 
these over max attack speed I'm
basically<00:01:55.170> trying<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.890> highest

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
basically trying to get the highest

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.660 
basically trying to get the highest
possible<00:01:57.240> attack<00:01:57.509> speed<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.610> on<00:01:59.610> my

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
possible attack speed that I can on my

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.730 
possible attack speed that I can on my
main<00:02:00.030> hand<00:02:00.270> weapon<00:02:00.600> because<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.409> what

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
main hand weapon because that is what

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.700 
main hand weapon because that is what
you<00:02:02.040> know<00:02:02.130> ancients<00:02:03.200> damage<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.469> attack

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
you know ancients damage and attack

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.530 
you know ancients damage and attack
speed<00:02:04.740> scales<00:02:05.430> from<00:02:05.610> currently<00:02:06.090> or<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
speed scales from currently or it

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.639 
speed scales from currently or it
doesn't<00:02:06.719> live<00:02:06.960> i'm<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.290> sure<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.530> that's

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
doesn't live i'm not sure if that's

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.669 
doesn't live i'm not sure if that's
changed<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:08.190> PT<00:02:08.520> or<00:02:08.550> not<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.679> somewhat

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
changed on PT or not but I somewhat

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.780 
changed on PT or not but I somewhat
hasn't<00:02:10.950> been<00:02:11.039> changed<00:02:11.220> that's<00:02:11.489> according<00:02:11.610> to

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
hasn't been changed that's according to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.090 
hasn't been changed that's according to
nutro

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
nutro

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.700 
nutro
but<00:02:13.280> my<00:02:13.640> main<00:02:13.880> hand<00:02:14.270> attack<00:02:14.870> speed<00:02:15.200> i<00:02:15.230> am<00:02:15.470> using

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
but my main hand attack speed i am using

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.010 
but my main hand attack speed i am using
a<00:02:16.070> dagger<00:02:16.520> which<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.090> fastest<00:02:17.450> weapon<00:02:17.750> with

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
a dagger which the fastest weapon with

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.710 
a dagger which the fastest weapon with
the<00:02:18.350> highest<00:02:18.920> attacks<00:02:19.280> people<00:02:19.490> possible<00:02:20.150> I'm

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
the highest attacks people possible I'm

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.320 
the highest attacks people possible I'm
sitting<00:02:21.260> at<00:02:21.440> 2.6<00:02:22.220> which<00:02:22.430> coincidentally<00:02:22.610> is

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
sitting at 2.6 which coincidentally is

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.750 
sitting at 2.6 which coincidentally is
actually<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.170> whirlwind<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.980> 20<00:02:25.400> Oh<00:02:25.430> break

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
actually a whirlwind and 20 Oh break

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.670 
actually a whirlwind and 20 Oh break
point<00:02:26.060> but<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.140> doesn't<00:02:27.350> really<00:02:27.440> matter

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
point but that doesn't really matter

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.140 
point but that doesn't really matter
here<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:30.160> I'm<00:02:31.160> going<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.490> be<00:02:31.580> attacking<00:02:31.850> like

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
here so I'm going to be attacking like

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.450 
here so I'm going to be attacking like
fairly<00:02:32.600> fast<00:02:32.870> like<00:02:33.410> this<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.770> this<00:02:34.070> is<00:02:34.250> pretty

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
fairly fast like this is this is pretty

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.620 
fairly fast like this is this is pretty
fast<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.000> when<00:02:35.240> I<00:02:35.270> pop<00:02:35.570> rap<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.470> Berserker<00:02:37.630> my

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
fast and when I pop rap the Berserker my

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.070 
fast and when I pop rap the Berserker my
attack<00:02:38.900> speed<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.320> going<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.530> jump<00:02:39.710> up<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.060> 3.26

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
attack speed is going to jump up to 3.26

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.080 
attack speed is going to jump up to 3.26
so<00:02:42.080> I'm<00:02:42.410> attacking<00:02:42.680> very<00:02:43.100> fast<00:02:43.340> my<00:02:43.610> ancients

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
so I'm attacking very fast my ancients

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.850 
so I'm attacking very fast my ancients
on<00:02:44.330> top<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.540> that<00:02:44.750> get<00:02:44.990> fifty<00:02:45.290> percent<00:02:45.560> boost

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
on top of that get fifty percent boost

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.500 
on top of that get fifty percent boost
which<00:02:46.100> i<00:02:46.190> believe<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.490> actually<00:02:46.880> additive<00:02:47.300> not

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
which i believe is actually additive not

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.710 
which i believe is actually additive not
multiplicative<00:02:48.520> not<00:02:49.520> 100<00:02:49.850> sure<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.240> that<00:02:50.300> but

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
multiplicative not 100 sure on that but

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.820 
multiplicative not 100 sure on that but
anyway<00:02:50.930> they're<00:02:51.230> going<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.410> attack<00:02:51.470> like

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
anyway they're going to attack like

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.380 
anyway they're going to attack like
ridiculously<00:02:52.310> fast<00:02:52.610> but<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.150> pretty

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
ridiculously fast but this is a pretty

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.240 
ridiculously fast but this is a pretty
like<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:54.080> is<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.260> pretty<00:02:54.470> fast<00:02:54.680> attack<00:02:55.010> rate

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
like this is a pretty fast attack rate

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.310 
like this is a pretty fast attack rate
so<00:02:55.970> I'm<00:02:56.030> going<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.210> be<00:02:56.300> generating<00:02:56.720> fury<00:02:57.020> a

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
so I'm going to be generating fury a

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.920 
so I'm going to be generating fury a
very<00:02:57.860> very<00:02:57.980> good<00:02:58.130> pace<00:02:58.420> going<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.540> go<00:02:59.660> over<00:02:59.690> my

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
very very good pace going to go over my

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.690 
very very good pace going to go over my
gear<00:03:00.170> real<00:03:00.350> quick<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.890> guys<00:03:01.070> can<00:03:01.310> pause<00:03:01.490> the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
gear real quick you guys can pause the

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.940 
gear real quick you guys can pause the
video<00:03:01.850> check<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.300> out<00:03:02.510> but<00:03:02.870> basically<00:03:03.740> have<00:03:03.920> a

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
video check it out but basically have a

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.850 
video check it out but basically have a
tax<00:03:04.190> feed<00:03:04.430> on<00:03:04.550> here<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:04.940> perfect<00:03:05.390> role<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:05.870> can't

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
tax feed on here a perfect role I can't

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.180 
tax feed on here a perfect role I can't
use<00:03:08.080> witching<00:03:09.080> hour<00:03:09.200> because<00:03:09.710> I<00:03:09.740> have<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.070> have

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
use witching hour because I have to have

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.000 
use witching hour because I have to have
the<00:03:10.310> ik<00:03:10.460> set<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.170> could<00:03:12.170> use<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.350> ik<00:03:12.650> hem<00:03:12.860> but

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
the ik set I could use the ik hem but

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.260 
the ik set I could use the ik hem but
that<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.190> wouldn't<00:03:13.430> be<00:03:13.490> able<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.760> use<00:03:13.940> memo<00:03:14.180> of

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
that I wouldn't be able to use memo of

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.840 
that I wouldn't be able to use memo of
twilight<00:03:14.840> which<00:03:15.170> has<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.710> tax<00:03:15.920> speed<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:16.520> it's

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
twilight which has the tax speed so it's

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.320 
twilight which has the tax speed so it's
kind<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.210> like<00:03:17.270> a<00:03:17.980> toss-up<00:03:18.980> potato<00:03:19.280> potato<00:03:19.580> and

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
kind of like a toss-up potato potato and

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.090 
kind of like a toss-up potato potato and
I<00:03:20.390> have<00:03:20.540> one<00:03:20.720> percent<00:03:21.050> extra<00:03:21.290> memento<00:03:21.740> I'm

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
I have one percent extra memento I'm

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.410 
I have one percent extra memento I'm
going<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.340> be<00:03:22.400> using<00:03:22.460> oculus<00:03:22.850> ring<00:03:23.240> with<00:03:23.360> a

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
going to be using oculus ring with a

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.030 
going to be using oculus ring with a
double<00:03:23.690> attack<00:03:23.870> speed<00:03:24.200> rules<00:03:24.410> so<00:03:24.650> this<00:03:24.800> is<00:03:24.920> one

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
double attack speed rules so this is one

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.290 
double attack speed rules so this is one
of<00:03:25.070> those<00:03:25.190> rings<00:03:25.460> that<00:03:25.580> comes<00:03:25.910> with<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.120> nine

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
of those rings that comes with a nine

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.720 
of those rings that comes with a nine
percent<00:03:26.630> tax<00:03:26.900> speed<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:28.430> can<00:03:28.550> actually

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
percent tax speed and you can actually

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.990 
percent tax speed and you can actually
enchant<00:03:29.270> one<00:03:29.420> of<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.540> other<00:03:29.660> properties<00:03:30.140> to

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
enchant one of the other properties to

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.600 
enchant one of the other properties to
another<00:03:32.000> seven<00:03:32.510> giving<00:03:32.990> you<00:03:33.170> up<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.980> sixteen

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
another seven giving you up to sixteen

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.720 
another seven giving you up to sixteen
percent<00:03:34.910> attack<00:03:35.210> speed<00:03:36.400> could<00:03:37.400> be<00:03:37.490> using

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
percent attack speed could be using

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.650 
percent attack speed could be using
tasker's<00:03:38.180> with<00:03:38.330> 50<00:03:38.630> texts<00:03:38.930> before<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.290> pets

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
tasker's with 50 texts before the pets

quickly<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:03.009> ancients<00:05:03.400> can<00:05:03.550> generate<00:05:03.880> fear

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
quickly the ancients can generate fear

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.020 
quickly the ancients can generate fear
for<00:05:04.419> you<00:05:04.509> look<00:05:04.659> at<00:05:04.750> that<00:05:04.900> it's<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.800> same<00:05:06.069> it's

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
for you look at that it's the same it's

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.110 
for you look at that it's the same it's
absolutely<00:05:07.180> insane<00:05:08.099> and<00:05:09.099> when<00:05:09.819> you<00:05:09.909> combine

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
absolutely insane and when you combine

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.480 
absolutely insane and when you combine
this<00:05:10.449> with<00:05:10.509> something<00:05:11.050> like<00:05:11.229> avalanche<00:05:11.740> so<00:05:12.220> I

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
this with something like avalanche so I

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.129 
this with something like avalanche so I
don't<00:05:13.389> have<00:05:13.509> a<00:05:13.569> whole<00:05:13.720> lot<00:05:13.750> of<00:05:13.840> cooldown

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
don't have a whole lot of cooldown

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.570 
don't have a whole lot of cooldown
reduction<00:05:14.259> here<00:05:14.860> i<00:05:14.889> have<00:05:15.340> actually

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
reduction here i have actually

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.210 
reduction here i have actually
two-point-six<00:05:16.300> percent<00:05:16.360> basically<00:05:17.080> zero<00:05:17.319> but

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
two-point-six percent basically zero but

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.710 
two-point-six percent basically zero but
let's<00:05:18.370> say<00:05:18.550> you've<00:05:18.729> got<00:05:18.909> and<00:05:19.150> I<00:05:19.210> music<00:05:19.449> lahar

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
let's say you've got and I music lahar

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.870 
let's say you've got and I music lahar
which<00:05:20.440> you<00:05:20.800> know<00:05:20.919> only<00:05:21.190> you<00:05:21.490> only<00:05:21.639> need<00:05:21.849> to

which you know only you only need to

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.050 
which you know only you only need to
expend<00:05:22.650> 15<00:05:23.650> fury<00:05:23.949> to<00:05:24.190> reduce<00:05:24.490> the<00:05:24.610> cooldown<00:05:24.759> by

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
percent cooldown reduction maybe even a

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.680 
percent cooldown reduction maybe even a

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
little bit lower one Boulder toss will

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.029 
little bit lower one Boulder toss will
remove<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:37.870> cooldown<00:05:38.229> on<00:05:38.409> your<00:05:38.590> Avalanche

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.490 
remove the cooldown on your Avalanche
lahar<00:05:39.310> so<00:05:39.759> like<00:05:40.570> if<00:05:40.690> I<00:05:40.750> pop<00:05:40.930> avalanche<00:05:41.349> right

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
lahar so like if I pop avalanche right

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.950 
lahar so like if I pop avalanche right
now<00:05:41.650> and<00:05:42.340> then<00:05:42.759> I<00:05:42.820> Boulder<00:05:43.090> toss<00:05:43.270> boom<00:05:43.630> it's

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
now and then I Boulder toss boom it's

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.350 
now and then I Boulder toss boom it's
almost<00:05:44.259> it's<00:05:44.500> almost<00:05:44.620> half<00:05:44.949> so<00:05:45.940> the<00:05:46.090> cooldown

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
almost it's almost half so the cooldown

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.860 
almost it's almost half so the cooldown
is<00:05:46.389> reduced<00:05:47.050> by<00:05:47.169> almost<00:05:47.199> half<00:05:48.060> so<00:05:49.060> more<00:05:49.750> the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
is reduced by almost half so more the

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.149 
is reduced by almost half so more the
approximately<00:05:50.349> fifty<00:05:50.590> percent<00:05:50.860> cord<00:05:51.099> out

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
approximately fifty percent cord out

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.800 
approximately fifty percent cord out
reduction<00:05:51.550> you<00:05:51.759> will<00:05:51.880> be<00:05:52.030> able<00:05:52.150> to<00:05:52.330> like<00:05:52.659> the

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
reduction you will be able to like the

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.779 
reduction you will be able to like the
Stay<00:05:52.990> implication<00:05:53.440> will<00:05:53.650> be<00:05:53.770> able<00:05:53.830> to<00:05:54.099> order

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
Stay implication will be able to order

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.100 
Stay implication will be able to order
toss<00:05:55.409> Avalanche<00:05:56.520> Boulder<00:05:57.520> toss<00:05:57.990> maybe<00:05:58.990> a

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
toss Avalanche Boulder toss maybe a

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.290 
toss Avalanche Boulder toss maybe a
couple<00:05:59.289> Boulder<00:05:59.650> tosses<00:06:00.099> and<00:06:00.340> then<00:06:00.520> avalanche

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
couple Boulder tosses and then avalanche

introduction<00:06:03.370> on<00:06:03.430> here<00:06:03.639> but<00:06:03.789> that's<00:06:03.969> just

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
introduction on here but that's just

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.510 
introduction on here but that's just
kind<00:06:04.539> of<00:06:04.569> like<00:06:04.690> a<00:06:04.719> new<00:06:04.949> theory<00:06:05.949> craft<00:06:06.310> though

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
kind of like a new theory craft though

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.529 
kind of like a new theory craft though
for<00:06:06.729> you<00:06:06.789> guys<00:06:07.830> and<00:06:08.969> the<00:06:09.969> reason<00:06:10.090> I'm<00:06:10.270> saying

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
for you guys and the reason I'm saying

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:11.969 
for you guys and the reason I'm saying
you<00:06:10.900> know<00:06:10.960> I'm<00:06:11.110> even<00:06:11.319> making<00:06:11.590> this<00:06:11.650> video's

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
you know I'm even making this video's

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.129 
you know I'm even making this video's
because<00:06:12.310> call<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.360> ancients<00:06:13.690> is<00:06:13.780> very<00:06:14.020> very

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
because call the ancients is very very

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.159 
because call the ancients is very very
powerful<00:06:14.380> now<00:06:14.770> so<00:06:15.099> the<00:06:15.969> fire<00:06:16.210> ancients<00:06:17.110> are

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
powerful now so the fire ancients are

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.210 
powerful now so the fire ancients are
very<00:06:17.440> very<00:06:17.590> good<00:06:17.800> for<00:06:18.009> damage<00:06:18.430> the

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.110 

the<00:06:22.220> ancients<00:06:22.669> fury<00:06:22.940> ancients<00:06:23.900> are<00:06:24.759> good<00:06:25.759> for

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
the ancients fury ancients are good for

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.689 
the ancients fury ancients are good for
removing<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.870> need<00:06:27.110> for<00:06:27.500> a<00:06:27.740> generator<00:06:28.130> so<00:06:28.610> you

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699 
removing the need for a generator so you

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.670 
removing the need for a generator so you
can<00:06:28.940> basically<00:06:29.060> take<00:06:29.389> any<00:06:29.750> build<00:06:29.990> like<00:06:30.350> let's

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
can basically take any build like let's

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.620 
can basically take any build like let's
say<00:06:30.770> hammer<00:06:31.280> the<00:06:31.490> ancients<00:06:31.910> or<00:06:32.000> even<00:06:32.210> seismic

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
say hammer the ancients or even seismic

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.439 
say hammer the ancients or even seismic
slam<00:06:32.870> and<00:06:33.229> just<00:06:34.039> spam<00:06:34.190> it<00:06:34.340> infinitely<00:06:34.639> I<00:06:35.090> do

this<00:06:35.810> now<00:06:36.229> if<00:06:36.410> you<00:06:36.530> are<00:06:36.620> going<00:06:36.710> to<00:06:36.800> be<00:06:36.860> using<00:06:36.919> a

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
this now if you are going to be using a

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.100 
this now if you are going to be using a
slower<00:06:37.520> weapons<00:06:37.940> such<00:06:38.150> as<00:06:38.180> the<00:06:38.600> furnace<00:06:38.930> which

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
slower weapons such as the furnace which

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.170 
slower weapons such as the furnace which

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
one has one point of attack speed you

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.150 
one has one point of attack speed you
absolutely<00:06:41.900> have<00:06:42.080> to<00:06:42.110> use<00:06:42.440> task<00:06:42.680> or<00:06:42.919> deal

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
absolutely have to use task or deal

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.469 
absolutely have to use task or deal
otherwise<00:06:43.639> they're<00:06:43.789> not<00:06:44.180> going<00:06:44.330> to<00:06:44.389> be

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
otherwise they're not going to be

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:45.909 
otherwise they're not going to be
attacking<00:06:44.840> fast<00:06:45.050> enough<00:06:45.350> to<00:06:45.470> not<00:06:45.680> going<00:06:45.800> to<00:06:45.860> be

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
attacking fast enough to not going to be

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:53.620 
attacking fast enough to not going to be
generating<00:06:46.370> very<00:06:46.610> fast<00:06:46.880> enough<00:06:47.259> but<00:06:52.539> it's<00:06:53.539> a

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
generating very fast enough but it's a

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.629 
generating very fast enough but it's a
very<00:06:53.870> very<00:06:53.900> potentially<00:06:54.710> powerful<00:06:55.130> spec

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 
very very potentially powerful spec

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.760 
very very potentially powerful spec
again<00:06:56.240> this<00:06:56.479> is<00:06:56.630> just<00:06:56.750> a<00:06:56.900> theory<00:06:57.110> craft<00:06:57.410> video

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
again this is just a theory craft video

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.370 
again this is just a theory craft video
one<00:06:57.979> kind<00:06:58.190> of<00:06:58.220> show<00:06:58.430> you<00:06:58.460> guys<00:06:59.380> what's

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 
one kind of show you guys what's

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:06.550 
one kind of show you guys what's
possible<00:07:00.860> in<00:07:01.810> terms<00:07:02.810> of<00:07:03.289> fury<00:07:04.070> generation<00:07:05.560> and

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
possible in terms of fury generation and

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.499 
possible in terms of fury generation and
this<00:07:07.190> isn't<00:07:07.490> optimal<00:07:07.789> I'm<00:07:07.880> not<00:07:08.060> sure<00:07:08.300> they're

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:08.509 
this isn't optimal I'm not sure they're

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:11.320 
this isn't optimal I'm not sure they're
actually<00:07:08.780> did<00:07:09.460> so<00:07:10.460> I'm<00:07:10.970> gonna<00:07:11.090> have<00:07:11.210> to

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
actually did so I'm gonna have to

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.520 
actually did so I'm gonna have to
actually<00:07:11.449> bring<00:07:11.750> back<00:07:12.050> here<00:07:14.289> you<00:07:15.289> guys<00:07:15.500> just

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.530 
actually bring back here you guys just

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.320 
actually bring back here you guys just
see<00:07:15.889> how<00:07:15.979> quickly<00:07:17.139> he<00:07:18.139> regenerates<00:07:18.770> when<00:07:19.330> when

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
see how quickly he regenerates when when

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.710 
see how quickly he regenerates when when
they're<00:07:20.449> not<00:07:20.570> frozen<00:07:21.940> so<00:07:22.940> am<00:07:23.090> I<00:07:23.180> guess<00:07:23.330> that's

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720 
they're not frozen so am I guess that's

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.589 
they're not frozen so am I guess that's
that<00:07:24.880> let<00:07:25.880> me<00:07:25.940> know<00:07:26.000> what<00:07:26.120> you<00:07:26.180> guys<00:07:26.240> think<00:07:26.419> in

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 
that let me know what you guys think in

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:29.379 
that let me know what you guys think in
the<00:07:26.659> comments<00:07:26.960> below<00:07:26.990> let<00:07:27.699> me<00:07:28.699> know<00:07:28.789> if<00:07:29.150> you

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:29.389 
the comments below let me know if you

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:31.240 
the comments below let me know if you
think<00:07:29.510> like<00:07:30.050> any<00:07:30.560> kind<00:07:30.710> of<00:07:30.830> bills<00:07:31.010> that<00:07:31.130> you

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.250 
think like any kind of bills that you

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.260 
think like any kind of bills that you
think<00:07:31.460> would<00:07:31.520> be<00:07:31.639> like<00:07:31.789> a<00:07:31.820> good<00:07:32.000> combination

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
think would be like a good combination

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.140 
think would be like a good combination
for<00:07:32.599> this<00:07:32.870> obviously<00:07:33.590> the<00:07:34.340> generator<00:07:34.789> spam

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150 
for this obviously the generator spam

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.180 
for this obviously the generator spam
builds<00:07:35.599> such<00:07:35.870> as<00:07:36.050> we<00:07:36.289> came<00:07:36.500> of<00:07:36.680> the<00:07:36.770> ancients

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.190 
builds such as we came of the ancients

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.210 
builds such as we came of the ancients
would<00:07:37.370> work<00:07:37.550> very<00:07:37.699> very<00:07:37.909> well<00:07:38.090> with<00:07:38.360> this<00:07:39.220> but

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:40.220 
would work very very well with this but

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.210 
would work very very well with this but
I<00:07:40.460> think<00:07:40.490> it<00:07:40.789> has<00:07:41.199> you<00:07:42.199> know<00:07:42.289> potential<00:07:42.710> for<00:07:42.919> a
