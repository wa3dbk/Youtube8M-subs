00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.010
 Hello dear fishermen and fishermen 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:11.099
 With you magazine successful fishing and I maxim 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.099
 peers in this little video I will tell 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.089
 about how to adjust the winding of the fishing line 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.270
 on 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.600
 without carrot reel this way 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.710
 so that with uneven posting such 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.990
 like a jig 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:31.230
 or twitching vaio the tatoo did not dump 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.710
 api subject there was no confusion and catching 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.660
 stayed as comfortable as possible 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.170
 me in the hands of the daiwa budget reel 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.539
 class daiwa I'm a river but now the conversation 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.780
 not about some sort of coil because something 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.670
 what we talk about but this function 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.820
 present in almost all 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.530
 coils and in the budget and in the most 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.449
 dear ones 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.789
 These are underground shaybochki for adjustment 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.820
 profile winding fishing line 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:09.930
 it would seem so many times and wrote 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.580
 articles and filmed videos on this topic but 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.189
 nevertheless fishing anyway 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.820
 constantly meet angler who 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.790
 profile winding fishing line on the spool 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.619
 unregulated and as a result they 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.630
 suffer from the discharge of loops companions 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:33.180
 although the operation well, it would seem simple as 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.780
 three pennies and so unscrew the nut 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.780
 clutch clutch 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:47.869
 remove the spool and immediately we see that 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.810
 a plastic ring is set here 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.119
 this is exactly that shpulya 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.640
 which is specifically designed 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:00.229
 manufacturer to adjust the profile 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.909
 winding fishing line and and we can take off 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.969
 if we need to adjust 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.009
 winding profile to the side 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.560
 reverse cone 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.310
 Often there are several such 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.459
 plastic rings if it is one and 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.250
 we want to adjust the winding profile 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:26.310
 more radically then we can take off and here 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.590
 this is a metal ring coil 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.120
 it will remain absolutely 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.739
 workable 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.200
 the ring is relatively thick therefore 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.069
 winding profile change immediately 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.079
 Significantly, but we must not hurry 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.890
 experiment and select for 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:46.700
 each specific coil needed 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.700
 magnitude 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.139
 so take this one off 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.989
 this ring is just using any 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:57.349
 small tweezers screwdriver yes just 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.519
 fingers can be picked up if desired 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.519
 now I'll take off for example 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.550
 that's why we put the spool in place 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:30.860
 fasten it and reel the line 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.630
 see if we have reached the desired 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:40.720
 result I will not tire the viewer 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:42.140
 the process of winding fishing line just for the sake of 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.560
 brevity 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:52.250
 and show on the example of another ready 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.450
 reels my old combat girlfriend daiwa 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.260
 certate here using just withdrawal 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.510
 underground 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:07.300
 clandestine gang profile winding fishing line 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:10.250
 made so what is needed that is below 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.340
 spools we see that cutting a little less 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.770
 and the top of her is a little more this and 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.160
 there is the most welcome reverse 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.790
 cone 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.290
 but of course in it all is wound up 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.460
 equal to reasonable limits that is, we 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.860
 see that about a millimeter is not fashionable but 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:32.660
 It would seem a trifle compared to 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.669
 just a straight cylinder this reverse 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.400
 cone this is different not so 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.919
 significantly but in practice at work 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.030
 coil it affects you very much 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:46.669
 Just be surprised when you reel the line 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.760
 like this, how much less 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.280
 loop loops 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.690
 confusion and other torment which 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.190
 used to deliver so much to you 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.460
 trouble Well on this until all 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.460
 good luck fishing
