in your hard drive and you can click it
back<00:04:30.960> in<00:04:31.140> so<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:31.950> can<00:04:32.070> put<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.220> total<00:04:32.490> of<00:04:32.790> five

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
back in so you can put a total of five

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.430 
back in so you can put a total of five
hard<00:04:33.630> drives<00:04:33.900> in<00:04:34.020> there<00:04:34.430> it<00:04:35.430> also<00:04:36.180> accepts<00:04:36.750> 3.5

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
hard drives in there it also accepts 3.5

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.720 
hard drives in there it also accepts 3.5
and<00:04:37.620> 2.5<00:04:38.270> and<00:04:39.710> right<00:04:40.710> here<00:04:40.980> you<00:04:41.220> can<00:04:41.250> take<00:04:41.550> out

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
and 2.5 and right here you can take out

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.980 
and 2.5 and right here you can take out
if<00:04:41.880> you<00:04:42.030> don't<00:04:42.210> want<00:04:42.360> if<00:04:42.450> you<00:04:42.540> want<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.810> space

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
if you don't want if you want the space

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.630 
if you don't want if you want the space
cleared<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.770> can<00:04:43.920> actually<00:04:44.040> pull<00:04:44.340> this<00:04:44.490> out

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
cleared you can actually pull this out

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.930 
cleared you can actually pull this out
and<00:04:45.060> kick<00:04:45.330> out<00:04:45.450> the<00:04:45.570> whole<00:04:45.780> entire<00:04:46.080> piece<00:04:46.380> and

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
and kick out the whole entire piece and

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.110 
and kick out the whole entire piece and
that<00:04:47.940> way<00:04:48.030> you<00:04:48.120> have<00:04:48.180> more<00:04:48.420> space<00:04:48.630> in<00:04:48.810> your<00:04:48.840> PC
