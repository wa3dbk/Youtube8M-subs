00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:11.370
 I promised to show how I learned 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:20.539
 and landing here looks like this number 6 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:24.539
 so cloudberries fall asleep just a mouse protein 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:29.240
 laying leave the furrow of the response from 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.099
 motoblock landing themselves when landing 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:37.370
 harbor old leaves are collected each 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.680
 year in the fall as soon as everything sat down 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.800
 the foliage is showered 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:48.210
 watering requires very little such 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.010
 dry season can be seen where the land is not 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.879
 covered with foliage so it's already 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.879
 dried up 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:12.150
 wet wet ground principle 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:20.250
 try as it grows so simple 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:29.850
 the tomatoes are already quite comfortable there 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:32.430
 thing laying on the track is convenient 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.840
 just walk on them even if it passes 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.500
 rain you can go into the garden and not 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.500
 carry along 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:53.100
 tomatoes began to bloom to sbu soon 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.829

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.729

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.540
