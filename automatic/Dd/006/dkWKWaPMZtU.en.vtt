00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.630
 pokémon ranger tracks of play will go on sale in japan on March 6 for 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:09.650
 nintendo ds but a demo version will come out this January 29 the story we 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.379
 situates in a new scenario 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:13.099
 the archipelago bolivia 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.730
 as usual, the region is under the watchful eye of an evil group the pokémon 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.409
 a person led by a mysterious man nicknamed rebel 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.329
 During our journey we will be accompanied by a friendly picchu 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.239
 fashionable wearing a ukulele apparently will meet the same 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.239
 function that does not influence me in the first games 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.140
 the pokémon trio of photos next to the inseparable dairy and the aunt spare 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 100 that will have an almost main role in this delivery as they will be our 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.640
 vehicle to cross different areas if we look at the images of 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.720
 up we can see that now we can do nothing to go under water during certain 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.480
 time will be an oxygen meter that bar to the right 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.270
 also now we can fly in real time nothing of just flying fry the go 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.120
 to another city now there will be scenes in which mounted on our pokémon 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.510
 we will fight evil from above 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.780
 according to the olivia map the first doses the sixth connected by a bridge 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.020
 while the third north has a port so we will have to ride 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.180
 in mind transformation or just using a boat 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.660
 east of that same island we can see a deep water area may be that 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.490
 there we immerse ourselves as in the mission of San Pedro in the shadows of 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.480
 almunia or maybe there is some legendary waiting for us there I thought that the 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.980
 son 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.470
 at least we know that the terrain will be varied again we can clearly see 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.550
 a mountain full of snow to the south an apparently volcanic island and 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.890
 northwest an island surrounded by a dense dark layer storm clouds 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.700
 which indicates that something weird is happening there 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.299
 the most striking of this page apart from the rangers signs 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.939
 rangers and with which we can invoke the help of several pokémon the vehicle 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.189
 pointed for now is the image in the lower right 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.410
 there we can see several ranger with their names the Japanese on their heads 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.340
 this and the text about it confirms that it is that rajoy has municipal mode 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.349
 the teacher burdens 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.579
 hastings likes that I mut 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.710
 they are back this time will help us to exterminate evil in oblivion 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.650
 the side that is of shadows of germany will be back but it is unknown if 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.789
 the reward will be the same as in the previous game 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:25.620
 the teacher 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.049
 ouka leele pigeon according to the images again we will explore different places 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.780
 like jungles ruins or volcanoes we will also look for and we will cross frozen areas 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.529
 according to I know the maximum of pokemones 7 counting our pokémon 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:40.919
 companion 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.509
 As you could not miss the trio they also have their own bow 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.549
 pokémon legal texts will help us through our adventure 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.239
 since we are so incapable of crossing some areas even though we have the 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.139
 six best pokémon on our side 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.599
 fortunately the web shows us the whole map of the region much better 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.449
 that the small sample that was seen in the magazine 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.489
 the island where we will find the ukulele pigeon is probably the 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.959
 small southwest 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.819
 I keep highlighting that area of ​​deep water and the island with dark clouds 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.450
 something bad is happening there you heard it here first 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.290
 it seems that the secret of the deceased were his attacks that he can not learn 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.459
 usually so technically it has something new to be transferred to 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.469
 erbol soulsilver and others 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.079
 a disappointment the truth
