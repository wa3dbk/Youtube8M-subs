Michelle and I just want to
say to everybody here,

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:45.879
we love you.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.749
(applause)

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:56.756
On this day, we thank
everyone who does so much

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:59.726
each and every day to defend
our country, to defend our

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:00.727
freedom.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.728
(applause)

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.497
We are grateful to
our armed services.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.498
(applause)

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.767
We are grateful to our
military families.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:08.868
(applause)

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.904
We are grateful
to our veterans.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.239
(applause)

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.443
Without you, we could
not enjoy the incredible

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:19.379
blessings that we do in this
greatest country on Earth.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:20.480
(applause)

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.315
And we are so appreciative
to all of you.

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:24.984
We hope you are
having a good time.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.886
The weather is cooperating.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:30.190
(applause)

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.394
And Michelle and I, Malia,
Sasha -- we could not be

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.663
more privileged to have
gotten to know so many of

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:40.166
you, and to know all the
sacrifices that you make on

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.367
our behalf each
and every day.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:47.240
So we just want to wish you
the happiest 4th of July and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.244
remind ourselves that
freedom is not free -- it's

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:54.047
paid by all the folks who
are here today and all the

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:55.548
folks who are
around the world.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:58.718
We want to thank those who
aren't with their families

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:01.387
on this holiday season
because they're

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:02.422
posted overseas.

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:03.756
(applause)

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:04.924
We want to especially
remember them.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:05.592
(applause)

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:06.493
Thank you very
much, everybody.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.827
God bless you.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:09.662
God bless the United
States of America.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.632
