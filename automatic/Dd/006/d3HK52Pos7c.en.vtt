00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.270
 so and yes he can reduce the chance for just under 50 percent 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.810
 Random can 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.270
 I think that will be very annoying only in promotional videos I am 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.500
 up to 30 fighters from the normal starring Britney Spears record in the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.169
 amount 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.599
 because while nearly 50 percent of all time comes as an ability afterwards 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.819
 Opponents 9 percent that is a heart attack 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.039
 I think I will like that very much 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.619
 that the host has to have Infoblox delicious our ability times 3 maximum three 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.059
 you can be popular in recent times 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.310
 Three years ago, also had the financial and becomes the up and down 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.370
 Smoking is just another of the smart at the same time 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.130
 the publishing group 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.590
 Chur Switzerland spoke the other day, it's time to go but later 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.590
 Ghost hand moves both flies its leaves 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.460
 it conveys 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.980
 and that is reported suffered the supermarket chain doubts 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.080
 in order to 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.740
 fantastic 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.550
 well I give you one 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.010
 the camera please be cooperative floats Holy Random fight that 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.080
 That's why I'm staying on the street 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.950
 that on the street 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.900
 It's as stormy as the hot wire 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.330
 This is how you start safely 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.560
 so too 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.610
 of course 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.340
 Show particles 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.360
 for example 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.550
 the super chilly the music 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.520
 9 We still have some time to do it and that weapons to magazine what 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.460
 offers that 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 this magazine reports on weapons this Main 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.890
 Rogier Wassen that edition 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.090
 This time we put the base weapons in front of the garden beds his novel weapon 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.280
 the base model is the AVO about not very effective but reliable 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.570
 Possibilities to assemble praise 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.680
 Let's anchor so that's the Fidelity System 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.770
 this topic so gear and I say 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.070
 she is the biggest that fits so i think 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.550
 is he said 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.509
 Equipment like that 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.189
 m attractive for the people in the game 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:18.049
 2 Aabar the Boeuf is quite different than we are used to playing it by others 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.349
 fcb-defense immediately 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.009
 actually everything is 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:26.499
 What we could attract our people was not mine and weapons 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.539
 There are only six or seven in the game per capita 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.859
 So there's nothing from the partners new city to buy new weapons directly 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:33.469
 or so 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.040
 No that's pretty big of a thing for me 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.389
 and like 7 8 hours or something 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.799
 How do we get new weapons? We build them in a weapons warehouse 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.899
 is here in the village 2 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.959
 and all he needs is a knowledge of the BAFA 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.549
 For this must have found the correspondingly skinny team in which they are in it 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.699
 stands and imagines I do the rest of her mon 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.699
 Trust Heicks percent more money 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.209
 After that I always stay 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.229
 In addition to the decision they will certainly be happy 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:09.489
 to 7 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.819
 Euro pension let's sing with it's like it's h 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.700
 15 times Hohenecker Brettorf and abundant 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.109
 this is the weapon store so get it 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.469
 and we'll be open 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.749
 and here we look for life to have finished 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.109
 then we see the list what do you want to have 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.650
 "Everything we can build now 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.860
 what we know is the cathedral Olga but that the standard weapon I have 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.979
 You can see that on the bottom left, which I think I have 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:42.789
 should the disease again the helm Fahnemann it's just disgusting 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:48.819
 and like Star Wars the Old Republic Robold and that's what I've got to the victim 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.709
 is my weapon so that are the strong growing demand but the 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.469
 Jump on the old cells and tell the Hellebaut weapon with the add-ons 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:57.749
 and then he does that 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:00.469
 So these weapons magazines 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.429
 whether the Red Bull 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.639
 Also these gun magazines are great, but it suits me 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.759
 Money that it would otherwise stir a bit 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.459
 it was said that we now get a regular Solter picture 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.939
 Sit that was the tape that just happens so we run around and say 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.229
 Baumann money Coleman 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.719
 and he with 5000 and in the door get to 8000 Hey this is significantly more than 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:27.069
 before in the ring but what they can do 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.990
 is and it betrays that 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.460
 our victory wants to increase later 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.539
 Villiger Ferne written exam 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.509
 and when we confess they rise for settlers Le Mans climbs as winners 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.979
 Usually more money every time we get money 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.349
 until last to a maximum of 33 or so 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.699
 and then he gets by 30 000 euros 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.870
 Kotick so vote into the money we make a fest so easy to fix IAA 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.879
 I want Peter's test anxiety 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.279
 that's just not a question to me it's not like you can spell it 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.550
 Draw opponents 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.420
 think 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.680
 Sarrazin writes that it means Guardian 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.990
 ahead 10 there are a total of 8 billion he seats good question you have to look 30 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.689
 Clock started the target so ugly Meier says 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.249
 if he belongs strong value the stronger, fast attacks can be dangerous HB 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.289
 Coupling to coupling pulls the building under its spell 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.190
 Westerwelle this one has the Fri is left to chance well there I have 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.599
 still influence on approx 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.999
 by magic, MP consumption is in Ahlen 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:32.610
 finally the name of the one you can freely determine the project the 

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:37.119
 Characters could ring armament issues and the last question there are 19 questions 

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:38.520
 protest 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.349
 the eleven the educator flader rises by lifts off no no, moreover they will 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.349
 through a PTFE a stronger only through extreme mic 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:48.729
 Roger that 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.159
 Here he sees it now at 2 6 so now I'm loosing more money 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.219
 I'm stuck with me Â»I will also make the maximum Scissor Sisters 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.099
 or 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.979
 I know the extra from Trinidad 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.749
 so suddenly maybe one or the other can literally listen 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:07.389
 because he is the questions 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.879
 So they assume that they did so gradually over the course of the game 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:12.530
 he drives and how he learns 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.020
 and now he has to look at the test normal 24 can then quite mine 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.490
 Ask who the boss at the end of this cave can get from the 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.960
 this one would pull those 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.990
 and the Bernese can look at Opel to reward them 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.250
 or will the DRS get along Customer proximity is just simplifying that 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.340
 I do the beautiful solo Highspeed promotional video that wants to see 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.300
 he can definitely press the pause in the break 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.770
 I pray 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.020
 so 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.020
 because we'll do that in time now - the card game 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.610
 then I want to still in the garden there is still growing magazine had 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.800
 posting the coat as comments that I knew at all Waterfront and 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.680
 it will let it go 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.499
 until I noticed that 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:00.759
 So let's do the card game first so this is the card queen 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.169
 the act hurts 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:07.449
 I'm the top ten I travel around the world and oversee the cards rules 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.400
 What do you want to know from me Customers Stadtwerke Dreieich, he says 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.199
 he could despite rain 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:18.800
 the current exchange rings come from the distant sector here is a small one 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.869
 maid city 

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:23.399
 from their sector the Tauss rules will spread where 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:25.839
 there are already 

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:28.689
 through the up to evaporate conductor I think so 

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:31.689
 Ban warned the train heading towards Timber 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.740
 yes that's our move about less now not yet
