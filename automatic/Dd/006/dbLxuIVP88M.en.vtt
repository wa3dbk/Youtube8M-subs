now<00:01:07.440> especially<00:01:07.740> unfortunate<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.550> go<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.700> one

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
now especially unfortunate to go to one

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.940 
now especially unfortunate to go to one
hand<00:01:09.150> once<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.050> force<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.410> the<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.620> hand<00:01:10.830> that

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
hand once you force in the one hand that

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.790 
hand once you force in the one hand that
yes<00:01:11.160> nificantly<00:01:11.700> weaker<00:01:12.000> shot<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.800> looking

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
yes nificantly weaker shot and looking

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.350 
yes nificantly weaker shot and looking
at<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.009> again<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.580> looks<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:14.940> she<00:01:15.060> planned

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
at this again it looks like she planned

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.660 
at this again it looks like she planned
to<00:01:15.540> go<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.840> hand<00:01:16.050> I<00:01:16.290> don't<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.890> why<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.880> know

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
to go on hand I don't know why you know

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.840 
to go on hand I don't know why you know
the<00:01:20.670> other<00:01:20.759> thing<00:01:21.000> about<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> two<00:01:21.420> hander<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
the other thing about the two hander is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.680 
the other thing about the two hander is
once<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.910> get<00:01:24.030> into<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.270> rally<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.690> she's

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
once you get into a rally you know she's

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.420 
once you get into a rally you know she's
fine<00:01:27.930> when<00:01:28.110> she's<00:01:28.259> long<00:01:28.770> he<00:01:28.979> bought<00:01:29.160> her<00:01:29.280> but

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
fine when she's long he bought her but

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.160 
fine when she's long he bought her but
when<00:01:29.520> she<00:01:29.580> pulled<00:01:29.759> him<00:01:29.820> wide<00:01:30.030> right<00:01:30.180> there<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
when she pulled him wide right there and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.499 
when she pulled him wide right there and
then<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.560> why<00:01:31.710> during<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:33.390> know

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
then this is why during here you know

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.270 
then this is why during here you know
once<00:01:34.080> they<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.470> hand<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:34.890> over<00:01:35.160> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
once they go to one hand it's over the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.620 
once they go to one hand it's over the
point<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.550> gonna<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.790> over<00:01:36.060> pretty<00:01:36.240> much<00:01:36.330> even

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
point is gonna be over pretty much even

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
point is gonna be over pretty much even
hit<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> weak<00:01:36.930> shot<00:01:37.250> but<00:01:38.250> two<00:01:38.430> hands<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:38.729> when

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
hit a weak shot but two hands right when

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.719 
hit a weak shot but two hands right when
he<00:01:39.090> hit<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.300> them<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.690> fine<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.729> would

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
he hit to them it's fine I would

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.980 
he hit to them it's fine I would
recommend<00:01:42.060> two<00:01:42.210> hands<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.570> you're<00:01:42.660> taller

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
recommend two hands if you're taller

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.130 
recommend two hands if you're taller
because<00:01:43.409> she's<00:01:44.220> Asian<00:01:44.460> she's<00:01:44.820> short<00:01:45.150> she<00:01:45.780> has

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
because she's Asian she's short she has

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.540 
because she's Asian she's short she has
to<00:01:46.229> cover<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.470> lot<00:01:46.620> court<00:01:46.920> because<00:01:47.430> she's

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
to cover a lot court because she's

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.180 
to cover a lot court because she's
shorter<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.180> she<00:01:49.020> does<00:01:49.170> gain<00:01:49.350> time<00:01:49.560> by<00:01:49.830> moving

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
shorter and she does gain time by moving

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.280 
shorter and she does gain time by moving
back<00:01:50.550> but<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.479> does<00:01:51.810> hamper<00:01:52.110> her

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
back but it does hamper her

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.320 
back but it does hamper her
effectiveness<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.610> biggest<00:01:53.940> strengths<00:01:54.240> of

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
effectiveness the biggest strengths of

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.520 
effectiveness the biggest strengths of
two<00:01:54.450> hands<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:54.900> when<00:01:55.080> you<00:01:55.140> catching<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> ball

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
two hands is when you catching the ball

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.789 
two hands is when you catching the ball
on<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> rise<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.310> when<00:01:57.270> you're<00:01:57.390> buying

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
on the rise and when you're buying

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.110 
on the rise and when you're buying
baseline<00:01:58.799> cuz<00:01:59.010> you<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.190> really<00:01:59.970> good

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
baseline cuz you have really good

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.649 
baseline cuz you have really good
disguise<00:02:01.850> look<00:02:02.850> how<00:02:02.940> solid<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.390> when<00:02:03.570> you're

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
disguise look how solid is when you're

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.660 
disguise look how solid is when you're
hang<00:02:03.810> right<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.140> her<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.010> would<00:02:08.340> teach<00:02:08.489> two

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
hang right to her so I would teach two

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.070 
hang right to her so I would teach two
hands<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.299> a<00:02:09.360> small<00:02:09.630> girl<00:02:09.840> who's

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
hands if you have a small girl who's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.520 
hands if you have a small girl who's
tall<00:02:10.549> you<00:02:11.549> know<00:02:11.640> cuz<00:02:11.940> then<00:02:12.630> then<00:02:13.019> they'll<00:02:13.410> be

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
tall you know cuz then then they'll be

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.340 
tall you know cuz then then they'll be
very<00:02:13.950> stable<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.780> they'll<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.989> good<00:02:16.140> shot

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
very stable and they'll have a good shot

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.910 
very stable and they'll have a good shot
and<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:18.900> transfer<00:02:19.410> weight<00:02:19.560> really<00:02:19.739> well

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
and you can transfer weight really well

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.460 
and you can transfer weight really well
with<00:02:20.010> two<00:02:20.160> hands<00:02:20.549> however<00:02:21.350> doesn't<00:02:22.350> hamper

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
with two hands however doesn't hamper

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.470 
with two hands however doesn't hamper
reach<00:02:22.799> so<00:02:23.400> if<00:02:23.489> they're<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:23.910> they're<00:02:24.180> unless

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
reach so if they're if they're unless

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.150 
reach so if they're if they're unless
they're<00:02:24.630> really<00:02:24.660> fast<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.860> gonna<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.130> a

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
they're really fast it's gonna be a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:35.230 
they're really fast it's gonna be a
problem

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.300 

you
