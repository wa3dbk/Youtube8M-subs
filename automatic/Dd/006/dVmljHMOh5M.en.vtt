because although i saw it coming for a

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.090 
because although i saw it coming for a
long<00:04:09.840> time<00:04:10.110> because<00:04:10.320> it<00:04:10.440> just<00:04:10.650> seemed<00:04:10.890> like<00:04:10.920> a

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
long time because it just seemed like a

long time because it just seemed like a
step<00:04:11.610> in<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.820> next<00:04:12.180> direction<00:04:12.530> it's<00:04:13.530> really

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
step in the next direction it's really

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.680

exciting<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.310> me<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.880> is<00:04:15.030> really<00:04:15.360> an

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
exciting to me that it is really an

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.539 
exciting to me that it is really an
entertainment<00:04:16.380> center<00:04:16.530> more<00:04:16.919> than<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.130> gaming

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
entertainment center more than a gaming

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.460 
entertainment center more than a gaming
console<00:04:17.970> because<00:04:18.209> people<00:04:19.049> like<00:04:19.200> that<00:04:19.410> that

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
console because people like that that

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.500 
console because people like that that
appeals<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.130> more<00:04:20.370> people<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.790> fact<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.150> you

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
appeals to more people the fact that you

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.420 
appeals to more people the fact that you
can<00:04:21.690> have<00:04:21.840> multiple<00:04:22.109> uses<00:04:22.650> for<00:04:22.860> something<00:04:23.340> you

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
can have multiple uses for something you

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.860 
can have multiple uses for something you
don't<00:04:23.580> have<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.789> have<00:04:23.910> your<00:04:24.060> cable<00:04:24.450> box<00:04:24.570> and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
don't have to have your cable box and

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.200 
don't have to have your cable box and
your<00:04:24.960> DVD<00:04:25.320> player

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
your DVD player

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.110 
your DVD player
and<00:04:26.300> your<00:04:26.660> gaming<00:04:26.930> console<00:04:27.470> on<00:04:27.740> your

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
and your gaming console on your

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.950 
and your gaming console on your
entertainment<00:04:29.120> center<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.569> can<00:04:29.600> just<00:04:29.840> have

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
entertainment center you can just have

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.050 
entertainment center you can just have
one<00:04:30.199> big<00:04:30.530> xbox<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.580> I<00:04:31.639> think<00:04:31.850> that's

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
one big xbox and I think that's

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.850 
one big xbox and I think that's
definitely<00:04:32.270> what<00:04:32.630> Microsoft<00:04:33.199> was<00:04:33.440> aiming<00:04:33.830> for

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
definitely what Microsoft was aiming for

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.580 
definitely what Microsoft was aiming for
with<00:04:34.220> with<00:04:35.030> just<00:04:35.419> hyping<00:04:35.810> up<00:04:35.930> this<00:04:36.110> new<00:04:36.349> thing

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
with with just hyping up this new thing

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.790 
with with just hyping up this new thing
so<00:04:37.180> one<00:04:38.180> thing<00:04:38.449> that<00:04:38.509> I'm<00:04:38.750> not<00:04:39.050> necessarily

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
so one thing that I'm not necessarily

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.700 
so one thing that I'm not necessarily
excited<00:04:40.310> for<00:04:40.550> is<00:04:40.789> skype<00:04:41.599> and<00:04:42.289> that's<00:04:42.500> just

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
excited for is skype and that's just

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.260 
excited for is skype and that's just
because<00:04:42.860> maybe<00:04:43.220> I'm<00:04:43.460> in<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.639> little<00:04:43.789> bit<00:04:44.030> of<00:04:44.180> a

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
because maybe I'm in a little bit of a

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.210 
because maybe I'm in a little bit of a
different<00:04:44.690> circumstance<00:04:45.110> than<00:04:45.590> most<00:04:45.800> people
