 Welcome to your best 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.880
 predecessor p 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:22.689
 I'll show you minecraft for the 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.060
 latest version 1.2 installs the 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.029
 between looks so for all now 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.519
 by the way , does not have to be just for the models 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.970
 do not do the hack client mode 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.309
 know so is a client therefore 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.110
 works as it contains deep inside 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.510
 and x-ray and a few others 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.070
 things so there could then also to 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.540
 example automatically beat or something 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.449
 one thing 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.360
 and yes, you either go to this one 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.949
 side of the left in the description there 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.239
 I do not find on download which one 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.960
 because you have to be there forever 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.699
 by clicking 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:02.980
 I'll go straight to this page 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.179
 back so so the styling of this 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.660
 the page in the description 

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:08.860
 then you go to download and therefore 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.479
 now in the case already done then 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.229
 There you are excited to be here 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.929
 models so here on this download 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.670
 not another, that is quite a lot 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.190
 now just such an advertising banner 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.380
 just click on the picture 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:33.009
 then service will open file 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:40.750
 we did not go in there now 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:43.209
 so our five folders so percent 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.610
 we had to push him and for that 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:47.319
 then enter percent from tata percent 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.450
 I think most of you know that 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:53.170
 you have then here goes to the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.670
 versions creates a new standard there 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.750
 din en tant mode in which the rhine 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:07.979
 and pulls this mode so and models 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.979
 chances are simply copied over here 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.959
 and then when it comes to the fed 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:25.099
 can you already minecraft states 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:26.880
 so too and that if you have the 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.160
 background there you can own your own 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.349
 insert skins 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.790
 that extended from under the link from the 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.890
 underside times in the writing 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.470
 that's just what the wallpaper but 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:47.610
 then sends you pretty much everyone 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:50.160
 this eur 251 you then here at 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.190
 newsletter selected but you go then 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.620
 down here then on us version 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.620
 and then you can choose your mode 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:13.530
 then it always takes a bit though 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:23.160
 I think it's okay and as you can see in 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:25.049
 minecraft 1 the 2 at least in the 12th 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.319
 some new stuff about why 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.540
 here and here as technically to say we 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.130
 a two player because I have not 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:45.750
 really did not want not yet 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:49.079
 possible for you to see that there too 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.810
 So if that's what I found I'm not 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.880
 sure if I know but if you are 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.160
 the video maybe ten best days 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.420
 look then and then at the left 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:06.239
 henceforth be the then already on the same 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.100
 whether they are going to be so landscape 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.850
 is generated 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.850
 So my studio 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.120
 he has to generate every economy 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.680
 become 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.650
 Oh, what is cool, if we are still 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:30.470
 We are a bios porn to our customers 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:32.710
 the world is new in the 12th time 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.710
 fall 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.640
 Okay, yes, that's rewarding as well 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.500
 maybe right now 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.820
 Somehow that was just because 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:54.640
 I record with camtasia 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:58.570
 but here it is just this 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.570
 Germany joins the sid 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:06.530
 and yes worldcom wait, I think if 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.880
 did you have fashionable then can you 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:14.020
 that's all for me now 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:17.210
 at least just now 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:21.370
 thanks for watching and until the next 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.370
 when it is again best before 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.100
 creation or once again
