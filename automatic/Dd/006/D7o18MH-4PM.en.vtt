had in previous Call of Duty games

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.980 
had in previous Call of Duty games
they're<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.280> they<00:01:18.030> stand<00:01:18.299> out<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> lot

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
they're really they stand out a lot

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.300 
they're really they stand out a lot
they<00:01:19.320> don't<00:01:19.470> look<00:01:19.619> similar<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.979> any<00:01:20.220> other

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
of Duty games which i think is very

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.130 
of Duty games which i think is very
impressive<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.570> colors<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:25.049> really

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
impressive and the colors are really

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.080 
impressive and the colors are really
nice<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.560> well<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> common<00:01:26.640> theme<00:01:26.880> with

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
nice as well so a common theme with

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.690

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
these 16 new hidden camels here is that

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.910 
these 16 new hidden camels here is that
a<00:01:29.759> lot<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.180> them<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.600> barbed<00:01:31.170> wire<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.650> part

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
a lot of them have barbed wire as part

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.499 
a lot of them have barbed wire as part
of<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> design<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.939> that's<00:01:33.240> kind<00:01:33.450> of

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
of the design so that's kind of

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.940 
of the design so that's kind of
interesting<00:01:33.720> I'm<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.170> too<00:01:34.350> sure<00:01:34.530> why<00:01:34.740> it's

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
do with a few friends or you can do solo

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.089 
do with a few friends or you can do solo
so<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.670> think<00:02:35.849> they're<00:02:36.209> gonna<00:02:36.329> try<00:02:36.629> to<00:02:36.890> get<00:02:37.890> more

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
so I think they're gonna try to get more

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.770 
so I think they're gonna try to get more
hype<00:02:38.340> for<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.000> get<00:02:39.120> more<00:02:39.269> people<00:02:39.420> into

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
hype for that and get more people into

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.380 
hype for that and get more people into
it<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.079> if<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.579> case<00:02:41.849> I<00:02:42.120> think<00:02:42.180> it's

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
it and if that is the case I think it's

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.759 
it and if that is the case I think it's
gonna<00:02:42.480> be<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.659> lot<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.900> fun<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.260> actually<00:02:43.590> have<00:02:43.739> a
