00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the last video and Fluffy's lighthouse

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.219 
the last video and Fluffy's lighthouse
it's<00:01:41.430> been<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> really<00:01:42.090> long<00:01:42.509> time<00:01:42.899> and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
it's been here a really long time and

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.319 
it's been here a really long time and
probably<00:01:44.159> since<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.579> server<00:01:44.820> started

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
probably since the server started

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.420 
probably since the server started
actually<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.860> was<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> first

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
actually and it was one of the first

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.520 
actually and it was one of the first
things<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.030> fluffy<00:01:48.420> built<00:01:48.600> along<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.200> me

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
things that fluffy built along with me

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.020 
things that fluffy built along with me
building<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> pirate<00:01:50.340> ship<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.670> think<00:01:50.700> he

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
building the pirate ship I think he

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.780 
building the pirate ship I think he
built<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.450> lighthouse<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> same<00:01:52.560> time<00:01:52.799> so

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
built the lighthouse at the same time so

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.780 
built the lighthouse at the same time so
yeah<00:01:54.270> that's<00:01:54.720> that's<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.259> staple<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.490> land

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
yeah that's that's a staple of this land

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.030 
yeah that's that's a staple of this land
and<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:58.110> next<00:01:58.380> place<00:01:58.500> I'm<00:01:58.649> going<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.829> show<00:01:59.009> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
is it's the market place and the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.609 
is it's the market place and the
original<00:02:02.280> idea<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.479> was<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.290> you

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
original idea of this was to be that you

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.850 
original idea of this was to be that you
know<00:02:04.740> everyone<00:02:05.250> would<00:02:05.399> kind<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.930> give<00:02:06.930> some<00:02:07.380> of

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
know everyone would kind of give some of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.130 
know everyone would kind of give some of
their<00:02:08.039> spare<00:02:08.550> materials<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.569> people<00:02:09.869> could

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
their spare materials and people could

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.750 
their spare materials and people could
take<00:02:10.289> them<00:02:10.619> if<00:02:10.890> they<00:02:11.039> needed<00:02:11.280> them

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
take them if they needed them

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
train station which I have spent so long

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.690 
train station which I have spent so long
building<00:04:40.510> home<00:04:41.290> it<00:04:42.010> took<00:04:42.190> me<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.340> very<00:04:42.430> long

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
building home it took me a very long

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.250 
building home it took me a very long
time<00:04:43.090> because<00:04:43.450> I<00:04:43.600> was<00:04:43.780> trying<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:44.020> make<00:04:44.139> it

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
time because I was trying to make it

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.960 
time because I was trying to make it
symmetrical<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:44.919> I<00:04:45.250> was<00:04:45.400> trying<00:04:45.669> to<00:04:45.730> get<00:04:45.820> all

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
symmetrical and I was trying to get all

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.290 
symmetrical and I was trying to get all
the<00:04:46.150> railways<00:04:46.720> sorted<00:04:47.350> and<00:04:47.530> stuff<00:04:47.800> so<00:04:48.220> this<00:04:49.120> is

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
the railways sorted and stuff so this is

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.820 
the railways sorted and stuff so this is
what<00:04:49.389> I'm<00:04:49.450> going<00:04:49.540> to<00:04:49.600> be<00:04:49.690> using<00:04:49.840> mostly<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:50.740> get

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
what I'm going to be using mostly to get

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.930 
what I'm going to be using mostly to get
around<00:04:51.130> because<00:04:51.580> I<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:54.070> don't<00:04:54.550> know<00:04:54.639> I<00:04:54.880> just

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
around because I I don't know I just

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.930 
around because I I don't know I just
actually<00:04:55.480> a<00:04:55.510> little<00:04:55.720> bit<00:04:55.870> so<00:04:56.110> each<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:57.160> kind

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
actually a little bit so each and kind

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.300 
actually a little bit so each and kind
of<00:04:58.060> place<00:04:58.360> each<00:04:59.200> railroad<00:04:59.710> goes<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.250> a

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
of place each railroad goes to a

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.560 
of place each railroad goes to a
different<00:05:00.610> area<00:05:00.760> I'll<00:05:01.120> just<00:05:01.240> give<00:05:01.389> you<00:05:01.419> an

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
different area I'll just give you an

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.990 
different area I'll just give you an
aerial<00:05:01.960> view<00:05:02.430> here<00:05:03.430> we<00:05:03.520> go

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
aerial view here we go

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.350 
aerial view here we go
like<00:05:04.180> proper<00:05:05.040> intricate<00:05:06.040> rail<00:05:06.430> system<00:05:07.030> going

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
like proper intricate rail system going

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.110 
like proper intricate rail system going
on<00:05:07.479> here<00:05:07.720> as<00:05:07.990> you<00:05:08.200> can<00:05:08.229> see<00:05:08.380> it<00:05:09.100> spans<00:05:09.669> quite

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
on here as you can see it spans quite

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.680 
on here as you can see it spans quite
far<00:05:10.389> so<00:05:10.889> I'll<00:05:11.889> probably<00:05:12.130> be<00:05:12.760> using<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.360> trains

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
far so I'll probably be using the trains

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.230 
far so I'll probably be using the trains
to<00:05:14.169> take<00:05:14.919> you<00:05:15.100> to<00:05:15.220> different<00:05:15.370> people's<00:05:15.820> areas

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
when I show them off so this is going to

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.640 
when I show them off so this is going to
going<00:05:19.630> to<00:05:19.690> be<00:05:19.780> seeing<00:05:19.930> a<00:05:19.990> lot<00:05:20.110> of<00:05:20.169> this<00:05:20.320> train
