00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.179
 so we're going to make a car rest 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.250
 enough we kept his little heads of 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.170
 langoustines to make the sauce it's 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.400
 in the idea of â€‹â€‹not buying anything 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.560
 something else to make the sauce what 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.330
 to work we will put a little 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.619
 little olive oil to heat and then 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.029
 we will have our carcass 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.810
 langoustines and we will leave them 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.130
 brown, taking care to crush them 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.349
 in these carcasses are going to add a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.359
 small aromatic garnish composed of 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.309
 carrots of leek onions that will 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.750
 come in the recipe in enhancers of 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.640
 taste so do not put too much 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.059
 for paf it becomes a broth of 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.980
 vegetables 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.450
 see it starts to tie a little 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.820
 little deep basically called sugars 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.320
 that's what will give the taste that then 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.360
 to take off his juices from them 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.590
 can happen in the sauce we're going 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.629
 deglaze with white wine 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.460
 here we are going to let reduce is gonna be 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.070
 a concentration of tastes and then we 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.350
 will put cream up to height 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 will leave that on the corner of the fire for that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.829
 simmer gently, gently 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.780
 to be able to take care of our lot where you 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.520
 will rarely see the head on the stalls 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.930
 until the huge is not very beautiful 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.519
 they are often beheaded on 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.330
 boats and throw rejected at sea for 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.130
 start a rag 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.840
 he was thrown by attacking the nets 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.939
 so we are very careful 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.830
 follow the central ridge to lose 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.689
 as little as possible and we remove the whole 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.490
 skin after that is what can be 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.560
 unpleasant in the monkfish is this 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.150
 little white membrane that she then there 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.619
 there is no secret must be delicate 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.420
 that you can ask your 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.250
 fishmonger do it all after we go 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.600
 check the top of the burbot at the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.579
 monkfish with a very particular skin that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.810
 very much about fish and who 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.970
 if we do not take it off 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.650
 curl up it's going badly leather and that's 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.049
 a fish that is overcooked will become 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.030
 cottony or very chewy and 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.490
 frankly not good here we have raised 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.990
 our fleet and we will extract 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 medallions here then we go there 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.680
 bunk with smoked salmon 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.810
 karin tends to be a little salty so 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.360
 we're going to be a bit soft on salt 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.220
 this is pepper and here we have it 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.970
 smoked salmon and with this beautiful slice 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.590
 we're going in 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.780
 layering the smoked salmon served 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.490
 lukewarm gets married with virtually all 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.080
 white fish the choice of monkfish 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.090
 it's for being able to carve 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.470
 medallions then there our sauce she 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.390
 is cooking we have a nice 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.220
 osmosis phenomenon that happens between the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.870
 cream the aromatic filling limits the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.819
 cream started a little bit colored 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.470
 be careful when you're cooking 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.069
 not to reduce too much it is not necessary that it boils 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.230
 a big broth 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.510
 otherwise it will reduce the cream will thicken 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.730
 but may even turn, ie 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.040
 that all the fat from the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.080
 cream will dissociate itself from the material 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.300
 liquid and so if that starts to do 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.800
 do not hesitate to add a small 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.630
 drop of water since this is the 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.420
 liquid part that goes away so we put back 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.040
 an early layer and obsar in general 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.840
 when she cooked a long time and that's to 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.250
 a lot of coral we get to have some 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.350
 sauces that are much more colorful 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.180
 sailboats and that's a sauce we 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.459
 can redo with many others 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.170
 crustaceans if you have eaten lobsters 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.330
 you can very well kept the heads 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.310
 lobsters and remake that same source 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.410
 with lobsters here we are going to ask the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.819
 delicately wrecks in the other cooker 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.500
 and then we will cover 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.090
 you have to leave five minutes and especially 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.290
 check the cooking so that the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.170
 lotte become as we said everything to 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.489
 the time when cottony besides is really 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.769
 very chewy that is strong 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.570
 unpleasant then there we saw at 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.920
 garden spinach we will melt a 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.150
 little bit of butter see we are a 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.019
 little nutty butter is excellent 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.030
 for spinach 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.709
 it makes them sing they will melt more 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.390
 it is necessary to prefer to season 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.739
 spinach before it cooks and in 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.269
 height that the leaf low is 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.590
 curl up why fall on 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.450
 cluster of salt or pepper 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.209
 had to season it with rain goods to 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.450
 height and that it goes very very quickly to 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.670
 make 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.510
 here they are cooked we are really going 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.180
 to have a result 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.340
 here is green the beautiful pink color 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.390
 bright spinach if cooked in advanced 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.950
 that they are stoved is that they are 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.989
 ironing the spinach will become a little 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.790
 more brown and so here is the slow 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.709
 and cooked that we are good we can go 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.670
 serve our guests we will have our 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.760
 spinach 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.050
 the superposition of salmon smoked batch on 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.610
 does that note do not hold 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.770
 inevitably and it opens a little 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.420
 fanatical way it's also a sign of 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.670
 freshness of your fish we will leave 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.620
 the dish live and finish on their own 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.849
 and here the shellfish cream is 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.510
 very simple cooking is something 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.130
 very simple thing 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.050
 the important thing is to have a good product 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.510
 a justin cooking of the seasoning 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.660
 here to give this dish there is the 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.280
 thought here a windthrow so white wine 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.830
 of burgundy that will be served a little fresh 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.810
 and there is a house at sir's house and 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.760
 Madame Gautrain who have a declination 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.160
 of Chablis wines of the small chablis 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.700
 Chablis Chablis 1er Cru and Chablis Grand 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.900
 vintage 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.100
 if you really want to do 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.010
 pleasure has come in the wines 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.580
 exception, here we recommend a wine 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.580
 chablis
