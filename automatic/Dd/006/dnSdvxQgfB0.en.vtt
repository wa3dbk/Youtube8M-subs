00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
mini and that's connected to my inline

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
mini and that's connected to my inline
adapter<00:01:42.899> except<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.320> I've<00:01:43.409> extended<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
adapter except for I've extended the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.649 
adapter except for I've extended the
pipe<00:01:44.880> for<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> inline<00:01:46.140> adapter<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
pipe for the inline adapter and

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.940 
pipe for the inline adapter and
connected<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:49.039> carbon<00:01:50.039> filter<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.679> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
connected a carbon filter to the to the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.060 
connected a carbon filter to the to the
soil<00:01:53.939> filter<00:01:54.359> so<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:55.109> will<00:01:55.289> filter<00:01:55.499> out<00:01:55.679> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
soil filter so this will filter out the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.399 
soil filter so this will filter out the
debris<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.969> all<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.420> bits<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.140> all<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
debris and all the bits and all the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.020 
debris and all the bits and all the
parasites<00:01:59.039> and<00:01:59.219> all<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.460> horrible<00:01:59.670> stuff

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
parasites and all that horrible stuff

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.760 
parasites and all that horrible stuff
and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> carbon<00:02:01.109> filter<00:02:01.289> will<00:02:01.740> remove

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
and then the carbon filter will remove

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.609 
and then the carbon filter will remove
any<00:02:02.340> farm<00:02:02.729> chemicals<00:02:03.030> such<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.659> fertilizers

any farm chemicals such as fertilizers
or<00:02:04.710> pesticides<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.700> then<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.420> runs<00:02:06.570> through

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
or pesticides and then that runs through

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.980 
or pesticides and then that runs through
to<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.590> standard<00:02:07.979> bite<00:02:08.190> valve<00:02:08.479> now<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.539> one

connect it to a plug that plugs into my
three<00:02:23.100> litre<00:02:23.310> Camelback<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.210> can<00:02:24.420> fill<00:02:24.690> one

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
three litre Camelback so I can fill one

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.190 
three litre Camelback so I can fill one
bladder<00:02:25.290> from<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:27.060> little<00:02:27.240> bladder<00:02:27.540> and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
bladder from this little bladder and

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.170 
bladder from this little bladder and
then<00:02:28.950> I'll<00:02:29.040> be<00:02:29.160> able<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.400> keep<00:02:29.580> clean<00:02:29.880> water

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
then I'll be able to keep clean water

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.730 
then I'll be able to keep clean water
three<00:02:30.540> liters<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.900> clean<00:02:31.080> water<00:02:31.290> available

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
three liters of clean water available

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.259 
three liters of clean water available
two<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.340> those<00:02:32.550> will<00:02:32.850> fill<00:02:33.090> one<00:02:33.360> three

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
two of those will fill one three

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.559 
two of those will fill one three
so<00:02:34.840> I'll<00:02:35.319> just<00:02:35.530> show<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.769> sort<00:02:36.189> of<00:02:36.249> working<00:02:36.700> all

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
so I'll just show it sort of working all

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.470 
so I'll just show it sort of working all
we<00:02:37.719> do<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:38.049> plug<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:38.859> connector<00:02:39.430> into<00:02:40.329> the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
we do is plug this connector into the

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.209 
we do is plug this connector into the
bladder<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.939> clicks<00:02:43.239> in<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.920> then<00:02:44.920> all<00:02:45.069> we

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.219 
bladder so it clicks in and then all we

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.399 
bladder so it clicks in and then all we
do<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.819> is<00:02:45.999> the<00:02:46.150> simplest<00:02:46.599> operation<00:02:47.200> in

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
do and this is the simplest operation in

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:47.970 
do and this is the simplest operation in
the<00:02:47.590> world

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
the world

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:56.220 
the world
is<00:02:48.099> we<00:02:48.280> drink<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.450> tastes<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.840> damn<00:02:55.989> sight

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
is we drink and that tastes a damn sight

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.720 
is we drink and that tastes a damn sight
better<00:02:56.290> than<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.709> water<00:02:56.859> I<00:02:57.010> get<00:02:57.219> out<00:02:57.340> my<00:02:57.489> tap

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
better than the water I get out my tap

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.940 
better than the water I get out my tap
now<00:02:58.540> because<00:02:58.840> I've<00:02:58.930> got<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:59.049> carbon<00:02:59.469> filter<00:02:59.709> on

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
now because I've got a carbon filter on

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.190 
now because I've got a carbon filter on
there<00:03:00.189> it<00:03:00.700> does<00:03:00.909> require<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.329> little<00:03:01.659> bit<00:03:01.930> extra

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
there it does require a little bit extra

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.390 
there it does require a little bit extra
effort<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.370> drink<00:03:03.639> through<00:03:04.590> but<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:06.280> know

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
effort to to drink through but you know

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.459 
effort to to drink through but you know
it's<00:03:06.849> not<00:03:07.090> much<00:03:07.359> I<00:03:07.689> mean<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.049> you're

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469 
it's not much I mean it is you're

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.020 
it's not much I mean it is you're
working<00:03:08.799> a<00:03:08.889> little<00:03:09.129> bit<00:03:09.400> harder<00:03:09.459> just<00:03:09.909> a

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
working a little bit harder just a

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.030 
working a little bit harder just a
marginal<00:03:10.810> amount<00:03:10.989> harder<00:03:11.439> to<00:03:11.560> get<00:03:11.709> your<00:03:11.859> drink

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
marginal amount harder to get your drink

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.449 
marginal amount harder to get your drink
but<00:03:12.969> totally<00:03:13.449> worth<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.079> that's<00:03:14.949> a<00:03:15.099> larger

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
but totally worth it and that's a larger

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.300 
but totally worth it and that's a larger
quantity<00:03:15.639> of<00:03:16.000> liquid<00:03:16.930> than<00:03:17.319> you<00:03:17.439> get<00:03:17.680> in<00:03:18.010> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
quantity of liquid than you get in the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.949 
quantity of liquid than you get in the
bag<00:03:18.669> that<00:03:18.879> comes<00:03:19.120> with<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.629> Sawyer<00:03:19.870> mini

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
bag that comes with the Sawyer mini

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.009 
bag that comes with the Sawyer mini
which<00:03:20.379> is<00:03:20.530> tiny<00:03:20.799> it's<00:03:21.459> easier<00:03:21.909> to<00:03:22.090> fill<00:03:22.359> as<00:03:22.840> you

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
which is tiny it's easier to fill as you

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.459 
which is tiny it's easier to fill as you
saw<00:03:23.290> in<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.310> opening<00:03:24.549> footage<00:03:25.389> you<00:03:25.810> just<00:03:25.840> dunk

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:26.469 
saw in the opening footage you just dunk

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:27.750 
saw in the opening footage you just dunk
the<00:03:26.709> end<00:03:26.889> in<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.129> water<00:03:27.219> you<00:03:27.400> don't<00:03:27.459> even<00:03:27.639> have

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
the end in the water you don't even have

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.319 
the end in the water you don't even have
to<00:03:27.849> get<00:03:27.939> your<00:03:28.060> hands<00:03:28.269> wet<00:03:28.540> you<00:03:28.689> just<00:03:28.719> hold<00:03:29.189> the

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
to get your hands wet you just hold the

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.959 
to get your hands wet you just hold the
hold<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:31.480> lip<00:03:31.689> on<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.230> bag<00:03:32.409> and<00:03:32.680> just<00:03:33.400> dunk<00:03:33.760> it

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:33.969 
hold the lip on the bag and just dunk it

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.539 
hold the lip on the bag and just dunk it
in<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.150> water<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.959> that's<00:03:35.949> it<00:03:36.159> that's<00:03:36.280> all

in the water and that's it that's all

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.460 
in the water and that's it that's all

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
you have to do you pull it up and you've

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.539 
you have to do you pull it up and you've
got<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.650> bag<00:03:38.859> full<00:03:39.159> of<00:03:39.220> clean<00:03:39.879> drinking<00:03:40.629> water

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
got a bag full of clean drinking water

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.020 
got a bag full of clean drinking water
okay<00:03:42.549> so<00:03:43.079> I'll<00:03:44.079> put<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.709> links<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.639> Amazon

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
this modification you can obviously the

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.229 
this modification you can obviously the
reverse<00:03:53.709> fill<00:03:54.040> system<00:03:54.489> still<00:03:54.729> works<00:03:54.970> the

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
reverse fill system still works the

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.420 
reverse fill system still works the
count<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.989> Sawyer<00:03:56.379> can<00:03:56.590> still<00:03:56.829> be<00:03:56.949> unclipped

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
count the Sawyer can still be unclipped

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.659 
count the Sawyer can still be unclipped
and<00:03:57.669> used<00:03:57.939> with<00:03:58.150> any<00:03:58.329> other<00:03:58.540> combination<00:03:58.780> of

operation no functionality is lost this
is<00:04:06.310> just<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:06.759> best<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.299> simplest<00:04:07.810> way<00:04:08.019> I

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
is just the best the simplest way I

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.399 
is just the best the simplest way I
think<00:04:09.280> of<00:04:09.489> getting<00:04:09.909> a<00:04:10.120> decent<00:04:10.389> volume<00:04:11.049> of<00:04:11.199> warp

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
think of getting a decent volume of warp

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.409 
think of getting a decent volume of warp
of<00:04:11.590> dirty<00:04:11.829> water<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:12.370> drinking<00:04:12.909> it<00:04:13.000> as<00:04:13.120> clean

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
of dirty water and drinking it as clean

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.110 
of dirty water and drinking it as clean
it's<00:04:14.079> quick<00:04:14.470> its<00:04:14.919> instant<00:04:15.430> it's<00:04:15.609> removing<00:04:16.000> all

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
it's quick its instant it's removing all

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.839 
it's quick its instant it's removing all
the<00:04:16.239> nasties<00:04:17.099> including<00:04:18.099> farm<00:04:18.340> chemicals

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
the nasties including farm chemicals

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.909 
the nasties including farm chemicals
with<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.180> added<00:04:19.750> carbon<00:04:20.139> filter<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.709> should

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
with the added carbon filter I should
