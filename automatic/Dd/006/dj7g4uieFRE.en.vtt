00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.080 
nicely and go for the dragon pulse just

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
might over predict but he just makes a

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.120 
might over predict but he just makes a
safe<00:04:14.520> move<00:04:14.700> go<00:04:15.270> straight<00:04:15.600> for<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:16.010> hydro<00:04:17.010> pump

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
and like i said takes me out so that's

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.400 
and like i said takes me out so that's
kind<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.470> my<00:04:19.590> main<00:04:19.830> check<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.190> crow<00:04:20.520> back<00:04:20.700> on

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
kind of my main check the crow back on

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.170 
kind of my main check the crow back on
but<00:04:21.650> I<00:04:21.680> should<00:04:22.070> still<00:04:22.100> be<00:04:22.550> okay<00:04:22.820> without<00:04:22.970> it

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
but I should still be okay without it

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.180 
but I should still be okay without it
but<00:04:23.540> getting<00:04:24.110> on<00:04:24.290> described<00:04:24.590> in<00:04:24.710> right<00:04:24.890> here<00:04:25.040> I

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
but getting on described in right here I

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.860 
but getting on described in right here I
figured<00:04:25.520> here<00:04:25.790> he's<00:04:26.210> just<00:04:26.450> getting<00:04:26.630> pretty

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
figured here he's just getting pretty

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.450 
figured here he's just getting pretty
close<00:04:27.080> combat<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.650> go<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.770> curl<00:04:28.070> that<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:28.370> I'm

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
close combat and go to curl that so I'm

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.610 
close combat and go to curl that so I'm
gonna<00:04:28.610> go<00:04:28.760> for<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:28.940> rock<00:04:29.150> slide<00:04:29.330> just<00:04:30.230> because<00:04:30.470> I

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
gonna go for a rock slide just because I

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.660 
gonna go for a rock slide just because I
didn't<00:04:30.800> want<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.950> miss<00:04:31.040> stone<00:04:31.310> edge<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:31.640> I

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
didn't want to miss stone edge and I

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.860 
didn't want to miss stone edge and I
figured<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.060> still<00:04:32.300> would<00:04:32.420> be<00:04:32.450> I'll<00:04:32.570> take<00:04:32.750> out

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
figured it still would be I'll take out

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.330 
figured it still would be I'll take out
crobat<00:04:33.200> plus<00:04:33.380> it<00:04:33.530> should<00:04:33.680> be<00:04:33.770> like<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:34.130> wrote

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
crobat plus it should be like I wrote

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.730 
crobat plus it should be like I wrote
him<00:04:34.520> if<00:04:34.610> he's<00:04:34.730> decided<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.120> stay<00:04:35.300> in<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.740> takes

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
him if he's decided to stay in and takes

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.440 
him if he's decided to stay in and takes
out<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:36.920> crobat<00:04:37.340> so<00:04:37.490> it<00:04:37.580> works<00:04:37.760> but<00:04:38.210> now<00:04:38.300> he's

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
out the crobat so it works but now he's

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.870 
out the crobat so it works but now he's
gonna<00:04:38.540> go<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:38.750> breloom<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:40.040> wasn't<00:04:40.610> sure

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
gonna go to breloom and I wasn't sure

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.400 
gonna go to breloom and I wasn't sure
he's<00:04:41.090> gonna<00:04:41.210> do<00:04:41.390> so<00:04:41.450> I<00:04:41.570> figured<00:04:41.840> okay<00:04:42.140> he's

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
he's gonna do so I figured okay he's

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.320 
he's gonna do so I figured okay he's
later<00:04:42.680> sis<00:04:42.980> sleep<00:04:43.160> powder<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.670> then<00:04:44.120> do

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
later sis sleep powder and then do

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.910 
later sis sleep powder and then do
something<00:04:44.540> else<00:04:44.690> plus<00:04:45.380> I<00:04:45.440> just<00:04:45.650> want<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:45.860> get

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
something else plus I just want to get

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.290 
something else plus I just want to get
the<00:04:46.040> intimidate<00:04:46.490> office<00:04:46.730> I<00:04:46.820> thought<00:04:47.000> he<00:04:47.120> might

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
the intimidate office I thought he might

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.370 
the intimidate office I thought he might
want<00:04:47.420> to<00:04:47.540> go<00:04:47.600> straight<00:04:47.870> for<00:04:47.990> an<00:04:48.110> attacking

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
want to go straight for an attacking

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.070 
want to go straight for an attacking
move<00:04:48.650> or<00:04:48.830> maybe<00:04:48.980> bsd<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:49.880> I<00:04:49.910> figured<00:04:50.330> Landers

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
move or maybe bsd so I figured Landers

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.350 
move or maybe bsd so I figured Landers
should<00:04:51.260> be<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:51.440> safest<00:04:51.650> option<00:04:52.010> but<00:04:52.220> uh<00:04:52.360> here

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
should be the safest option but uh here

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.540 
should be the safest option but uh here
I'm<00:04:53.600> just<00:04:53.630> gonna<00:04:53.900> go<00:04:54.140> for<00:04:54.170> the<00:04:54.680> u-turn<00:04:55.190> I<00:04:55.370> see

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
I'm just gonna go for the u-turn I see

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.480 
I'm just gonna go for the u-turn I see
as<00:04:55.760> a<00:04:55.790> leftover<00:04:56.270> so<00:04:56.750> I'm<00:04:56.840> like<00:04:56.990> okay<00:04:57.230> um<00:04:57.890> maybe

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
as a leftover so I'm like okay um maybe

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.980 
as a leftover so I'm like okay um maybe
he'll<00:04:58.730> want<00:04:58.820> to<00:04:58.970> swarming<00:04:59.390> right<00:04:59.540> here<00:04:59.750> maybe

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
he'll want to swarming right here maybe

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.510

he'll want to set up an SD noting that

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.310 
he'll want to set up an SD noting that

left<00:05:37.730> over<00:05:37.910> so<00:05:38.210> I'm<00:05:38.419> thinking<00:05:38.990> okay<00:05:39.110> let's<00:05:39.410> go

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
left over so I'm thinking okay let's go

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.400 
left over so I'm thinking okay let's go
to<00:05:39.650> Rotom<00:05:40.010> maybe<00:05:40.490> I<00:05:40.580> can<00:05:40.790> take<00:05:40.940> a<00:05:41.510> plus<00:05:41.990> one<00:05:42.200> hit

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
to Rotom maybe I can take a plus one hit

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.230 
to Rotom maybe I can take a plus one hit
and<00:05:42.530> then<00:05:42.620> get<00:05:42.800> off<00:05:42.830> a<00:05:42.919> low<00:05:43.190> lowest<00:05:43.340> so<00:05:44.090> that's

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
and then get off a low lowest so that's

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
decided not to set up just cuz he

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.950 
decided not to set up just cuz he
figured<00:06:10.370> i<00:06:10.460> would<00:06:10.669> Willis<00:06:11.120> for<00:06:11.390> something<00:06:11.750> so

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
figured i would Willis for something so

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.200 
figured i would Willis for something so
i<00:06:12.020> could<00:06:12.350> just<00:06:12.620> be<00:06:12.800> fruitless<00:06:13.040> but<00:06:13.490> whatever

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
i could just be fruitless but whatever

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.300 
i could just be fruitless but whatever
the<00:06:14.240> case<00:06:14.300> i<00:06:14.600> did<00:06:14.900> get<00:06:15.020> off<00:06:15.169> the<00:06:15.830> pain<00:06:16.010> split

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
the case i did get off the pain split

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.120 
the case i did get off the pain split
and<00:06:16.520> I'm<00:06:16.580> just<00:06:16.760> gonna<00:06:16.880> volt<00:06:17.300> switch<00:06:17.450> here<00:06:18.320> yeah

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130

and I'm just gonna volt switch here yeah
d<00:06:19.220> volt<00:06:19.490> switch<00:06:19.610> here<00:06:19.880> I<00:06:19.910> figured<00:06:20.270> what<00:06:20.360> I<00:06:20.419> volt

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
d volt switch here I figured what I volt

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.580 
d volt switch here I figured what I volt
switch<00:06:20.690> into<00:06:21.050> though<00:06:21.169> I<00:06:21.200> think<00:06:21.680> I<00:06:21.800> go<00:06:22.070> into

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
switch into though I think I go into

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.840 
switch into though I think I go into
okay<00:06:24.590> go<00:06:24.800> into<00:06:24.950> Landers<00:06:25.340> to<00:06:25.610> get<00:06:25.730> the

was<00:07:10.690> a<00:07:10.750> really<00:07:10.840> stupid<00:07:11.199> risk<00:07:11.710> that<00:07:11.919> I<00:07:11.979> could

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
was a really stupid risk that I could

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.189 
was a really stupid risk that I could
have<00:07:12.460> just<00:07:12.669> not<00:07:13.060> done<00:07:13.300> a<00:07:13.360> codess<00:07:13.720> got<00:07:13.840> to<00:07:14.050> run

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 
have just not done a codess got to run

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:16.260 
have just not done a codess got to run
him<00:07:14.319> his<00:07:14.409> death<00:07:14.590> water<00:07:14.860> but<00:07:15.759> at<00:07:15.880> the<00:07:15.940> same<00:07:16.090> time

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
him his death water but at the same time

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.420 
him his death water but at the same time
I<00:07:16.630> don't<00:07:16.990> know<00:07:17.080> whatever<00:07:17.380> but<00:07:17.889> as<00:07:18.009> you<00:07:18.159> get<00:07:18.310> to

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.430 
I don't know whatever but as you get to

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.490 
I don't know whatever but as you get to
breathing<00:07:18.610> I<00:07:18.849> figured<00:07:19.180> here<00:07:19.479> he<00:07:19.630> predict<00:07:20.409> me

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
breathing I figured here he predict me

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.839 
breathing I figured here he predict me
to<00:07:20.620> switch<00:07:20.770> out<00:07:20.979> being<00:07:21.130> a<00:07:21.220> minus<00:07:21.490> one<00:07:21.669> not

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:21.849 
to switch out being a minus one not

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:23.309 
to switch out being a minus one not
willing<00:07:22.030> to<00:07:22.090> take<00:07:22.150> a<00:07:22.210> mock<00:07:22.419> punch<00:07:22.690> so<00:07:23.139> I'm<00:07:23.199> just

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:23.319 
willing to take a mock punch so I'm just

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:24.629 
willing to take a mock punch so I'm just
couldnt<00:07:23.500> go<00:07:23.590> straight<00:07:24.039> for<00:07:24.190> close<00:07:24.430> to<00:07:24.460> all

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 
couldnt go straight for close to all

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:26.249 
couldnt go straight for close to all
that<00:07:24.849> and<00:07:25.060> it<00:07:25.180> luckily<00:07:25.389> pays<00:07:25.719> off<00:07:25.840> to<00:07:25.870> the<00:07:26.110> take

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:26.259 
that and it luckily pays off to the take

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:27.839 
that and it luckily pays off to the take
him<00:07:26.380> out<00:07:26.500> and<00:07:26.680> you<00:07:27.069> knocked<00:07:27.280> over<00:07:27.370> Mach<00:07:27.639> punch

and<00:07:28.030> that<00:07:28.659> kind<00:07:28.840> of<00:07:28.870> means<00:07:28.960> it's<00:07:29.199> my<00:07:29.289> game<00:07:29.500> kids

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:34.180 
so that kind of died and that'll

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.969 
so that kind of died and that'll
actually<00:07:34.360> make<00:07:34.659> it<00:07:34.780> be<00:07:34.900> my<00:07:35.110> match<00:07:35.409> so<00:07:35.650> good

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:35.979 
actually make it be my match so good

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:39.059 
actually make it be my match so good
game<00:07:36.219> potay<00:07:36.669> um<00:07:37.199> that<00:07:38.199> kind<00:07:38.530> of<00:07:38.590> prediction<00:07:38.889> at

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:39.069 
game potay um that kind of prediction at

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:40.649 
game potay um that kind of prediction at
braylin<00:07:39.370> they're<00:07:39.550> kind<00:07:39.789> of<00:07:39.849> won<00:07:40.240> me<00:07:40.270> the<00:07:40.389> match

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:40.659 
braylin they're kind of won me the match

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:42.600 
braylin they're kind of won me the match
but<00:07:41.080> otherwise<00:07:41.889> yeah<00:07:42.310> it<00:07:42.370> would<00:07:42.520> have

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:42.610 
but otherwise yeah it would have

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.800 
but otherwise yeah it would have
probably<00:07:42.789> lost<00:07:43.000> there<00:07:43.240> so<00:07:43.449> it's<00:07:43.599> kind<00:07:43.750> of

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.810 
probably lost there so it's kind of

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.290 
probably lost there so it's kind of
stupid<00:07:44.380> where<00:07:44.650> sara<00:07:44.860> both<00:07:45.069> track<00:07:45.400> on<00:07:45.580> Walt

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:46.300 
stupid where sara both track on Walt

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.529 
stupid where sara both track on Walt
tracking<00:07:46.750> on<00:07:46.810> against<00:07:47.050> both<00:07:47.380> breloom<00:07:47.830> in<00:07:47.949> the

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 
tracking on against both breloom in the

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:51.779 
tracking on against both breloom in the
his<00:07:49.539> own<00:07:49.690> tracking<00:07:49.990> on<00:07:50.169> but<00:07:50.409> the<00:07:51.250> Berlin<00:07:51.580> risk

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:51.789 
his own tracking on but the Berlin risk

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:53.939 
his own tracking on but the Berlin risk
made<00:07:52.389> sense<00:07:52.719> in<00:07:52.870> my<00:07:52.900> mind<00:07:53.199> when<00:07:53.349> I<00:07:53.440> did<00:07:53.650> it<00:07:53.680> but

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:53.949 
made sense in my mind when I did it but

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:55.200 
made sense in my mind when I did it but
the<00:07:54.069> track<00:07:54.250> and<00:07:54.430> risk<00:07:54.610> was<00:07:54.789> kind<00:07:54.969> of<00:07:55.029> stupid

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:55.210 
the track and risk was kind of stupid

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.839 
the track and risk was kind of stupid
but<00:07:55.569> where<00:07:56.080> the<00:07:56.199> case<00:07:56.380> um<00:07:56.710> yeah<00:07:57.159> still<00:07:57.669> good

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:57.849 
but where the case um yeah still good

00:07:57.849 --> 00:08:00.149 
but where the case um yeah still good
