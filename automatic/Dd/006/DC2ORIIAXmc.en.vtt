00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.020
 so the whole times industry eg operating perch 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:13.769
 is raised 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.099
 Bayer is using the model number for milk 24 as a standard 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.199
 90 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.560
 Shalom Windows xp operating system 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.740
 what by default in the room where something optimized that Heisig files to 17 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.569
 2 1 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.569
 The helpers have tackled with were completely 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.819
 away and also the services have been optimized accordingly 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.650
 Percentage of operation - typical 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.360
 the red ones have all states 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.380
 by the majority of all these applications 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.050
 can start 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.730
 Vettel gave it special what you could do he leaves Baustart 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.740
 so what he has 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.200
 So a very narrow 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.380
 Windows XP 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
 well and now let's say something out there and do better 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.660
 so that same Acer this time but with a megabit STMicro Six 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.170
 is it really still the 29th 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.890
 Clevern's 90 series 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.980
 I can show you so I hugged you some stuff 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.400

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.020
 So it is percent in the whole team Ronny workplace accessories 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.770
 what you need for it 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.600
 you can surf the deliverer with the drums de 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.080
 Percent whole 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.610
 Applications run just like the Mac under the version of the 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.160
 Operating system and in versions with burst x10 point 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.730
 Of course, four points Access is not St very current 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.810
 but a passerby over we see so here it is going to be one with the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.860
 Continental as lost 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.510
 1 gained 6 gigawatts of processing speed for me 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.120
 the percent for one 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.340
 for the normal PC on the Dorney merchants RSO Vienna not even so 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.530

 around 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.370
 You can all the programs you know so well, the pretty gimmick 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.920
 McAfee lured f12 into the post after the sport is faded in

 or the f9 key 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.290
 in which all the applications then you can so they can 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.980
 Applications foreground 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.270
