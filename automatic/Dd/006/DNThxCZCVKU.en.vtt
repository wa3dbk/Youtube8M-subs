Vegas Nevada so summer program running
right<00:00:11.900> now<00:00:12.080> we've<00:00:12.259> got<00:00:12.379> lots<00:00:12.530> of<00:00:12.620> athletes

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
right now we've got lots of athletes

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.039 
right now we've got lots of athletes
going<00:00:13.190> through<00:00:13.580> and<00:00:13.879> one<00:00:14.570> of<00:00:14.629> the<00:00:14.719> great<00:00:14.900> new

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
going through and one of the great new

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.660 
going through and one of the great new
things<00:00:15.320> we've<00:00:15.469> introduced<00:00:15.980> into<00:00:16.190> our<00:00:16.309> system

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
things we've introduced into our system

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.790 
things we've introduced into our system
is<00:00:16.760> the<00:00:16.910> free<00:00:17.210> lap<00:00:17.390> timing<00:00:17.960> system

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
is the free lap timing system

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.950 
is the free lap timing system
I<00:00:18.830> started<00:00:19.730> off<00:00:19.850> talking<00:00:20.330> to<00:00:20.570> Christopher

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
I started off talking to Christopher

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.440 
I started off talking to Christopher
free<00:00:21.500> lap<00:00:21.680> and<00:00:22.010> went<00:00:22.700> through<00:00:22.820> the<00:00:22.970> system<00:00:23.330> it

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
free lap and went through the system it

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.940 
free lap and went through the system it
seems<00:00:23.630> pretty<00:00:23.840> interesting<00:00:24.380> to<00:00:24.560> us

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
seems pretty interesting to us

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.950 
seems pretty interesting to us
we<00:00:25.340> were<00:00:25.460> looking<00:00:25.670> for<00:00:25.850> a<00:00:25.880> system<00:00:26.420> that<00:00:26.450> would

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
we were looking for a system that would

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.230 
we were looking for a system that would
allow<00:00:27.350> us<00:00:27.380> to<00:00:27.830> give<00:00:28.040> some<00:00:28.340> quantitative

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
allow us to give some quantitative

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.990 
allow us to give some quantitative
timing<00:00:29.960> on<00:00:30.110> our<00:00:30.140> athletes<00:00:30.710> over<00:00:31.400> a<00:00:31.580> couple<00:00:31.910> of

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
timing on our athletes over a couple of

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.240 
timing on our athletes over a couple of
different<00:00:32.210> distances<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:33.739> first<00:00:33.950> one<00:00:34.129> we

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
different distances the first one we

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.739 
different distances the first one we
were<00:00:34.340> interested<00:00:34.550> in<00:00:34.820> was<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.030> 10-yard<00:00:35.539> we

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:35.749 
were interested in was the 10-yard we

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:37.119 
were interested in was the 10-yard we
wanted<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.019> see<00:00:36.170> what<00:00:36.350> their<00:00:36.469> acceleration

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
wanted to see what their acceleration

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.160 
wanted to see what their acceleration
was<00:00:37.280> like<00:00:37.429> over<00:00:37.670> 10-yard<00:00:38.120> second<00:00:38.809> one<00:00:38.929> we<00:00:39.079> were

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
was like over 10-yard second one we were

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.669 
was like over 10-yard second one we were
interested<00:00:39.410> in<00:00:39.710> was<00:00:40.039> a<00:00:40.609> 5<00:00:41.300> 10<00:00:41.570> 5<00:00:41.899> effectively

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:42.679 
interested in was a 5 10 5 effectively

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.860 
interested in was a 5 10 5 effectively
we<00:00:42.800> caught<00:00:42.980> a<00:00:43.309> change<00:00:43.820> of<00:00:43.999> direction<00:00:44.179> drill

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
we caught a change of direction drill

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.739 
we caught a change of direction drill
and<00:00:45.789> after<00:00:46.789> taking<00:00:47.089> a<00:00:47.210> closer<00:00:47.449> look<00:00:47.539> at<00:00:47.659> the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:47.749 
and after taking a closer look at the

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:49.750 
and after taking a closer look at the
free<00:00:47.960> lap<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.440> some<00:00:48.920> great<00:00:49.100> discussions<00:00:49.640> with

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
free lap and some great discussions with

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.000 
free lap and some great discussions with
Christopher<00:00:50.269> we<00:00:50.390> decided<00:00:50.870> that<00:00:50.899> the<00:00:51.649> product

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
Christopher we decided that the product

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.919 
Christopher we decided that the product
was<00:00:52.100> going<00:00:52.219> to<00:00:52.339> do<00:00:52.429> the<00:00:52.519> job<00:00:52.550> for<00:00:52.999> us<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:53.780> we

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
was going to do the job for us so we

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.529 
was going to do the job for us so we
went<00:00:54.109> ahead<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:54.350> invested<00:00:54.920> in<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.100> system<00:00:55.539> the

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
went ahead and invested in a system the

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.899 
went ahead and invested in a system the
system<00:00:56.929> we<00:00:57.050> ended<00:00:57.289> up<00:00:57.379> going<00:00:57.620> with<00:00:57.769> was<00:00:58.249> three

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
system we ended up going with was three

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.079 
system we ended up going with was three
of<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.569> TX<00:01:00.079> juniors<00:01:00.679> which<00:01:01.129> is<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.550> the

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
of the TX juniors which is the the

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.299 
of the TX juniors which is the the
timing<00:01:02.359> beacon<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.050> we<00:01:03.559> combined<00:01:03.979> that<00:01:04.159> with

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
timing beacon and we combined that with

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.270 
timing beacon and we combined that with
two<00:01:04.670> watches<00:01:05.300> from<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.870> system<00:01:06.290> this<00:01:07.100> allows

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
two watches from the system this allows

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.100 
two watches from the system this allows
us<00:01:07.640> to<00:01:07.759> do<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:07.880> couple<00:01:08.240> of<00:01:08.299> things<00:01:08.540> we<00:01:08.840> can<00:01:08.869> have

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
us to do a couple of things we can have

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.440 
us to do a couple of things we can have
a<00:01:09.140> start<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.649> a<00:01:09.770> stop<00:01:09.829> beacon<00:01:10.549> for<00:01:11.090> our

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
a start and a stop beacon for our

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.420 
a start and a stop beacon for our
10-yard<00:01:12.020> sprint<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:12.619> then<00:01:13.009> we<00:01:13.130> can<00:01:13.280> use

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
10-yard sprint and then we can use

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.639 
10-yard sprint and then we can use
actually<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:13.939> single<00:01:14.329> beacon<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:15.079> time<00:01:15.380> our

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
actually a single beacon to time our

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.209 
actually a single beacon to time our
five<00:01:16.040> ten<00:01:16.369> five<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:17.469> another<00:01:18.469> video<00:01:18.920> we're

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
five ten five and another video we're

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:20.709 
five ten five and another video we're
just<00:01:19.670> putting<00:01:19.820> together<00:01:20.119> now<00:01:20.329> we're<00:01:20.539> going<00:01:20.659> to

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
just putting together now we're going to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.510 
just putting together now we're going to
show<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:20.960> actually<00:01:21.560> how<00:01:21.590> we<00:01:21.770> do<00:01:22.070> that<00:01:22.219> five

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
show you actually how we do that five

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.609 
show you actually how we do that five
ten<00:01:22.789> five<00:01:23.060> but<00:01:23.810> today<00:01:24.110> we're<00:01:24.320> going<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.500> look

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
ten five but today we're going to look

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.100 
ten five but today we're going to look
at<00:01:24.770> our<00:01:24.920> setup<00:01:25.430> here<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:26.210> how<00:01:26.659> we're<00:01:26.869> running

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
at our setup here and how we're running

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.139 
at our setup here and how we're running
out<00:01:27.259> our<00:01:27.710> ten<00:01:28.009> yards<00:01:28.520> it's<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.759> really<00:01:29.000> simple

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
out our ten yards it's a really simple

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.179 
out our ten yards it's a really simple
system<00:01:29.509> we<00:01:30.049> have<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.350> athlete<00:01:30.710> come<00:01:30.920> up<00:01:31.039> to

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
system we have the athlete come up to

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.520 
system we have the athlete come up to
the<00:01:31.280> line<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.549> we've<00:01:32.000> made<00:01:32.210> some<00:01:32.450> put<00:01:33.350> some

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
the line and we've made some put some

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.980 
the line and we've made some put some
marks<00:01:33.859> down<00:01:34.039> on<00:01:34.219> our<00:01:34.310> turf<00:01:34.609> one<00:01:35.329> for<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.659> start

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
marks down on our turf one for the start

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.630 
marks down on our turf one for the start
line<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.500> one<00:01:36.770> for<00:01:37.070> actually<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.490> where

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
line and one for actually that where

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.940 
line and one for actually that where
each<00:01:37.789> beacon<00:01:38.270> goes<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:39.350> interesting<00:01:39.770> thing

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
each beacon goes the interesting thing

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.920 
each beacon goes the interesting thing
about<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.280> beacon<00:01:40.520> is<00:01:40.820> there's<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.270> proximity

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
about the beacon is there's a proximity

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.289 
about the beacon is there's a proximity
on<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.500> beacon<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:43.460> works<00:01:43.670> out<00:01:43.909> at<00:01:44.060> about

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
on the beacon and it works out at about

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.919 
on the beacon and it works out at about
33<00:01:45.200> inches<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:46.549> bring<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.210> watch<00:01:47.450> within

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
33 inches so you bring the watch within

33 inches of the beacon and that will
took<00:01:50.689> a<00:01:50.750> trigger<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.289> timing<00:01:51.619> system<00:01:52.270> what<00:01:53.270> we

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
took a trigger the timing system what we

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.749 
took a trigger the timing system what we
opted<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:53.990> do<00:01:54.140> was<00:01:54.380> put<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.799> start<00:01:55.189> line<00:01:55.399> down<00:01:55.609> on

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
opted to do was put a start line down on

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.090 
opted to do was put a start line down on
the<00:01:55.850> ground<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:56.450> then<00:01:56.929> we<00:01:57.049> measured<00:01:57.380> 36

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
the ground and then we measured 36

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.819 
the ground and then we measured 36
inches<00:01:58.490> forward<00:01:59.030> of<00:01:59.119> that<00:01:59.270> start<00:01:59.659> line<00:01:59.929> and

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
inches forward of that start line and

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.770 
inches forward of that start line and
put<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.130> spot<00:02:01.429> for<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:01.670> beacon<00:02:01.850> now<00:02:02.420> this<00:02:02.570> gives

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
put a spot for the beacon now this gives
