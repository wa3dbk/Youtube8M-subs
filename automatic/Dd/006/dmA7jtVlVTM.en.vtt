working<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:53.340> playing<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.940> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
working on that but playing with that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.990 
working on that but playing with that
composition<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.590> my<00:00:55.800> diet<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.550> kind<00:00:56.879> of

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
composition of my diet really kind of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.090 
composition of my diet really kind of
gave<00:00:57.690> me<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.870> little<00:00:58.020> bit<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.350> setback<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
gave me a little bit of a setback for a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.619 
gave me a little bit of a setback for a
while<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> actually<00:00:59.640> had<00:00:59.940> one<00:00:59.969> week<00:01:00.390> where<00:01:00.600> I

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
while I actually had one week where I

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.340 
while I actually had one week where I
put<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.050> eight<00:01:01.320> pounds<00:01:01.800> out<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.980> nowhere<00:01:03.350> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
put on eight pounds out of nowhere and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500 
put on eight pounds out of nowhere and
it<00:01:04.650> wasn't<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.159> really<00:01:05.549> ate<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:06.060> higher

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
it wasn't that I really ate a higher

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.960 
it wasn't that I really ate a higher
amount<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.200> calories<00:01:07.799> i<00:01:08.010> was<00:01:08.159> eating<00:01:08.460> slightly

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
amount of calories i was eating slightly

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.929 
amount of calories i was eating slightly
higher<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:10.110> i<00:01:10.140> had<00:01:10.560> changed<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.549> went<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
higher but i had changed and went to a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.060 
higher but i had changed and went to a
higher<00:01:12.240> composition<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.140> carbs<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.890> that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
higher composition of carbs and that

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.770 
higher composition of carbs and that
made<00:01:14.250> me<00:01:14.280> pack<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.830> but<00:01:17.090> i'm<00:01:18.090> still<00:01:18.420> kind<00:01:18.720> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
made me pack it on but i'm still kind of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480 
made me pack it on but i'm still kind of
at<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> little<00:01:19.229> higher<00:01:19.380> composition<00:01:20.130> because<00:01:20.310> i

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
at a little higher composition because i

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.490 
at a little higher composition because i
have<00:01:20.729> been<00:01:20.909> taking<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.540> more<00:01:21.750> fruits<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
calorie numbers who still remained

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.580 
calorie numbers who still remained
pretty<00:01:42.479> low<00:01:42.720> pretty<00:01:43.110> much<00:01:43.229> where<00:01:43.439> they're

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
pretty low pretty much where they're

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.249

to<00:01:57.719> do<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.200> trying<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> figure<00:01:58.770> things<00:01:58.950> out

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
to do it and trying to figure things out

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
to do it and trying to figure things out
and<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.790> was<00:02:00.090> doing<00:02:00.360> some<00:02:00.630> elimination<00:02:01.469> diet

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
and I was doing some elimination diet

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.310 
and I was doing some elimination diet
things<00:02:02.100> trying<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.759> figure<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:04.020> was

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
things trying to figure out what was

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.590 
things trying to figure out what was
making<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.710> swelling<00:02:05.100> occur<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.030> still<00:02:06.360> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
making that swelling occur and I still I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.090 
making that swelling occur and I still I
still<00:02:06.869> don't<00:02:07.200> know

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
still don't know

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.730 
still don't know
I<00:02:08.490> suspect<00:02:09.180> gluten<00:02:09.600> as<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> possibility<00:02:10.320> as<00:02:10.560> to

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
I suspect gluten as a possibility as to

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.300 
I suspect gluten as a possibility as to
let<00:02:10.890> suspect<00:02:11.700> dairy<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.510> suspect<00:02:12.750> port<00:02:13.530> all

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
let suspect dairy and I suspect port all

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.890 
let suspect dairy and I suspect port all
right<00:02:14.460> now<00:02:14.640> I'm<00:02:14.910> in<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.180> process<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.720> just

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
right now I'm in the process of just

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.570 
right now I'm in the process of just
killing<00:02:16.140> pork<00:02:17.450> in<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.630> past<00:02:18.870> when<00:02:19.230> we<00:02:19.550> had<00:02:20.550> a

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
killing pork in the past when we had a

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.700 
killing pork in the past when we had a
time<00:02:20.820> when<00:02:21.000> we<00:02:21.150> did<00:02:21.360> tour<00:02:21.660> observance<00:02:22.140> when

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
time when we did tour observance when

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.640 
time when we did tour observance when
not<00:02:23.130> really<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.700> now<00:02:23.880> but<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.170> past<00:02:25.320> when

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
not really that now but in the past when

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.000 
not really that now but in the past when
we<00:02:25.770> did<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.490> spent<00:02:27.500> was<00:02:28.500> about<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> year<00:02:28.770> and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
we did that I spent was about a year and

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.800 
we did that I spent was about a year and
a<00:02:29.100> half<00:02:29.130> maybe<00:02:29.490> almost<00:02:30.120> two<00:02:30.240> years<00:02:30.510> without

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
a half maybe almost two years without

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.810 
a half maybe almost two years without
any<00:02:31.440> port<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.900> do<00:02:34.740> remember<00:02:35.070> during<00:02:35.550> that

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
any port and I do remember during that

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.310 
any port and I do remember during that
time<00:02:36.030> now<00:02:36.270> it's<00:02:36.390> been<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.570> while<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.170> was<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
time now it's been a while and I was a

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.990 
time now it's been a while and I was a
lot<00:02:37.470> younger<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:38.310> during<00:02:38.460> that<00:02:38.640> time<00:02:38.970> I

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
lot younger but during that time I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.510 
lot younger but during that time I
didn't<00:02:39.690> have<00:02:39.750> any<00:02:40.110> joint<00:02:40.410> swelling<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:41.430> I'm

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
didn't have any joint swelling so I'm

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.160 
didn't have any joint swelling so I'm
really<00:02:41.820> wondering<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.930> culprit

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
really wondering if that is the culprit

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.910 
really wondering if that is the culprit
I<00:02:43.590> don't<00:02:43.890> know<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:45.120> right<00:02:45.420> now<00:02:45.920> I'm

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
I don't know but right now I'm

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.470 
I don't know but right now I'm
eliminating<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.700> again<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.120> that's<00:02:48.240> at<00:02:48.450> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
eliminating it again so that's at the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.270 
eliminating it again so that's at the
current<00:02:48.840> thing<00:02:49.080> I'm<00:02:49.260> working<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:49.710> trying<00:02:50.100> to

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
current thing I'm working on trying to

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.860 
current thing I'm working on trying to
figure<00:02:50.520> out<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.850> see<00:02:51.120> if<00:02:51.150> that's<00:02:51.480> my<00:02:51.690> little

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
figure out to see if that's my little

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.820 
figure out to see if that's my little
bodies<00:02:52.860> enemy<00:02:53.870> anyway<00:02:54.870> all<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.710> aside

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
bodies enemy anyway all of that aside

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.940 
bodies enemy anyway all of that aside
weight<00:02:56.550> loss<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.850> still<00:02:57.330> going<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.900> think<00:02:58.770> my

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
weight loss is still going I think my

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.490 
weight loss is still going I think my
last<00:02:59.160> video<00:02:59.580> I<00:03:00.060> want<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.570> say<00:03:00.720> i<00:03:00.780> was<00:03:00.930> around<00:03:01.110> 50

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
last video I want to say i was around 50

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.670 
last video I want to say i was around 50
pounds<00:03:01.890> or<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.190> on<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.760> down<00:03:02.940> marker<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.680> being

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
pounds or so on the down marker so being

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.740 
pounds or so on the down marker so being
63<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.460> an<00:03:05.640> improvement<00:03:05.880> I'm<00:03:06.330> still<00:03:06.570> moving

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
63 is an improvement I'm still moving

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.280 
63 is an improvement I'm still moving
along<00:03:07.970> not<00:03:08.970> as<00:03:09.060> far<00:03:09.210> as<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.420> hope<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.810> be<00:03:09.840> by<00:03:10.110> now

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
to get out and walk it's hard to get out

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.470 
to get out and walk it's hard to get out
and<00:03:22.920> walk<00:03:23.070> when<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.370> have<00:03:23.610> little<00:03:23.880> ones<00:03:24.000> when

and walk when you have little ones when

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.010 
and walk when you have little ones when

it's very cold outside I feel so mean
and<00:03:28.230> guilty<00:03:28.730> pushing<00:03:29.730> them<00:03:29.880> out<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.210> old

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
and guilty pushing them out in that old

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.050 
and guilty pushing them out in that old
cold<00:03:30.750> air<00:03:30.960> I<00:03:31.290> know<00:03:31.860> it's<00:03:32.130> good<00:03:32.400> for<00:03:32.640> them<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.850> a

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
cold air I know it's good for them to a

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.230 
cold air I know it's good for them to a
point<00:03:33.510> but<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:34.440> get<00:03:34.770> as<00:03:34.950> much<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.520> walk-in<00:03:36.060> is

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
point but to get as much of a walk-in is

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.120 
point but to get as much of a walk-in is
what<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.420> really<00:03:36.900> need<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.350> actually<00:03:37.530> call<00:03:38.100> it

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
what I really need to actually call it

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.640 
what I really need to actually call it
exercise<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:39.300> can<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.720> hard<00:03:39.960> because<00:03:40.230> if<00:03:40.500> I'm

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
exercise it can be hard because if I'm

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.110 
exercise it can be hard because if I'm
not<00:03:40.770> there<00:03:40.980> very<00:03:41.160> long<00:03:41.250> then<00:03:41.640> they<00:03:41.760> get<00:03:41.970> pretty

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
not there very long then they get pretty

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.210 
not there very long then they get pretty
cold<00:03:42.390> even<00:03:42.720> bendel<00:03:43.140> dup<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.470> big<00:03:43.710> thick<00:03:43.950> coats

soon will say that's whatever the good
Lord<00:03:57.960> ones<00:03:58.350> there<00:03:58.650> but<00:03:59.460> in<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.640> meantime<00:03:59.820> I

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
Lord ones there but in the meantime I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.550 
Lord ones there but in the meantime I
still<00:04:00.390> do<00:04:00.510> try<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.720> get<00:04:00.900> on<00:04:00.990> the<00:04:01.110> stationary

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
still do try to get on the stationary

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.810 
still do try to get on the stationary
bike<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.250> take<00:04:02.550> little<00:04:02.760> walks<00:04:03.000> as<00:04:03.240> a<00:04:03.270> can<00:04:03.570> and

bike and take little walks as a can and

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.940 
bike and take little walks as a can and
and<00:04:05.820> I<00:04:05.910> think<00:04:06.180> that's<00:04:06.390> basically<00:04:06.960> if<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.890> know

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950

and I think that's basically if you know
for<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.220> moment<00:04:08.400> diet-wise<00:04:09.230> still<00:04:10.230> on<00:04:10.380> my

just pack it as many of those as I can

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.690 
just pack it as many of those as I can

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
and that's not always easy but I'm

trying I have a lot of room for
improvement<00:04:57.280> there<00:04:59.520> but<00:05:00.520> I<00:05:00.550> think<00:05:00.820> that's<00:05:01.030> it

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
improvement there but I think that's it

improvement there but I think that's it
there<00:05:01.450> is<00:05:01.540> my<00:05:01.720> update<00:05:02.080> my<00:05:02.260> current<00:05:02.680> weight<00:05:02.919> is

there is my update my current weight is
the<00:05:05.380> two<00:05:06.270> 71.8<00:05:07.270> I<00:05:07.750> believe<00:05:08.790> then<00:05:09.790> that<00:05:09.820> should

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
the two 71.8 I believe then that should

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.500 
the two 71.8 I believe then that should
be<00:05:10.540> roughly<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:11.110> 63<00:05:11.650> pounds<00:05:11.800> down<00:05:12.100> so<00:05:12.580> still<00:05:13.330> a

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
be roughly the 63 pounds down so still a

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.350 
be roughly the 63 pounds down so still a
very<00:05:13.780> very<00:05:14.110> long<00:05:14.410> way<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:14.710> go<00:05:14.980> one<00:05:15.970> day<00:05:16.150> at<00:05:16.270> a
