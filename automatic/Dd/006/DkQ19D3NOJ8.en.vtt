this so most still don't and i think

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.260 
this so most still don't and i think

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
on can i think that that the basis for

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.679 
on can i think that that the basis for
rational<00:01:16.920> discussion<00:01:17.159> about<00:01:17.909> gun<00:01:18.540> control

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
should always start with arbitrarily

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.060 
should always start with arbitrarily
labeling<00:01:21.720> some<00:01:21.930> people<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.380> good<00:01:22.619> guys<00:01:22.799> and

labeling some people as good guys and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.890 
labeling some people as good guys and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
our people is bad guys because that's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.560 
our people is bad guys because that's
how<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.140> world<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:25.619> hashes<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.520> uh<00:01:27.150> no

with<00:03:20.349> a<00:03:20.379> gun<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.709> that's<00:03:20.859> not<00:03:21.040> necessarily

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
with a gun and that's not necessarily

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.969 
with a gun and that's not necessarily
only<00:03:21.729> because<00:03:22.299> they<00:03:22.750> were<00:03:22.810> these<00:03:23.680> mass

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:23.979 
only because they were these mass

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:25.469 
only because they were these mass
shootings<00:03:24.010> were<00:03:24.459> in<00:03:24.669> places<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:25.150> guns

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:25.479 
shootings were in places that guns

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.030 
shootings were in places that guns
weren't<00:03:25.750> allowed<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:25.989> think<00:03:26.409> they<00:03:26.530> some<00:03:26.889> of

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
weren't allowed I think they some of

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.379 
weren't allowed I think they some of
them<00:03:27.159> were<00:03:27.370> in<00:03:27.430> places<00:03:27.909> where<00:03:28.000> concealed

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
them were in places where concealed

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.659 
them were in places where concealed
carry<00:03:28.629> was<00:03:28.810> allowed<00:03:29.049> so<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.590> think<00:03:29.829> it's<00:03:30.519> just

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
carry was allowed so I think it's just

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.819 
carry was allowed so I think it's just
not<00:03:31.030> often<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.780> according<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.349> mother<00:03:32.500> Jones

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
not often and according to mother Jones

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.920 
not often and according to mother Jones
pretty<00:03:33.159> much<00:03:33.310> never<00:03:33.609> that<00:03:34.329> a<00:03:34.359> good<00:03:34.569> guy<00:03:34.720> with<00:03:34.900> a

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
pretty much never that a good guy with a

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.140 
pretty much never that a good guy with a
gun<00:03:35.019> will<00:03:35.439> stop<00:03:35.739> a<00:03:35.919> bad<00:03:36.129> guy<00:03:36.189> with<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.519> gun<00:03:36.639> so<00:03:37.120> I

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
gun will stop a bad guy with a gun so I

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.089 
gun will stop a bad guy with a gun so I
by<00:03:37.329> no<00:03:37.359> means<00:03:37.840> think<00:03:38.229> that<00:03:38.409> second<00:03:38.769> Amendment

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
by no means think that second Amendment

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.530 
by no means think that second Amendment
rights<00:03:39.129> should<00:03:39.340> be<00:03:39.459> completely<00:03:39.819> taken<00:03:40.269> away<00:03:40.509> I

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
rights should be completely taken away I

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.449 
rights should be completely taken away I
don't<00:03:40.989> think<00:03:41.169> that<00:03:41.290> every<00:03:41.739> single<00:03:42.009> person<00:03:42.129> who

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
don't think that every single person who

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.339 
don't think that every single person who
wants<00:03:42.669> to<00:03:42.790> own<00:03:42.909> a<00:03:42.939> gun<00:03:43.030> is<00:03:43.329> a<00:03:43.359> bad<00:03:43.689> guy<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.259> this

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
wants to own a gun is a bad guy and this

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.449 
wants to own a gun is a bad guy and this
means<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.680> there's<00:03:44.889> going<00:03:45.009> to<00:03:45.099> be<00:03:45.129> a<00:03:45.220> bunch

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
means that there's going to be a bunch

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.129 
means that there's going to be a bunch
of<00:03:45.609> people<00:03:46.120> with<00:03:46.239> concealed<00:03:46.599> carry<00:03:46.870> who<00:03:47.049> are

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
of people with concealed carry who are

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.379 
of people with concealed carry who are
about<00:03:47.259> to<00:03:47.319> shoot<00:03:47.590> up<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.829> campus<00:03:48.250> but<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.239> do

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
about to shoot up the campus but I do

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.390 
about to shoot up the campus but I do
think<00:03:49.989> that<00:03:50.109> it<00:03:50.259> is<00:03:50.290> possible<00:03:50.799> to<00:03:50.859> take<00:03:51.099> second

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
think that it is possible to take second

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.949 
think that it is possible to take second
Amendment<00:03:51.699> rights<00:03:51.729> too<00:03:52.030> far<00:03:52.329> I<00:03:52.359> think<00:03:52.629> ever

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
Amendment rights too far I think ever

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.020 
Amendment rights too far I think ever
since<00:03:53.049> its<00:03:53.620> inception<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:54.699> Second<00:03:55.000> Amendment

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
since its inception the Second Amendment

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.939 
since its inception the Second Amendment
was<00:03:55.419> meant<00:03:55.629> to<00:03:55.750> have<00:03:55.900> limitations<00:03:56.379> you<00:03:56.680> can't

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
was meant to have limitations you can't

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:58.679 
was meant to have limitations you can't
have<00:03:57.129> an<00:03:57.340> f-15<00:03:57.790> fighter<00:03:58.030> jet<00:03:58.269> you<00:03:58.359> can't<00:03:58.569> have

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 
have an f-15 fighter jet you can't have

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.509 
have an f-15 fighter jet you can't have
any<00:03:58.870> sort<00:03:59.139> of<00:03:59.199> weapon<00:03:59.439> of<00:03:59.769> protection<00:04:00.489> that

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
any sort of weapon of protection that

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.629 
any sort of weapon of protection that
you<00:04:00.729> want<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.959> I<00:04:02.049> think<00:04:02.349> that<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:03.220> know<00:04:03.340> it's

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
you want and I think that you know it's

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.729 
you want and I think that you know it's
just<00:04:03.879> again<00:04:04.329> a<00:04:04.389> tricky<00:04:04.810> conversation<00:04:05.019> about

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
just again a tricky conversation about

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.640 
just again a tricky conversation about
what's<00:04:06.509> safe<00:04:07.509> and<00:04:07.810> what's<00:04:08.169> not<00:04:08.590> and

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
what's safe and what's not and

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.439 
what's safe and what's not and
especially<00:04:09.189> if<00:04:09.459> concealed<00:04:09.819> carry<00:04:10.060> permits

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
especially if concealed carry permits

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.990 
especially if concealed carry permits
are<00:04:10.629> easy<00:04:11.139> to<00:04:11.379> obtain<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:12.069> becomes<00:04:12.699> a<00:04:12.819> lot<00:04:12.939> less

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
are easy to obtain it becomes a lot less

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.089 
are easy to obtain it becomes a lot less
safe<00:04:13.479> in<00:04:13.689> my<00:04:13.840> opinion<00:04:14.139> and<00:04:14.319> I<00:04:14.379> also<00:04:14.590> think<00:04:14.889> if

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
safe in my opinion and I also think if

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.909 
safe in my opinion and I also think if
you<00:04:15.669> get<00:04:16.239> used<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.870> seeing<00:04:17.199> guns<00:04:17.530> on<00:04:17.709> campus

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
you get used to seeing guns on campus

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.860 
you get used to seeing guns on campus
because<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:18.579> many<00:04:18.669> people<00:04:19.030> can<00:04:19.150> legally<00:04:19.659> carry

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
because so many people can legally carry

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.800 
because so many people can legally carry
them<00:04:20.169> and<00:04:20.500> are<00:04:20.799> not<00:04:21.039> harmful<00:04:21.489> you're<00:04:22.360> going<00:04:22.630> to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
them and are not harmful you're going to

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.730 
them and are not harmful you're going to
be<00:04:22.990> less<00:04:23.440> a

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
be less a

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.620 
be less a
alert<00:04:24.009> when<00:04:24.430> somebody<00:04:24.849> then<00:04:25.060> does<00:04:25.330> bring<00:04:25.569> a

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
alert when somebody then does bring a

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.330 
alert when somebody then does bring a
gun<00:04:25.780> onto<00:04:25.930> campus<00:04:26.199> he<00:04:26.470> does<00:04:26.740> want<00:04:27.009> to<00:04:27.130> create

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
gun onto campus he does want to create

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.980 
gun onto campus he does want to create
harm<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.759> so<00:04:27.910> you're<00:04:28.060> gonna<00:04:28.240> see<00:04:28.389> a<00:04:28.660> gun<00:04:28.870> and

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
harm and so you're gonna see a gun and

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.779 
harm and so you're gonna see a gun and
think<00:04:29.199> I<00:04:29.380> probably<00:04:29.919> is<00:04:30.250> not<00:04:30.370> doing<00:04:30.580> anything

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
think I probably is not doing anything

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.309 
think I probably is not doing anything
probably<00:04:31.120> has<00:04:31.360> a<00:04:31.389> concealed<00:04:31.780> carry<00:04:31.840> permit

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:32.319 
probably has a concealed carry permit

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.680 
probably has a concealed carry permit
and<00:04:32.830> but<00:04:33.099> for<00:04:33.280> all<00:04:33.370> you<00:04:33.610> know<00:04:33.789> he<00:04:34.180> could<00:04:34.539> be

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
and but for all you know he could be

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.080 
and but for all you know he could be
ready<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.500> be<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.740> nest<00:04:36.009> next<00:04:36.430> mass<00:04:36.639> shooter

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090
