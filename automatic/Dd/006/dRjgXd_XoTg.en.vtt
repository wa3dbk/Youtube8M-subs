00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 come mate down you go to clipping 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.349
 because four more runs without turbo the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.509
 cars get out of the vehicle but there are 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.410
 what to do here here run but you 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.410
 you can download if you want 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.369
 to see here what you do not know 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:38.540
 if it does not come as a strip that's what it has 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:42.160
 80 or do not wait say what's up 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.160
 if you do not give 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.160
 Car 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.879
 impossible 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.580
 quiet 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.509
 my uncle uncle but if I do not even know where 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.090
 I'm going oysters because this car is going so much 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:18.240
 uncle after I want to upload the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.240
 it costs with this environment that I have with him 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.310
 one centimeter male 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.980
 but mine does not reach macho 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:46.100
 do not go uncle if first I do not even know how 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.100
 see is yes 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.890
 it can not reappear equally if you can 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.840
 above 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.840
 my mother 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:14.600
 it's a tree that the past had in the 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.330
 past and I 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.490
 but where there is where you have to go in the 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.120
 jump from that up 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.600
 because it's not hard for me to stamp 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.330
 bleeding point but if a question the 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.190
 point is that it is up there I arrive and 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.860
 I see myself in the point because 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.590
 what the fuck is happening to me because he has to 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.720
 get higher than the point and a little jump 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.420
 and just before the guy just shitting 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.950
 quiet that we continue here we are going to 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:52.090
 joy let's go there we go up look dude 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:56.290
 the sidewalk to see how it is that there is another 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.780
 bigger still later then just the 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.780
 sidewalk and it's impossible 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.569
 is that if you lift the car you saw that 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.569
 you are counting there are only two are all 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:21.740
 it's possible, of course, if I jump 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.920
 before entering 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:29.410
 I can not fat that's relative and that 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.410
 I make those laws because nothing true 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.120
 then mine does not go up alone 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.770
 it seems that we have to raise 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.709
 above the building they made me 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.010
 congratulates to say that they are two laps 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.010
 my mother 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.069
 mine does not pass through here 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.069
 we confirm 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:10.909
 here we are going to see 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:16.100
 I'm being wavered by YouTube 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:20.989
 why do you choose you and go 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.670
 go go go on iodine pills 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.890
 get meeting and here and now 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.740
 is worth where the good thing now is that 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:33.110
 I ran into the sidewalk 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.110
 turn 22 seconds 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:41.789

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:47.180
 I was looking at the first mate 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:49.590

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.680

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.639

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.350

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:09.009
