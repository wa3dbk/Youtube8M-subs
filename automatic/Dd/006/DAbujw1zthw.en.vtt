00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.570 
a month in the hospital you should stay
away<00:04:33.210> from<00:04:33.510> these<00:04:33.930> these<00:04:34.740> creatures<00:04:35.099> the

first off the males are bigger I know
there<00:04:45.720> are<00:04:45.810> some<00:04:46.020> species<00:04:46.289> where<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.710> female

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
there are some species where the female

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.420 
there are some species where the female
is<00:04:47.550> bigger<00:04:47.849> but<00:04:48.240> this<00:04:48.690> is<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.530> species<00:04:50.220> where

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
is bigger but this is a species where

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.790 
is bigger but this is a species where
the<00:04:50.460> males<00:04:50.880> are<00:04:51.210> here<00:04:51.740> while<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.889> males<00:04:53.159> have

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
the males are here while the males have

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.110 
the males are here while the males have
q<00:04:55.240> red-eyes<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.900> they<00:04:57.050> have<00:04:57.319> these<00:04:58.120> sharp

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
q red-eyes and they have these sharp

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.230 
q red-eyes and they have these sharp
teeth<00:04:59.210> on<00:04:59.990> the<00:05:00.319> bottom<00:05:00.800> of<00:05:00.919> their<00:05:01.220> jaws<00:05:01.520> while

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
teeth on the bottom of their jaws while

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.170 
teeth on the bottom of their jaws while
the<00:05:02.389> females<00:05:02.990> have<00:05:03.289> a<00:05:03.349> total<00:05:03.650> of<00:05:03.740> four<00:05:04.129> I<00:05:04.180> won

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
the females have a total of four I won

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.100 
the females have a total of four I won
over<00:05:05.569> the<00:05:05.750> two<00:05:06.620> over<00:05:06.889> here<00:05:06.919> and<00:05:07.509> two<00:05:08.509> over<00:05:08.539> here

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
over the two over here and two over here

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.740 
over the two over here and two over here
though<00:05:09.650> based<00:05:10.069> upon<00:05:10.370> this<00:05:10.580> I<00:05:10.789> think<00:05:10.849> this

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
though based upon this I think this

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.749 
though based upon this I think this
particular<00:05:11.960> one<00:05:12.319> had<00:05:12.770> her<00:05:12.889> eye<00:05:12.949> scratched<00:05:13.430> out

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
particular one had her eye scratched out

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:14.649 
particular one had her eye scratched out
well

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
well

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.960 
well
that<00:05:14.840> was<00:05:15.020> how<00:05:15.169> it<00:05:15.199> was<00:05:15.349> I<00:05:15.500> mean<00:05:15.830> why<00:05:16.699> are<00:05:16.729> these

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
that was how it was I mean why are these

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.580 
that was how it was I mean why are these
that<00:05:18.159> and<00:05:19.750> another<00:05:20.750> thing<00:05:21.050> to<00:05:21.169> note<00:05:21.349> is<00:05:21.560> that

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
that and another thing to note is that

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.059 
that and another thing to note is that
the<00:05:21.979> males<00:05:22.220> have<00:05:22.639> these<00:05:23.440> types<00:05:24.440> of<00:05:24.620> feet<00:05:24.889> and

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069 
the males have these types of feet and

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.399 
the males have these types of feet and
the<00:05:25.190> females<00:05:25.580> have<00:05:25.789> different<00:05:26.020> types<00:05:27.020> of<00:05:27.169> feet

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
the females have different types of feet

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.290 
the females have different types of feet
and<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.889> males<00:05:28.099> also<00:05:28.340> have<00:05:28.610> bigger<00:05:28.909> feet<00:05:29.240> than

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
and the males also have bigger feet than

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.140 
and the males also have bigger feet than
the<00:05:30.020> females<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:31.280> they<00:05:31.430> also<00:05:31.550> have<00:05:31.819> bigger

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
the females and they also have bigger

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.670 
the females and they also have bigger
details<00:05:32.800> than<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:33.979> females<00:05:34.870> so<00:05:36.220> pretty<00:05:37.220> much

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
details than the females so pretty much

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.710 
details than the females so pretty much
the<00:05:39.680> females<00:05:40.159> when<00:05:41.000> they're<00:05:41.180> not<00:05:41.330> trying<00:05:41.539> to

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
the females when they're not trying to

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.080 
the females when they're not trying to
protect<00:05:41.990> their<00:05:42.169> babies<00:05:42.349> have<00:05:43.130> no<00:05:43.310> problem<00:05:43.940> if

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
protect their babies have no problem if

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.290 
protect their babies have no problem if
you<00:05:44.120> come<00:05:44.569> across<00:05:44.810> one<00:05:45.110> of<00:05:45.289> them<00:05:46.120> she<00:05:47.120> won't

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
you come across one of them she won't

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.450 
you come across one of them she won't
let<00:05:47.419> you<00:05:47.630> pet<00:05:48.169> her<00:05:49.479> like<00:05:50.479> that<00:05:51.099> but<00:05:52.099> the<00:05:52.219> male's

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
let you pet her like that but the male's

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.309 
let you pet her like that but the male's
they<00:05:53.090> just<00:05:53.360> will<00:05:53.479> not<00:05:53.599> let<00:05:53.659> you<00:05:54.020> do<00:05:54.169> that

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
they just will not let you do that

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.680 
they just will not let you do that
because<00:05:54.800> they<00:05:55.669> are<00:05:55.699> very<00:05:56.360> aggressive

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
because they are very aggressive

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.920 
because they are very aggressive
creatures<00:05:57.590> it<00:05:57.919> is<00:05:58.759> in<00:05:59.150> their<00:05:59.509> nature<00:05:59.539> to

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
creatures it is in their nature to

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.740 
creatures it is in their nature to
attack<00:06:00.860> anyone<00:06:01.699> even<00:06:02.330> if<00:06:02.449> they're<00:06:02.599> not

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
attack anyone even if they're not

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.719 
attack anyone even if they're not
attending<00:06:03.229> to<00:06:03.580> hurt<00:06:04.580> someone<00:06:05.090> so<00:06:06.550> pretty<00:06:07.550> much

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
attending to hurt someone so pretty much

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.659 
attending to hurt someone so pretty much
you<00:06:07.969> probably<00:06:08.300> would<00:06:08.960> have<00:06:09.169> to<00:06:09.409> try<00:06:09.650> to<00:06:09.710> train

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
you probably would have to try to train

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.600 
you probably would have to try to train
the<00:06:11.180> males<00:06:11.419> to<00:06:11.930> be<00:06:11.960> a<00:06:12.500> bit<00:06:12.979> less<00:06:13.219> aggressive

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
the males to be a bit less aggressive

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.040 
the males to be a bit less aggressive
than<00:06:14.710> than<00:06:15.710> they<00:06:15.919> are<00:06:16.159> right<00:06:16.610> now<00:06:16.719> so<00:06:17.719> it

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
than than they are right now so it

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.080 
than than they are right now so it
probably<00:06:18.440> would<00:06:18.710> take<00:06:18.860> a<00:06:18.919> lot<00:06:19.279> of<00:06:19.460> training<00:06:19.729> to

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
probably would take a lot of training to

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.650 
probably would take a lot of training to
gain<00:06:20.690> a<00:06:20.960> male

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
gain a male

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.650 
gain a male
so<00:06:23.660> yeah<00:06:24.170> males<00:06:24.860> with<00:06:25.310> a<00:06:25.340> CAC<00:06:25.640> all<00:06:26.120> the<00:06:26.420> time

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
so yeah males with a CAC all the time

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.540 
so yeah males with a CAC all the time
unless<00:06:27.140> they<00:06:27.290> could

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
unless they could

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.760 
unless they could
luckily<00:06:28.850> get<00:06:29.270> trained<00:06:29.600> but<00:06:30.260> the<00:06:30.380> females

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
luckily get trained but the females

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.280 
luckily get trained but the females
would<00:06:31.340> only<00:06:31.520> attack<00:06:31.970> yes<00:06:32.510> they're<00:06:32.900> trying<00:06:33.230> to

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
would only attack yes they're trying to

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.610 
would only attack yes they're trying to
protect<00:06:33.590> the<00:06:33.740> babies<00:06:34.690> so<00:06:35.690> that<00:06:35.720> is<00:06:36.170> about<00:06:36.380> it

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
protect the babies so that is about it

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.920 
protect the babies so that is about it
that<00:06:36.800> is<00:06:37.010> the<00:06:37.220> female<00:06:37.760> a<00:06:38.090> Lee<00:06:38.210> dongho

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
that is the female a Lee dongho

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.370 
that is the female a Lee dongho
and<00:06:39.530> I<00:06:40.280> might<00:06:40.850> decide<00:06:41.210> to<00:06:41.270> make<00:06:41.600> a<00:06:41.630> baby<00:06:41.930> too

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
and I might decide to make a baby too

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.410 
and I might decide to make a baby too
though<00:06:43.130> I'm<00:06:43.250> not<00:06:43.400> quite<00:06:43.460> sure<00:06:43.700> what<00:06:44.090> for<00:06:44.300> the

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420

though I'm not quite sure what for the
hair<00:06:44.720> I<00:06:44.750> could<00:06:44.990> use<00:06:45.350> for<00:06:45.620> that<00:06:45.710> but<00:06:46.160> if<00:06:46.640> anyone

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
hair I could use for that but if anyone

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.300 
hair I could use for that but if anyone
wants<00:06:47.390> to<00:06:47.420> leave<00:06:47.810> a<00:06:47.840> comment<00:06:48.230> asking<00:06:48.830> me<00:06:48.980> what

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
I actually do one because I don't have

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.550 
I actually do one because I don't have
many<00:07:00.710> parts<00:07:01.250> to<00:07:01.430> do<00:07:01.670> that<00:07:01.880> so<00:07:02.780> I<00:07:02.990> would<00:07:03.260> like<00:07:03.440> to
