00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello to all and all these young people that 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.200
 I have to meet up for the video on 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.860
 the 2012 Tour de France 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.730
 so we are at pronounced damage then 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.370
 how's it going to happen this step 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.289
 past saint pierre a breakaway that has 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.970
 five minutes 30 of advanced so much 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.670
 to tell you that at 7 km from the finish 5 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.640
 30 minutes advanced it feels good for 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.119
 them then on the other hand we were all 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.460
 grouped 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.170
 the peloton was not broke we were 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.689
 all together well even if there you see 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.949
 that during a small bump in the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.510
 last descent and ben there was 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.180
 a few breakaways that do this ago 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.760
 some leaders you finally her 6 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.540
 kim wanted to leave the peloton so no 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.309
 well naughty and more downhill I'm going 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.070
 succeed in the east to hold them to hold them 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.030
 to his relatives of me so yeah I 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.620
 maybe bullshit it's from 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.750
 to send him Bosnian in a breakaway 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.309
 even if they go 6 minutes 30 advanced 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.680
 even in a breakaway it's going to be hard 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.109
 hard hard to go back to thibaut pinot va 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.899
 no hiding so leblut have been a little 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.030
 scattered certainly but majorie the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.960
 majority of the runners were there the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.960
 proof is that it's worth it to win 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.939
 was still we want more indecent 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.979
 there is not there is not necessarily need to 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.840
 break you'll see I 'm going 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.939
 to have a big fat big fright to 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.979
 hand we'll see that together 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.509
 so the way the device there were the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.700
 escaped he looked at me look where 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.460
 I break my mouth do not have others 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.299
 words I break my mouth yeah so there 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.970
 I tell you shit 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.159
 luckily thankfully from widehem on 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.470
 on the bike and there we can see the 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.060
 look fail look i move on and then there 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.619
 he sees bahia a fall due to a fall 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.090
 these two werss sanchez name me I 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.740
 believe that I think it's sanchez who 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.649
 fell too 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.119
 so here I fall rather rarely but 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.430
 it is true that good in reality you 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.140
 graves the tma you yellow your turn 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.579
 France can be lost clearly 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.290
 can break something and the turn of 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.590
 France can be lost so that's fine 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.490
 luckily I fell and we can 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.140
 not get hurt in the game so 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.790
 luckily so the legal age she has a 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.189
 weight seen again in a platoon see that I 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.820
 did not get too late so on the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.590
 big plateau 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.200
 so me it's an arrival a little bit 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.479
 cause to brazil good arm the lines ci 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.280
 can do something but hey there 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.720
 I have more red bar all that so 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.950
 it's really hot we'll see together 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.319
 already I'm good I stay in the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.879
 platoon already I'm at the bottom of the pack 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.910
 I must be able to escape 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.739
 leave my teammates waiting for me 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.810
 unclassified yeah with breakaways that 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.620
 was leaving I pay him a little and my team 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.200
 to try to catch up 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.120
 so it's a bit of a pity fortunately 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.610
 thankfully I watched a little 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.260
 from behind with with the times for 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.110
 see if they had escaped well 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.000
 luckily he did not have 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.590
 sanchez left it was sanchez of the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.910
 rabobank 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.470
 she's singing look not even if it's 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.500
 weird that if 76 of the rabobank 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.349
 yeah good brief so the only chair that 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.760
 So there went out there I resumed my 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.530
 place in the pack I took a 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.900
 small energy bars to make 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.599
 back up my ba rolls not so could everything go 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.250
 well guys so I passed the 2000s 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.470
 subscribers at the point of the month when I you 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.450
 speak I will soon overtake them so 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.480
 in fact this video will appear on Tuesday 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.580
 so good it's Tuesday instead of 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.050
 Wednesday simply because Thursday 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.519
 and friday the gas is my videos 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.470
 special 2000 subscribers who are going out 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.530
 then after that we will resume the course of 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.120
 normal videos but here it is Thursday 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.920
 and friday guys it's my videos 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.069
 special 2000 subscribers who are going out 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.510
 so this is a pack opening on fall 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.780
 for the first video is the second 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.610
 video is a match on fifa fifa 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.920
 ultimate team and of course with the 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.269
 players that I street in the packs 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.099
 so I think there is way to rio the 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.409
 good hoping she will tell you to 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.970
 have borders in the packs and 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.040
 and then with all that one for once 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.330
 have fun so here we are at one kilometer 4 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.040
 arrival we'll get a little 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.750
 climb I managed to watch I'm 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.460
 in front of the pack 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.580
 I'm in front of the peloton 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.470
 I could have too much strength I see cheeks 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.240
 still people trying to leave 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.690
 I said to melt to follow the 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.650
 attacks 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.170
 so what is very good and so here is 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.280
 so on the other hand I know I would have 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.130
 not rated video but I'm really 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.230
 glad I ordered my microphone at the Yeti 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.910
 blue so maybe it's one in 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.709
 managing the two special 2000 subscribers 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.270
 with his microphone there such as one 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.520
 but if he wants to find the 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.800
 high level with this microphone ex micro there 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.200
 also but after the guys strike at nico 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.030
 to micro who will I hope nickel so 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.980
 normally the next episode champion 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.620
 de france will be shot with the new 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.090
 micro is going to see and maybe changed so 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.200
 such as you will not like but good must 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.930
 no time to get used 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.850
 you will appreciate it is still having 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.880
 a big investment a hundred 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.850
 euros so it's not nothing but good I 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.650
 am here too to please you 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.230
 so it makes me really happy 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.390
 so there certainly is a breakaway so 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.460
 you can see kadri who won 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.280
 then, of course, they take place almost 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.020
 four and a half minutes advanced but 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.450
 clearly there was no change 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.770
 in the overall standings there was none so 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.620
 it is only kadri took the jersey 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.780
 white with red dots it's just that so 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.919
 I have nothing else to tell you so this 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.300
 video was quite short simply 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.990
 because I'm going over a lot of 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.169
 videos during low during this week 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.820
 so 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.440
 so I wanted if you want to watch 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.750
 the overall standings but I can you 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.360
 ensure there has been no change 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.620
 on this set inject them make me in 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.240
 anyway I'm really happy because 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.010
 that my videos his tour de france walk 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.330
 wonderfully so listen to the guys but 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.830
 more witnesses to frankly I'm 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.000
 happiest of the world on this site a 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.000
 subject that keeps everyone
