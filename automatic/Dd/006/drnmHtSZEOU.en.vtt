don't know if they're corroded or I
don't<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.650> what<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.180> if<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.450> just

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
don't know what it is if it's just

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.260 
don't know what it is if it's just
because<00:01:33.869> he's<00:01:34.049> old<00:01:34.759> now<00:01:35.759> we're<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> turn

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
because he's old now we're going to turn

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.660 
because he's old now we're going to turn
it<00:01:36.500> take<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> back

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.680 

and<00:01:43.510> as<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.110> can<00:01:44.229> see<00:01:44.290> he<00:01:44.620> has<00:01:45.540> he<00:01:46.540> has<00:01:46.630> a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
and as you can see he has he has a

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.469 
and as you can see he has he has a
sticker<00:01:47.020> on<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:48.190> back<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.610> says<00:01:48.790> Morse<00:01:49.090> code

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
sticker on the back that says Morse code

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.390 
sticker on the back that says Morse code
I<00:01:49.900> think<00:01:50.409> that's<00:01:50.890> where<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.130> supposed<00:01:51.340> to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
I think that's where you supposed to

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.399 
I think that's where you supposed to
have<00:01:51.520> like<00:01:51.729> Rockets<00:01:52.330> or<00:01:52.600> something<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:53.170> does

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
have like Rockets or something and does

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.940 
have like Rockets or something and does
not<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.610> crank<00:01:55.210> seems<00:01:55.510> to<00:01:55.659> be<00:01:55.810> broken<00:01:56.350> but

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
not the crank seems to be broken but

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.080 
not the crank seems to be broken but
does<00:01:57.190> turn<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:59.070> right<00:02:00.070> there<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.580> put<00:02:00.759> in<00:02:00.880> two

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
does turn and right there you put in two

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.350 
does turn and right there you put in two
D<00:02:01.270> batteries<00:02:01.300> and<00:02:02.140> known<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.619> switch<00:02:03.780> over

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
D batteries and known and I switch over

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.490 
D batteries and known and I switch over
all<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.659> think<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:08.080> looks<00:02:08.289> very<00:02:08.380> good<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:10.600> just

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
all I think it looks very good and just

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.370 
all I think it looks very good and just
wanted<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:11.860> show<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.130> that
