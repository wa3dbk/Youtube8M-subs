these sections of rustic muddy road are
actually<00:00:09.570> fairly<00:00:09.780> easy<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.349> make<00:00:10.469> when<00:00:11.219> one<00:00:11.429> of

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
actually fairly easy to make when one of

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.730 
actually fairly easy to make when one of
your<00:00:11.670> pairs<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.150> beige<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.719> finally<00:00:13.349> had<00:00:13.620> its

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
your pairs of beige I finally had its

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.460 
your pairs of beige I finally had its
day<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:13.980> can<00:00:14.219> step<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.580> up<00:00:14.670> into<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.450> road<00:00:16.170> like

day you can step it up into a road like
shape<00:00:16.830> like<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.430> then<00:00:18.119> squeeze<00:00:18.900> onto

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
shape like this and then squeeze onto

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.170 
shape like this and then squeeze onto
the<00:00:19.470> top<00:00:19.650> surface<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.430> load<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.910> brown

do<00:00:24.150> not<00:00:24.300> use<00:00:24.480> silicon<00:00:24.930> because<00:00:25.109> silicon<00:00:25.590> will

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
do not use silicon because silicon will

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.609 
do not use silicon because silicon will
not<00:00:26.310> take<00:00:26.550> paint<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.390> acrylic<00:00:27.960> mastic<00:00:28.380> takes

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
not take paint but acrylic mastic takes

not take paint but acrylic mastic takes
paint<00:00:28.859> marvelously<00:00:29.519> well<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:30.150> then<00:00:30.689> usually

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
paint marvelously well I then usually

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.359 
paint marvelously well I then usually
mix<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.320> little<00:00:31.349> bit<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.679> cat<00:00:31.920> litter<00:00:32.099> you

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
mix in a little bit of cat litter you

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.400 
mix in a little bit of cat litter you
can<00:00:32.520> see<00:00:32.700> these<00:00:32.759> little<00:00:33.030> stones<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.899> rough

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
can see these little stones and rough

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.650 
can see these little stones and rough
bits<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.829> there<00:00:35.309> that's<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:36.000> very<00:00:36.180> fine<00:00:36.450> bits

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
bits in there that's the very fine bits

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.020 
bits in there that's the very fine bits
of<00:00:36.750> cat<00:00:36.960> litter<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:38.280> then<00:00:38.489> spread<00:00:38.940> it

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
of cat litter and I then spread it

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.299 
of cat litter and I then spread it
around<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.600> over<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> top<00:00:40.379> surface<00:00:40.800> using<00:00:41.070> my

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
around all over the top surface using my

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.100 
around all over the top surface using my
finger<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.180> found<00:00:42.420> no<00:00:42.600> better<00:00:42.809> tool<00:00:43.079> than

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
finger I have found no better tool than

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.830 
finger I have found no better tool than
my<00:00:43.500> finger<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.000> leave<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.539> about

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
my finger and then I leave it for about

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.500 
my finger and then I leave it for about
20<00:00:46.440> minutes<00:00:46.590> or<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.640> dry<00:00:48.030> then<00:00:48.329> but

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
20 minutes or so it's not dry then but

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.850 
20 minutes or so it's not dry then but
it's<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.780> little<00:00:48.989> bit<00:00:49.140> more<00:00:49.289> workable<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
it's a little bit more workable and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.950 
it's a little bit more workable and
tacky<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:50.910> get<00:00:51.059> lollipop<00:00:51.510> sticks<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
tacky I then get lollipop sticks and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
tacky I then get lollipop sticks and
matches<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.379> things<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.430> striate<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
matches and things and just striate the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.119 
matches and things and just striate the
surface<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:55.260> give<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> look<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:55.980> though

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
surface to give it the look as though

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.740 
surface to give it the look as though
the<00:00:56.460> traffic<00:00:56.789> has<00:00:56.879> been<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.329> along<00:00:57.449> its

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the traffic has been going along its

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.360 
the traffic has been going along its
length<00:00:57.960> rather<00:00:58.289> than<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.649> randomly<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.250> all

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
length rather than just randomly in all

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.970 
length rather than just randomly in all
directions<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:01.199> once<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.590> properly

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
directions and then once it's properly

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.039 
directions and then once it's properly
dry<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> dry<00:01:02.760> brush<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.270> pale<00:01:03.480> colors<00:01:03.840> over

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
dry I dry brush with pale colors over

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.840 
dry I dry brush with pale colors over
the<00:01:04.140> top<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:04.949> you're<00:01:05.189> done<00:01:05.309> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the top and then you're done it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.609 
the top and then you're done it
generally<00:01:06.210> works<00:01:06.299> better<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.840> long<00:01:07.110> lengths

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
generally works better in long lengths

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.590 
generally works better in long lengths
rather<00:01:08.159> than<00:01:08.369> short<00:01:08.850> bits<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.270> but

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
rather than short bits like this but

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.850 
rather than short bits like this but
it's<00:01:09.720> easier<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.049> show<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> short<00:01:10.650> bit

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it's easier to show you with a short bit

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.730 
it's easier to show you with a short bit
it's<00:01:11.280> flexible<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.080> go<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:13.409> into<00:01:13.650> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
it's flexible so this can go down into a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.190 
it's flexible so this can go down into a
valley<00:01:13.950> or<00:01:14.310> over<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> hill<00:01:15.210> or<00:01:15.420> whatever<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.080> if

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
valley or over a hill or whatever so if

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
valley or over a hill or whatever so if
your<00:01:16.380> terrain<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:16.890> perfectly<00:01:17.340> flat<00:01:17.580> then

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
your terrain is not perfectly flat then

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.060 
your terrain is not perfectly flat then
your<00:01:17.970> roads<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.570> follow<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.470> contours<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
your roads can follow the contours of

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.440 
your roads can follow the contours of
your<00:01:20.130> terrain<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.790> quite<00:01:20.970> useful<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
your terrain which is quite useful and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.109 
your terrain which is quite useful and
you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.080> also<00:01:22.229> roll<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.790> storage

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
you can also roll it up for storage

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.469 
you can also roll it up for storage
which<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.479> pretty<00:01:24.869> handy<00:01:25.080> too<00:01:25.520> if<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:27.240> wait

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
which is pretty handy too if you wait

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.020 
which is pretty handy too if you wait
until<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:28.470> moment<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.159> can

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
until just the right moment you can

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.429 
until just the right moment you can
sculpt<00:01:30.689> in

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
sculpt in

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.560 
sculpt in
impressions<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.430> tank<00:01:32.759> tracks<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.360> wheels

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
impressions of tank tracks and wheels

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.899 
impressions of tank tracks and wheels
and<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:33.990> forth<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.350> you've<00:01:34.439> got<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:34.909> model

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
and so forth if you've got some model

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.660 
and so forth if you've got some model
tanks<00:01:36.329> with<00:01:37.020> tracks<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.500> could<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.579> know

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
tanks with tracks you could you know

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
tanks with tracks you could you know
something<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.930> could<00:01:40.079> use<00:01:40.320> these

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
something like that you could use these

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.859 
something like that you could use these
and<00:01:40.680> press<00:01:41.100> them<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> surface<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.750> the

and press them in to the surface of the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.460 
and press them in to the surface of the

Monument this crater was pretty quick
and<00:02:34.560> easy<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:34.860> make<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.280> started<00:02:36.090> with<00:02:36.180> a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
and easy to make I started with a

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.030 
and easy to make I started with a
linoleum<00:02:36.540> tile<00:02:37.020> because<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.380> just<00:02:37.680> happened<00:02:37.980> to

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
linoleum tile because I just happened to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.910 
linoleum tile because I just happened to
have<00:02:38.190> one<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.550> with<00:02:39.300> cork<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.990> built<00:02:40.650> up<00:02:40.860> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
have one and with cork I built up the

have one and with cork I built up the
ring<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.790> then<00:02:42.330> texted<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.900> all<00:02:42.990> with<00:02:43.200> brown

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470

bits of cat litter in there for stones

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.540 
bits of cat litter in there for stones
and<00:02:48.420> then<00:02:48.660> with<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.960> matchstick<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.680> sculpted

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
and then with a matchstick I sculpted

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.130 
and then with a matchstick I sculpted
little<00:02:50.760> striations<00:02:51.390> going<00:02:51.630> outwards<00:02:52.050> from

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
little striations going outwards from

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.170 
little striations going outwards from
the<00:02:52.230> center<00:02:52.320> suggesting<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.220> blast<00:02:53.880> from<00:02:54.120> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the center suggesting a blast from the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.230 
the center suggesting a blast from the
middle<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.690> then<00:02:55.320> wet<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.220> end<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.730> my<00:02:56.820> finger

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
middle I then wet the end of my finger

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.930 
middle I then wet the end of my finger
and<00:02:57.390> then<00:02:57.780> use<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.410> smooth<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.460> patch<00:02:59.670> in

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
and then use that to smooth a patch in

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.820 
and then use that to smooth a patch in
the<00:03:00.090> middle<00:03:00.420> which<00:03:00.900> are<00:03:01.050> then<00:03:01.170> painted<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.620> dark

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
the middle which are then painted a dark

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.470 
the middle which are then painted a dark
color<00:03:02.220> with<00:03:02.490> a<00:03:02.640> little<00:03:02.760> lighter<00:03:03.330> color

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
color with a little lighter color

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.990 
color with a little lighter color
suggesting<00:03:04.110> some<00:03:04.490> floating<00:03:05.490> scum<00:03:05.880> or

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
suggesting some floating scum or

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000 
suggesting some floating scum or
something<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.420> then<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.840> varnished<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.650> to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
something and then I varnished it to

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.470 
something and then I varnished it to
make<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.250> look<00:03:08.370> like<00:03:08.460> a<00:03:08.520> puddle<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.300> middle

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
make it look like a puddle in the middle

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.090 
make it look like a puddle in the middle
of<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.630> crater<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.080> then<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.620> just<00:03:10.770> added<00:03:10.950> some

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
of the crater and then I just added some

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.760 
of the crater and then I just added some
green<00:03:11.730> flock<00:03:12.060> around<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.480> edges<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.990> show<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
green flock around the edges to show the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.400 
green flock around the edges to show the
old<00:03:13.950> surface<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.940> ground<00:03:15.180> before<00:03:15.990> it<00:03:16.290> was

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
old surface of the ground before it was

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.300 
old surface of the ground before it was
all<00:03:16.530> smashed<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.930> course<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:19.170> water<00:03:19.620> treatment

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
all smashed of course a water treatment

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.970 
all smashed of course a water treatment
works<00:03:20.820> now<00:03:21.120> this<00:03:21.360> one<00:03:21.540> is<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.050> specific<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.860> the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
works now this one is so specific to the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.470 
works now this one is so specific to the
things<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.370> found<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:23.730> make<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.000> out<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.300> it

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
things I found to make it out of that it

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.640 
things I found to make it out of that it
might<00:03:24.600> be<00:03:24.720> difficult<00:03:24.900> for<00:03:25.170> others<00:03:25.530> to

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
might be difficult for others to

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.520 
might be difficult for others to
replicate<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.970> base<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.300> it<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.959> big<00:03:28.260> sheet

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
replicate the base of it is a big sheet

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.070 
replicate the base of it is a big sheet
of<00:03:28.739> foam<00:03:29.070> core<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.640> got<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.120> for<00:03:30.330> nothing<00:03:30.690> it

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
of foam core I got this for nothing it

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.050 
of foam core I got this for nothing it
was<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.380> sign<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:31.890> was<00:03:32.310> used<00:03:32.550> in<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.760> local
