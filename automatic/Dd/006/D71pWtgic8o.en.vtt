00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
this video we're going to learn how to

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.589 
this video we're going to learn how to
set<00:00:07.620> up<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:08.069> smart<00:00:08.340> board<00:00:08.580> ready<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.389> your

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
set up a smart board ready for your

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.589 
set up a smart board ready for your
lessons<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.170> it's<00:00:10.980> quite<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> simple<00:00:11.370> process

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
lessons and it's quite a simple process

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.430 
lessons and it's quite a simple process
so<00:00:12.599> one<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.840> first<00:00:13.019> things<00:00:13.200> I'm<00:00:13.259> going<00:00:13.290> to

so one of the first things I'm going to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.129 
so one of the first things I'm going to
do<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.280> calibrate<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.880> board<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.990> when<00:00:16.080> you

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
do is to calibrate the board so when you

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.750 
do is to calibrate the board so when you
first<00:00:16.320> walk<00:00:16.500> into<00:00:16.710> your<00:00:16.830> lesson<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.369> turn<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760

need<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.110> calibrate<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.649> board<00:00:40.890> first<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.520> you

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
need to calibrate the board first if you
