00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
best picture but it's a picture that I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.219 
best picture but it's a picture that I

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
chose because it has a lot of texture

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.440 
chose because it has a lot of texture
and<00:01:34.590> some<00:01:35.100> detail<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.000> okay<00:01:37.939> you<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.180> also

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and some detail to it okay you can also

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.240 
and some detail to it okay you can also
do<00:01:40.229> another<00:01:40.439> drop-down<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:42.030> yourself<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
do another drop-down and have yourself a

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.690 
do another drop-down and have yourself a
little<00:01:44.250> loop<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.680> can<00:01:49.890> kind<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.250> get

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
little loop here so you can kind of get

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.149 
little loop here so you can kind of get
an<00:01:50.729> idea<00:01:50.960> while<00:01:51.960> you're<00:01:52.170> sharpening<00:01:53.659> exactly

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
an idea while you're sharpening exactly

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.499 
an idea while you're sharpening exactly
what<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.280> looks<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.820> okay<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.250> just

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
what it looks like okay and you can just

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.050 
what it looks like okay and you can just
drag<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.719> wherever<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.229> want<00:02:01.469> anyway<00:02:02.189> so

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
drag it to wherever you want anyway so

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.130 
drag it to wherever you want anyway so
the<00:02:03.180> first<00:02:03.390> thing<00:02:03.450> I'm<00:02:03.600> going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.780> tell<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:03.960> is

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the first thing I'm going to tell you is

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.789 
the first thing I'm going to tell you is
as<00:02:04.409> far<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.219> amount<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.520> sharpening<00:02:06.799> if

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
as far as the amount of sharpening if

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.770 
as far as the amount of sharpening if
you're<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> do<00:02:08.819> people<00:02:09.270> you're<00:02:09.599> not

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
you're going to do people you're not

you're going to do people you're not
going<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.170> as<00:02:10.289> much<00:02:10.319> if<00:02:10.830> you're<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.280> to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
going to do as much if you're going to

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.059 
going to do as much if you're going to
do

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
do

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.979 
do
objects<00:02:12.370> you're<00:02:13.090> probably<00:02:13.299> going<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.569> do<00:02:13.719> more

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
objects you're probably going to do more

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.500 
objects you're probably going to do more
we<00:02:14.709> can<00:02:14.920> go<00:02:15.010> from<00:02:15.189> zero<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.819> if<00:02:15.879> you<00:02:15.999> look<00:02:16.209> you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
we can go from zero and if you look you

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.229 
we can go from zero and if you look you
can<00:02:16.659> see<00:02:16.719> it's<00:02:16.989> kind<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.319> fuzzy<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.879> take<00:02:19.120> it

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
can see it's kind of fuzzy if I take it

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.780 
can see it's kind of fuzzy if I take it
all<00:02:19.389> the<00:02:19.420> way<00:02:19.569> up<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.109> actually<00:02:20.859> puts<00:02:21.430> noise

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
all the way up it actually puts noise

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.349 
all the way up it actually puts noise
into<00:02:22.239> it<00:02:22.389> and<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.689> just<00:02:22.719> really<00:02:23.499> overdoes<00:02:24.069> it

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
into it and it just really overdoes it

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.080 
into it and it just really overdoes it
what<00:02:25.359> you<00:02:25.480> can<00:02:25.689> do<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.489> just<00:02:27.489> hold<00:02:27.700> down<00:02:27.819> the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
what you can do is just hold down the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.500 
what you can do is just hold down the
Alt<00:02:28.389> key<00:02:28.859> on<00:02:29.859> PC<00:02:30.730> or<00:02:31.000> option<00:02:31.540> on<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.859> Mac<00:02:32.859> and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
Alt key on PC or option on a Mac and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.470 
Alt key on PC or option on a Mac and
it'll<00:02:34.510> kind<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.840> gray<00:02:35.109> scale<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.680> out<00:02:36.480> and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
it'll kind of gray scale it out and

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.409 
it'll kind of gray scale it out and
it'll<00:02:38.040> let<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.069> know<00:02:39.489> right<00:02:39.909> when<00:02:40.269> you're

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:40.419 
it'll let you know right when you're

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.500 
it'll let you know right when you're
hitting<00:02:40.659> that<00:02:40.900> sweet<00:02:41.319> spot<00:02:41.530> where<00:02:42.510> it

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
hitting that sweet spot where it

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.610 
hitting that sweet spot where it
sharpens<00:02:44.139> it<00:02:44.400> but<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.519> doesn't<00:02:45.849> go<00:02:45.969> crazy<00:02:46.620> so

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
sharpens it but it doesn't go crazy so

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.050 
sharpens it but it doesn't go crazy so
we're<00:02:47.769> going<00:02:47.859> to<00:02:47.950> bring<00:02:48.159> that<00:02:48.219> right<00:02:48.609> up<00:02:48.790> to

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
we're going to bring that right up to

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.270 
we're going to bring that right up to
about<00:02:50.010> about<00:02:51.010> 32<00:02:51.730> or<00:02:51.909> 33<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.949> then<00:02:53.949> on<00:02:54.159> the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
about about 32 or 33 and then on the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.199 
about about 32 or 33 and then on the
radius<00:02:55.709> there's<00:02:56.709> really<00:02:57.010> no<00:02:57.280> reason<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.879> go<00:02:58.030> up

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
radius there's really no reason to go up

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.659 
radius there's really no reason to go up
past<00:02:58.959> about<00:02:59.439> to<00:03:00.030> but<00:03:01.030> with<00:03:01.629> this<00:03:02.579> usually<00:03:03.579> if

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
past about to but with this usually if

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.379 
past about to but with this usually if
you're<00:03:03.819> around<00:03:05.579> 11.7<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.699> further<00:03:06.969> you<00:03:07.090> go

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
you're around 11.7 the further you go

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.420 
you're around 11.7 the further you go
see<00:03:08.199> it<00:03:08.290> brings<00:03:08.500> everything<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.159> again<00:03:09.340> I'm

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
holding down the alt or option key okay

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.789 
holding down the alt or option key okay
so<00:03:13.689> I'm<00:03:13.780> going<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.930> bring<00:03:14.109> it<00:03:14.230> over<00:03:14.500> here<00:03:14.530> a

so I'm going to bring it over here a

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.379 
so I'm going to bring it over here a
little<00:03:14.980> bit<00:03:15.219> and<00:03:16.859> about<00:03:17.859> 1.2<00:03:18.609> for<00:03:18.849> this<00:03:19.000> looks

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
little bit and about 1.2 for this looks

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.990 
little bit and about 1.2 for this looks
pretty<00:03:19.689> good<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.139> can<00:03:21.069> do<00:03:21.129> the<00:03:21.250> same<00:03:21.549> thing<00:03:21.849> for

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
pretty good I can do the same thing for

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.300 
pretty good I can do the same thing for
the<00:03:22.060> detail<00:03:22.509> all<00:03:23.079> right<00:03:23.290> with<00:03:24.159> the<00:03:24.280> detail

looks good and then masking is something
that<00:03:45.159> you're<00:03:45.340> going<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.489> use<00:03:45.819> just<00:03:46.629> like<00:03:46.810> you

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
that you're going to use just like you

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.069 
that you're going to use just like you
wouldn't<00:03:47.109> photoshop<00:03:47.680> for<00:03:47.979> a<00:03:48.009> mask<00:03:48.689> if<00:03:49.689> I<00:03:49.870> take

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
wouldn't photoshop for a mask if I take

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.539 
wouldn't photoshop for a mask if I take
it<00:03:50.199> all<00:03:50.319> the<00:03:50.349> way<00:03:50.439> to<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.769> right<00:03:50.949> it<00:03:51.250> basically

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
it all the way to the right it basically

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.909 
it all the way to the right it basically
puts<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.209> mask<00:03:52.419> on<00:03:52.689> it<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:52.930> if<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.139> can<00:03:53.530> hold<00:03:53.799> the

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
puts a mask on it and if I can hold the

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.270 
puts a mask on it and if I can hold the
option<00:03:54.040> key<00:03:54.340> down<00:03:55.439> you're<00:03:56.439> going<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.650> see<00:03:56.919> the

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
option key down you're going to see the

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.280 
option key down you're going to see the
white<00:03:57.519> areas<00:03:57.969> are<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.269> areas<00:03:58.419> where<00:03:59.109> it's

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
white areas are the areas where it's

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.009 
white areas are the areas where it's
going<00:03:59.439> to<00:03:59.469> go<00:03:59.560> through<00:03:59.919> to<00:04:01.439> in<00:04:03.569> black<00:04:04.569> areas

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
going to go through to in black areas

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.619 
going to go through to in black areas
where<00:04:05.379> it's<00:04:05.530> masking<00:04:06.009> it<00:04:06.159> out<00:04:06.419> so<00:04:07.419> in<00:04:07.509> this

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
where it's masking it out so in this

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.050 
where it's masking it out so in this
case<00:04:07.870> we<00:04:08.139> want<00:04:08.379> to<00:04:08.469> mask<00:04:08.879> you<00:04:09.879> want<00:04:10.090> everything

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
case we want to mask you want everything

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.129 
case we want to mask you want everything
except<00:04:13.060> for<00:04:13.180> maybe<00:04:13.299> some<00:04:13.569> of<00:04:13.689> that<00:04:13.719> stuff<00:04:13.989> in

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
except for maybe some of that stuff in

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.779 
except for maybe some of that stuff in
the<00:04:14.199> background<00:04:14.439> so<00:04:14.949> again<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.489> can<00:04:15.669> adjust

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:15.789 
the background so again you can adjust

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:20.399 
the background so again you can adjust
this<00:04:16.269> to<00:04:16.680> your<00:04:17.680> liking<00:04:18.130> okay<00:04:19.109> well<00:04:20.109> now<00:04:20.229> that

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
this to your liking okay well now that

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.470 
this to your liking okay well now that
we've<00:04:20.529> done<00:04:20.739> that<00:04:21.150> we<00:04:22.150> have<00:04:22.360> introduced

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
we've done that we have introduced

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.110 
we've done that we have introduced
a<00:04:23.510> little<00:04:24.170> bit<00:04:24.290> of<00:04:24.320> noise<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:25.010> that's<00:04:25.700> when<00:04:25.970> we

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
a little bit of noise and that's when we

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.640 
a little bit of noise and that's when we
we<00:04:26.270> can<00:04:26.420> go<00:04:26.600> down<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:26.990> noise<00:04:27.260> reduction

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
we can go down to the noise reduction

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.560 
we can go down to the noise reduction
and<00:04:29.080> really<00:04:30.080> ten<00:04:30.920> fifteen<00:04:31.550> twenty<00:04:31.730> percent<00:04:32.360> is

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
and really ten fifteen twenty percent is

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.780 
and really ten fifteen twenty percent is
more<00:04:32.810> than<00:04:32.930> enough<00:04:33.230> if<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:34.100> have<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.460> go<00:04:34.550> up<00:04:34.640> to

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
more than enough if you have to go up to

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.280 
more than enough if you have to go up to
50<00:04:35.240> that's<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:36.020> lot<00:04:37.900> because<00:04:38.900> what<00:04:39.080> it's<00:04:39.200> going

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
50 that's a lot because what it's going

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.810 
50 that's a lot because what it's going
to<00:04:39.350> do<00:04:39.470> is<00:04:39.560> it's<00:04:39.590> going<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:39.920> smooth<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.340> out<00:04:40.460> too

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
to do is it's going to smooth it out too

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.240 
to do is it's going to smooth it out too
much<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.450> make<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.080> look<00:04:42.230> almost<00:04:42.470> plastic

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
much and make it look almost plastic
