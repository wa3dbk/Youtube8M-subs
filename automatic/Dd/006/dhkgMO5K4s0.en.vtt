00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 although it seems a lie if a person 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.219
 leaves planted on the altar to his future 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.769
 husband or wife has the right to 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.299
 report him for emotional damage in 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.539
 some countries like they can be for 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.359
 example taiwan can be denounced 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.000
 this and you can get that person 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.779
 that has left you planted in 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.960
 the altar pay a fine of thousands and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:36.030
 thousands of dollars this was the case of a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.640
 Taiwanese couple who was formed 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.890
 basically by a man a man of 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.160
 thirty-one years old and a woman who 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.920
 I was five months pregnant at 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.890
 it seems the woman did not want to go to the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.860
 ceremony because he had discussed 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:57.630
 for the guest list and because of that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.820
 he did not show up at the wedding so 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.910
 her future husband what she decided to do 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.710
 was to take a maid of honor to one of 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.070
 the bridesmaids who were at the wedding 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.800
 and he married her to avoid the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.150
 shame but the most curious thing about this is 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.830
 that finally ended 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.100
 truly married to that lady of 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.910
 honor this woman not only lost to 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 her future husband but also one of 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.580
 the bridesmaids in the end ended 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.310
 marrying him closing thus all 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.160
 possibility that this pregnant woman 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.770
 five months since I could rectify 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.500
 the error of not having been presented in the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.080
 wedding besides this the woman who does not 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.210
 went to the ceremony to get married goes to 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.119
 have to pay according to the court of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.570
 taiwan eight thousand dollars for damages 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.630
 moral damages that according to the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.320
 court have been brought to this 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.710
 person because then that had 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.700
 decided not to go to the wedding for reasons that 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.130
 they were not important 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.709
 so as you can see in some 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.290
 places are taken this from marriages 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.750
 very seriously I do not know if in Spain 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.569
 you can do the same thing you can 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.230
 denounce the moral damages but 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.870
 I do not know if the court really 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.440
 I would accept it but good in taiwan as 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.510
 you can see if a person leaves you 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.150
 planted on the altar when you go to 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.959
 married on your wedding day she can be 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.630
 report for moral damages a curious 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.030
 information that makes us see the laps 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.549
 who gives life not in this case this 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.750
 man who had not presented us his 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:49.690
 woman, well, your future wife, 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.640
 decided to catch any woman to a 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.220
 of the bridesmaids and say me case 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.990
 with this and in the end he ended up living with 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.050
 Bridesmaid 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.300
 a very interesting story that we 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.390
 makes you look for what I said the 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.120
 turns that gives life 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.600
 that in the end, one never knows where 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.240
 it can end 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.110
 interesting news hard to believe 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.110
 but real
