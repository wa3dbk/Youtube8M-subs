 greetings the guardians speaks to you very 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.150
 welcome and welcome back to destination 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.040
 what they are seeing is the sleeper 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.870
 simulate a broadcast bible that will occupy 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.519
 the space of heavy weapon and that pretends 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.290
 be at the height of the jara and 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.330
 imagine unlike other rifles 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.920
 fusion we know a charged shot 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.930
 of this weapon will be able to go through 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.910
 several enemies and bounce up to five 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.980
 times on the walls this clear when 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.720
 we have all your improvements available on 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.070
 path that we must take to obtain them 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.750
 it will not be easy to ensure the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.340
 bunge developers and we'll have to 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.019
 look for all the relics of the age of 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.610
 gold that have been scattered for several 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.680
 planets once we have found them 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.630
 all these old people will have to be delivered 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.129
 fragments to the armourer of the tower the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.570
 relics will activate a mission that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.030
 will make the players embark on a 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.379
 odyssey to repair and activate the weapon not 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.180
 they went into details about the mission 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.559
 but if it was commented that there will be tasks and 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.270
 objectives in which we need 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.129
 solve puzzles that will be very difficult 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.870
 come alone and that's why we should 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.820
 undertake such missions a team 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.039
 about its design this was inspired by 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.579
 several pictures of the nasa including the mark 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.109
 roberts 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.000
 now let's take a look at the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.410
 modifiers of this weapon just remember 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.760
 that the description may change 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.799
 when the official version comes out 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.150
 espanyol projectile perforating the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.900
 project and penetrate and go through 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
 enemies 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.890
 once the projectile is able to do 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.830
 Precision damage and improvements 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.140
 ballistics we have fejuve ballistics bonuses 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.820

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.380
 of range less recoil 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.750
 impact bonds reduction of the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.520

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.380

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.760
 acquisition of targets reduction of 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 stability in the first improvement of 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.210
 skill just a scratch with this weapon 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.520
 it is easier to aim while 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.560
 they shoot help to stay pointing a 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.750

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.470
 perfect balance the recoil of this 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.630
 weapon is extremely under his management 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.520
 punctual range bonuses bonds 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.680

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.740
 reduction of stability and finally 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.450
 the exotic skill final name dvd 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.510
 increases the number of bullets that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.040
 they bounce back to 5 and this is all what do you think of 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.660
 this fusion weapon that will be equipped 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.490
