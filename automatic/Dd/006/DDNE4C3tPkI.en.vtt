because<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.590> think<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.800> might<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.220> first

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
because I think this might be the first

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.700 
because I think this might be the first
one<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:20.699> youtube<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> second<00:00:21.630> not<00:00:22.500> sure

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
one on youtube and the second not sure

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.200 
one on youtube and the second not sure
might<00:00:22.949> be<00:00:23.010> one<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> first<00:00:23.460> ones<00:00:23.609> so

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
might be one of the first ones so

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.519 
might be one of the first ones so
because<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.630> got<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> cards<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.500> I

lasers I mean this is we're right now I

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.009 
lasers I mean this is we're right now I
might<00:02:58.489> cut<00:02:58.640> this<00:02:58.790> but<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.150> mean<00:02:59.360> it's<00:02:59.540> it's<00:02:59.750> okay

might cut this but I mean it's it's okay

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.420 
might cut this but I mean it's it's okay
in<00:03:00.110> testing<00:03:00.470> so<00:03:00.620> I'll<00:03:00.709> just<00:03:00.739> keep<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.160> for<00:03:01.340> an

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
in testing so I'll just keep it for an

in testing so I'll just keep it for an
hour<00:03:01.519> but<00:03:01.760> another<00:03:02.690> my<00:03:02.840> key<00:03:02.900> cut<00:03:03.140> for

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
hour but another my key cut for

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.900 
hour but another my key cut for
something<00:03:03.500> later<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:04.250> is<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.549> proxy<00:03:04.879> to

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
something later this is the proxy to

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.699 
something later this is the proxy to
dowsing<00:03:05.180> machine<00:03:05.360> but<00:03:05.989> both<00:03:06.379> my<00:03:06.560> dowsing

now<00:03:08.269> so<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.690> get<00:03:09.049> those<00:03:09.170> back<00:03:09.410> but<00:03:10.280> dowsing

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
now so I get those back but dowsing

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.089 
now so I get those back but dowsing
machine<00:03:10.700> is<00:03:11.150> by<00:03:11.360> far<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.599> best<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:12.170> spectrum<00:03:13.010> is

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
machine is by far the best a spectrum is

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.020 
machine is by far the best a spectrum is
that<00:03:13.280> because<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.489> play<00:03:13.610> so<00:03:13.670> many<00:03:13.790> trainers

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
that because you play so many trainers

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.970 
that because you play so many trainers
and<00:03:14.239> stuff<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:16.340> I've<00:03:17.209> 19<00:03:17.690> trainers<00:03:18.079> or<00:03:18.950> I

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
and stuff so I've 19 trainers or I

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.059 
and stuff so I've 19 trainers or I
tumblr<00:03:19.430> be<00:03:19.549> McCallum<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.829> then<00:03:21.829> on<00:03:21.920> an

tumblr be McCallum so and then on an
energy<00:03:22.430> these<00:03:22.850> energies<00:03:23.239> are<00:03:23.359> kind<00:03:23.540> of<00:03:23.600> weird

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
energy these energies are kind of weird

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.170 
energy these energies are kind of weird
but<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.230> mean<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.680> don't<00:03:24.859> mean<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.760> can't<00:03:25.790> get

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
but I mean I don't mean you can't get

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.370 
but I mean I don't mean you can't get
too<00:03:26.299> weird<00:03:26.480> with<00:03:26.600> these<00:03:26.720> energies<00:03:27.079> or<00:03:27.170> your

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
too weird with these energies or your

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.110 
too weird with these energies or your
detector<00:03:27.680> me<00:03:27.889> that<00:03:28.040> consistent<00:03:28.459> right<00:03:29.000> now

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
detector me that consistent right now

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.360 
detector me that consistent right now
it's<00:03:29.299> uh<00:03:29.709> this<00:03:30.709> may<00:03:30.829> seem<00:03:30.889> like<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.190> lot<00:03:31.340> of

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
it's uh this may seem like a lot of

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.900 
it's uh this may seem like a lot of
energy<00:03:31.549> to<00:03:31.700> 10<00:03:32.450> fairy<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.920> reason<00:03:34.220> why<00:03:34.730> I'm

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
energy to 10 fairy the reason why I'm

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.430 
energy to 10 fairy the reason why I'm
playing<00:03:35.120> time<00:03:35.239> very<00:03:35.420> i'm<00:03:35.599> not<00:03:35.810> i'm<00:03:36.019> pretty

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
playing time very i'm not i'm pretty

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.559 
playing time very i'm not i'm pretty
sure<00:03:36.620> i'm<00:03:36.739> not<00:03:36.829> going<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.190> cut<00:03:37.340> any<00:03:37.489> is<00:03:37.730> because

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
sure i'm not going to cut any is because

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.270 
sure i'm not going to cut any is because
you<00:03:38.750> want<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:39.019> geo<00:03:39.230> man<00:03:39.410> c<00:03:39.590> for<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.859> like<00:03:40.069> for

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
you want a geo man c for the like for

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.620 
you want a geo man c for the like for
two<00:03:40.430> terms<00:03:40.609> and<00:03:40.970> if<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.150> don't<00:03:41.389> have<00:03:41.510> the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
two terms and if you don't have the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.839 
two terms and if you don't have the
fairy<00:03:41.840> energy<00:03:41.930> in<00:03:42.230> dec<00:03:42.549> because<00:03:43.549> you<00:03:43.639> can't

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
fairy energy in dec because you can't

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.159 
fairy energy in dec because you can't
get<00:03:43.940> these<00:03:44.060> next<00:03:44.359> energy<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.690> show<00:03:44.840> you<00:03:44.989> with

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
get these next energy to show you with

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.870 
get these next energy to show you with
the<00:03:45.380> ferry<00:03:45.650> entity<00:03:46.010> so<00:03:46.250> i<00:03:46.280> really<00:03:46.790> think

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
the ferry entity so i really think

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.280 
the ferry entity so i really think
they're<00:03:47.060> completely<00:03:47.480> necessary<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:48.109> play

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
they're completely necessary to play

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.849 
they're completely necessary to play
this<00:03:48.560> man<00:03:48.769> ferry<00:03:49.099> plus<00:03:49.849> you<00:03:50.599> hit<00:03:51.380> for<00:03:51.620> way<00:03:51.799> you

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
this man ferry plus you hit for way you

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.069 
this man ferry plus you hit for way you
if<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.730> tactful<00:03:53.150> with<00:03:53.209> for<00:03:53.450> energy<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:53.989> if

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
if you tactful with for energy so if

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.449 
if you tactful with for energy so if
they<00:03:54.169> can<00:03:54.290> one-shot<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.709> your<00:03:54.950> for<00:03:55.190> energy

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
they can one-shot you your for energy

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.909 
they can one-shot you your for energy
down<00:03:55.579> you<00:03:55.880> need<00:03:56.090> 10<00:03:56.480> I<00:03:56.750> mean<00:03:57.019> it's<00:03:57.319> like<00:03:57.620> plus

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
down you need 10 I mean it's like plus

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.129 
down you need 10 I mean it's like plus
to<00:03:58.040> prod<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.310> need<00:03:58.669> that<00:03:58.849> my<00:03:58.970> energy<00:03:59.329> basic

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
to prod you need that my energy basic

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.900 
to prod you need that my energy basic
energy<00:04:00.260> Lee's<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:00.889> I<00:04:01.130> just<00:04:01.669> think<00:04:01.819> it's

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
energy Lee's so I just think it's

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.539 
energy Lee's so I just think it's
necessary<00:04:02.329> that's<00:04:02.780> just<00:04:02.870> me<00:04:03.019> though<00:04:03.049> and<00:04:03.549> then

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
necessary that's just me though and then

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.069 
necessary that's just me though and then
for<00:04:04.940> frizzy<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.389> three<00:04:05.510> prism<00:04:05.780> because<00:04:05.959> once

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
for frizzy and three prism because once

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.750 
for frizzy and three prism because once
you<00:04:06.139> get<00:04:06.260> one<00:04:06.290> of<00:04:06.470> these<00:04:06.530> in<00:04:06.709> play<00:04:06.889> really<00:04:07.130> you

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
you get one of these in play really you

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.280 
you get one of these in play really you
cannot<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.389> move<00:04:08.630> it<00:04:08.720> around<00:04:08.810> whoever's

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
cannot just move it around whoever's

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.190 
cannot just move it around whoever's
poisoned<00:04:09.769> so<00:04:10.519> I<00:04:10.549> mean<00:04:10.790> it's<00:04:11.329> pretty<00:04:11.630> good<00:04:11.870> I

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
poisoned so I mean it's pretty good I

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.110 
poisoned so I mean it's pretty good I
mean<00:04:12.739> you<00:04:13.310> have<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:13.549> play<00:04:13.669> if<00:04:13.790> your<00:04:13.910> employer

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
mean you have to play if your employer

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.029 
mean you have to play if your employer
is<00:04:14.299> ian<00:04:14.480> i<00:04:14.599> might<00:04:14.930> cut<00:04:15.079> this<00:04:15.139> out<00:04:15.260> into<00:04:15.560> because

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
is ian i might cut this out into because

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.370 
is ian i might cut this out into because
i<00:04:16.220> just<00:04:16.370> want<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.609> prize<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:17.150> my<00:04:17.870> Luck's<00:04:18.079> i<00:04:18.229> will

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
i just want a prize to my Luck's i will

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.770 
i just want a prize to my Luck's i will
so<00:04:18.680> I<00:04:18.919> just<00:04:19.370> putting<00:04:19.789> three<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.269> chance<00:04:20.630> of

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
so I just putting three so the chance of

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.930 
so I just putting three so the chance of
that<00:04:20.870> it'll<00:04:21.109> pretty<00:04:21.289> low<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:22.490> yeah<00:04:22.580> that's<00:04:22.849> the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
that it'll pretty low so yeah that's the

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.060 
that it'll pretty low so yeah that's the
deck<00:04:23.180> time<00:04:23.690> what<00:04:23.780> you<00:04:23.870> think<00:04:24.110> if<00:04:24.469> I<00:04:24.620> should<00:04:24.979> I

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
deck time what you think if I should I

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.780 
deck time what you think if I should I
was<00:04:25.190> going<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.400> show<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:25.550> with

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
was going to show you with

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.790 
was going to show you with
with<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.420> proxy<00:04:27.080> why<00:04:27.230> didn't<00:04:27.440> have<00:04:27.590> it<00:04:27.710> with

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
with the proxy why didn't have it with

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.710 
with the proxy why didn't have it with
me<00:04:27.980> I<00:04:28.190> realize<00:04:28.610> both<00:04:28.760> my<00:04:28.910> friend<00:04:29.090> my<00:04:29.240> friend<00:04:29.480> is

me I realize both my friend my friend is
two<00:04:29.840> of<00:04:29.930> them<00:04:30.080> so<00:04:30.950> because<00:04:31.880> he<00:04:31.910> has<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.060> dex

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
two of them so because he has to dex

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.320 
two of them so because he has to dex
