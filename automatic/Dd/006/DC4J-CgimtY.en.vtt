what's new about the new on 2010 ACR

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.950 
what's new about the new on 2010 ACR
there's<00:01:35.909> some<00:01:36.060> subtle<00:01:36.360> tweaks<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:36.780> they're

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
there's some subtle tweaks but they're

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.810 
there's some subtle tweaks but they're
all<00:01:37.079> significant<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.610> saw<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
all significant if you saw the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.280 
all significant if you saw the
Nurburgring<00:01:39.299> video<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.049> we

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
Nurburgring video you can see that we

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140 
Nurburgring video you can see that we
struggled<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:40.799> fifth<00:01:41.009> gear<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:41.970> went

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
struggled with fifth gear so we went

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.969 
struggled with fifth gear so we went
back<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.630> we've<00:01:42.899> engineered<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.590> new<00:01:43.740> fifth

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
back and we've engineered a new fifth

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.889 
back and we've engineered a new fifth
gear<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.549> from<00:01:44.820> point<00:01:45.060> seven<00:01:45.360> four<00:01:45.570> point

we've<00:01:49.439> also<00:01:49.590> our<00:01:49.979> test<00:01:50.189> drivers<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.579> been

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
we've also our test drivers have been

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.789 
we've also our test drivers have been
talking<00:01:51.000> about<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.360> shifter<00:01:51.930> -<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.500> quite<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
talking about the shifter - for quite a

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.590 
talking about the shifter - for quite a
while<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.070> we've<00:01:53.399> been<00:01:53.490> reduce<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.299> height<00:01:54.450> of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
while so we've been reduce the height of

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.630 
while so we've been reduce the height of
the<00:01:54.689> tip<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.020> all<00:01:55.200> acrs<00:01:55.649> will<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> lower

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the tip on all acrs will get a lower

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.620 
the tip on all acrs will get a lower
shorter<00:01:57.030> shift

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
shorter shift

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.810

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
tuned and a new end plate that's

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.220 
tuned and a new end plate that's
basically<00:02:15.489> about<00:02:15.819> lateral<00:02:16.270> downforce<00:02:17.050> as

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
basically about lateral downforce as

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.260 
basically about lateral downforce as
well<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.340> those<00:02:18.459> little<00:02:18.580> events<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
well so those little events and the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.970 
well so those little events and the
fundamental<00:02:20.140> shape<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.590> helped<00:02:20.800> in

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
fundamental shape of it helped in

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.490 
fundamental shape of it helped in

collectible as possible and these two

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.350 
collectible as possible and these two
cars<00:02:39.010> are<00:02:39.100> examples<00:02:39.550> of<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:39.880> so<00:02:40.209> we're

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
cars are examples of that so we're

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.699 
cars are examples of that so we're
probably<00:02:40.600> going<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.989> now<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.410> we<00:02:41.500> have<00:02:41.620> the
