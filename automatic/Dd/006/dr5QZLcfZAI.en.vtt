will include in this video and i gotta

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.620 
will include in this video and i gotta
say<00:03:30.200> 83<00:03:30.770> head<00:03:30.950> in<00:03:31.130> sounds<00:03:31.580> about<00:03:31.790> right<00:03:31.820> i<00:03:32.360> mean

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
say 83 head in sounds about right i mean

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.540 
say 83 head in sounds about right i mean
as<00:03:32.990> you<00:03:33.110> saw<00:03:33.260> there<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.680> head<00:03:33.860> of<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.130> power

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
as you saw there the head of the power

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.420 
as you saw there the head of the power
he<00:03:34.760> put<00:03:34.910> behind<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.330> was<00:03:35.510> incredible<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.320> so

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
he put behind that was incredible and so

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.690 
he put behind that was incredible and so
he<00:03:37.430> can<00:03:37.760> score<00:03:38.600> them<00:03:38.870> in<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.709> air<00:03:39.860> I<00:03:40.130> mean<00:03:40.519> I

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
he can score them in the air I mean I

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.340 
he can score them in the air I mean I
know<00:03:40.760> headers<00:03:41.360> are<00:03:41.510> overpowered<00:03:42.080> in<00:03:42.170> this

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
know headers are overpowered in this

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.120 
know headers are overpowered in this
game<00:03:43.150> which<00:03:44.150> probably<00:03:44.690> plays<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.140> big<00:03:45.620> big<00:03:45.830> part

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
game which probably plays a big big part

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.370 
game which probably plays a big big part

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
weak foot his medium medium worker it

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.599 
weak foot his medium medium worker it
means<00:04:14.299> he's<00:04:14.510> out<00:04:14.660> of<00:04:14.690> position<00:04:15.019> a<00:04:15.380> lot<00:04:15.680> which

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
means he's out of position a lot which

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.490 
means he's out of position a lot which
kind<00:04:16.850> of<00:04:17.000> got<00:04:17.120> frustrated<00:04:17.810> at<00:04:17.930> times<00:04:17.959> but<00:04:18.440> I

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
kind of got frustrated at times but I

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.219 
kind of got frustrated at times but I
could<00:04:18.890> work<00:04:19.160> around<00:04:19.430> it<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:20.510> his<00:04:20.690> passing<00:04:21.140> is

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
could work around it and his passing is

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.990 
could work around it and his passing is
a<00:04:21.290> bit<00:04:21.470> off<00:04:21.620> but<00:04:21.799> like<00:04:21.950> I<00:04:22.070> said<00:04:22.130> I<00:04:22.370> really<00:04:22.669> don't

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
a bit off but like I said I really don't

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.300 
a bit off but like I said I really don't
look<00:04:23.450> for<00:04:23.510> passing<00:04:24.260> in<00:04:24.440> a<00:04:24.590> strike<00:04:24.919> girl<00:04:25.160> I'm

him<00:04:39.320> for<00:04:39.440> about<00:04:39.590> seven<00:04:39.950> hundred<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:40.220> twenty

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
him for about seven hundred and twenty

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.270 
him for about seven hundred and twenty
thousand<00:04:40.940> coins<00:04:41.560> which<00:04:42.560> is<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:42.740> lot<00:04:42.979> more<00:04:43.010> than

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280
