00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.160
 like the two lucas in a new video and 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.200
 good guys today we're going to do it 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.380
 How to download the launcher 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.910
 apocalypse mastretta for the version 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.609
 1.6 point 4 with all updated modes 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.080
 at a certain date that we can say 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.720
 now because the name agreed but 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.050
 good what we mainly have to 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.940
 to do quickly is to install it myself 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.940
 you beat it quickly because 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.879
 because I had already installed it but 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.930
 well you guys if you will 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.530
 have to download that I'm going to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.300
 leave the link is this that is as if 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.739
 out an apocalypse launcher migras 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.769
 3 obviously because what we are 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.479
 teaching and good they quickly achieved 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:03.590
 what we have to do is download 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:07.610
 this and open it when you open it and it will give you 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.260
 an installation progress to me gives me 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.360
 failures I do not know if I'm going to give failures now 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.950
 but good to you you will not have to 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.940
 I fail because I think that because I already 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.460
 no forge and good always always 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.940
 whenever you are going to install this 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.979
 we leave have they do not have to have another 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.800
 pack or other mod 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.070
 another minecraft point in roaming because 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.410
 if you are not going to give much fault and not that 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.479
 use good guys you when they open 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.110
 this is going to give you to cancel this do not 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.890
 will import and give you to install 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.260
 advance install and good and now we have 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.590
 what to expect obviously although they have their 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.390
 twitter your facebook and youtube of I do not know 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.200
 who will it be but I think it's from 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.900
 creator of the way that is ebro 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.700
 yes 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.850
 good and now what we have to do 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.710
 is to wait for the launcher to open 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.610
 automatically 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.539
 they will appear here a little sign that 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.280
 is going to tell you that the launcher is in 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.980
 boat installs the mod correctly 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.010
 pack because this is a map with all 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.709
 modes that have added wheel rex and 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.160
 vegeta his series of apocalypse ma 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.650
 misfortune 3 came out the 1 and the 2 that those 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.770
 good look for them in the in another channel 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.750
 because here they will not be 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.340
 and now what we have to do is 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.340
 hope this does not do more 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.030
 if I'm going to make a small cut and water 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.500
 these guys have skipped the classic 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.390
 lounge in the mumbat was installed 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.299
 correctly and good now what I have 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.299
 what to do to accept and we open this 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.530
 here and all the molds that 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.890
 what can they do in this window 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.780
 where it says edit mode is add or 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.859
 deactivate or say activate or deactivate 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.739
 mod 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.200
 I deactivated it I came here and here we go to 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.689
 see a folder where the mode has been 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.879
 deactivated now that we have to do 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.150
 is to turn it on because I do not want to and 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:14.150
 is that you have all the modes because you see 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.549
 these in all this now that we give 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.829
 remain are you say minecraft here they have 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.069
 the credits they sell is the engine of 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.829
 see and here you have to give where it says 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.930
 a launcher will forget there or phoenix and 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.420
 they have the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.540
 and there come even another way 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.359
 rather than the truth that made the robot or 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.870
 very good and here forgive that they have the 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:40.459
 launcher keiner phoenix and dark lvp that 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.040
 are three lounge is that the truth that 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.079
 I'm very good we give to where it says 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.569
 no premium will load the launcher 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.480
 I like the vision of the phoenix 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:54.290
 to load and you will open this window 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.689
 it's going to take a while because they're going 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.720
 to have that window all mind 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:01.720
 totally update and 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.860
 and how is the launcher starting 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.140
 start it a pack so the pack of 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.700
 mont and good now what they have to 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.700
 to do is give it a name 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:22.320
 enter today to connect and quality us 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.850
 where it says start game play do and 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.610
 now you have to wait for this window 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.340
 It takes a long time to load 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.000
 totally until the rain cut the 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.920
 video 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.050
 I have to return him to load up 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.940
 here but then it will take a while like this 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.120
 I come here 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.790
 well we continue where we left it and this 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:48.030
 the truth that took 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:50.500
 about three minutes as good as 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.690
 We hope this ends I'm going to 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.850
 say that I'm going to want you to tell me in 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.760
 the comments if you do not tell me not 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.940
 matter but good that if they want 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.340
 start a series of classrooms the truth that 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.020
 I will not care about anything but I'm going to 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.380
 be a little bit new in what you do 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.880
 I'm downloading it 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.930
 spoiler I know but good 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.810
 the house 61% and I have 19 hours left 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.100
 lie because it 's because it has a lot 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:24.820
 little fits 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:27.290
 40 and if I took out the loaded of this 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:33.350
 I close the 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:35.540
 qantas already and all that goes 400 plus 600 to 15 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.580
 10 hours but it 's a good lie and now 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.460
 what we have to do automatically 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.790
 is when we finish this we are and everything already 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:48.940
 is about to end they are going to close and 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:52.730
 is going to open the back directly and 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.790
 well here tomÃ¡s there is nothing much more 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.810
 to tell you because I'm already 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:03.620
 over here they're going to say a word 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:05.540
 I say a sentence of letters that goes 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.080
 to say that the launcher is already cast 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.740
 automatically and that can that when 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.020
 and the window can be closed and that 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.690
 they will open the white this window 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.960
 Excuse me, it's not going to close alone but 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:24.229
 first for the one to open 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.000
 well I'm going to leave them like this is just one 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:29.230
 Once the game starts 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.230
 you can close the window 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.280
 I have a fault that gives me error 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.280
 but to you 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.569
 I 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.169
 Thank you 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.169
 and good bye
