00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.680
 hello my name is vladimir jetta you 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.900
 see the test you are back in 2000 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.940
 company sharp released the first in the world 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.010
 cell phone equipped with digital 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.020
 camera from now on mobile 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.330
 manufacturers entered the real race 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.550
 armaments increased matrix sizes 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.289
 the number of megapixels grew quite recently 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.080
 i told you about nokia phone 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.270
 lumia 1020 which possesses as much as 40 1 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.670
 megapixel camera and today i have 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.949
 in the hands of an unusual thing on one side 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.050
 it's a good digital cameras and with the 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.600
 another android smartphone name for this 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.579
 samsung galaxy s4 zoom 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.860
 phone after all I will call him that 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.870
 comes already familiar to us with boxes 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.300
 wooden print made from thick 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.739
 the map is already in size of this box 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.649
 we can guess what's inside 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.450
 something unusual standard equipment 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.309
 Is that for this model samsung 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.590
 Includes a special rag 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.200
 for cleaning lenses everything else 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.000
 Standard earphone cable charger and 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.729
 additional both shury for headset 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.219
 time to pay attention to the smartphone itself in 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.110
 palm s4 zoom is uncomfortable despite 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.960
 the fact that the screen diagonal is smaller 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.090
 than s4 to use it with one hand 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.040
 heavily hampered by a massive camera module 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.990
 strongly protruding from the body 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.700
 more or less than its balance 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.040
 battery which is located in 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.869
 bottom of the smartphone when viewed 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.000
 seen from the side, characteristic of 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.640
 soap hollow which helps 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.710
 hold the camera securely in your hand however 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.659
 use the camera with one hand yet 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.939
 not convenient because when we take 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.740
 the apparatus like this our finger falls on 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.520
 touchscreen and touches some of the elements 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.680
 of management 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.170
 perhaps comfortable using the camera 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.850
 can only in this position undoubted 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.299
 The advantage is the presence of physical 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.950
 two-way shutter button 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.970
 a few words about the appearance from above 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.979
 there is a connector for 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.950
 headphone or headset microphone 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.630
 noise reduction and infrared port on the left 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.090
 special tripod mount 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.460
 dust cover slot for 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.040
 micro sd card and lace hole 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.450
 like on ordinary digital soap dishes on 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.239
 right side see the power button 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.170
 turn off the volume rocker and button 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.840
 shutter release 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.200
 below port microusb and also a stub 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.940
 battery compartment and sim card on 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.920
 rear of the smartphone 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.410
 the massive xenon camera module itself 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.600
 flash autofocus and speaker 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.300
 The case with this phone is that the speaker 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.950
 located behind is not a fault 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.020
 the massive camera module protects it from 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.480
 random finger closures or 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.340
 anything else of course in s4 zoom in 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.920
 first attention attracts itself 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.900
 camera if front-facing 1 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.910
 a full nine tenth megapixel will 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.860
 I need the frequency of the main you 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.990
 probably want to use much 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.120
 more often do it the truth in my opinion 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.980
 uncomfortable picture quality compared to 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.990
 that gives out cameras of other devices 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.000
 great machine can choose 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.220
 correct exposure stabilization 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.680
 pictures work well color sensor 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.390
 Transmits correctly night shooting succeeds 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.670
 phone not bad but with an increase 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.800
 snapshots become clearly visible 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.960
 shumodava work the problem is that 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.870
 camera sensor amount got from it 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.240
 older brother galaxy camera improvement in 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.130
 technical plan did not happen maybe 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.230
 if you 4 zoom was set 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.300
 more advanced quality matrix 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.070
 pictures could be improved significantly 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.410
 however this did not happen 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.330
 the sensor has a matrix capable 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.220
 issue pictures at a resolution of 16 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.100
 megapixels at the time of recording this 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.630
 video review samsung galaxy s4 zoom 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.270
 the world's only smartphone with 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.700
 tenfold lens boiling system 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.739
 lenses from samsung provides optical 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.110
 image stabilization necessary 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.250
 for example at maximum approximation 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.900
 teeth can be used as with 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.880
 onscreen buttons here we are getting close 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.040
 Now we are going back and with the help 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.019
 mechanical ring which is located 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.060
 behind a really unpleasant discovery 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.760
 for me it was something that quickly run 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.989
 the camera here is impossible you have to first 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.970
 unlock screen 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.110
 in the usual way and then there are two 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:14.430
 option either label or swivel 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.430
 ring select mode and go ahead 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.040
 It is very strange that the camera background 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.540
 more in this and provided for this 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.240
 simple but useful stuff 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.240
 smartphone stuffing modest two cores 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.190
 sony exynos 4212 processor produces 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.950
 one and a half gigahertz each graphic 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.840
 processes the mali 400 mp4 chip 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.750
 the amount of RAM and a half

 gigabyte storage capacity 8 gigabytes of 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.950
 which the user is available only 5 to 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.080
 Fortunately, the amount of constant memory can be 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.640
 expand with micro sd cards 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.460
 screen diagonal power tourism 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.560
 is 4.3 inches we are already so 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.630
 samsungov accustomed to skim a giant that 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.810
 This is basically a comfortable diagonal 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.150
 perceived as something small super 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.460
 mallet matrix has a resolution of 960 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.380
 at 540 which of course is not the best 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.080
 the result does not even reach 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.390
 values and jack which today is already 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.820
 going back past full hd 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.890
 resolution at an angle of color a little 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.780
 tarnish but in the normal position 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.640
 The screen picture is good 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.680
 on closer look you can 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.550
 notice tiny steps when drawing 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.770
 fonts 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.150
 icons, but they are so small that it is unlikely 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.350
 will prevent you from being daily 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.840
 using the phone 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.570
 by the way as a phone s4 zoom 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.850
 weak not quite clear what's what 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.240
 attached the camera to the phone or all the same 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.180
 phone camera in principle s4 zoom nothing 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.350
 no different from the average 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.050
 Android-smartphone here is all the same 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.610
 that and everywhere Wi-Fi and bluetooth can 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.300
 go online share your 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.550
 snapshots 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.260
 well, naturally listen to music in 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.210
 the average such a photo phone costs about 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.370
 15 and a half thousand rubles 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.410
 definitely this device for narrow 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.669
 consumer circle perhaps the same 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.500
 mega 6.3 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.390
 a review of which you could see recently 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.930
 on our consumer channel will 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.210
 more 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.460
 however, this device will have them 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.590
 as in the case of a book you must 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.360
 you need to hold the device in your hands before 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.520
 than to buy it otherwise you risk 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.260
 face some difficulties when 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.390
 using this smartphone every 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.360
 day anyway the choice is yours 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.410
