00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.700
 jordi gamer 072 bringing you a video 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.560
 this clarifying doubts well let's see 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.930
 some have been asking me 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.060
 when the 0.11 of má in field that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.250
 says if we are going to see this is at fas 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.829
 0.11 remember that they started I think that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.370
 since January to work in it 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.440
 of January then this how much is late 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.079
 in a version how long they take 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.149
 altogether four months maximum five or 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.000
 five or six months can no longer be 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.440
 take five months maximum should work 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.979
 in a version of minecraft that of 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.689
 edit and we will calculate the date or 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.820
 let's do our little theories 

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:59.130
 we'll see 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.130
 I got hortal tapan here from minecraft 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.170
 ya or from minecraft wiki 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.910
 and says that the skins are already 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.140
 implemented that we had already talked about 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:13.020
 in a video from before and the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.970
 alexis skin was 3 pixels and 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.920
 here in the description I'm going to leave you 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.220
 this page so you can go through and see everything 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.170
 what is not confirmed 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.479
 we talk about the death messages of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.520
 player implemented to the game this 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.560
 means messages will appear in the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.240
 chat when you are dead and it will tell you the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.930
 cause of your death either by mold or 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.340
 fall block etc etc and pepsi 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.869
 well here is fishing this is already 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.750
 confirmed that the fishing I had already 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.970
 spoken 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.450
 one of the boats we will see what the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.190
 Boats says boats exclusive versions and 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.680
 if you can mount two entities at 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.720
 very good time here they leave it in 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.280
 the description this page to see all 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.090
 what is confirmed says spider of 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.270
 cave or is it bat team but let's go 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.760
 to see here says that this version could 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.150
 go out 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.890
 March or April and what to say that could 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.740
 leave in this month because we are already in 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.720
 March could leave at the end of March 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.460
 for example today we are think that three 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.490
 I do not know 4 to 4 March and the 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.520
 Build the build not the official one 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.440
 leave will one of the 0.11 this month 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.700
 but I have another bad news told us no 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.270
 tweeted our friends show and cervantes 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.430
 that I had already told you about him that is the 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.280
 administrator of the errors said that in 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.380
 this week there will not be news anymore 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.020
 they are not going to increase anything else to maika 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.970
 because editing is only going to fix 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.600
 these little books that here that have 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.930
 aggregate 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.730
 for example the skins already added them 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.430
 but they may have bugs that are 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.050
 arranging the votes will have books and they are 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.420
 those who are arranging now no longer 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.180
 they will add nothing else we will not have 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.330
 more news but everything is already there 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.040
 implemented that is all that is here 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.190
 it was only more in field than editing 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.030
 except these until it appears 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.030
 let me read 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.090
 but intermittent but m 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.320
 says network block ton I had already had them 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.210
 talked about that but it's not going to 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.790
 increase but it takes its said that 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.340
 it was a mistake to have put that 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.320
 rectum block was a was a small 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.770
 error that he had that is not going to 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.010
 have block network I'm once tell you 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.180
 this is all already implemented in 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.940
 the game no more I tell you that they are 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.820
 arranging books or if or if they want 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.500
 they can put something else but I do not think so 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.050
 already in this month should be removed because 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.030
 I think it's already four months of January 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:50.120
 february march april not april I think that 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.620
 they're going to take it out in my theory in April they're going 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.709
 to get this version 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.680
 or at the end of March I would say that for 1 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.930
 April 2 April 4 April April 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.659
 but maximum that until the end of April 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.220
 take it out that would already be exaggerating the 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:09.360
 we can wait in this month or at 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.390
 next in April to 5 or 10 yo 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.629
 tell them that they take it on 5 or 10 of 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.709
 April the built but the official one is like this 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.750
 It is done 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.299
 I think that ending up open because 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.880
 first they have to fix books of 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.010
 the 0.11 but the bourgeois we want 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.160
 see you already have that is new to 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.389
 they have to increased it has 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.580
 increased good that has 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.169
 increased this thing all that is 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.479
 question we do not want to knit anymore 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.979
 trips to see what they have or yes but 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.410
 wait, they're still fixing 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.960
 some buses are going to draw in total I think 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.960
 that 10 buils or I do not know according to the books that 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.970
 have but the good day this week not 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.300
 there's going to be news because I think it's 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.590
 they went to san diego these these friends is 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.760
 what I've seen that they've tweeted that 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.760
 They are in San Diego and they are doing 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.220
 some things I do not know 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.710
 and up to here nothing are small theories 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.240
 mine and remember that you can let your 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.400
 theories down here in the description of 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.830
 when you think I get the 0.10 point 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.280
 zero remember that when this version 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.590
 come out I'll leave it to you or we 'll do it rebién a 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.440
 the 0.11 point zero 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.800

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.360
 channel and this when I leave I'm going to 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.030
