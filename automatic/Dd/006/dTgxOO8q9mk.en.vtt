00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
possible so next we're going to do our

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.550 
possible so next we're going to do our
liner<00:03:42.460> I'm<00:03:43.240> gonna<00:03:43.480> be<00:03:43.600> using<00:03:43.780> my<00:03:44.020> Wet<00:03:44.440> n<00:03:44.470> Wild

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
liner I'm gonna be using my Wet n Wild

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.860 
liner I'm gonna be using my Wet n Wild
mega<00:03:44.950> liner<00:03:45.460> and<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.240> just<00:03:46.600> one<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.750> my

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
mega liner and this is just one of my

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.240 
mega liner and this is just one of my
favorites<00:03:47.260> because<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.710> has<00:03:47.830> a<00:03:47.860> brush

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
favorites because it has a brush

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.510 
favorites because it has a brush
applicator<00:03:48.490> and<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:49.780> find<00:03:50.020> it<00:03:50.140> easier<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:51.010> wing

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
applicator and I find it easier to wing

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.340 
applicator and I find it easier to wing
it<00:03:51.640> out<00:03:51.730> with<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.000> brush<00:03:52.240> so<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.020> is<00:03:53.140> what<00:03:53.260> the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
it out with a brush so this is what the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.380 
it out with a brush so this is what the
applicator<00:03:53.770> looks<00:03:54.010> like<00:03:55.770> really<00:03:56.770> thin<00:03:57.070> brush

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
applicator looks like really thin brush

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.330 
applicator looks like really thin brush
but<00:03:58.390> you<00:03:58.450> can<00:03:58.660> use<00:03:58.780> any<00:03:59.020> black<00:03:59.920> liquid<00:04:00.190> liner

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340
