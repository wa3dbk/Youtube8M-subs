00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
and I know everyone says exercise is the

and I know everyone says exercise is the
best<00:02:42.750> thing<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:43.349> but<00:02:44.069> honestly<00:02:45.409> it<00:02:46.409> was

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
best thing to do but honestly it was

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.160

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
more than I normally do I think maybe

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.460 
more than I normally do I think maybe
it's<00:02:55.200> from<00:02:55.409> stress<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.040> everything<00:02:56.370> cuz<00:02:59.000> um

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
it's from stress and everything cuz um

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.619 
it's from stress and everything cuz um
yeah<00:03:01.470> just<00:03:01.829> I<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.340> think<00:03:02.639> it's<00:03:02.760> stress<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.209> I

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
yeah just I just think it's stress and I

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.309 
yeah just I just think it's stress and I
don't<00:03:03.930> know<00:03:04.049> other<00:03:04.319> stuff<00:03:04.590> factoring<00:03:05.250> but<00:03:06.060> um
