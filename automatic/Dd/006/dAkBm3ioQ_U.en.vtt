of<00:00:16.090> course<00:00:16.299> and<00:00:16.720> we<00:00:17.259> kind<00:00:17.470> of<00:00:17.529> develop<00:00:17.920> the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
of course and we kind of develop the

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.480 
of course and we kind of develop the
fact<00:00:18.279> that<00:00:18.369> I<00:00:18.520> was<00:00:18.759> being<00:00:19.060> looked<00:00:19.270> yesterday

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
fact that I was being looked yesterday

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.359 
fact that I was being looked yesterday
but<00:00:21.490> I<00:00:22.320> mean<00:00:23.320> I<00:00:23.410> applied<00:00:23.649> for<00:00:23.680> the<00:00:24.009> first<00:00:24.220> time

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
but I mean I applied for the first time

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.970 
but I mean I applied for the first time
kalkan<00:00:25.000> in<00:00:25.540> at<00:00:25.989> least<00:00:26.169> in<00:00:26.380> the<00:00:26.439> wrong<00:00:26.619> beam<00:00:26.800> of

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
kalkan in at least in the wrong beam of

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.710 
kalkan in at least in the wrong beam of
course<00:00:27.220> and<00:00:27.369> I<00:00:27.430> see<00:00:27.489> it<00:00:27.820> it's<00:00:28.210> a<00:00:28.329> different

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
course and I see it it's a different

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.350 
course and I see it it's a different
story<00:00:28.809> but<00:00:29.230> in<00:00:30.040> a<00:00:30.160> long<00:00:30.669> game<00:00:30.880> it<00:00:31.059> was<00:00:31.239> the

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
story but in a long game it was the

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.340 
story but in a long game it was the
first<00:00:31.540> time<00:00:31.779> and<00:00:33.450> well<00:00:34.450> I<00:00:34.480> said<00:00:34.809> I<00:00:34.930> could<00:00:35.230> ask

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
first time and well I said I could ask

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.020 
first time and well I said I could ask
quite<00:00:35.590> easily<00:00:35.800> i<00:00:36.040> even<00:00:36.460> offered<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.760> draw

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
quite easily i even offered the draw

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.689 
quite easily i even offered the draw
yeah<00:00:37.390> quite<00:00:38.380> soon<00:00:38.680> because<00:00:39.070> i<00:00:39.190> thought<00:00:39.370> my

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
yeah quite soon because i thought my

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.599 
yeah quite soon because i thought my
position<00:00:40.120> was<00:00:40.300> really<00:00:40.570> safe<00:00:40.809> but<00:00:41.710> then<00:00:41.949> i

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
position was really safe but then i

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.410 
position was really safe but then i
don't<00:00:43.120> know<00:00:43.329> i<00:00:43.420> started<00:00:43.780> preparing<00:00:44.079> a<00:00:44.530> great

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
don't know i started preparing a great

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.540 
don't know i started preparing a great
already<00:00:46.420> some<00:00:46.839> moves<00:00:47.170> that<00:00:47.499> I<00:00:47.829> found<00:00:48.070> logical

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
already some moves that I found logical

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.149 
already some moves that I found logical
i<00:00:48.579> was<00:00:48.850> about<00:00:49.469> I've<00:00:50.469> quite<00:00:50.859> in<00:00:51.429> a<00:00:51.609> crate<00:00:51.909> and

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
i was about I've quite in a crate and

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.770 
i was about I've quite in a crate and
then<00:00:54.159> I<00:00:54.190> was<00:00:54.670> right<00:00:55.089> worse<00:00:55.499> and<00:00:56.499> of<00:00:57.489> course

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
then I was right worse and of course

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.869 
then I was right worse and of course
things<00:00:58.780> went<00:00:59.019> down<00:00:59.379> here<00:00:59.589> when<00:00:59.769> I<00:00:59.800> started<00:01:00.730> to

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
things went down here when I started to

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.779 
things went down here when I started to
panic<00:01:00.909> and<00:01:01.480> enter<00:01:02.379> that<00:01:02.559> in<00:01:02.710> game<00:01:02.920> which<00:01:03.219> was<00:01:03.429> a

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
panic and enter that in game which was a

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.860 
panic and enter that in game which was a
coupon<00:01:04.659> done<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.229> then<00:01:05.409> a<00:01:05.650> change<00:01:06.159> done<00:01:06.870> i'm

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
coupon done and then a change done i'm

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.649 
coupon done and then a change done i'm
at<00:01:08.020> fortunately<00:01:08.620> I<00:01:08.680> had<00:01:08.830> some<00:01:09.729> little<00:01:10.300> chances

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
at fortunately I had some little chances

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.560 
at fortunately I had some little chances
for<00:01:10.840> condo<00:01:11.080> price<00:01:11.290> on<00:01:11.500> little<00:01:12.190> chances<00:01:12.670> but

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
for condo price on little chances but

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.130 
for condo price on little chances but
normally<00:01:14.020> she<00:01:15.180> cannot<00:01:16.180> go<00:01:16.450> into<00:01:16.630> more<00:01:16.930> than

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
normally she cannot go into more than

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.680 
normally she cannot go into more than
usual<00:01:17.410> but<00:01:17.530> give<00:01:17.860> some<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:18.880> don't<00:01:19.270> know<00:01:19.330> twenty

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
usual but give some I don't know twenty

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.500 
usual but give some I don't know twenty
percent<00:01:19.900> chance<00:01:20.260> of<00:01:20.560> achieving<00:01:20.800> a<00:01:21.130> draw<00:01:21.340> and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
percent chance of achieving a draw and

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.690 
percent chance of achieving a draw and
then<00:01:22.510> some<00:01:23.110> miracle<00:01:23.590> happened<00:01:23.980> and<00:01:24.250> my

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
then some miracle happened and my

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.430 
then some miracle happened and my
opponent<00:01:25.150> overlooked<00:01:25.630> something<00:01:25.870> and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
opponent overlooked something and

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.240 
opponent overlooked something and
suddenly<00:01:27.160> I<00:01:27.460> was<00:01:27.610> winning<00:01:28.290> yeah<00:01:29.290> this<00:01:29.500> is<00:01:29.680> g4

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
suddenly I was winning yeah this is g4

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.280 
suddenly I was winning yeah this is g4
idea<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:30.790> you<00:01:30.910> see<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.180> already<00:01:31.870> advanced

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
idea that you see the already advanced

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.410 
idea that you see the already advanced
or<00:01:32.470> away<00:01:32.620> or<00:01:32.920> just<00:01:33.190> putting<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.000> ponds<00:01:34.270> and

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
or away or just putting the ponds and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.840 
or away or just putting the ponds and
hoping<00:01:34.570> for<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.840> best<00:01:35.040> well<00:01:36.040> i<00:01:36.070> know<00:01:36.400> i<00:01:36.640> had

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
hoping for the best well i know i had

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.750 
hoping for the best well i know i had
seen<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:38.500> point<00:01:38.830> I<00:01:39.040> was<00:01:39.160> always<00:01:39.340> there's<00:01:39.640> no

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
seen this point I was always there's no

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.360 
seen this point I was always there's no
point<00:01:40.000> in<00:01:40.180> trying<00:01:40.630> on<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:41.170> great<00:01:41.560> because<00:01:41.890> I've

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
point in trying on a great because I've

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.310 
point in trying on a great because I've
shaking<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:43.030> too<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.390> maybe<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.870> first<00:01:44.080> idea

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
shaking it too is maybe the first idea

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.760 
shaking it too is maybe the first idea
that<00:01:44.500> comes<00:01:44.650> to<00:01:44.980> your<00:01:45.040> mind<00:01:45.660> to<00:01:46.660> I<00:01:47.050> mean<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.590> get

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
that comes to your mind to I mean to get

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.450 
that comes to your mind to I mean to get
to<00:01:48.370> really<00:01:48.880> solid<00:01:49.330> but<00:01:49.860> then<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:51.010> course<00:01:51.250> if

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
to really solid but then of course if

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.340 
to really solid but then of course if
you<00:01:51.580> see<00:01:51.760> Jay<00:01:51.940> for<00:01:51.970> you<00:01:52.330> see<00:01:52.570> that<00:01:52.750> white<00:01:53.020> us<00:01:53.200> to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
you see Jay for you see that white us to

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.800 
you see Jay for you see that white us to
be<00:01:53.470> more<00:01:53.590> careful<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:55.360> all<00:01:55.510> idea<00:01:55.780> of

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
be more careful and then all idea of

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.630 
be more careful and then all idea of
space<00:01:56.080> in<00:01:56.260> equation<00:01:56.830> because<00:01:57.340> after<00:01:57.610> I

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
space in equation because after I

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.940 
space in equation because after I
presume<00:01:57.940> maybe<00:01:58.540> actually<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.290> draw<00:01:59.500> a<00:01:59.530> line<00:01:59.770> d

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
presume maybe actually to draw a line d

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.340 
presume maybe actually to draw a line d
I<00:02:00.160> don't<00:02:01.000> know<00:02:01.120> but<00:02:01.270> computer<00:02:01.780> gives<00:02:02.050> like

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
I don't know but computer gives like

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.340 
I don't know but computer gives like
pressing<00:02:02.680> 50<00:02:03.520> or<00:02:03.700> 80<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.390> don't<00:02:04.780> remember<00:02:04.960> but

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
pressing 50 or 80 I don't remember but

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.800 
pressing 50 or 80 I don't remember but
it's<00:02:05.800> really<00:02:06.280> difficult<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.880> me<00:02:07.060> but<00:02:07.660> of

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
it's really difficult to me but of

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.109 
it's really difficult to me but of
course<00:02:07.840> before<00:02:08.140> that<00:02:08.500> is<00:02:09.099> a<00:02:09.160> couple<00:02:09.640> as<00:02:09.910> a

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
course before that is a couple as a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
and today what the of course it's a very

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.190 
and today what the of course it's a very
special<00:02:16.310> situation<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.390> only<00:02:17.870> need<00:02:18.170> to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
special situation and you only need to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.449 
special situation and you only need to
draw<00:02:18.500> with<00:02:18.680> white<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.230> played<00:02:21.459> solid

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
draw with white so I played solid

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.229 
draw with white so I played solid
opening<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.260> but<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.290> thought<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:25.239> solid

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
opening and but I thought a solid

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.690 
opening and but I thought a solid
opening<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.750> ok<00:02:27.019> but<00:02:27.230> then<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:27.650> have<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.860> play<00:02:28.459> my

opening is ok but then I have to play my
chest<00:02:29.030> not<00:02:29.660> focus<00:02:30.019> on<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:31.129> wall<00:02:31.459> unless

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
there's an absolutely first wall but

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.809 
there's an absolutely first wall but

really<00:03:09.280> consistently<00:03:10.280> i<00:03:10.400> would<00:03:10.670> say<00:03:11.110> since

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
really consistently i would say since

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.319 
really consistently i would say since
last<00:03:13.040> few<00:03:13.430> months<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.940> especially

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
last few months and especially

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.990 
last few months and especially
Inspectorate<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.889> video<00:03:16.190> campaign<00:03:16.579> is

Inspectorate the video campaign is

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.080 
Inspectorate the video campaign is
ironic<00:03:17.829> so<00:03:18.829> of<00:03:19.280> course<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:19.670> would<00:03:19.790> be<00:03:19.940> very

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
ironic so of course it would be very

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.599 
ironic so of course it would be very
tough<00:03:20.389> much<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:21.160> we'll<00:03:22.160> see<00:03:22.190> what<00:03:22.489> happens

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
tough much and we'll see what happens
