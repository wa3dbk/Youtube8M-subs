 1499 euros in sum in big doctor month 2009 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.449
 not to mention the subject to the effects of the stimulus policy 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.940
 we explain to novelties about this product that self 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.930
 the dolby prologic two 20's which with a thereer source allows you 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.189

 haag of practically 7 points 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.769
 we can not wait for the actors scanning system to go fast, which actually allows 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.690
 with a source of any of any definition to climb in 10 80 p with a 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.329
 the most effective treatment on stair effects knowing the management of 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.080
 details that this couple at the n24 these signs over water ddsc threw 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.440
 that these treatments that do the same thing with the audio we start from a 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.870
 dull lower definition lower accuracy is in the process of becoming 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.580
 stall with superior quality obviously as novelty one to 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.420

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.950
 since this product a little nature label that means we can connect 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.520
 paris ap network attacks 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.690
 the algorithm that locally on the new GUI 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.630
 definition 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200
 of this product really very nice and then 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.030
 right here 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.720
 here are the high definition audio formats 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.130
 this is the trial has for its part video 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.710
 the hdmi the lensois points 3 supporters to carry these high audio formats 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.330
 definition and here we were small audio fragments odyssey the goal 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.010
 to smother the automatic calibration of the product 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.000
 the dynamic volume that you talk about 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.930
 when we do not look to have been modeled yet or change sources 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.899
 mans prototype 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.810
 the odyssey daïna volumes that shows up here with this little subtle lob 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.650
 euros 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.929
 percent of the inhabitants you are not talking about world having constant apolline 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.449
 to switch from one TV channel to another the volume is not stronger 

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:50.210
 all of a sudden 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.460
 you spend daraba dvd player arras for example a fm tuner or at a 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.759
 TV show there too he goes calm and his game went around 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.060
 of the product to present you everything we have here 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.430
 here is the very very complete back side 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.820
 composite input and ideals if you still have video game this is one of 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.329
 rare amplifier to keep this type of crisis 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:12.349
 obviously 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.449
 five inputs hdmi an output 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:17.769
 all this is the fmi returning of course 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.209
 side network connectivity you will spend late the eternal spicy 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.249
 this man is useful 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.809
 you have for everything that is little 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.129
 for its integration you have writing 12 volts 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.939
 obama to bring down a screen or other device shut up 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.359
 you have here 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.239
 did they port for them from one room to another to are france at the 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.869
 network 132 that if you wanted to drive the product the fm tuner in between talked all to 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:43.219
 time 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:44.939
 two optical inputs 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.599
 an optical output here 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.989
 obviously we still have the inputs and outputs 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.810
 this tip that will be there 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.839
 his season the releases per month 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.809
 for all your speakers 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:59.139
 obviously here we do not confront fronde b it means we can put 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.749
 of holy land 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:07.539
 and then we get here entry in e coaxial digital audio and here a 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:09.570
 small catch I very very practical 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.639
 when you turn on your well done up 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.629
 of this crisis the debt fueled that we wanted to win it was no longer going 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.399
 blow you can for example plug in a dvd player it will work that 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.769
 when he walks and suddenly ordered his image and his extinction 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.209
 the name had to 33 10 new bikes found in secure rent for me 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.400
 sign solution point en obviously an attractive price
