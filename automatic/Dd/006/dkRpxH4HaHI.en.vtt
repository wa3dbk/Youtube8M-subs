00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:17.600
 A good climbing for gps of the original people was Rex 30 j finally buy 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.680
 I is fine Tan thought Naa do If you do not buy because it was often the road hesitation 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.890
 But 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:30.740
 I bought it at last because there was a shop that has become quite cheap at Rakuten point recently 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:34.950
 But this is good and Rex, but this 30 j is a Japanese version, isn't it? 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:41.730
 30 good and Rick 30 in the English version 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:43.650
 You can buy it for a price of about 30,000 yen, but the map software inside is a map of Japan 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.310
 Software is hard to use 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:53.520
 Because it means that there is no Japanese notation after 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.090
 Well it's a little expensive but 30 j I thought it would be better if Japanese was good and bought it 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.540
 The 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:03.870
 And this is 30 j but 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:06.670
 It is useless if you do not install the map software, but when you went to Mt. Takano the other day 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.840
 Hey this I'd took 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.979
 You can see this 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:17.689
 I did not write the topographic map contour line either 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:25.620
 There is no station name, only information on the road 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:32.170
 I think I just have entered that Tteyuu called to 100,000 minutes of one of Japan outline map 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.240
 After that you can only use latitude and longitude so you can not use it as it is 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.960
 so 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:44.130
 You can download and edit free map data on the internet etc. 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.409
 Because I thought a little Do not troublesome but is 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.450
 I bought this one 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:55.869
 It is Japan climbing map and the point m + v Tsu 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:01.719
 Often used when climbing that mountain 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:06.380
 This sd card is because it contains data of Yamato Kogen map 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:10.599
 Because it says that it can be used immediately by putting in this garmin 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.599
 Then I want to set up immediately 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.120
 Well then I really want to get started by just plugging in 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.530
 Map data really went in just by inserting the card 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:18.180
 This is really 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:19.030
 But it is better to go It is convenient variety I is cheaper If you've done it yourself 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.139
 Hey 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:32.099
 I think that there is a sense that it would be faster to buy this of a little bit of 10,000 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:34.729
 Since Yarakashi also Well way lost earlier this year Naa go to the mountain with confidence if there is this 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.729
 I think
