of this light which is the one I kind of

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.250 
of this light which is the one I kind of
wish<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.670> had<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> got<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.600> honest<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.049> will

wish I had a got and be honest I will
end<00:01:07.470> up<00:01:07.619> getting<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.630> unit<00:01:09.630> has<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> memory<00:01:10.409> for

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
end up getting it unit has a memory for

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.649 
end up getting it unit has a memory for
for<00:01:10.950> two<00:01:11.130> modes<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.780> comes<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
for two modes but this one comes on and

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:22.700 
for two modes but this one comes on and
they<00:01:15.659> already<00:01:15.960> skipping<00:01:16.409> most<00:01:18.890> come<00:01:19.890> on

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
kind of an aggravating interface but

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.950 
kind of an aggravating interface but
there's<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.680> low<00:01:25.860> setting<00:01:26.570> three<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:27.750> the

there's the low setting three out the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.830 
there's the low setting three out the
front<00:01:28.200> lumens<00:01:28.790> their<00:01:29.790> website<00:01:30.240> reports<00:01:30.720> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
front lumens their website reports that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.790 
front lumens their website reports that
are<00:01:30.990> run<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.320> 3.4<00:01:32.160> days<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:33.420> believe<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
are run for 3.4 days I can believe that

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.230 
are run for 3.4 days I can believe that
like<00:01:34.800> I<00:01:34.830> said<00:01:34.920> same<00:01:35.310> set<00:01:35.550> of<00:01:35.640> batteries<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
like I said same set of batteries and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.980 
like I said same set of batteries and
never<00:01:36.540> change<00:01:36.840> them<00:01:37.640> going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.540> medium

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
never change them going to the medium

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.200 
never change them going to the medium
setting<00:01:40.430> which<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.700> 36<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.960> front<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.920 
setting which is 36 out the front to the
high<00:01:45.450> setting<00:01:46.250> which<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.490> 180<00:01:48.180> out<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> front

high setting which is 180 out the front

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.710 
high setting which is 180 out the front
now<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.310> claims<00:01:50.760> off<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.180> two<00:01:51.330> double-a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
now it claims off of two double-a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.580 
now it claims off of two double-a
batteries<00:01:52.230> 180<00:01:53.070> out<00:01:53.370> the<00:01:53.730> front<00:01:54.000> lumens<00:01:54.590> 1.7
