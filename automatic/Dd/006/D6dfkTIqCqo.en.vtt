00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
on with the acrylic paint I started a

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.630 
on with the acrylic paint I started a
new<00:03:42.040> layer<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.570> added<00:03:43.570> some<00:03:43.959> blues<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.640> some

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
new layer and added some blues and some

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.060 
new layer and added some blues and some
white<00:03:45.880> acrylic<00:03:46.299> paint<00:03:46.450> because<00:03:47.380> I'm<00:03:47.620> using<00:03:47.830> a

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
white acrylic paint because I'm using a

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.699 
white acrylic paint because I'm using a
darker<00:03:48.489> color<00:03:48.730> paper<00:03:49.049> press<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.230> paper<00:03:50.440> in

darker color paper press the paper in

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.490 
darker color paper press the paper in
and<00:03:51.130> then<00:03:51.850> removed<00:03:52.239> it<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.510> just<00:03:53.049> repeated

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
and then removed it and just repeated

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.800 
and then removed it and just repeated
the<00:03:53.530> same<00:03:53.950> steps<00:03:54.340> as<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.610> did<00:03:54.910> on<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.269> last<00:03:55.299> ones

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
the same steps as I did on the last ones

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.229 
the same steps as I did on the last ones
and<00:03:56.140> here's<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.830> result<00:03:57.160> on<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.340> darker<00:03:58.000> color

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
and here's the result on a darker color

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.750 
and here's the result on a darker color
paper<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:59.500> fun<00:03:59.739> thing<00:03:59.920> about<00:03:59.950> this<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:00.549> that

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
paper the fun thing about this is that

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.789 
paper the fun thing about this is that
you<00:04:00.970> can<00:04:01.150> really<00:04:01.269> customize<00:04:01.600> anything<00:04:02.530> you

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
you can really customize anything you

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.920 
you can really customize anything you
don't<00:04:03.040> have<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.280> limit<00:04:03.430> yourself<00:04:03.549> to<00:04:04.000> paper<00:04:04.239> so

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
don't have to limit yourself to paper so

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.199 
don't have to limit yourself to paper so
this<00:04:05.170> next<00:04:05.410> version<00:04:05.830> I<00:04:06.010> tried<00:04:06.400> with<00:04:06.640> acrylic

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
this next version I tried with acrylic

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.210 
this next version I tried with acrylic
and<00:04:07.420> added<00:04:08.410> some<00:04:08.560> different<00:04:08.920> colors

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
and added some different colors

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.940 
and added some different colors
including<00:04:09.489> white<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.420> I<00:04:10.930> tried<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.470> piece<00:04:11.709> of

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
including white and I tried a piece of

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.250 
including white and I tried a piece of
birch<00:04:12.220> wood<00:04:12.640> if<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.329> want<00:04:13.510> to<00:04:13.600> try<00:04:13.810> marbling

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
birch wood if you want to try marbling

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.409 
birch wood if you want to try marbling
some<00:04:14.530> fabric<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.459> could<00:04:15.579> use<00:04:15.760> this<00:04:15.940> method

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
some fabric you could use this method

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.630 
some fabric you could use this method
with<00:04:16.660> fabric<00:04:17.229> paint<00:04:17.260> which<00:04:17.739> acts<00:04:18.010> a<00:04:18.310> lot<00:04:18.579> like

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
with fabric paint which acts a lot like

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.729 
with fabric paint which acts a lot like
acrylic<00:04:19.090> paint<00:04:19.450> so<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:20.200> will<00:04:20.380> look<00:04:20.530> very

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
acrylic paint so it will look very

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.350 
acrylic paint so it will look very
similar<00:04:21.099> to<00:04:21.669> this

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
similar to this

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.510 
similar to this
for<00:04:22.599> this<00:04:22.720> wood<00:04:22.990> piece<00:04:23.169> I<00:04:23.439> wiped<00:04:23.860> off<00:04:24.069> all<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
for this wood piece I wiped off all the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.399 
for this wood piece I wiped off all the
shaving<00:04:24.849> cream<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.300> then<00:04:25.539> let<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.780> dry<00:04:25.870> in<00:04:26.259> the

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
shaving cream and then let it dry in the

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.939 
shaving cream and then let it dry in the
Sun<00:04:26.620> and<00:04:26.800> here's<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.490> result<00:04:27.819> if<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:29.650> notice

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949

Sun and here's the result if you notice
any<00:04:30.159> warping<00:04:30.550> after<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.240> paper<00:04:31.449> has<00:04:31.719> dried

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
any warping after the paper has dried

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.860 
any warping after the paper has dried
you<00:04:32.620> can<00:04:32.650> place<00:04:33.310> them<00:04:33.610> in<00:04:33.849> between<00:04:34.150> stacks<00:04:34.689> of

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
you can place them in between stacks of

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.379 
you can place them in between stacks of
paper<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.439> place<00:04:36.069> heavy<00:04:36.340> weights<00:04:36.729> on<00:04:36.939> top<00:04:37.210> of

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
them to flatten it and I just used

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.850 
them to flatten it and I just used
really<00:04:40.030> heavy<00:04:40.240> books<00:04:40.509> which<00:04:41.110> will<00:04:41.379> do<00:04:41.710> the
