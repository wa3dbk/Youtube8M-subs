00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
mold down to every little detail just a

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.660 
mold down to every little detail just a
different<00:03:26.330> color<00:03:26.920> which<00:03:27.920> makes<00:03:28.190> it<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.490> little

different color which makes it a little
unusual

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
unusual

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.930 
unusual
this<00:03:30.800> was<00:03:31.070> limited<00:03:31.550> to<00:03:31.810> 480<00:03:32.810> pieces<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:34.730> it

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
this was limited to 480 pieces so it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.040 
this was limited to 480 pieces so it
will<00:03:35.150> become<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.990> little<00:03:36.380> harder<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.770> find<00:03:37.030> as

will become a little harder to find as

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.020

time<00:03:39.050> goes<00:03:39.290> on<00:03:40.210> making<00:03:41.210> it<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.630> little<00:03:42.380> bit<00:03:42.590> more

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
time goes on making it a little bit more

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.230 
time goes on making it a little bit more
desirable<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.590> now<00:03:45.590> on<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.550> what<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:46.910> think

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
desirable and now on to what I think

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.390 
desirable and now on to what I think
it's<00:03:47.450> my<00:03:47.920> personal<00:03:48.920> favorite

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400
