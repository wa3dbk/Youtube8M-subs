knowledge with redstone in this video
we'll<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.500> focusing<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> basic<00:00:17.640> functions

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
we'll be focusing on the basic functions

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.880 
we'll be focusing on the basic functions
of<00:00:18.180> all<00:00:18.330> redstone<00:00:18.779> related<00:00:19.170> items<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.800> blocks

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
on state and the off state now you watch

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:44.090 
on state and the off state now you watch

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and
it<00:00:44.580> stops<00:00:44.910> redstone<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:46.140> only<00:00:46.290> be<00:00:46.440> powered

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it stops redstone can only be powered

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.840 
it stops redstone can only be powered
for<00:00:46.860> 15<00:00:47.310> blocks<00:00:47.580> and<00:00:47.880> then<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.210> will<00:00:48.390> stop<00:00:48.530> so

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
for 15 blocks and then it will stop so

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.400 
for 15 blocks and then it will stop so
yeah<00:00:50.850> make<00:00:51.240> sure<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.480> keep<00:00:51.720> out<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.260> can

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
yeah make sure you keep out that you can

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.690 
yeah make sure you keep out that you can
use<00:00:52.620> repeaters<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.190> we're<00:00:53.310> going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.490> get<00:00:53.580> to

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
use repeaters but we're going to get to

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.360 
use repeaters but we're going to get to
that<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.970> different<00:00:54.300> episode<00:00:54.530> also<00:00:55.530> when

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
that in a different episode also when

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.010 
that in a different episode also when
you're<00:00:56.520> placing<00:00:56.700> it<00:00:56.970> when<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> bit<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
you're placing it when it's a bit like a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.690 
you're placing it when it's a bit like a
torch<00:00:58.290> when<00:00:58.470> placing<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.830> block<00:00:59.040> on<00:00:59.070> top<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.550> it

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
torch when placing a block on top of it

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.970 
torch when placing a block on top of it
it<00:01:00.150> appears<00:01:00.480> above<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.380> water

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
it appears above it like that and water

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.579 
it appears above it like that and water
will<00:01:02.190> destroy<00:01:02.670> redstone<00:01:03.540> so<00:01:03.990> you<00:01:04.049> need<00:01:04.409> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
will destroy redstone so you need to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.200 
will destroy redstone so you need to
watch<00:01:04.739> out<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.160> as<00:01:05.340> well<00:01:05.370> now<00:01:05.910> normally

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
watch out for that as well now normally

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.050 
watch out for that as well now normally
redstone<00:01:07.110> parts<00:01:07.860> are<00:01:08.070> either<00:01:08.370> inputs<00:01:08.940> or

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
redstone parts are either inputs or

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.880 
redstone parts are either inputs or
outputs<00:01:09.120> but<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> sake<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> tutorial

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
outputs but for the sake of the tutorial

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.530 
outputs but for the sake of the tutorial
was<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> call<00:01:11.820> them<00:01:12.000> senders<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
was going to call them senders and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.750 
was going to call them senders and
receivers<00:01:12.920> senders<00:01:13.920> send<00:01:14.340> power<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
receivers senders send power and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.030 
receivers senders send power and
receivers<00:01:15.180> receive<00:01:15.570> power<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.050> these<00:01:16.830> are

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
receivers receive power and these are

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.250 
receivers receive power and these are
the<00:01:17.190> sender's<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.690> bussin<00:01:19.080> which

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
the sender's so we have be bussin which

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.780 
the sender's so we have be bussin which
stays<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.770> about<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.040> second<00:01:20.460> after<00:01:20.610> you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
stays on for about a second after you

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.900 
stays on for about a second after you
push<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.500> that<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.740> not<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.070> placed<00:01:23.610> on

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
push it and that can not be placed on

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.370 
push it and that can not be placed on
the<00:01:24.120> top<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.420> box<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.780> these<00:01:24.870> to<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.020> placed<00:01:25.230> on

the top of box and these to be placed on
the<00:01:25.470> side<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.430> lever<00:01:26.670> which<00:01:27.360> toggles<00:01:27.660> on<00:01:27.900> for

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the side the lever which toggles on for

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.290 
the side the lever which toggles on for
how<00:01:29.010> long<00:01:29.190> you<00:01:29.370> leave<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.700> till<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.060> then

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
how long you leave it till and then

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.980 
how long you leave it till and then
toggles<00:01:30.900> back<00:01:31.080> off<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.159> off<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:33.060> off<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.600> off

have<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.950> two<00:01:38.330> pressure<00:01:39.330> plates<00:01:39.570> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
have the two pressure plates you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.300 
have the two pressure plates you
wouldn't<00:01:40.470> participate<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.100> stone

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
wouldn't participate in the stone

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.460 
wouldn't participate in the stone
pressure<00:01:41.550> plate<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.510> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.720> both<00:01:42.900> see<00:01:43.110> they

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
pressure plate now you can both see they

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.390 
pressure plate now you can both see they
have<00:01:43.909> around<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.030> same<00:01:45.300> delay<00:01:46.260> time<00:01:46.560> then

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
have around the same delay time then

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.490 
have around the same delay time then
they<00:01:47.670> work<00:01:47.880> similar<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.720> bus<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.170> except

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
they work similar to the bus and except

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.030 
they work similar to the bus and except
you<00:01:49.650> don't<00:01:49.850> push<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.880> well<00:01:51.390> stand<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.229> but

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
you don't push it well stand on it but

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.030 
you don't push it well stand on it but
you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.729> see<00:01:53.940> something<00:01:54.240> here<00:01:54.710> when<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> put

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
you can see something here when I put

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.310 
you can see something here when I put
blocks<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:57.000> top<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.330> this<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.990> wooden

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
blocks on top of this the wooden

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.620 
blocks on top of this the wooden
pressure<00:01:58.560> plate<00:01:58.860> stays<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.370> but<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.880> stone

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
pressure plate stays on but the stone

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.780 
pressure plate stays on but the stone
pressure<00:02:01.229> plate<00:02:01.470> doesn't<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.430> because

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
pressure plate doesn't and it's because

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.000 
pressure plate doesn't and it's because
stone<00:02:03.479> pressure<00:02:03.720> plate<00:02:03.960> needs<00:02:04.229> an<00:02:04.530> actual

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
stone pressure plate needs an actual

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.430 
stone pressure plate needs an actual
person<00:02:05.250> or<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:06.060> mob<00:02:06.330> such<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> pig<00:02:07.170> or<00:02:07.350> a

person or a mob such as a pig or a
creeper<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.129> stand<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.549> it<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> jack<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.330> be

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
creeper to stand on it for a jack to be

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.449 
creeper to stand on it for a jack to be
powered<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.380> also<00:02:10.590> applies<00:02:10.950> from<00:02:11.220> mine

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
powered this also applies from mine

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.690 
powered this also applies from mine
carts<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.030> and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
carts so and

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.630 
carts so and
d<00:02:12.849> minecart<00:02:13.360> will<00:02:13.739> turn<00:02:14.739> on<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.459> wooden

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
d minecart will turn on the wooden

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.339 
d minecart will turn on the wooden
pressure<00:02:15.879> plate<00:02:16.150> but<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.480> will<00:02:16.599> not<00:02:16.900> turn<00:02:17.140> on

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
pressure plate but it will not turn on

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.140 
pressure plate but it will not turn on
the<00:02:17.830> stone<00:02:18.069> pressure<00:02:18.340> plate<00:02:18.610> if<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.940> had<00:02:19.120> a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
the stone pressure plate if it had a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.759 
the stone pressure plate if it had a
person<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.780> would<00:02:20.110> turn<00:02:20.290> on<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.560> stone

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
person in it would turn on the stone

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.410 
person in it would turn on the stone
pressure<00:02:20.980> plate<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.819> can<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.239> use

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
pressure plate so you can you can use

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.900 
pressure plate so you can you can use
that<00:02:22.629> for<00:02:22.870> like<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:23.500> your<00:02:23.709> cart<00:02:24.370> runs<00:02:24.610> away<00:02:24.849> you

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
that for like if your cart runs away you

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.550 
that for like if your cart runs away you
can<00:02:25.090> make<00:02:25.239> a<00:02:25.269> turn<00:02:25.510> around<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.050> will<00:02:26.200> kill

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
can make a turn around and I will kill

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.160 
can make a turn around and I will kill
you<00:02:26.590> sheep<00:02:27.150> now<00:02:28.150> you've<00:02:28.390> seen<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.720> sender's

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
you sheep now you've seen the sender's

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.680 
you sheep now you've seen the sender's
and<00:02:29.440> these<00:02:29.680> are<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.920> receivers<00:02:30.489> now<00:02:31.030> these

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
and these are the receivers now these

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.589 
and these are the receivers now these
actually<00:02:32.260> when<00:02:32.620> they<00:02:32.800> react<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.550> power<00:02:33.880> so

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
actually when they react to power so

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.960 
actually when they react to power so
when<00:02:35.080> some<00:02:35.410> redstone<00:02:36.040> next<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.700> them<00:02:36.849> is

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
when some redstone next to them is

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.420 
when some redstone next to them is
turned<00:02:37.180> on<00:02:37.300> they<00:02:38.080> do<00:02:38.140> something<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:39.370> to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
turned on they do something and so to

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.100 
turned on they do something and so to
start<00:02:39.730> off<00:02:39.849> with<00:02:40.060> we<00:02:40.269> have<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.660> note<00:02:40.870> block

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
start off with we have the note block

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.080 
start off with we have the note block
which<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.290> recently<00:02:41.950> added<00:02:42.099> in<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.400> 1.2

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
which is recently added in the 1.2

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.780 
which is recently added in the 1.2
update<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.629> when<00:02:44.440> powered<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:45.190> makes<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.640> note

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
update and when powered it makes a note

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.479 
update and when powered it makes a note
and<00:02:46.060> depending<00:02:46.930> on<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.290> block<00:02:47.530> below<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:48.040> it

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
and depending on the block below it it

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.190 
and depending on the block below it it
makes<00:02:48.819> a<00:02:48.970> different<00:02:49.269> type<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.480> note<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.080> if

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
makes a different type of note so if

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.490 
makes a different type of note so if
it's<00:02:50.349> a<00:02:50.470> wooden<00:02:50.769> block<00:02:50.920> below<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:52.329> pig<00:02:53.290> I

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
it's a wooden block below this pig I

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.370 
it's a wooden block below this pig I
will<00:02:53.769> kill<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.069> just<00:02:54.579> like<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.849> sheep<00:02:55.060> if<00:02:55.480> you

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
will kill you just like the sheep if you

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.080 
will kill you just like the sheep if you
have<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.769> different<00:02:56.950> block<00:02:57.220> below<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.700> then<00:02:57.880> it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
have a different block below it then it

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.080 
have a different block below it then it
will<00:02:58.329> make<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> different<00:02:59.170> type<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.319> sound<00:03:00.090> so

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
will make a different type of sound so

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.490 
will make a different type of sound so
you<00:03:01.180> can<00:03:01.299> experiment<00:03:01.540> with<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.989> then<00:03:02.380> we

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
you can experiment with that then we

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.690 
you can experiment with that then we
have<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.340> mine<00:03:04.060> cart<00:03:04.299> tracks<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:04.989> in<00:03:05.890> when

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
have the mine cart tracks and in when

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.520 
have the mine cart tracks and in when
there's<00:03:06.880> like<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.030> t-junction<00:03:07.450> like<00:03:08.019> this<00:03:08.230> and

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
there's like a t-junction like this and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.180 
there's like a t-junction like this and
it<00:03:09.340> powers<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.880> will<00:03:10.120> switch<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.500> can<00:03:11.920> see

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
it powers it will switch so you can see

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.520 
it powers it will switch so you can see
how<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:12.760> flips<00:03:13.269> back<00:03:13.510> because<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.049> power<00:03:14.230> goes

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
how it flips back because the power goes

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.729 
how it flips back because the power goes
back<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.849> null<00:03:16.150> because<00:03:16.630> it's<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.380> button

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
back to to null because it's a button

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.729 
back to to null because it's a button
and<00:03:18.510> then<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.540> dispenser<00:03:20.230> which<00:03:20.380> was<00:03:20.560> also

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
and then the dispenser which was also

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.879 
and then the dispenser which was also
added<00:03:21.100> in<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.250> 1.2<00:03:21.910> update<00:03:21.989> which<00:03:22.989> dispenses

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
added in the 1.2 update which dispenses

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.500 
added in the 1.2 update which dispenses
blocks<00:03:24.160> at<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.430> moment<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:24.700> just<00:03:24.880> have<00:03:25.030> dirt<00:03:25.269> in

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
blocks at the moment I just have dirt in

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.590 
blocks at the moment I just have dirt in
it<00:03:25.600> so<00:03:26.530> every<00:03:27.250> time<00:03:27.459> I<00:03:27.489> click<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.180> button<00:03:28.480> it

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
it so every time I click the button it

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.199 
it so every time I click the button it
dispenses<00:03:29.079> a<00:03:29.139> piece<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.440> dirt<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.150> now<00:03:31.150> we

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
dispenses a piece of dirt and now we

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.569 
dispenses a piece of dirt and now we
have<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.690> two<00:03:31.900> doors<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:33.400> wooden<00:03:34.120> door<00:03:34.299> and

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
have the two doors the wooden door and

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.380 
have the two doors the wooden door and
the<00:03:36.660> prying<00:03:37.660> door

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
the prying door

the Keen people may have noticed that I
haven't<00:04:13.230> actually<00:04:13.440> said<00:04:13.709> anything<00:04:14.040> about<00:04:14.160> the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
haven't actually said anything about the

haven't actually said anything about the
redstone<00:04:14.730> torch<00:04:15.000> yet<00:04:15.239> and<00:04:15.570> that's<00:04:15.780> because

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
redstone torch yet and that's because

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.330 
redstone torch yet and that's because
I've<00:04:16.260> been<00:04:16.290> talking<00:04:16.650> about<00:04:16.709> senders<00:04:17.220> and

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
I've been talking about senders and

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.599 
I've been talking about senders and
receivers<00:04:17.609> it's<00:04:18.239> both<00:04:18.690> in<00:04:19.530> this<00:04:19.769> case<00:04:20.040> it's<00:04:20.400> a

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
receivers it's both in this case it's a

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.550 
receivers it's both in this case it's a
sender<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.570> can<00:04:21.690> see<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.109> its<00:04:22.260> default

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
sender and you can see that its default

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.800 
sender and you can see that its default
state<00:04:22.830> is<00:04:22.980> on<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.430> then<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:23.940> sends<00:04:24.210> power<00:04:24.450> to

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
state is on and then it sends power to

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.290 
state is on and then it sends power to
adjacent<00:04:25.110> blocks<00:04:25.470> like<00:04:25.800> this<00:04:25.880> but<00:04:26.880> here's<00:04:27.240> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
adjacent blocks like this but here's the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.200 
adjacent blocks like this but here's the
case<00:04:27.570> where<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.900> does<00:04:28.110> both<00:04:28.410> this<00:04:29.340> button

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
case where it does both this button

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.200 
case where it does both this button
powers<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.320> redstone<00:04:31.710> which<00:04:32.520> what<00:04:32.820> happens

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
powers this redstone which what happens

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.010 
powers this redstone which what happens
is<00:04:33.390> this<00:04:33.660> reacts<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.980> this<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.580> turns<00:04:36.240> off<00:04:36.540> so

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
is this reacts to this and turns off so

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.140 
is this reacts to this and turns off so
it<00:04:37.110> does<00:04:37.260> react<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:38.250> send<00:04:38.490> us<00:04:38.669> so<00:04:38.880> it's<00:04:39.060> a

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
it does react to send us so it's a

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.480 
it does react to send us so it's a
receiver<00:04:39.510> as<00:04:39.840> well<00:04:40.110> as<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.410> sender<00:04:40.800> for<00:04:40.980> the

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
receiver as well as the sender for the

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.890 
receiver as well as the sender for the
you<00:04:41.700> know<00:04:41.820> we're<00:04:42.090> just<00:04:42.240> using<00:04:42.390> these<00:04:42.600> terms

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
you know we're just using these terms

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.620 
you know we're just using these terms
because<00:04:43.140> it's<00:04:43.260> easier<00:04:43.729> but<00:04:44.729> when<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.030> base<00:04:45.270> or

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
because it's easier but when the base or

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.390 
because it's easier but when the base or
when<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.960> block<00:04:46.169> that<00:04:46.320> it's<00:04:46.470> on<00:04:46.680> is<00:04:46.950> powered

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
when the block that it's on is powered

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.040 
when the block that it's on is powered
like<00:04:47.729> this<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.479> turns<00:04:48.810> off<00:04:50.510> see<00:04:51.510> how<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.870> goes

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
like this it turns off see how it goes

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.860 
like this it turns off see how it goes
off<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.919> then<00:04:53.130> this<00:04:53.490> which<00:04:54.210> was<00:04:54.510> sending

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
off and then this which was sending

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.290 
off and then this which was sending
power<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.200> turns<00:04:55.530> off<00:04:55.770> because<00:04:56.190> whatever<00:04:57.000> it's

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
power to turns off because whatever it's

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.990 
power to turns off because whatever it's
sending<00:04:57.690> is<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.080> state<00:04:58.560> that<00:04:58.590> you<00:04:59.130> know<00:04:59.280> your

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
sending is the state that you know your

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.480 
sending is the state that you know your
torches<00:05:00.390> on<00:05:00.590> thanks<00:05:01.590> for<00:05:01.710> watching<00:05:02.070> hopefully

if you didn't really know in any of the
basics<00:05:06.630> about<00:05:06.750> redstone<00:05:07.380> well<00:05:07.650> hopefully<00:05:07.830> you

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
basics about redstone well hopefully you

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.250 
basics about redstone well hopefully you
do<00:05:08.160> now<00:05:08.370> in<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:09.479> next<00:05:09.630> episode<00:05:10.080> we'll<00:05:10.200> be

do now in the next episode we'll be

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.900 
do now in the next episode we'll be
looking<00:05:10.380> at<00:05:10.590> logic<00:05:10.950> gates<00:05:11.130> alike<00:05:11.520> they're

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
looking at logic gates alike they're

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.540 
looking at logic gates alike they're
very<00:05:11.970> simple<00:05:12.390> not<00:05:12.690> gates<00:05:13.440> which<00:05:13.710> is<00:05:13.860> this<00:05:14.040> or

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
very simple not gates which is this or

the inverter gate the repeater gate
right<00:05:17.400> here<00:05:17.460> and<00:05:18.020> there's<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.169> and<00:05:19.380> gate<00:05:19.710> as

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
right here and there's the and gate as

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.610 
right here and there's the and gate as
well<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:20.720> we'll<00:05:21.720> get<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:21.990> that<00:05:22.020> sound<00:05:22.380> in<00:05:22.530> a

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
well and we'll get to that sound in a

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.070 
well and we'll get to that sound in a
second<00:05:22.979> this<00:05:23.430> is<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.729> and<00:05:24.000> gate<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.510> warsop
