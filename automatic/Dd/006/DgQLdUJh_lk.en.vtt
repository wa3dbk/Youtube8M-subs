00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.500 
actually a strike the ball and he's very
I<00:03:07.620> guess<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.129> wouldn't<00:03:08.400> say<00:03:08.549> strong<00:03:08.969> but<00:03:09.480> I

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
I guess I wouldn't say strong but I

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.509 
I guess I wouldn't say strong but I
think<00:03:09.780> he<00:03:09.930> feels<00:03:10.200> like<00:03:10.590> he's<00:03:10.799> aggressive<00:03:11.129> so

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
think he feels like he's aggressive so

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.949 
think he feels like he's aggressive so
he<00:03:11.609> wins<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.939> ball<00:03:12.090> back<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.480> he's<00:03:12.569> got<00:03:12.719> great

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
he wins the ball back and he's got great

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.030 
he wins the ball back and he's got great
balance<00:03:13.169> now<00:03:13.500> you're<00:03:13.620> gonna<00:03:13.739> be<00:03:13.829> seen<00:03:14.010> a

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
balance now you're gonna be seen a

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.920 
balance now you're gonna be seen a
couple<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.430> Clips<00:03:14.669> where<00:03:14.879> I<00:03:15.090> was<00:03:15.480> running<00:03:15.750> for

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
couple of Clips where I was running for

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.050 
couple of Clips where I was running for
on<00:03:16.049> goal<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.439> take<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:16.859> down<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.639> go<00:03:17.819> for<00:03:18.000> the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
on goal I take it down and I go for the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.930 
on goal I take it down and I go for the
shot<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:18.540> initially<00:03:19.169> he's<00:03:19.319> got<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.590> shot<00:03:19.799> away

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
shot so initially he's got the shot away

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.979 
shot so initially he's got the shot away
obviously<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.060> keeper<00:03:21.329> saves<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.720> which<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:21.959> a

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
obviously the keeper saves it which is a

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.449 
obviously the keeper saves it which is a
good<00:03:22.199> save<00:03:22.440> nothing<00:03:22.859> could<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.159> think<00:03:23.310> wrong

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
good save nothing could I think wrong

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.330 
good save nothing could I think wrong
about<00:03:23.669> that<00:03:23.729> and<00:03:24.180> then<00:03:24.659> he<00:03:24.989> just<00:03:25.409> has<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.040> grit

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
about that and then he just has the grit

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.039 
about that and then he just has the grit
and<00:03:26.459> determination<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:27.359> win<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.659> ball<00:03:27.840> back
