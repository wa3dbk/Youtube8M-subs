00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.690 
pouch is 185 I honestly did not want the
25<00:01:30.150> because<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.840> think<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.040> small<00:01:32.460> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
25 because I just think it's so small it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.480 
25 because I just think it's so small it
was<00:01:32.790> kind<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.119> silly<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> 35<00:01:35.220> would

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
was kind of silly I think the 35 would

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490 
was kind of silly I think the 35 would
be<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.420> too<00:01:36.630> big<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:36.869> someone<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.470> my

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
be a little too big for someone of my

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.740 
be a little too big for someone of my
stature<00:01:38.210> I'm<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.750> around<00:01:40.049> 53<00:01:40.939> 115<00:01:41.939> pounds<00:01:42.210> so

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
stature I'm like around 53 115 pounds so

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.380 
stature I'm like around 53 115 pounds so
this<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.649> perfectly<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.369> big<00:01:44.610> enough<00:01:44.850> bag<00:01:45.060> for

video that said that you shouldn't put
it<00:02:15.160> here<00:02:15.640> because<00:02:16.360> after<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.810> while<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.290> whole

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
it here because after a while the whole

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.380 
it here because after a while the whole
starts<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.010> sag<00:02:18.280> from<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.760> weight<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.000> the
