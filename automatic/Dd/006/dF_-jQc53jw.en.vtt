CD<00:03:53.910> around<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.510> check<00:03:54.660> stuff<00:03:54.870> out<00:03:55.670> but<00:03:56.670> you

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
CD around and check stuff out but you

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.550 
CD around and check stuff out but you
know<00:03:57.060> close<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.510> keyboard<00:03:57.690> close<00:03:58.350> that

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
know close the keyboard close that

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.759 
know close the keyboard close that
application<00:04:00.049> so<00:04:01.049> we<00:04:01.170> haven't<00:04:01.319> written<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.680> lot

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
application so we haven't written a lot

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.970 
application so we haven't written a lot
of<00:04:01.829> applications<00:04:02.430> yet<00:04:02.670> but<00:04:03.500> it's<00:04:04.500> all<00:04:04.890> the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
of applications yet but it's all the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.440 
of applications yet but it's all the
applications<00:04:05.459> are<00:04:05.579> written<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:05.880> limbo<00:04:06.180> it's<00:04:06.390> a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
applications are written in limbo it's a

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.610 
applications are written in limbo it's a
very<00:04:06.630> easy<00:04:06.840> language<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.590> program<00:04:08.220> in<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:09.620> we

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
very easy language to program in and we

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.479 
very easy language to program in and we
use<00:04:10.799> its<00:04:11.010> uses<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.459> TK<00:04:12.049> windowing<00:04:13.489> windowing

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
use its uses the TK windowing windowing

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.860 
use its uses the TK windowing windowing
toolkit<00:04:14.970> which<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.359> little<00:04:15.600> bit<00:04:15.720> outdated

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
toolkit which is a little bit outdated

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.219 
toolkit which is a little bit outdated
but<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.500> is<00:04:16.620> very<00:04:17.010> easy<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.549> write<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.329> so<00:04:18.959> it's

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
but it is very easy to write in so it's

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.360 
but it is very easy to write in so it's
it's<00:04:19.560> pretty<00:04:19.680> quick<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.070> give<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.220> new

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
it's pretty quick to give a new

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.800 
it's pretty quick to give a new
application<00:04:20.789> put<00:04:21.150> together<00:04:22.610> now<00:04:23.610> as<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.720> can

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
application put together now as you can

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.630 
application put together now as you can
see<00:04:24.960> we've<00:04:25.260> we've<00:04:25.560> found<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.919> buttons<00:04:26.220> to<00:04:26.520> do

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
see we've we've found the buttons to do

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.680 
see we've we've found the buttons to do
our<00:04:26.789> own<00:04:26.820> thing

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
our own thing

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.000 
our own thing
so<00:04:28.250> we<00:04:29.250> can<00:04:29.400> do<00:04:29.490> stuff<00:04:29.760> like<00:04:30.140> open<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.290> open

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
so we can do stuff like open the open

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.760 
so we can do stuff like open the open
the<00:04:32.280> screen<00:04:32.640> brightness<00:04:32.910> adjustment<00:04:33.770> by

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
the screen brightness adjustment by

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.950 
the screen brightness adjustment by
pressing<00:04:35.220> holding<00:04:36.000> them<00:04:36.120> power<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.480> pressing

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
pressing holding them power and pressing

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.010 
pressing holding them power and pressing
the<00:04:37.050> up<00:04:37.080> arrow<00:04:37.380> or<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.610> up<00:04:38.820> volume<00:04:39.030> button<00:04:39.390> and

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
the up arrow or the up volume button and

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.120 
the up arrow or the up volume button and
then<00:04:40.170> we<00:04:40.230> can<00:04:40.380> drag<00:04:40.590> this<00:04:40.740> thing<00:04:40.950> on<00:04:41.070> the

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
then we can drag this thing on the

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.800 
then we can drag this thing on the
screen<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.550> change<00:04:41.700> the<00:04:41.790> brightness<00:04:43.190> and<00:04:44.810> also

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
screen to change the brightness and also

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.140 
screen to change the brightness and also
very<00:04:46.230> useful<00:04:46.380> in<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:46.980> development<00:04:47.730> operating

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
very useful in a development operating

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.970 
very useful in a development operating
system<00:04:48.450> if<00:04:49.200> you<00:04:49.350> hold<00:04:49.530> down<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.770> power<00:04:49.800> button

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
system if you hold down the power button

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.110 
system if you hold down the power button
and<00:04:50.340> press<00:04:50.610> home

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
and press home

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.990 
and press home
it<00:04:51.600> completely<00:04:52.170> restarts<00:04:52.650> inferno<00:04:53.280> now<00:04:53.940> the

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
it completely restarts inferno now the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.340 
it completely restarts inferno now the
brightness<00:04:54.390> is<00:04:54.510> all<00:04:54.630> funky<00:04:54.840> because<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.530> is

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
brightness is all funky because it is

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.930 
brightness is all funky because it is
well<00:04:58.350> it's<00:04:58.530> going<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.740> be<00:04:58.890> a<00:04:59.130> little<00:04:59.610> bit<00:04:59.790> too

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
well it's going to be a little bit too

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.790 
well it's going to be a little bit too
little<00:05:00.750> too<00:05:00.870> bright<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.350> see<00:05:01.620> with<00:05:01.740> this

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
little too bright to see with this

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.070 
little too bright to see with this
camera<00:05:02.250> but<00:05:02.910> that's<00:05:03.330> what<00:05:03.450> we've<00:05:03.570> got<00:05:03.780> for<00:05:03.960> now

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
camera but that's what we've got for now

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.410 
camera but that's what we've got for now
and<00:05:06.500> so<00:05:07.500> I<00:05:07.530> hope<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:08.040> is<00:05:08.100> given<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.880> little<00:05:09.300> bit

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
and so I hope this is given a little bit

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.930 
and so I hope this is given a little bit
idea<00:05:11.030> of<00:05:12.030> what<00:05:12.270> we've<00:05:12.450> what<00:05:12.900> we've<00:05:12.930> got<00:05:13.200> so<00:05:13.410> far

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
idea of what we've what we've got so far

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.390 
idea of what we've what we've got so far
but<00:05:15.470> that<00:05:16.470> we<00:05:16.680> definitely<00:05:16.800> want<00:05:17.040> more

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
but that we definitely want more

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.400 
but that we definitely want more
definitely<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.330> lot<00:05:18.450> more<00:05:18.510> developers<00:05:19.170> in<00:05:19.290> on

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
definitely a lot more developers in on

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.920 
definitely a lot more developers in on
this<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:19.830> we'd<00:05:20.820> like<00:05:21.000> you<00:05:21.300> know<00:05:21.390> help<00:05:21.630> it'll

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
this and we'd like you know help it'll

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.630 
this and we'd like you know help it'll
be<00:05:22.110> it'll<00:05:22.590> be<00:05:22.680> of<00:05:22.800> interest<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:23.340> other

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
be it'll be of interest to other

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.910 
be it'll be of interest to other
developers<00:05:24.090> who<00:05:24.210> are<00:05:24.300> not<00:05:24.500> so<00:05:25.500> thrilled<00:05:25.830> with

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
developers who are not so thrilled with

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.530 
developers who are not so thrilled with
Java<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.490> would<00:05:26.640> like<00:05:26.760> to<00:05:26.790> look<00:05:27.360> into

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
Java and would like to look into

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.990 
Java and would like to look into
something<00:05:27.840> else
