um for your class it up it could be

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.670 
um for your class it up it could be
anything<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:33.960> use<00:00:34.110> any<00:00:34.260> sniper<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
anything you just use any sniper that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
sniper I don't care you can use the DSR

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.920 
sniper I don't care you can use the DSR
on<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> blissed<00:00:41.579> are<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.420> best<00:00:42.629> for<00:00:42.809> trick

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
on the blissed are the best for trick

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.840 
on the blissed are the best for trick
shotting<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.469> should<00:00:44.219> probably<00:00:44.430> use<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.670> of

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
shotting so should probably use one of

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.250 
shotting so should probably use one of
those<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.899> an<00:00:46.020> example<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:47.660> what<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
those is an example of it what you do is

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.680 
those is an example of it what you do is
you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.890> swap<00:00:51.500> appointment<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.649> knife<00:00:53.690> pick

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
you can swap appointment you knife pick

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.360 
you can swap appointment you knife pick
up<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.930> gun<00:00:55.050> off<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> ground<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:58.129> then<00:00:59.129> you

um<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.700> can<00:01:14.909> sprint<00:01:15.240> with<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.780> knife

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
um you can sprint with it you can knife

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.399 
um you can sprint with it you can knife
with<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.460> um<00:01:17.460> press<00:01:17.850> y<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:19.080> your<00:01:19.259> gun<00:01:19.380> out

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
after yeah it's really six hot though it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.469 
after yeah it's really six hot though it
works<00:01:24.180> best<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:26.060> drop<00:01:27.060> your<00:01:27.090> sniper

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
works best when you drop your sniper

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.460 
works best when you drop your sniper
around<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.670> then<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.049> go<00:01:31.049> for<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.320> shot

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
around and then you go for a shot

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.600 
around and then you go for a shot
because<00:01:31.799> when<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.040> goes<00:01:32.130> straight<00:01:32.310> your

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
because when it goes straight your

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.520 
because when it goes straight your
sniper<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.930> swaps<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.409> your

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
sniper and then it can swaps with your

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.929 
sniper and then it can swaps with your
sniper<00:01:34.710> what's<00:01:35.670> realistic<00:01:38.299> yeah<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.840> I'm

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939
