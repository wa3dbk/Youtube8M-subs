of course the TARDIS is on it and I just

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.920 
of course the TARDIS is on it and I just
thought<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.369> was<00:00:23.460> such<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> beautiful<00:00:24.180> print<00:00:24.510> so

the restrictions of this fabric actually
it's<00:00:53.789> turning<00:00:54.149> out<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> bit<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.170> a

the<00:01:13.770> olan<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.939> fabric<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.689> wasn't<00:01:16.590> real

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the olan of this fabric I wasn't real

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.859 
the olan of this fabric I wasn't real
clear<00:01:16.979> when<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> bought<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.939> quite<00:01:18.689> frankly

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
clear when I bought it and quite frankly

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.630 
clear when I bought it and quite frankly
I<00:01:19.140> don't<00:01:19.170> think<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.530> paid<00:01:19.710> much<00:01:19.890> attention<00:01:19.920> I

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
I don't think I paid much attention I

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.270 
I don't think I paid much attention I
was<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.240> love<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.720> want<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.140> by<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
was just like I love it I want it by it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.060 
was just like I love it I want it by it
is<00:01:23.520> 45<00:01:24.030> inch<00:01:24.270> fabric<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.799> see

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
is 45 inch fabric but if you can see

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.030 
is 45 inch fabric but if you can see
here<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> has<00:01:26.909> about<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.900> two<00:01:27.990> inch<00:01:28.380> seam

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
here it has about a two inch seam

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.609 
here it has about a two inch seam
allowance<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.790> you're<00:01:29.970> losing<00:01:30.450> actually<00:01:31.320> four

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
allowance so you're losing actually four

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.460 
allowance so you're losing actually four
inches<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.570> patterns<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.110> actually

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
inches of patterns so this is actually

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.260 
inches of patterns so this is actually
41<00:01:35.250> inch<00:01:36.799> pattern<00:01:37.799> which<00:01:38.549> given<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> length

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
41 inch pattern which given the length

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.030 
41 inch pattern which given the length
that<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.570> want<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.900> make<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.200> skirt<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.710> given

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that I want to make the skirt and given

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.520 
that I want to make the skirt and given
my<00:01:41.220> waist<00:01:41.520> size<00:01:41.759> makes<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.689> difficult<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
my waist size makes it difficult to do a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.480 
my waist size makes it difficult to do a
circle<00:01:44.009> skirt

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
circle skirt

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.249 
circle skirt
not<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.909> mention<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.390> fact<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.659> patterns

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
not to mention the fact that patterns

not to mention the fact that patterns

all going in the same direction because

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.020 
all going in the same direction because
we<00:01:48.799> have<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.860> pattern<00:01:50.130> that's<00:01:50.399> all<00:01:50.670> going<00:01:50.909> in

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
we have a pattern that's all going in

we have a pattern that's all going in

the same direction and you want to keep

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
are going to do is we're going to do a

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.430 
are going to do is we're going to do a
four<00:02:06.869> panel<00:02:07.170> circle<00:02:07.740> skirt<00:02:08.009> doing<00:02:08.879> more<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:10.170> a

bit of a diagonal on the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.540 
bit of a diagonal on the
fabric<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:15.030> could<00:02:15.390> do<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.650> panel<00:02:17.160> circle

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
fabric we could do a to panel circle

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.870 
fabric we could do a to panel circle
skirt<00:02:17.820> if<00:02:18.060> we<00:02:18.630> wanted<00:02:19.050> all<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.590> TARDISes<00:02:20.580> to

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
skirt if we wanted all the TARDISes to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.390 
skirt if we wanted all the TARDISes to
be<00:02:21.000> going<00:02:21.420> sideways<00:02:21.750> which<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.680> don't<00:02:23.040> really

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
be going sideways which I don't really

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.850 
be going sideways which I don't really
want<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.510> want<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.320> them<00:02:25.500> more

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
want to do that I want to do them more

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.240 
want to do that I want to do them more
maybe<00:02:26.430> say<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:27.030> an<00:02:27.240> angle<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:29.190> think

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
maybe say on an angle like so I think

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.280 
maybe say on an angle like so I think
would<00:02:29.610> look<00:02:29.760> actually<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.480> little<00:02:30.750> bit<00:02:31.020> better

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
would look actually a little bit better

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.920 
would look actually a little bit better
and<00:02:31.650> going<00:02:32.130> sideways<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:33.210> we're<00:02:33.510> going<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.690> do

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
and going sideways so we're going to do

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.830 
and going sideways so we're going to do
four<00:02:34.560> panel<00:02:34.890> circle<00:02:35.220> skirt<00:02:35.460> so<00:02:35.850> we<00:02:36.570> don't<00:02:36.720> have

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
four panel circle skirt so we don't have

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.130 
four panel circle skirt so we don't have
a<00:02:36.870> pattern<00:02:37.170> no<00:02:37.770> no<00:02:38.100> we<00:02:38.790> are<00:02:39.090> doing<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:39.840> all

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
a pattern no no we are doing this all

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.560 
a pattern no no we are doing this all
based<00:02:40.470> off<00:02:40.710> of<00:02:40.770> lots<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.550> internet<00:02:42.000> googling

based off of lots of internet googling

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.430 
based off of lots of internet googling
and<00:02:42.780> searching<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.730> calculators<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.020> all<00:02:46.020> of

and searching and calculators and all of

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.740 
and searching and calculators and all of
that<00:02:46.490> because<00:02:47.490> this<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.910> super<00:02:48.480> expensive

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
that because this is super expensive

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.100 
that because this is super expensive
fabric<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.850> really<00:02:51.150> didn't<00:02:51.420> want<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.750> make

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
fabric and I really didn't want to make

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.990 
fabric and I really didn't want to make
a<00:02:52.290> mistake<00:02:52.500> on<00:02:53.130> my<00:02:55.190> sizing<00:02:56.190> what<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.430> did<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.880> I

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
a mistake on my sizing what I did is I

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.950 
a mistake on my sizing what I did is I
actually<00:02:57.300> did<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.890> made<00:02:59.250> my<00:02:59.490> own<00:02:59.720> powder<00:03:00.720> I'm

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
actually did a I made my own powder I'm

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.470 
actually did a I made my own powder I'm
using<00:03:01.050> tracing<00:03:01.860> paper<00:03:02.070> again<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.120> can<00:03:03.300> use

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
using tracing paper again you can use

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.930 
using tracing paper again you can use
anything<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.320> have<00:03:04.530> handy<00:03:05.010> newspaper

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
anything that you have handy newspaper

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.540 
anything that you have handy newspaper
um<00:03:06.420> anything<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.710> have<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:07.950> that's

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
um anything that you have that that's

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.100 
um anything that you have that that's
easy<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:09.000> get<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> hold<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.660> bigger<00:03:09.870> the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
easy to get a hold of the bigger the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.200 
easy to get a hold of the bigger the
sheets<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:11.040> easier<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.700> because<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.030> will

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
sheets the easier it is because you will

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.450 
sheets the easier it is because you will
have<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.420> attach<00:03:12.810> some<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.440> together<00:03:13.590> so

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
have to attach some of it together so

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.940 
have to attach some of it together so
this<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.910> just<00:03:15.180> one<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.870> four<00:03:16.140> panels<00:03:16.680> I'm

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
this is just one of the four panels I'm

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.050 
this is just one of the four panels I'm
going<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.250> walk<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.580> through<00:03:17.610> how<00:03:17.850> to

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
going to walk you through how to

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.400 
going to walk you through how to
actually<00:03:18.380> create<00:03:19.380> your<00:03:19.950> own<00:03:20.750> pattern<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:22.260> can

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
actually create your own pattern you can

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.110 
actually create your own pattern you can
definitely<00:03:22.620> do<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.100> straight<00:03:23.550> on<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:24.030> the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
definitely do it straight on to the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.850 
definitely do it straight on to the
fabric<00:03:24.360> but<00:03:24.780> what's<00:03:24.960> great<00:03:25.110> about<00:03:25.200> doing<00:03:25.590> it

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
fabric but what's great about doing it

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.220 
fabric but what's great about doing it
on<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.370> pattern<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:27.030> number<00:03:27.870> one<00:03:28.050> you

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
on to the pattern is number one you

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.840 
on to the pattern is number one you
don't<00:03:28.320> have<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.800> do<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.010> calculations<00:03:29.610> every

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
don't have to do the calculations every

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.150 
don't have to do the calculations every
time<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.270> decide<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.750> do<00:03:30.990> a<00:03:31.020> circle<00:03:31.470> skirt<00:03:31.560> you

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
time you decide to do a circle skirt you

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.240 
time you decide to do a circle skirt you
have<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.520> pattern<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:34.070> because<00:03:35.070> it's

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
have the pattern and because it's

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.300 
have the pattern and because it's
expensive<00:03:35.610> fabric<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.630> can<00:03:37.320> double<00:03:37.860> check<00:03:38.100> that

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
expensive fabric I can double check that

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.380 
expensive fabric I can double check that
my<00:03:38.880> calculations<00:03:39.510> are<00:03:40.260> correct<00:03:41.150> before<00:03:42.150> I

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
my calculations are correct before I

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.980 
my calculations are correct before I
start<00:03:42.810> cutting<00:03:43.020> out<00:03:43.350> my<00:03:43.730> very<00:03:44.730> expensive

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
start cutting out my very expensive

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.620 
start cutting out my very expensive
fabric<00:03:45.990> and<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.950> helps<00:03:47.310> me<00:03:47.490> to<00:03:47.520> visualize<00:03:48.270> as

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
fabric and it helps me to visualize as

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.660 
fabric and it helps me to visualize as
well<00:03:48.900> when<00:03:49.470> I'm<00:03:49.590> laying<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.100> down<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.490> let's

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
well when I'm laying it down to let's

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.330 
well when I'm laying it down to let's
get<00:03:50.880> mapping<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:52.020> create<00:03:52.650> your<00:03:52.800> pattern<00:03:53.010> you

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
get mapping to create your pattern you

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.940 
get mapping to create your pattern you
need<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.580> determine<00:03:54.210> your<00:03:54.390> two<00:03:54.660> radiuses
