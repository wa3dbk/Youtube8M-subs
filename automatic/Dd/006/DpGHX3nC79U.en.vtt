back in May to school so this was for my

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.000 
back in May to school so this was for my
Fri<00:00:45.539> temporarily<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.559> whisper

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
Fri temporarily so here I have a whisper

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
Fri temporarily so here I have a whisper
one<00:00:50.309> two<00:00:50.550> three<00:00:50.820> gallon<00:00:51.149> internal<00:00:51.780> powder

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
one two three gallon internal powder

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.950 
one two three gallon internal powder
filter<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.860> then<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.239> LED<00:00:54.930> light

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
filter and then I have this LED light

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.619 
filter and then I have this LED light
and<00:00:56.420> everything<00:00:57.420> came<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:59.390> so<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> was

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
and everything came to think so it was

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.779 
and everything came to think so it was
twenty<00:01:00.870> dollars<00:01:01.140> total<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.609> guess

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
twenty dollars total and I just I guess

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.179 
twenty dollars total and I just I guess
I<00:01:02.910> was<00:01:03.030> worth<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.390> because<00:01:03.570> apparently<00:01:04.189> this

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
I was worth it because apparently this

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.039 
I was worth it because apparently this
filter<00:01:05.670> by<00:01:06.630> itself<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.320> seventeen<00:01:08.310> dollars<00:01:09.049> so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
filter by itself is seventeen dollars so

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.640 
filter by itself is seventeen dollars so
I<00:01:10.080> guess<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.530> worth<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:13.439> then

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
I guess I was worth it you know and then

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.570 
I guess I was worth it you know and then
I<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.970> this

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.730 

the<00:01:20.150> air<00:01:20.450> pump<00:01:20.660> that<00:01:20.840> comes<00:01:21.020> with<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.350> tank<00:01:21.560> as

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
the air pump that comes with the tank as

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.030 
the air pump that comes with the tank as
well<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.720> has<00:01:24.620> a<00:01:26.050> paper<00:01:27.050> towel<00:01:27.350> wrapped

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
well and it has a paper towel wrapped

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.310 
well and it has a paper towel wrapped
around<00:01:28.190> it<00:01:28.430> because<00:01:28.790> it's<00:01:29.390> not<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.660> cloud<00:01:30.020> if

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
around it because it's not a cloud if

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.320 
around it because it's not a cloud if
