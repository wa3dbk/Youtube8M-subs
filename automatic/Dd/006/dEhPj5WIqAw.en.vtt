00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
but um guns i would recommend i'm going

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.370 
but um guns i would recommend i'm going
to<00:03:46.739> do<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:46.980> for<00:03:47.250> each<00:03:47.340> map<00:03:47.609> um<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:49.049> guns<00:03:49.260> i

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
to do that for each map um the guns i

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.750 
to do that for each map um the guns i
would<00:03:49.500> recommend<00:03:49.889> for<00:03:50.069> this<00:03:50.190> map<00:03:50.400> would

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
would recommend for this map would

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.140 
would recommend for this map would
probably<00:03:51.389> be<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:52.489> long-range<00:03:53.489> weapons<00:03:54.000> of

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
probably be a long-range weapons of

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.360 
probably be a long-range weapons of
course<00:03:54.480> just<00:03:54.930> like<00:03:55.049> cliffside<00:03:55.560> guises<00:03:56.099> it's

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
course just like cliffside guises it's

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.150 
course just like cliffside guises it's
very<00:03:56.730> sniper<00:03:57.209> friendly<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:57.959> long<00:03:58.380> range<00:03:58.739> and

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
very sniper friendly and long range and

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.400 
very sniper friendly and long range and
long<00:03:59.430> lines<00:03:59.730> of<00:03:59.970> sight<00:04:00.209> there's<00:04:01.200> getting<00:04:01.349> a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
long lines of sight there's getting a

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.890 
long lines of sight there's getting a
lot<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.650> those<00:04:01.859> engagements<00:04:02.190> so<00:04:02.730> i<00:04:02.940> would<00:04:03.359> my

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
lot of those engagements so i would my

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.900 
lot of those engagements so i would my
i'd<00:04:04.590> say<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.889> best<00:04:05.069> weapon<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.549> choose<00:04:05.730> for

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
i'd say the best weapon and choose for

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.270 
i'd say the best weapon and choose for
this<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.239> probably<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.599> g11<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.980> i<00:04:08.099> don't

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
this is probably the g11 and i don't

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.280 
this is probably the g11 and i don't
know<00:04:08.310> how<00:04:08.519> I<00:04:08.579> died<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.150> nukem<00:04:09.660> anyone<00:04:09.750> hit<00:04:10.139> me

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
know how I died that nukem anyone hit me

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.069 
know how I died that nukem anyone hit me
but<00:04:10.500> whatever<00:04:11.569> um<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:13.560> g11<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:15.299> m16

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
but whatever um the g11 and the m16

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.110 
but whatever um the g11 and the m16
other<00:04:16.650> good<00:04:17.039> guns<00:04:17.340> that<00:04:17.519> would<00:04:17.669> work<00:04:17.789> would<00:04:18.000> be

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
other good guns that would work would be

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.680 
other good guns that would work would be
the<00:04:18.209> FN<00:04:18.599> FAL<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.320> m14<00:04:20.130> sniper<00:04:21.060> rifles<00:04:21.510> would

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
the FN FAL the m14 sniper rifles would

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.350 
the FN FAL the m14 sniper rifles would
work<00:04:21.840> fine

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
work fine

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.360 
work fine
this<00:04:22.509> map<00:04:22.689> to<00:04:22.990> just<00:04:23.259> don't<00:04:23.650> run<00:04:23.919> around<00:04:24.039> too

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
this map to just don't run around too

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.399 
this map to just don't run around too
much<00:04:24.490> with<00:04:24.729> them<00:04:24.849> there's<00:04:25.330> there's<00:04:26.020> obviously

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
much with them there's there's obviously

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.589 
much with them there's there's obviously
corners<00:04:26.889> in<00:04:26.979> this<00:04:27.099> map<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.699> haven't<00:04:28.180> even<00:04:28.270> seen

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599

corners in this map I haven't even seen
yet<00:04:28.659> I'm<00:04:29.080> going<00:04:29.199> to<00:04:29.289> explore<00:04:29.620> this<00:04:29.800> map<00:04:30.009> to<00:04:30.189> its

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
yet I'm going to explore this map to its

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.110 
yet I'm going to explore this map to its
full<00:04:30.520> potential<00:04:30.849> but<00:04:31.210> um<00:04:32.699> yeah<00:04:33.699> this<00:04:33.879> is<00:04:34.000> this

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
full potential but um yeah this is this

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.550 
full potential but um yeah this is this
map<00:04:34.300> there's<00:04:34.599> not<00:04:34.719> a<00:04:34.750> whole<00:04:34.960> lot<00:04:35.199> of<00:04:35.259> close

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
map there's not a whole lot of close

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.260 
map there's not a whole lot of close
range<00:04:35.830> engagements<00:04:36.009> you<00:04:36.610> can<00:04:36.759> see<00:04:36.909> right<00:04:36.939> here

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
range engagements you can see right here

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.070 
range engagements you can see right here
I'm<00:04:37.389> just<00:04:37.569> I'm<00:04:38.039> um<00:04:39.389> this<00:04:40.389> right<00:04:40.599> here's<00:04:40.840> a<00:04:40.900> good

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
see that beef like flash and this map is

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.869 
see that beef like flash and this map is
a<00:04:45.340> hard<00:04:45.849> flag<00:04:46.270> get<00:04:46.629> beyond<00:04:47.080> but<00:04:47.919> like<00:04:48.580> it's

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 
a hard flag get beyond but like it's

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.790 
a hard flag get beyond but like it's
completely<00:04:49.810> out<00:04:49.930> in<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.110> open<00:04:50.289> all<00:04:50.620> there<00:04:50.770> is

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
bricks and stuff like that and this is a

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.559 
bricks and stuff like that and this is a
great<00:05:32.050> area<00:05:32.349> to<00:05:32.560> spawn<00:05:33.099> trap<00:05:33.430> on<00:05:33.669> i<00:05:33.940> know<00:05:34.300> it's

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
great area to spawn trap on i know it's

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.550 
great area to spawn trap on i know it's
the<00:05:34.659> spawns<00:05:34.990> are<00:05:35.319> a<00:05:35.379> bit<00:05:35.860> corrupt<00:05:36.400> but<00:05:36.969> um<00:05:37.560> they

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
the spawns are a bit corrupt but um they

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.339 
the spawns are a bit corrupt but um they
probably<00:05:39.159> won't<00:05:39.370> change<00:05:39.669> this<00:05:39.849> bond<00:05:40.259> call<00:05:41.259> of

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
probably won't change this bond call of

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.230 
probably won't change this bond call of
duty<00:05:41.379> spawns<00:05:41.919> in<00:05:42.009> general<00:05:42.460> aren't<00:05:42.819> that<00:05:43.029> great

commend<00:06:17.589> this<00:06:17.919> would<00:06:18.159> be<00:06:18.279> probably<00:06:18.580> the<00:06:18.729> best

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
commend this would be probably the best

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.219 
commend this would be probably the best
not<00:06:19.689> for<00:06:20.289> domination<00:06:20.889> um<00:06:21.479> I<00:06:22.479> haven't<00:06:22.900> played

TDM<00:06:23.680> a<00:06:23.710> whole<00:06:24.009> lot<00:06:24.219> on<00:06:24.370> these<00:06:24.490> like<00:06:24.789> I<00:06:24.909> did<00:06:25.089> the

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
TDM a whole lot on these like I did the

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:28.050 
TDM a whole lot on these like I did the
DLCs<00:06:26.229> last<00:06:26.500> time<00:06:26.800> they<00:06:26.949> first<00:06:27.189> the<00:06:27.610> first<00:06:27.879> time

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
DLCs last time they first the first time

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.870 
DLCs last time they first the first time
they<00:06:28.270> came<00:06:28.419> out<00:06:28.539> last<00:06:28.750> time<00:06:28.930> but<00:06:29.830> look<00:06:30.699> at<00:06:30.789> this

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
they came out last time but look at this

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.639 
they came out last time but look at this
line<00:06:31.120> of<00:06:31.300> sight<00:06:31.509> this<00:06:31.719> is<00:06:31.870> really<00:06:32.050> risky<00:06:32.319> me

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:32.649 
line of sight this is really risky me

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:34.080 
line of sight this is really risky me
running<00:06:32.949> up<00:06:33.099> constantly<00:06:33.669> on<00:06:33.849> it

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
running up constantly on it

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.330 
running up constantly on it
but<00:06:34.210> I<00:06:34.750> guess<00:06:35.290> it<00:06:35.440> worked<00:06:35.650> for<00:06:35.860> me<00:06:35.980> and<00:06:36.130> I<00:06:36.220> don't

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
but I guess it worked for me and I don't

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.439 
but I guess it worked for me and I don't
say<00:06:36.490> killed<00:06:36.730> buzz<00:06:36.880> Hawk<00:06:37.180> helicopter<00:06:37.870> but<00:06:38.680> um

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
say killed buzz Hawk helicopter but um

but the dlc I recommend it that'd be my
final<00:06:50.590> words<00:06:50.770> on<00:06:51.010> it<00:06:51.130> and<00:06:53.310> this<00:06:54.310> is<00:06:54.460> pretty

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610
