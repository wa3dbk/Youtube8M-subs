the best place to start we're talking

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.790 
the best place to start we're talking
about<00:00:47.270> a<00:00:47.360> hybrid<00:00:47.809> is<00:00:48.050> up<00:00:48.350> front<00:00:48.590> with<00:00:48.739> the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
about a hybrid is up front with the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.560 
about a hybrid is up front with the
powertrain<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:49.550> let's<00:00:49.730> check<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.059> out<00:00:52.570> alright

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
powertrain so let's check it out alright

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.000 
powertrain so let's check it out alright
well<00:00:53.750> here<00:00:53.870> we<00:00:54.020> are<00:00:54.050> underneath<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.739> hood<00:00:54.949> of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
well here we are underneath the hood of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.520 
well here we are underneath the hood of
this<00:00:55.190> 2010<00:00:55.760> Fusion<00:00:56.239> Hybrid<00:00:56.390> this<00:00:57.109> is<00:00:57.289> really

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
this 2010 Fusion Hybrid this is really

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.930 
this 2010 Fusion Hybrid this is really
where<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:57.680> magic<00:00:57.890> happens<00:00:58.430> in<00:00:58.550> terms<00:00:58.670> of<00:00:58.850> the

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
where the magic happens in terms of the

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.910 
where the magic happens in terms of the
hybrid<00:00:59.239> powertrain<00:00:59.690> system<00:01:00.019> now<00:01:00.559> before<00:01:00.829> we

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
hybrid powertrain system now before we

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.590 
hybrid powertrain system now before we
get<00:01:01.010> too<00:01:01.190> far<00:01:01.219> into<00:01:01.429> it<00:01:01.670> we<00:01:02.000> want<00:01:02.179> to<00:01:02.239> point<00:01:02.420> out

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
get too far into it we want to point out

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.630 
get too far into it we want to point out
that<00:01:02.780> not<00:01:02.929> all<00:01:03.199> hybrids<00:01:03.710> are<00:01:03.890> created<00:01:04.309> equal

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
that not all hybrids are created equal

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.430 
that not all hybrids are created equal
actually<00:01:05.210> two<00:01:05.570> different<00:01:05.750> types<00:01:05.930> of<00:01:06.260> hybrid

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
actually two different types of hybrid

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.160 
actually two different types of hybrid
systems<00:01:06.950> available<00:01:07.460> that's<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:08.030> mild<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:08.630> full

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
systems available that's a mild and full

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.840 
systems available that's a mild and full
the<00:01:09.619> easiest<00:01:10.250> way<00:01:10.400> to<00:01:10.430> tell<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:10.820> difference

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
the easiest way to tell the difference

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.300 
the easiest way to tell the difference
between<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.540> two<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:11.960> vehicle<00:01:12.860> with<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:13.009> full

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
between the two a vehicle with a full

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.910 
between the two a vehicle with a full
hybrid<00:01:13.549> system<00:01:14.000> like<00:01:14.630> this<00:01:14.780> fusion<00:01:15.259> can<00:01:15.740> move

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
hybrid system like this fusion can move

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.410 
hybrid system like this fusion can move
on<00:01:16.100> its<00:01:16.310> own<00:01:16.430> with<00:01:16.729> just<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:17.060> electrical

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
on its own with just the electrical

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.179 
on its own with just the electrical
system<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:17.960> doesn't<00:01:18.110> require<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:18.560> gasoline

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
system it doesn't require the gasoline

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.969

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
transmission it really makes the two

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.490 
transmission it really makes the two

working<00:03:32.769> we<00:03:33.489> could<00:03:33.610> really<00:03:33.820> crank<00:03:34.120> up<00:03:34.269> the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
Sony sound systems we've wanted to

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.130 
Sony sound systems we've wanted to
everything<00:03:36.850> works<00:03:37.060> just<00:03:37.180> like<00:03:37.540> normal<00:03:37.780> just

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
everything works just like normal just

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.130 
everything works just like normal just
not<00:03:38.650> using<00:03:38.920> any<00:03:39.040> gas<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.720> we'll<00:03:40.810> talk<00:03:40.989> about

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
not using any gas and we'll talk about

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.960 
not using any gas and we'll talk about

driving hybrids trying to be the most

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.819 
driving hybrids trying to be the most
efficient<00:03:43.480> it's<00:03:44.049> a<00:03:44.140> little<00:03:44.380> different<00:03:44.560> from

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
efficient it's a little different from

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.920 
efficient it's a little different from

driving a normal vehicle one of the
things<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:48.940> want<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.239> avoid<00:03:49.480> doing<00:03:49.540> in<00:03:50.320> terms

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
things you want to avoid doing in terms

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.080 
things you want to avoid doing in terms
of<00:03:50.739> getting<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.010> most<00:03:51.160> efficiency<00:03:51.790> out<00:03:51.820> of

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
little different though you actually

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
you apply the brakes you're not just

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.809 
you apply the brakes you're not just
wasting<00:04:07.050> energy<00:04:07.260> you're<00:04:08.069> taking<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:08.610> energy

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
that to recharge the batteries so you

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.110 
that to recharge the batteries so you
actually<00:04:16.350> get<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.859> benefit<00:04:17.400> from<00:04:17.669> using<00:04:17.910> the

brakes it's one of the cool things that

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.040 
brakes it's one of the cool things that
makes<00:04:20.549> hybrids<00:04:21.090> really<00:04:21.720> unique

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050
