00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.670 

I<00:00:22.490> was<00:00:23.060> writing<00:00:23.240> games<00:00:23.540> when<00:00:23.750> I<00:00:23.840> was<00:00:23.870> being<00:00:24.260> 12

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
I was writing games when I was being 12

I was writing games when I was being 12
whatever<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:25.940> essentially<00:00:26.390> you<00:00:26.660> didn't<00:00:26.900> go

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
whatever so essentially you didn't go

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.830 
whatever so essentially you didn't go

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
ask anybody he made this up no no it

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.210 
ask anybody he made this up no no it
doesn't<00:00:30.110> work<00:00:30.140> I<00:00:30.380> asked<00:00:30.620> on<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:30.920> she<00:00:31.010> told<00:00:31.160> me

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
doesn't work I asked on and she told me

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.770 
doesn't work I asked on and she told me
to<00:00:31.370> do<00:00:31.460> this<00:00:31.580> a<00:00:36.850> really<00:00:37.850> good<00:00:37.880> example<00:00:38.120> as<00:00:38.630> you

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
to do this a really good example as you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.590 
to do this a really good example as you
can<00:00:38.930> see<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.200> coffered<00:00:39.620> ceiling<00:00:40.310> and<00:00:41.060> I

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
can see the coffered ceiling and I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.880 
can see the coffered ceiling and I
definitely<00:00:41.840> think<00:00:42.140> it's<00:00:42.290> a<00:00:42.380> fun<00:00:42.590> environment

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
definitely think it's a fun environment

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.190 
definitely think it's a fun environment
in<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.640> game<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:44.030> play<00:00:44.059> in<00:00:44.300> there's<00:00:45.020> some

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
in a game to play in there's some

in a game to play in there's some
natural<00:00:46.300> erosion<00:00:47.300> going<00:00:47.720> on<00:00:48.460> she's<00:00:49.460> still

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
natural erosion going on she's still

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.210 
natural erosion going on she's still
bluffing<00:00:50.150> it<00:00:51.140> all<00:00:51.260> ties<00:00:51.530> together<00:00:51.739> it's<00:00:52.130> all

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
bluffing it all ties together it's all

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.460 
bluffing it all ties together it's all
one<00:00:52.460> big<00:00:52.489> bundle<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.360> this<00:00:53.809> is<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.080> universe
