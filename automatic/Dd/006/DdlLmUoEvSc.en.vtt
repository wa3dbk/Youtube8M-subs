playing it so now we take those tables
that<00:03:34.410> can<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.740> capture<00:03:35.070> card<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.370> we

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
that can the capture card that we

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.240 
that can the capture card that we
plugged<00:03:35.670> into<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.970> back<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.300> TV<00:03:37.250> and

plugged into the back of the TV and
we're<00:03:38.370> going<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.520> find<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.820> side<00:03:39.140> this<00:03:40.140> is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
we're going to find the side this is

record video now you're going to need to

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.850 
record video now you're going to need to
use<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:54.030> install<00:04:55.030> video<00:04:55.300> or<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.200> install<00:04:56.530> CD

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.920 
use the install video or the install CD
which<00:04:57.130> I<00:04:57.220> don't<00:04:57.280> have<00:04:57.430> right<00:04:57.550> now<00:04:57.730> and<00:04:58.120> you're

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.409 
going to want to install DM cap right
right<00:05:04.240> no<00:05:04.540> it's<00:05:05.170> right<00:05:05.350> there<00:05:06.210> now<00:05:07.210> you<00:05:07.270> can

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
right no it's right there now you can

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.240 
right no it's right there now you can
all<00:05:07.540> see<00:05:07.570> stuff<00:05:07.960> like<00:05:08.020> virtual<00:05:08.470> dub<00:05:08.620> but<00:05:09.010> I

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
all see stuff like virtual dub but I

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.970 
all see stuff like virtual dub but I
just<00:05:09.940> use<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.210> mcat<00:05:10.570> for<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.840> most<00:05:11.020> part<00:05:11.290> and

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
just use the mcat for the most part and

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.770 
just use the mcat for the most part and
this<00:05:12.430> fast<00:05:12.640> can<00:05:12.850> get<00:05:13.000> kind<00:05:13.210> of<00:05:13.240> big<00:05:13.390> sometime

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
this fast can get kind of big sometime

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.150 
this fast can get kind of big sometime
so<00:05:14.020> you<00:05:14.169> might<00:05:14.290> want<00:05:14.500> an<00:05:14.560> external<00:05:14.950> hard<00:05:15.100> drive

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
so you might want an external hard drive
