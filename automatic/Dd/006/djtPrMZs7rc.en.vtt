00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.030 
and then your blink blink route one is
right<00:01:45.900> here<00:01:46.080> so<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.410> cool<00:01:46.560> thing<00:01:46.710> about<00:01:46.740> this

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
right here so the cool thing about this

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.720 
right here so the cool thing about this
what<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.220> might<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.490> already<00:01:47.610> noticed

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
what you might have already noticed

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.160 
what you might have already noticed
because<00:01:48.150> I've<00:01:48.240> been<00:01:48.300> jumping<00:01:48.480> around<00:01:48.660> it<00:01:48.960> is

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
because I've been jumping around it is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.400 
because I've been jumping around it is
that<00:01:49.830> they<00:01:50.100> don't<00:01:50.250> need<00:01:50.580> blocks<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:52.140> it's

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
that they don't need blocks so one it's

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.110 
that they don't need blocks so one it's
gonna<00:01:52.560> look<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.830> lot<00:01:52.980> nicer<00:01:53.160> and<00:01:53.580> it's<00:01:53.880> actually

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
gonna look a lot nicer and it's actually

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.850 
gonna look a lot nicer and it's actually
very<00:01:54.300> accessible<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:55.080> make<00:01:55.230> these<00:01:55.410> I<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.590> put

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
very accessible to make these I just put

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.230 
very accessible to make these I just put
it<00:01:55.950> out<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.160> here<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.670> actually<00:01:56.820> see

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
it out of here so you can actually see

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.570 
it out of here so you can actually see
they<00:01:57.840> act<00:01:58.080> as<00:01:58.350> platforms<00:01:58.980> generally<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.520> you

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
they act as platforms generally as you

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.370 
they act as platforms generally as you
can<00:01:59.700> see<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.970> face<00:02:00.120> like<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.360> platform<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.170> it's

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
can see it face like a platform and it's

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.020 
can see it face like a platform and it's
on<00:02:01.500> top<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.010> so<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.520> actually<00:02:02.640> makes<00:02:02.910> it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
on top of it so it actually makes it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.820 
on top of it so it actually makes it
really<00:02:03.210> easy<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.690> also<00:02:03.930> set<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.410> you<00:02:04.650> can

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
really easy to also set it up you can

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.010 
really easy to also set it up you can
basically<00:02:05.070> fly<00:02:05.640> underneath<00:02:06.090> them<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:06.750> just

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
basically fly underneath them and just

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.510 
basically fly underneath them and just
drop<00:02:07.350> down<00:02:07.590> when<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.130> go<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> another

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
drop down when you want to go to another

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.580 
drop down when you want to go to another
one<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.479> setup<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.200> gonna<00:02:10.320> help

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
one so the setup of this is gonna help

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.350 
one so the setup of this is gonna help
out<00:02:10.740> greatly<00:02:11.130> if<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.490> want<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.760> create<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.120> farm

or anything also noted that just because
it's<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.420> Silverthorne<00:02:16.110> planter<00:02:16.590> box<00:02:17.000> doesn't

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
it's a Silverthorne planter box doesn't

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.550 
it's a Silverthorne planter box doesn't
mean<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.270> can't<00:02:18.540> plant<00:02:18.870> any<00:02:19.110> seed<00:02:19.410> you

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
mean that you can't plant any seed you

one you can plant any sea that you want
any<00:02:21.840> type<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.230> these<00:02:22.410> planter<00:02:22.770> boxes<00:02:23.130> they<00:02:23.580> all

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
any type of these planter boxes they all

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.340 
any type of these planter boxes they all
are<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.720> for<00:02:24.989> show

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
are just for show

generally what their names are and what

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.220 
generally what their names are and what
they<00:02:28.650> look<00:02:28.890> like<00:02:29.060> but<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.330> cool<00:02:30.600> thing<00:02:30.630> about

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
they look like but the cool thing about

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.449 
they look like but the cool thing about
the<00:02:32.810> Silverthorne<00:02:33.810> planter<00:02:34.470> boxes<00:02:34.920> here<00:02:35.220> is

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
the Silverthorne planter boxes here is

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.479 
the Silverthorne planter boxes here is
that<00:02:35.970> if<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.270> play<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.600> up<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:37.320> seven<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.340> them

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
that if you play it up to seven of them

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.510 
that if you play it up to seven of them
I<00:02:38.670> believe<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.150> seven<00:02:39.630> it'll<00:02:40.500> count<00:02:41.100> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
I believe it is seven it'll count the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.150 
I believe it is seven it'll count the
biome<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.239> plant<00:02:42.540> them<00:02:42.690> on<00:02:42.870> as<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.290> snow

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
biome that you plant them on as a snow

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.670 
biome that you plant them on as a snow
biome<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:45.060> snow<00:02:45.660> creatures<00:02:46.110> will<00:02:46.320> actually

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
biome and snow creatures will actually

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.650 
biome and snow creatures will actually
spawn<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.370> if<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:47.850> raining<00:02:48.120> it'll<00:02:48.510> turn

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
spawn and if it's raining it'll turn

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.690 
spawn and if it's raining it'll turn
into<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.959> blizzard<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.709> get<00:02:49.890> golems

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
into a blizzard and you can get golems

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.490 
into a blizzard and you can get golems
from<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.090> too<00:02:51.330> if<00:02:51.510> you're<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.840> hard<00:02:52.019> mode<00:02:52.080> so

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
from it too if you're in hard mode so

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.050 
from it too if you're in hard mode so
that<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:53.130> actually<00:02:53.400> an<00:02:53.459> interesting<00:02:53.640> fact

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
that is actually an interesting fact

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.699 
that is actually an interesting fact
that<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.299> actually<00:02:54.450> counts<00:02:54.930> as<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.049> blocks<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
that it actually counts as a blocks and

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.940 
that it actually counts as a blocks and
it<00:02:55.799> will<00:02:56.480> cause<00:02:57.480> snow<00:02:57.870> creatures<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.470> spawn<00:02:58.739> if

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
it will cause snow creatures to spawn if

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.430 
it will cause snow creatures to spawn if
you<00:02:59.100> plant<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.760> down<00:02:59.880> there<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.750> definitely

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
you plant it down there but definitely

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.900 
you plant it down there but definitely
really<00:03:01.739> cool<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.010> can<00:03:02.130> see<00:03:02.250> if<00:03:02.370> they<00:03:02.459> act<00:03:02.640> just

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
really cool you can see if they act just

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.340 
really cool you can see if they act just
the<00:03:02.940> same<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.390> can<00:03:03.510> see<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> mile<00:03:04.080> in<00:03:04.200> mine

the water leaf it's gonna have the plant

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.539 
the water leaf it's gonna have the plant
sticking<00:03:18.630> out<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.040> but<00:03:20.040> when<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.250> put<00:03:20.430> it

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
sticking out of it but when you put it

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.670 
sticking out of it but when you put it
down<00:03:20.580> here<00:03:21.150> as<00:03:21.299> you<00:03:21.570> see<00:03:21.750> it's<00:03:22.110> obviously<00:03:22.530> not

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
down here as you see it's obviously not

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.320 
down here as you see it's obviously not
going<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.890> do<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.220> course<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.150> could

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
going to do that course you could

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.750 
going to do that course you could
connect<00:03:24.690> them<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.110> that's<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.070> bit<00:03:26.280> each<00:03:26.519> one

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
connect them and that's a bit each one

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.630 
connect them and that's a bit each one
of<00:03:26.850> these<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.209> 20<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.810> 25<00:03:28.470> planter<00:03:29.250> boxes

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
of these is like 20 to 25 planter boxes

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.180 
of these is like 20 to 25 planter boxes
just<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.299> know<00:03:30.540> because<00:03:31.230> each<00:03:31.709> one<00:03:31.980> is

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
just so you know because each one is

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.830 
just so you know because each one is
this<00:03:32.370> big<00:03:32.610> each<00:03:32.820> one<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.209> size<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.660> clay

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
this big each one is the size of a clay

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.229 
this big each one is the size of a clay
pot<00:03:34.049> obviously<00:03:34.709> it's<00:03:34.890> it's<00:03:35.070> it's<00:03:35.760> pretty<00:03:36.030> tiny

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
pot obviously it's it's it's pretty tiny

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.240 
pot obviously it's it's it's pretty tiny
so<00:03:37.019> this<00:03:37.230> is<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.380> lot<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.709> them<00:03:37.799> connected

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
so this is a lot of them connected

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.220 
so this is a lot of them connected
together<00:03:38.370> here<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.030> actually<00:03:39.720> connect<00:03:40.140> them

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
together here and actually connect them

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.090 
together here and actually connect them
and<00:03:40.350> make<00:03:40.440> them<00:03:40.560> look<00:03:40.650> real<00:03:40.860> cool<00:03:41.040> but

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
and make them look real cool but

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.640 
and make them look real cool but
definitely<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.120> think<00:03:42.239> pretty<00:03:42.930> cool<00:03:43.140> like<00:03:43.560> I

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
definitely I think pretty cool like I

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.280 
definitely I think pretty cool like I

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
said you get them after killing

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.350 
said you get them after killing
Horrible<00:03:45.739> Bosses<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.370> start<00:03:46.610> unlocking<00:03:46.969> more

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
Horrible Bosses you start unlocking more

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.530
