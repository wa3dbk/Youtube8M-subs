it's<00:00:02.190> really<00:00:02.490> straightforward<00:00:03.360> actually

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
it's really straightforward actually

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.320 
it's really straightforward actually
using<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.890> standard<00:00:07.890> emitter<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.330> some

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
using the standard emitter and some

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.200 
using the standard emitter and some
cloth<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.590> have<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.800> piece<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.190> paper<00:00:11.280> just

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
cloth so I have a piece of paper just

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.289 
cloth so I have a piece of paper just
made<00:00:12.360> out<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.630> plane<00:00:12.980> I'm<00:00:13.980> gonna<00:00:14.309> make<00:00:14.519> it

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
made out of a plane I'm gonna make it

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.820 
made out of a plane I'm gonna make it
85<00:00:16.170> by<00:00:17.570> 110<00:00:18.570> just<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.650> rough

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
85 by 110 just to get the rough

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.460 
85 by 110 just to get the rough
proportions<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.880> my<00:00:21.779> width<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.289> height

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
proportions and my width and height

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.109 
proportions and my width and height
segments<00:00:22.920> I'm<00:00:23.039> just<00:00:23.189> gonna<00:00:23.310> knock<00:00:23.519> down<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.910> 10

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
segments I'm just gonna knock down to 10

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.359 
segments I'm just gonna knock down to 10
because<00:00:24.560> we<00:00:25.560> don't<00:00:25.740> really<00:00:25.859> need<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.130> much

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
because we don't really need that much

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.339 
because we don't really need that much
that<00:00:29.369> many<00:00:29.550> polygons<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:31.019> what<00:00:31.109> I'm<00:00:31.199> going<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
that many polygons and what I'm going to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.530 
that many polygons and what I'm going to
do<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.619> I'm<00:00:31.859> gonna<00:00:32.070> make<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.550> editable<00:00:33.120> right

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
do is I'm gonna make it editable right

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.720 
do is I'm gonna make it editable right
away<00:00:33.719> by<00:00:33.899> pressing<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.290> C<00:00:34.500> key<00:00:34.710> or<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.399> button

over<00:00:35.880> here<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:37.670> then<00:00:38.670> we'll<00:00:38.790> get<00:00:39.140> straight

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
over here and then we'll get straight

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.209 
over here and then we'll get straight
into<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.309> cloth<00:00:41.579> tab<00:00:41.940> we'll<00:00:42.870> go<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.219> cloth

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
into the cloth tab we'll go in cloth

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.119 
into the cloth tab we'll go in cloth
tags<00:00:44.899> cloth<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.730> with<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.940> selected<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:49.129> can

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
tags cloth and with that selected we can

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.740 
tags cloth and with that selected we can
come<00:00:50.399> over<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.329> first<00:00:51.360> thing<00:00:51.600> I'm

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
come over here and the first thing I'm

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.709 
come over here and the first thing I'm
going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.410> under<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> Forces<00:00:53.489> tab<00:00:53.719> in

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
going to do is under the Forces tab in

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.090 
going to do is under the Forces tab in
the<00:00:54.870> tag<00:00:55.079> tab<00:00:55.350> I'm<00:00:55.590> gonna<00:00:55.800> leave<00:00:55.980> everything

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the tag tab I'm gonna leave everything

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.540 
the tag tab I'm gonna leave everything
stiffness<00:00:56.910> 100<00:00:57.629> flexi<00:00:58.170> oh<00:00:59.120> yeah<00:01:00.559> 25<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:02.100> don't

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
stiffness 100 flexi oh yeah 25 I don't

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.149 
stiffness 100 flexi oh yeah 25 I don't
really<00:01:02.699> care<00:01:03.359> about<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.629> right<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:04.159> forces

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
really care about that right now forces

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.590 
really care about that right now forces
however<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.640> gonna<00:01:05.790> remove<00:01:06.090> gravity

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
however I'm gonna remove gravity

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.380 
however I'm gonna remove gravity
entirely<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.380> put<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:07.799> zero<00:01:08.390> wind

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
entirely and put it at zero wind

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.810 
entirely and put it at zero wind
direction<00:01:09.540> X<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> leave<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:10.979> zero<00:01:11.220> Y

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
direction X I'm going to leave at zero Y

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.190 
direction X I'm going to leave at zero Y
I'm<00:01:12.240> gonna<00:01:12.420> put<00:01:12.689> at<00:01:12.900> about<00:01:14.450> one<00:01:15.450> point<00:01:15.720> one

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
I'm gonna put at about one point one

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.310 
I'm gonna put at about one point one
point<00:01:17.009> five<00:01:17.369> maybe<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.750> gonna<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:19.080> how

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
point five maybe this is gonna be how

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.020 
point five maybe this is gonna be how
much<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.680> rises<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.710> wind<00:01:22.950> direction<00:01:23.159> for

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
much it rises and the wind direction for

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.289 
much it rises and the wind direction for
Zed<00:01:24.570> I'll<00:01:24.930> leave<00:01:25.229> at<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.299> I'm

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
Zed I'll leave at one for now and I'm

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.230 
Zed I'll leave at one for now and I'm
just<00:01:27.450> gonna<00:01:27.570> leave<00:01:28.850> leave<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> other

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
just gonna leave leave all the other

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
just gonna leave leave all the other
things<00:01:30.630> wind<00:01:31.259> strength<00:01:31.500> sorry<00:01:31.860> I'm<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.220> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
things wind strength sorry I'm going to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.640 
things wind strength sorry I'm going to
put<00:01:32.460> at<00:01:32.610> about<00:01:33.000> 0.5<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:36.229> then<00:01:37.229> I'm<00:01:37.350> gonna<00:01:37.470> go

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
put at about 0.5 and then I'm gonna go

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.730 
put at about 0.5 and then I'm gonna go
and<00:01:37.829> get<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:38.009> emitter<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:41.659> I'll<00:01:42.659> rotate<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.439> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and get my emitter and I'll rotate it so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
and get my emitter and I'll rotate it so
that<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.729> pointing<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.360> I'm<00:01:45.509> pressing

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
that it's is pointing up I'm pressing

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.410 
that it's is pointing up I'm pressing
shift<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:47.850> snap

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
shift to get it to snap

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.139 
shift to get it to snap
so<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.290> rotated<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.829> 90<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.640> now<00:01:50.729> it's<00:01:50.970> going

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
so it's rotated up 90 so now it's going

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.399 
so it's rotated up 90 so now it's going
to<00:01:51.180> shoot<00:01:51.390> straight<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:54.020> what's<00:01:55.020> happening

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
to shoot straight up what's happening

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.709 
to shoot straight up what's happening
now<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.549> see<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.119> don't<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:57.659> you

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
now is if you see I don't know if you

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.990 
now is if you see I don't know if you
notice<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.049> our<00:01:58.500> plane<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.369> lifting<00:01:59.759> on<00:01:59.850> its

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
notice but our plane is lifting on its

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.300 
notice but our plane is lifting on its
own<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:01.020> not<00:02:01.290> an<00:02:01.500> emitter<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.130> just

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
own it's not an emitter but it's just

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.090 
own it's not an emitter but it's just
what<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.520> cloth<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:03.000> doing<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:04.920> was

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
what the cloth is doing that was

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.330 
what the cloth is doing that was
happening<00:02:05.369> before<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.670> put<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.969> emitter<00:02:06.210> there

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
happening before I put the emitter there

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.889 
happening before I put the emitter there
so<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.610> roughly<00:02:08.940> see<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.300> shape<00:02:09.539> we're

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
so you can roughly see the shape we're

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.479 
so you can roughly see the shape we're
gonna<00:02:10.020> get

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
gonna get

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.880 
gonna get
now<00:02:11.970> I'll<00:02:12.120> take<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.540> plane<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.230> I'll<00:02:13.620> make

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
now I'll take that plane and I'll make

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.059 
now I'll take that plane and I'll make
it<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.129> child<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.670> emitter<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.950> under<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
it a child of the emitter and under the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.199 
it a child of the emitter and under the
emitter<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.519> have<00:02:17.730> birthrate<00:02:18.690> ten<00:02:19.700> render<00:02:20.700> ten

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
emitter we have birthrate ten render ten

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.570 
emitter we have birthrate ten render ten
and<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:22.140> let's<00:02:22.410> just<00:02:22.620> wait<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.010> many<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.340> mean

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
and that let's just wait to many I mean

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.180 
and that let's just wait to many I mean
if<00:02:24.360> we<00:02:24.569> go<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.750> show<00:02:25.349> objects<00:02:25.800> here<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.099> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
if we go to show objects here in the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.130 
if we go to show objects here in the
emitter<00:02:26.370> we're<00:02:27.180> gonna<00:02:27.330> have<00:02:27.569> they're<00:02:28.019> gonna

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
emitter we're gonna have they're gonna

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.020 
emitter we're gonna have they're gonna
be<00:02:28.319> colliding<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> simple<00:02:29.670> emitter

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
be colliding and with a simple emitter

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.830 
be colliding and with a simple emitter
you<00:02:30.300> don't<00:02:30.510> have<00:02:30.690> any<00:02:30.810> collision<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:33.360> we<00:02:33.510> we

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
you don't have any collision so we we

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.449 
you don't have any collision so we we
can't<00:02:34.080> do<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.380> unless<00:02:34.620> we<00:02:34.860> switch<00:02:35.220> over<00:02:35.340> to

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
can't do that unless we switch over to

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.360 
can't do that unless we switch over to
thinking<00:02:35.849> particles<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:37.380> I'm<00:02:38.040> gonna<00:02:38.160> knock

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
thinking particles so I'm gonna knock

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.020 
thinking particles so I'm gonna knock
that<00:02:38.400> down<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.849> like<00:02:38.880> two<00:02:39.950> which<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.160> still<00:02:41.459> a

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
that down to like two which is still a

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.100 
that down to like two which is still a
nice<00:02:43.340> amount<00:02:44.340> really<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.209> we're<00:02:45.900> still

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
nice amount really and we're still

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.740 
nice amount really and we're still
probably<00:02:46.319> gonna<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:46.830> collision<00:02:47.340> issues<00:02:47.750> I'm

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
probably gonna have collision issues I'm

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.800 
probably gonna have collision issues I'm
gonna<00:02:48.959> slow<00:02:49.200> down<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.440> life<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:50.390> mean<00:02:51.390> sorry

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
gonna slow down the life I mean sorry

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.670 
gonna slow down the life I mean sorry
not<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.110> lifetime<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.739> bead<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.519> about<00:02:53.819> 100

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
not the lifetime this bead to about 100

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.740 
not the lifetime this bead to about 100
for<00:02:55.680> now<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:56.280> rotation<00:02:56.880> I'm<00:02:59.599> I'm<00:03:00.599> gonna

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
for now and rotation I'm I'm gonna

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.100 
for now and rotation I'm I'm gonna
switch<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:02.700> don't<00:03:03.150> know<00:03:03.269> maybe<00:03:03.450> 15<00:03:03.930> percent

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
switch to I don't know maybe 15 percent

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.449 
switch to I don't know maybe 15 percent
right<00:03:04.530> now<00:03:04.709> with<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.069> hundred<00:03:05.370> percent

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
right now with a hundred percent

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.270 
right now with a hundred percent
variation<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:08.250> now<00:03:08.489> we'll<00:03:08.730> see<00:03:10.130> we'll<00:03:11.130> have<00:03:11.160> a

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
variation and now we'll see we'll have a

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.220 
variation and now we'll see we'll have a
nice<00:03:11.459> variation<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.599> we're<00:03:12.900> still<00:03:13.140> getting

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
nice variation and we're still getting

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.020 
nice variation and we're still getting
too<00:03:13.530> many<00:03:13.650> coming<00:03:14.069> out<00:03:14.190> because<00:03:14.880> they're

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
too many coming out because they're

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.500 
too many coming out because they're
moving<00:03:15.150> too<00:03:15.480> fast<00:03:17.000> but<00:03:18.000> I'll<00:03:18.120> knock<00:03:18.329> it<00:03:18.359> down

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
moving too fast but I'll knock it down

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.840 
moving too fast but I'll knock it down
to<00:03:18.660> one<00:03:19.049> for<00:03:19.769> now<00:03:19.889> just<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.280> play<00:03:20.459> around<00:03:20.670> with

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
to one for now just to play around with

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.520 
to one for now just to play around with
it<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:22.819> then<00:03:23.819> I'm<00:03:23.880> gonna<00:03:24.000> add<00:03:24.209> wind<00:03:24.540> also<00:03:25.139> from

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
it and then I'm gonna add wind also from

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.770 
it and then I'm gonna add wind also from
the<00:03:25.650> emitters<00:03:25.980> here<00:03:27.109> and<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:30.389> important

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
the emitters here and the important

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.550 
the emitters here and the important
thing<00:03:30.810> with<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.200> wind<00:03:31.410> is<00:03:33.319> well<00:03:34.319> it's<00:03:34.440> gonna

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
thing with the wind is well it's gonna

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.099 
thing with the wind is well it's gonna
blow<00:03:34.829> it<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> side<00:03:35.370> for<00:03:35.400> us<00:03:35.670> of<00:03:36.060> course<00:03:36.420> but

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
blow it to the side for us of course but

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.960 
blow it to the side for us of course but
more<00:03:37.230> specifically<00:03:37.889> we<00:03:38.519> want<00:03:38.730> some<00:03:38.940> fall-off

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
more specifically we want some fall-off

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.879 
more specifically we want some fall-off
so<00:03:41.970> I'm<00:03:42.060> gonna<00:03:42.209> go<00:03:42.780> into<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.260> wind<00:03:43.440> object

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
so I'm gonna go into the wind object

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.629 
so I'm gonna go into the wind object
turn<00:03:44.519> on<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.730> fall<00:03:44.910> off<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.889> make<00:03:46.889> it<00:03:46.920> a

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
turn on the fall off and make it a

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:54.650 
turn on the fall off and make it a
sphere<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:49.380> just<00:03:50.010> stretch<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.519> out<00:03:53.389> as<00:03:54.389> far

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
sphere and just stretch that out as far

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.660 
sphere and just stretch that out as far
as<00:03:54.750> we<00:03:54.870> need<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.139> go<00:03:55.260> there<00:03:55.560> doesn't<00:03:56.489> really

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
as we need to go there doesn't really

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.890 
as we need to go there doesn't really
matter<00:03:56.910> at<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:57.180> point<00:03:57.329> but<00:03:57.900> we<00:03:58.440> can<00:03:59.900> we're

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
matter at this point but we can we're

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.500 
matter at this point but we can we're
gonna<00:04:00.989> see<00:04:01.380> our<00:04:01.650> our<00:04:02.579> paper<00:04:02.819> going<00:04:03.180> I'll<00:04:03.359> make

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
gonna see our our paper going I'll make

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.210 
gonna see our our paper going I'll make
the<00:04:03.720> animation<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.170> little<00:04:04.319> bit<00:04:04.410> longer<00:04:04.650> say

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
the animation a little bit longer say

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.569 
the animation a little bit longer say
300<00:04:05.790> frames<00:04:06.739> and<00:04:07.739> I'm<00:04:08.010> gonna<00:04:08.160> make<00:04:08.370> sure<00:04:08.400> my

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
300 frames and I'm gonna make sure my

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.580 
300 frames and I'm gonna make sure my
emitter<00:04:08.940> is<00:04:09.209> actually<00:04:09.569> going<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.840> emit<00:04:10.079> for

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
emitter is actually going to emit for

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.190 
emitter is actually going to emit for
300<00:04:11.069> frames

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:23.690 

and<00:04:17.680> there<00:04:18.680> we<00:04:18.799> go

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.070 

and<00:04:24.210> they're<00:04:24.360> all<00:04:24.480> just<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.810> little<00:04:24.930> bit

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
and they're all just a little bit

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.500 
and they're all just a little bit
different<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:26.070> can<00:04:26.220> up<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.820> render<00:04:27.060> now<00:04:27.330> that

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
different you can up the render now that

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.530 
different you can up the render now that
we<00:04:27.600> have<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.990> moving<00:04:28.230> a<00:04:28.530> little<00:04:28.980> bit<00:04:29.100> further

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
we have the moving a little bit further

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.460 
we have the moving a little bit further
the<00:04:30.540> birthrate<00:04:30.960> render<00:04:31.320> so<00:04:33.230> you're<00:04:34.230> gonna<00:04:34.320> get

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
the birthrate render so you're gonna get

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.910 
the birthrate render so you're gonna get
a<00:04:34.530> few<00:04:34.770> more<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:36.140> since<00:04:37.140> we're<00:04:37.350> using<00:04:37.380> simple

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
a few more and since we're using simple

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.160 
a few more and since we're using simple
particles<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.940> can<00:04:38.970> put<00:04:39.270> in<00:04:39.390> turbulence<00:04:39.930> or

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
particles you can put in turbulence or

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.640 
particles you can put in turbulence or
gravity<00:04:40.650> or<00:04:41.040> whatever<00:04:41.310> else<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:41.610> choose
