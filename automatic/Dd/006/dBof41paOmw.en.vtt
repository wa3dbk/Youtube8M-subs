00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.740
 hello today, prepare sautéed vegetables 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:12.459
 accompanied by mushrooms in this case 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.740
 perretxikos zucchini ingredients 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.650
 leek and carrot artichokes and 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.850
 green asparagus and the mushrooms that 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.850
 clean with a damp cloth 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.290
 then we skipped the perretxikos in the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.290
 pan with a little oil 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.530
 and we reserve them 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.310
 now we cut the vegetables 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.410
 the artichokes have to be peeled 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.850
 previously until uncovering 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.850
 the most tender leaves 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.520
 we also peel the stem 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.520
 and finally we cut the tip 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.549
 next we are going to steam 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.549
 all the vegetables 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.250
 we add salt in the middle of cooking and 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.190
 the 15 minutes and 25 the artichokes the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.560
 we remove 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.780
 and we sauté it in a pan with some 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.650
 chopped garlic and a little oil 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.990
 then we add the mushrooms 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.990
 we sauté everything together a couple of minutes 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.980
 and we serve on the plate accompanying 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.980
 vegetables with a little salt in flakes 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.020
 and that's it until soon
