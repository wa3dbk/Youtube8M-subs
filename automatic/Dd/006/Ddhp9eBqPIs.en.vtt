00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 you know there are games that 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.589
 enjoys an hour has passed 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.299
 incredible and sometimes we do not understand 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.710
 really why me I have two big 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.710
 chestnut trees in this area it's 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.690
 mirror's edge 2 that the whole earth 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.009
 seems to wait so that no one has 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.990
 bought the first mirror's edge 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.310
 not does not point the finger at me like that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.189
 I even bought two months time 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.750
 but version on ps3 was scratched and star 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.449
 wars battlefront which is very 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.250
 different but finally we are a little 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.470
 surprised and quite a few days and say 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.460
 also why so many expectations in 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.920
 knowing that the first two 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.780
 battlefront was good but no more he 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.850
 had not managed to forge images of 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.010
 cult games but yet this star wars 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.320
 battlefront when it was announced to 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.950
 the e3 we went from 3 amea the three 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.149
 previous ones it was not a bit or even 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.590
 says regular battlefront trick of phew 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.870
 but no battlefront that's never a 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.780
 absolutely amazing series and I have beautiful 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.910
 have very good memories I had 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.190
 a little trouble to understand it so I 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.760
 seen star wars battlefront 2 in promo on 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.920
 steam 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.719
 the servers are closed but I am 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.309
 went I'm going back in I had 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.659
 done during my childhood and I'm going 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.150
 try to go and see what can 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.270
 justify then already it is very very 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.460
 beautiful on pc I did on playstation 2 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.259
 at the time I do them on pc and the game 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.470
 stay pretty pretty knowing who is 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.240
 released at 9 I would say it remains very 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.310
 pretty and it surprised me a lot after 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.950
 I was also surprised by the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.210
 missions that are pretty scripted that 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.000
 it is true that it has brought something very 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.430
 nice but eventually the game stays 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.200
 nice but no more it's not that that will 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.060
 explain such an aitor I was 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.530
 look for a little bit in in 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.420
 ribs and a little bit less pure gaming 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.540
 and you have to learn that star wars 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.270
 battlefront battlefront first name 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.040
 it was in his day the game of the series 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.280
 star wars the best-selling of all 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.380
 time 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.909
 the game that has sold the most house 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.100
 it's still a little blue feat 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.649
 the games that were made on the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.800
 licensed star wars had a lot and 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.260
 this sale 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.550
 pretty gargantuan that his sales enough 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.860
 gargantuan for this first 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.390
 battlefront is explained in my opinion by 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.750
 three phenomena already the game was 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.520
 rather good it necessarily helps 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.040
 secondly the game havel advantage 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.260
 to offer the consolers a steam game 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.910
 battlefield on consoles while at 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.860
 the time it had very little 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.990
 Battlefield 2 on Playstation 2 Modern 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.940
 warfare so it seems to me that those not 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.740
 Battlefield 2 will moderate stuffing or ps2 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.480
 correct me if I'm wrong finally brief 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.820
 the battlefield 2 that had been focused on 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.560
 ps2 was not at all up to the 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.720
 battlefield 2 on pc so here are the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.460
 consoling have they had wall we want with 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.470
 battlefront a kind of game that does not 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.390
 did not necessarily know and especially 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.340
 Well, it's pretty funny when we 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.680
 provides information on timing but 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.350
 first battlefront of the name came out in 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.300
 it seems to me when leaving the 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.590
 dvd set of the first trilogy the 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.810
 older star wars so 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.490
 inevitably date timing is by the way 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.500
 also find that when we do 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.870
 watch the battlefront ii is out 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.790
 bench these buses and world output dvd 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.280
 or release in room of the last star wars 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.540
 as of third but it coincides with 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.310
 level of dates which also explains 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.470
 that it's made of pretty good sales 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.870
 and it's funny to see that in the end 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.760
 can rouzier than this battlefront the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.080
 reboot that remains to come out in 2015 and 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.510
 well yes what is planned too 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.550
 in December 2015 20 km / hour they 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.040
 be pushed back in May 2016 and well 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.959
 this is the star wars 7 of disney and yeah 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.760
 once again electronic art decided 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.410
 by an excellent sense of timing 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.180
 we already do you the fact that the game is 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.190
 sold well explains in great 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.690
 party the hype 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.160
 especially since I imagine that I'm not the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.110
 only to have spanked battlefront when 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.450
 I was a kid and idealize it by 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.390
 following I see a lot of players who 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.620
 had to do it when they had between 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.420
 I'll make a fork 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.630
 voluntarily very very largely between 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.180
 5 and 15 years old he came out 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.600
 if I do not deceive in 2005 the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.230
 battlefront 2 this yes seems to me in 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.959
 2005 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.310
 so here we can imagine players 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.360
 of just about every age that we have 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.660
 did but who knew him anyway 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.890
 in a period where 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.720
 we are a little more candid in the 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.430
 field of video gaming and finally with 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.260
 time we have a kind of nostalgic 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.670
 and settles in but times yes that makes me 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.160
 still really envy eh this 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.570
 battlefront and chronic'art wages said m 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.880
 a lot of budgets which is a 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.200
 excellent thing really it's dice who 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.780
 is at the controls with particular 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.970
 veterans of the battlefield series so 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.680
 because yes you have to know that dice 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.470
 it's a big topic it's a bit like 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:27.050
 when to bioware fossat or or naughty dog 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.610
 good is that studio arnaud but there is 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.340
 a lot of turnover there is a team 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.870
 go to a team b short should be wary 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.670
 now the development studios 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.950
 this become brands and idiots 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.570
 showed very well understood in any case 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.730
 good we can still say that it is a 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.080
 pledge of safety of the world so voila 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.110
 this frontil battle does a little bit 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.220
 to dream huh must admit in the end the 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.140
 hype can be understood 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.580
 especially that it turns on frosbite 3 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.160
 so to have them a very very game 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.780
 pretty and he may have an atmosphere 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.340
 absolutely terrible so I'm waiting 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.620
 really to see what it's going to give 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.500
 when I see the last battlefield that 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.910
 was for me during his beta after this 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.280
 are the complete game going to be excellent 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.790
 I do not know but a little shower 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.020
 cold 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.850
 we see that call of duty is a 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.390
 little bit losing speed well here 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:14.510
 we will have a fps a fps a little bit at the 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.340
 bf in quotes that will try 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.020
 to offer something different 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.400
 would it be thanks to his star universe 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.800
 wars and me who have a good affection 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.840
 for this universe I'm not an ultra 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.890
 big fan like some but that's it 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.140
 I like this universe 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.480
 Well, I have to admit that I leave 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.490
 myself take to this game of life that at 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.730
 departure left me rather indifferent 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.560
 and surprised so here in comments 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.030
 do not hesitate to say why you 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.580
 wait for battlefront because finally 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.560
 this video its purpose is rather to 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.660
 stimulate debate and interrogation rather 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.760
 than give a sliced ​​opinion one of this movie 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.290
 in live it is relatively difficult to 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.419
 explain but what are you waiting for this 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.919
 star wars battlefront why did you 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.960
 did you when you were little had it 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.940
 open the urfe bay meanwhile 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.320
 do you hope for something a little more 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.200
 original because finally the universe 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.280
 star wars it changes a bit of the fps 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.370
 classic military during our years 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.680
 our years 2010 and here it is 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.530
 not to give your expectations in comment 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.120
 I will be eager to read them question 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.650
 to write to me and a little about that me 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.910
 even I must confess when I see that 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.190
 I have a hype that would be around 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.630
 battlefront she has nothing objective is 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.040
 totally subjective and it plays into 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.080
 party on kid's memories 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.810
 here it is that's all for this video 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.490
 why battlefront iii star wars 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.650
 battlefront the reboot to as much hype 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.720
 in any case something tells me that 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.700
 electronic art is already selling 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.350
 thousands of thousands and thousands and 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.760
 thousands must understand videos 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.760
 go on that hi
