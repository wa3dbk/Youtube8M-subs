 Y 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.580
 I remember that my mom made us a 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.110
 honey water atole with very rich dough 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.450
 for all my brothers and then in 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.290
 those years was what they go wyk and without 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.290
 an excellent 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.129
 A) Yes 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.980
 we uncover it 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.030
 we solved with him the cocotte 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.200
 and deposit in the container 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.590
 Y 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.780
 for us the barbecue is something very 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.710
 important since it represents the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.720
 opportunity of power is to share with the 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.520
 people who visit us during our 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.400
 festivities throughout the year as well 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.870
 for us because this is a way of 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.030
 lifetime 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.820
 this tradition has around 100 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.320
 years our ancestors started 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.290
 make the barbecue square here that 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.170
 they did it in this place down here is 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.610
 the custom of making it the barbecue is 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.030
 something we do 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.940
 the just institutional regulation 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:43.340
 grant I go the permission to sell 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:46.640
 cured and natural pulques that 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:51.299
 properties of pulque are those of my 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.630
 Robust children eliminates diabetes 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.610
 stimulates sex and it's also 4 because 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.530

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.390
 pulque de san andrÃ©s because here they 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.390
 we name that they go to bed 2 and they wake up 3 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.900
 the people here from boyer was created with 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.620
 Pulque is very temperamental 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.620
 okay 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.150
 I feel that the square of the barbecue and 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.730
 the pulque is very important to attend 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.040
