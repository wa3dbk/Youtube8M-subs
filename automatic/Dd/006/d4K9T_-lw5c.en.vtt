00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.739
 Belarus winners

 which continues there in contact with 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 Sergey Fedorov is he 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.360
 worried citing sowed one of them 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.090

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.390
 approaching and benches 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.400

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.360
 offense demand joke 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.180
 finished so far 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.180
 to split fighters 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.260
 and we all understand Sergey Fedorov this 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.570
 something indicators 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.570
 with them really and 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.210
 not by chance 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.590
 Sergey Fedorov 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 very tough senate 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.400
 applied the court recognized 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.870
 against Fedor Fedorov 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.870
 low and if u talk to your 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.500
 with their names hundreds 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 district here it all is left 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.220
 tricks with impunity 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.590
 not Sergey Fedorov 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.590
 his actions here are explicable 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.070
 but can not be and did not succeed 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.880
 Sergey Fedorov 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.880
 nothing is absolutely clear 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.929
 Yes here 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.749
 I managed to issue a rival damage but here 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.469
 it's courage 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.469
 what are you Sergey Fedorov 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:19.759
 challenged rival tried 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:21.599
 prove yourself there are those who in 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.159
 general 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.069
 not too familiar 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.069
 causes nothing but 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.289
 Well, here he has a small such 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.289
 concentration and cinema 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:36.929
 that's what happened is a consequence of that 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.399
 That day missed this dirty 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.389
 they did not divide the reception because 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.749
 moment and nothing good continuation 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:46.119
 would not be 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:48.999
 on ice but not at this moment I missed 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:52.069
 I believe, that 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.479
 very significant flaws 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.459
 but now to the priest 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.899
 and secondly Petrov 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.899
 it makes sense but 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.229
 throughout the fullness of the information cube 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.299
 but only guess 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.299
 how much of a fine 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.029
