00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.700 

play<00:00:18.790> the<00:00:18.940> horn<00:00:19.090> -<00:00:19.300> shall<00:00:19.540> we

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.160 

and<00:00:23.250> off<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.430> go<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> if<00:00:24.360> you<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.630> see<00:00:24.870> on<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
and off you go and if you can see on the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.460 
and off you go and if you can see on the
platform<00:00:25.650> there<00:00:26.810> there<00:00:27.810> are<00:00:27.930> people<00:00:28.080> milling

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
platform there there are people milling

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.620 
platform there there are people milling
around<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.400> didn't<00:00:29.610> put<00:00:29.760> any<00:00:29.790> people

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.380 

object<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.950> editor<00:00:35.310> well<00:00:36.000> those<00:00:36.239> are

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
object and the editor well those are

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.120 
object and the editor well those are
people<00:00:36.660> associated<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.680> linear

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
people associated with that linear

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.119 
people associated with that linear
platform<00:00:38.790> object<00:00:39.150> will<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.390> created<00:00:41.720> and<00:00:43.129> if

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
platform object will be created and if

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.520 
platform object will be created and if
you<00:00:44.220> don't<00:00:44.400> put<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.580> down<00:00:45.140> this<00:00:46.140> isn't<00:00:46.440> going

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
you don't put that down this isn't going

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.439 
you don't put that down this isn't going
to<00:00:46.590> work<00:00:46.650> if<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.730> put<00:00:47.970> down<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
to work if you just put down the

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.560 
to work if you just put down the
platform<00:00:48.660> object<00:00:49.280> without<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.699> weird

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
platform object without that weird

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.880 
platform object without that weird
platform<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.710> top<00:00:54.350> you're<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.470> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> get

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
platform on top you're not going to get

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:13.410 
platform on top you're not going to get
any<00:00:56.070> success<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.610> your<00:00:56.850> scenarios

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.800 

so<00:01:13.720> I'll<00:01:13.840> stop<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.290> pick<00:01:14.470> these<00:01:14.560> people<00:01:14.620> up

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.920 

and<00:01:20.140> then<00:01:20.350> we<00:01:20.530> are<00:01:20.560> stationary<00:01:21.720> let's<00:01:22.720> go<00:01:22.869> to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
and then we are stationary let's go to

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.069 
and then we are stationary let's go to
the<00:01:23.110> outside<00:01:23.440> view

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.700 

see<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> little<00:01:29.009> squares<00:01:30.259> you<00:01:31.259> could<00:01:31.409> sink

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
see the little squares you could sink

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.679 
see the little squares you could sink
that<00:01:31.890> into<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> platform<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:33.060> little<00:01:33.539> bit

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
that into the platform just a little bit

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.130 
that into the platform just a little bit
more<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.140> wanted<00:01:34.469> to<00:01:35.179> all<00:01:36.179> right<00:01:36.329> we

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
more if you wanted to all right we

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.899 
more if you wanted to all right we
should<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.409> able<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.979> pick<00:01:38.219> up<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.429> passengers

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
should be able to pick up the passengers

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.310 
should be able to pick up the passengers
now

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.230 

and<00:01:44.740> there<00:01:44.920> we<00:01:45.040> go

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.800 

thanks<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.140> weird<00:01:50.010> checker<00:01:50.580> patent<00:01:50.940> we

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
thanks to this weird checker patent we

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.570 
thanks to this weird checker patent we
have<00:01:51.930> people<00:01:52.200> getting<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.770> off<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.980> train

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.640 

now<00:01:56.120> it<00:01:56.300> takes<00:01:56.510> about<00:01:56.630> 30<00:01:56.960> seconds<00:01:57.380> for<00:01:57.530> them

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
now it takes about 30 seconds for them

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.070 
now it takes about 30 seconds for them
to<00:01:57.770> get<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:58.220> off<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:59.390> we<00:01:59.510> just<00:01:59.660> mill<00:01:59.960> around

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
to get on and off so we just mill around

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.870 
to get on and off so we just mill around
here<00:02:00.530> for<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.740> moment

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.910 

again<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.510> could<00:02:05.660> use<00:02:05.720> any<00:02:06.170> kind<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.500> platform

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
again you could use any kind of platform

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.540 
again you could use any kind of platform
you<00:02:07.010> wanted<00:02:08.710> you<00:02:09.710> could<00:02:09.890> put<00:02:10.070> anything<00:02:10.340> on

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
you wanted you could put anything on

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.340 
you wanted you could put anything on
there<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:10.970> can<00:02:11.120> have<00:02:11.330> an<00:02:11.450> overpass<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:11.930> can

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
there you can have an overpass you can

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.960 
there you can have an overpass you can
do<00:02:12.440> whatever<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:13.010> want<00:02:13.220> with<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.520> platform

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
do whatever you want with the platform

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.810 
do whatever you want with the platform
as<00:02:14.210> long<00:02:14.360> as<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.600> put<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:15.830> linear<00:02:16.280> platform

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
as long as you put that linear platform

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.690 
as long as you put that linear platform
object<00:02:17.240> on<00:02:17.390> there<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.950> has<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.190> be<00:02:19.430> present

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
object on there it has to be present

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.190 
object on there it has to be present
either<00:02:19.910> on<00:02:20.060> one<00:02:20.090> side<00:02:20.450> or<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.870> other<00:02:20.900> it

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
either on one side or the other it

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.720 
either on one side or the other it
doesn't<00:02:21.230> matter<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:24.050> we're<00:02:24.230> done

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
doesn't matter and we're done

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.960 
doesn't matter and we're done
so<00:02:25.730> let's<00:02:26.150> go<00:02:26.300> off<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.420> our<00:02:26.600> destination

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.750 

over<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.510> Horning<00:02:33.780> yeah

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
over the Horning yeah

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.990 
over the Horning yeah
it's<00:02:36.150> improper<00:02:36.569> use<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.050> horn<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.379> know<00:02:37.530> but

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
it's improper use of the horn I know but

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.699 
it's improper use of the horn I know but
whatever

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
whatever

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.170 
whatever
there's<00:02:41.220> no<00:02:41.370> people<00:02:41.610> around<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:42.060> complain

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
there's no people around to complain

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.150 
there's no people around to complain
here

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:58.940 

so<00:02:46.490> we'll<00:02:46.850> just<00:02:47.090> go<00:02:47.270> around

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.140 

now<00:02:59.950> again<00:03:00.159> at<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.430> end<00:03:00.549> of<00:03:00.640> this<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:01.030> could

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
now again at the end of this you could

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.690 
now again at the end of this you could
put<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.599> shared<00:03:01.930> or<00:03:02.439> a<00:03:02.500> platformer<00:03:03.159> or<00:03:03.370> whatever

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
put a shared or a platformer or whatever

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.410 
put a shared or a platformer or whatever
you<00:03:03.849> wanted<00:03:04.150> it's<00:03:04.510> really<00:03:04.870> up<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:06.420> with
