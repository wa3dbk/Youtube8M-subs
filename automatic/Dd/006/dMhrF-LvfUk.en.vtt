00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
nice practical guitar skill to apply

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.390 
nice practical guitar skill to apply
immediately<00:00:16.699> in<00:00:17.539> your<00:00:17.599> playing<00:00:18.410> in<00:00:18.680> this

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
video I'm going to teach you how to tune

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.890 
video I'm going to teach you how to tune
your<00:00:20.960> guitar<00:00:21.160> perfectly<00:00:22.329> perfectly<00:00:23.329> without

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
your guitar perfectly perfectly without

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.280 
your guitar perfectly perfectly without
the<00:00:24.349> use<00:00:24.619> of<00:00:24.649> a<00:00:25.160> tuner<00:00:25.730> now<00:00:26.329> most<00:00:26.779> of<00:00:26.930> you<00:00:27.079> like

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
the use of a tuner now most of you like

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.290 
the use of a tuner now most of you like
to<00:00:27.500> use<00:00:27.739> this<00:00:28.129> method<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:31.550> guitar<00:00:31.879> is<00:00:32.059> out<00:00:32.180> of

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
to use this method the guitar is out of

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.920 
to use this method the guitar is out of
tune<00:00:32.450> on<00:00:32.840> purpose<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:34.850> five<00:00:35.090> five<00:00:35.329> five<00:00:35.539> four

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
tune on purpose the five five five four

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.770 
tune on purpose the five five five four
five<00:00:36.170> method<00:00:36.680> now<00:00:36.950> that's<00:00:37.370> a<00:00:37.520> nice<00:00:37.760> method<00:00:38.329> but

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
five method now that's a nice method but

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.470 
five method now that's a nice method but
it's<00:00:39.260> a<00:00:39.410> bit<00:00:39.590> impractical<00:00:40.010> why<00:00:40.640> because<00:00:41.270> you

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
it's a bit impractical why because you

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.510 
it's a bit impractical why because you
have<00:00:41.720> to<00:00:41.960> go<00:00:42.170> back<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:42.739> forth<00:00:43.010> from<00:00:43.310> the

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
have to go back and forth from the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.940 
have to go back and forth from the
strengths<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.390> tuning<00:00:44.750> pegs<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.620> have<00:00:45.829> to

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
strengths to the tuning pegs you have to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.170 
strengths to the tuning pegs you have to
let<00:00:46.160> go<00:00:46.190> of<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:47.000> note<00:00:47.239> for<00:00:47.780> example<00:00:48.940> so<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.060> out

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
let go of the note for example so it out

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.450 
let go of the note for example so it out
of<00:00:50.300> tune<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:50.899> you<00:00:51.230> let<00:00:51.470> go<00:00:51.710> of<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.040> note<00:00:52.250> and

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
of tune so you let go of the note and

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.729 
of tune so you let go of the note and
tune<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.420> string<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:53.989> then<00:00:54.170> go<00:00:54.350> back<00:00:54.710> and

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
tune the string and then go back and

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.560 
tune the string and then go back and
compare<00:00:55.280> them<00:00:55.430> again<00:00:56.380> waste<00:00:57.380> of<00:00:57.590> time<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.940> you

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
compare them again waste of time and you

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.569 
compare them again waste of time and you
let<00:00:59.780> go<00:00:59.809> of<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.170> note<00:01:00.350> so<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:00.590> have<00:01:00.950> no<00:01:01.250> point

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
let go of the note so you have no point

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.899 
let go of the note so you have no point
of<00:01:01.700> ongoing<00:01:02.180> comparison<00:01:03.020> or<00:01:03.489> some<00:01:04.489> people<00:01:04.640> do

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
of ongoing comparison or some people do

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.969 
of ongoing comparison or some people do
this

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
this

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.980 
this
okay<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.880> then<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.119> have<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.420> go<00:01:08.600> back<00:01:08.840> and

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
okay and then you have to go back and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.810 
okay and then you have to go back and
forth<00:01:09.289> from<00:01:09.649> playing<00:01:10.039> the<00:01:10.219> strengths<00:01:10.610> to

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
forth from playing the strengths to

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.490 
forth from playing the strengths to
tuning<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.539> playing<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.960> strengths<00:01:12.320> to

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
tuning to playing the strengths to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.560 
tuning to playing the strengths to
tuning<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.159> playing<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.640> strengths<00:01:13.909> which<00:01:14.420> is

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
tuning to playing the strengths which is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.200 
tuning to playing the strengths which is
even<00:01:14.960> more<00:01:15.320> uncomfortable<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.880> what<00:01:17.090> we're

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
even more uncomfortable so what we're

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.800 
even more uncomfortable so what we're
going<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.450> do<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:17.750> use<00:01:18.310> natural<00:01:19.310> harmonics<00:01:19.909> to

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
going to do is use natural harmonics to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:31.450 
going to do is use natural harmonics to
tune<00:01:21.020> our<00:01:21.289> guitar<00:01:21.679> like<00:01:22.100> this<00:01:23.530> here<00:01:24.530> that<00:01:30.460> the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
tune our guitar like this here that the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.120 
tune our guitar like this here that the
open<00:01:31.759> strings<00:01:32.060> can<00:01:32.270> be<00:01:32.299> played<00:01:32.719> the<00:01:33.679> notes<00:01:33.920> can

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
open strings can be played the notes can

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.709 
open strings can be played the notes can
be<00:01:34.189> played<00:01:34.490> in<00:01:34.640> natural<00:01:35.060> harmonics<00:01:35.539> and

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
be played in natural harmonics and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.059 
be played in natural harmonics and
that's<00:01:35.899> what<00:01:36.170> we're<00:01:36.350> going<00:01:36.469> to<00:01:36.560> use<00:01:36.649> now

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
that's what we're going to use now

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.339 
that's what we're going to use now
natural<00:01:37.579> harmonics<00:01:38.060> I'll<00:01:38.539> take<00:01:38.869> a<00:01:38.899> second<00:01:39.289> to

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:39.349 
natural harmonics I'll take a second to

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.859 
natural harmonics I'll take a second to
explain<00:01:39.470> if<00:01:39.830> you<00:01:39.920> don't<00:01:40.099> know<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:40.880> when<00:01:41.630> you

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
explain if you don't know is when you

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.130 
explain if you don't know is when you
place<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.140> finger<00:01:42.530> any<00:01:42.979> finger<00:01:43.849> on<00:01:44.030> top<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.929> the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
place a finger any finger on top of the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.940 
place a finger any finger on top of the
string<00:01:45.439> right<00:01:45.740> above<00:01:46.069> the<00:01:46.729> steel<00:01:47.149> fret

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
string right above the steel fret

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.589 
string right above the steel fret
exactly<00:01:48.950> above<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.369> steel<00:01:49.610> fret<00:01:49.970> on<00:01:50.149> five

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:50.599 
exactly above the steel fret on five

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.899 
exactly above the steel fret on five
seven<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.380> twelve<00:01:51.799> and<00:01:52.189> you<00:01:52.579> can<00:01:52.789> also

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
seven and twelve and you can also

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.880 
seven and twelve and you can also
produce<00:01:53.179> them<00:01:53.509> on<00:01:53.720> nine<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:54.079> four<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.829> three

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
produce them on nine and four and three

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.520 
produce them on nine and four and three
if<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:55.340> want<00:01:55.489> but<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:56.060> easiest<00:01:56.420> ones<00:01:56.810> are<00:01:57.170> on

if you want but the easiest ones are on

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.100 
if you want but the easiest ones are on
five<00:01:57.890> seven<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:58.729> twelve<00:01:58.970> try<00:01:59.420> just<00:01:59.780> put<00:02:00.079> a

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
five seven and twelve try just put a

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.620 
five seven and twelve try just put a
finger<00:02:00.380> on<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:01.039> string<00:02:01.159> don't<00:02:02.060> press<00:02:02.299> it<00:02:02.329> down

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
finger on the string don't press it down

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.359 
finger on the string don't press it down
just<00:02:03.079> touch<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.590> string<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.099> play<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:06.369> yeah

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
just touch the string and play it yeah

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.740 
just touch the string and play it yeah
you<00:02:07.429> can<00:02:07.549> do<00:02:07.819> a<00:02:07.849> lot<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.090> cool<00:02:08.360> stuff<00:02:08.690> with

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
you can do a lot of cool stuff with

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.120 
you can do a lot of cool stuff with
natural<00:02:09.229> harmonics<00:02:09.649> I'm<00:02:09.769> going<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:09.950> show<00:02:10.099> you

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
natural harmonics I'm going to show you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.160 
natural harmonics I'm going to show you
in<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.340> different<00:02:10.519> lesson<00:02:10.819> but<00:02:11.540> in<00:02:11.750> the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
in a different lesson but in the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.970 
in a different lesson but in the
meantime<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.900> produce<00:02:15.590> them<00:02:16.030> now<00:02:17.030> let's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
meantime just produce them now let's

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.699 
meantime just produce them now let's
start<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.130> masse<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:20.720> natural<00:02:21.079> harmonic<00:02:21.560> on

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
start the masse the natural harmonic on

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.050 
start the masse the natural harmonic on
five<00:02:22.220> on<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.910> ebay<00:02:23.420> string<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.370> same<00:02:25.609> note

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
five on the ebay string is the same note

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.190 
five on the ebay string is the same note
you<00:02:26.239> get<00:02:26.480> when<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.780> play<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.079> natural

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
you get when you play the natural

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.550 
you get when you play the natural
harmonic<00:02:27.739> on<00:02:27.859> seven<00:02:28.370> on<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.760> string<00:02:29.560> okay

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
harmonic on seven on the a string okay

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.180 
harmonic on seven on the a string okay
so<00:02:30.680> it's<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.130> same<00:02:31.370> note<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.799> if<00:02:33.799> the<00:02:33.920> guitar

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
so it's the same note and if the guitar

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.309 
so it's the same note and if the guitar
is<00:02:34.310> even<00:02:34.549> a<00:02:34.639> bit<00:02:34.850> out<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.030> tune<00:02:37.569> they<00:02:38.569> clash<00:02:38.900> and

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
is even a bit out of tune they clash and

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.800 
is even a bit out of tune they clash and
then<00:02:40.130> when<00:02:40.459> they<00:02:40.579> clash<00:02:40.850> let's<00:02:41.239> get<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.510> even

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
then when they clash let's get it even

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.180 
then when they clash let's get it even
more<00:02:43.450> just<00:02:44.450> tune<00:02:44.630> your<00:02:44.780> guitar<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.290> hear<00:02:46.010> them

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
more just tune your guitar and hear them

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.140 
more just tune your guitar and hear them
align<00:02:46.459> listen<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.269> it

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:03.640 

see<00:02:53.150> suddenly<00:02:54.140> it's<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.410> same<00:02:54.650> note

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.120 

here<00:03:04.650> them<00:03:04.800> aligned<00:03:06.350> it's<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.470> same<00:03:07.710> thing

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
here them aligned it's the same thing

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.580 
here them aligned it's the same thing
with<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.180> D<00:03:09.390> five<00:03:09.900> on<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.290> seven<00:03:10.860> on<00:03:10.950> D<00:03:12.590> that's

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
with a and D five on a seven on D that's

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.820 
with a and D five on a seven on D that's
tuned

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.009 

now<00:03:18.830> it's<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:20.650> got<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:23.510> same<00:03:23.720> thing

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
now it's you got it and the same thing

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.869 
now it's you got it and the same thing
on<00:03:24.290> G<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:24.800> D<00:03:26.890> same<00:03:27.890> thing<00:03:28.160> let's<00:03:28.489> get<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.760> out

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
on G and D same thing let's get it out

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.680 
on G and D same thing let's get it out
of<00:03:28.910> tune<00:03:32.709> here<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.860> Milan

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
of tune here the Milan

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.620 
of tune here the Milan
let's<00:03:35.690> get<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.050> g<00:03:36.260> string<00:03:36.530> out<00:03:36.650> of<00:03:36.769> tune<00:03:40.630> you

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
let's get the g string out of tune you

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.949 
let's get the g string out of tune you
hear<00:03:41.870> how<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.640> waveforms<00:03:43.640> align<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.780> sit

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
hear how the waveforms align to sit

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.960 
hear how the waveforms align to sit
together<00:03:46.599> and<00:03:48.130> then<00:03:49.130> what<00:03:49.459> do<00:03:49.549> you<00:03:49.640> do<00:03:49.790> with

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
together and then what do you do with

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.970 
together and then what do you do with
strings<00:03:50.330> 2<00:03:50.720> &amp;<00:03:50.930> 1<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:52.760> natural<00:03:53.630> harmonic<00:03:54.080> on<00:03:54.290> 7

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
strings 2 &amp; 1 the natural harmonic on 7

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.839 
strings 2 &amp; 1 the natural harmonic on 7
on<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.400> 6th<00:03:55.760> string<00:03:55.790> is<00:03:56.299> the<00:03:56.660> open<00:03:57.019> B<00:03:57.200> string

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
on the 6th string is the open B string

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:07.770 
on the 6th string is the open B string
ok<00:03:58.849> this<00:04:02.860> see<00:04:05.440> exactly<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.590> same<00:04:06.680> note<00:04:07.099> and

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
ok this see exactly the same note and

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.449 
ok this see exactly the same note and
the<00:04:08.780> natural<00:04:09.110> harmonic<00:04:09.500> on<00:04:09.620> 5<00:04:09.890> on<00:04:10.099> the<00:04:10.190> 6th

the natural harmonic on 5 on the 6th

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.970 
the natural harmonic on 5 on the 6th
string<00:04:10.670> is<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.180> E<00:04:11.209> string

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.620 

see

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.010 

and<00:04:19.580> then<00:04:20.580> you<00:04:20.700> can<00:04:20.850> check<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.150> out<00:04:21.270> and<00:04:21.570> see<00:04:21.900> if

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
and then you can check it out and see if

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.320 
and then you can check it out and see if
those<00:04:22.230> two<00:04:22.440> are<00:04:22.590> in<00:04:22.710> tune<00:04:22.920> by<00:04:23.280> using<00:04:23.700> five<00:04:24.120> and

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
those two are in tune by using five and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.090 
those two are in tune by using five and
seven<00:04:24.600> again<00:04:26.510> see<00:04:27.510> so<00:04:29.600> that's<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.810> method

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
seven again see so that's the method

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.570 
seven again see so that's the method
