00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.810 
closest thing to what we might see
coming<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:19.920> from<00:01:20.100> Sam<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
coming out from Sam it's going to be a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.429 
coming out from Sam it's going to be a
combination<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:21.810> now<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
combination of these now it's going to

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.219 
combination of these now it's going to
be<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.280> pebble<00:01:23.670> form<00:01:24.150> factor<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.840> think<00:01:25.140> it's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
be the pebble form factor I think it's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.929 
be the pebble form factor I think it's
gonna<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> very<00:01:25.619> nice<00:01:25.770> form<00:01:26.040> factor<00:01:26.460> it's

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
gonna be a very nice form factor it's

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.520 
gonna be a very nice form factor it's
going<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.360> functionality<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.290> Sony

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
