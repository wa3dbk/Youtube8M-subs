I<00:00:07.770> really<00:00:08.250> make<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.610> default<00:00:09.000> look<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.269> a

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
I really make the default look in a

I really make the default look in a
couple<00:00:09.420> videos<00:00:09.650> it's<00:00:10.650> not<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.340> default

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
hampa I could go all day with names but

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.800 
hampa I could go all day with names but
these<00:00:22.859> guys<00:00:23.010> out<00:00:23.250> there<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.789> know<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
these guys out there I know the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.179 
these guys out there I know the
realistic<00:00:25.199> development<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.920> did<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
realistic development going on did a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.450 
realistic development going on did a
Nancy<00:00:26.430> experience<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.449> default<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.340> guess<00:00:29.340> it

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
Nancy experience the default I guess it

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.720 
Nancy experience the default I guess it
just<00:00:29.490> seems<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.199> dwindle<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.590> know<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
just seems to dwindle you know so the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.660 
just seems to dwindle you know so the
only<00:00:32.850> things<00:00:33.059> i<00:00:33.149> use<00:00:33.420> were<00:00:33.660> wrecks<00:00:34.290> or<00:00:34.680> real

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
only things i use were wrecks or real

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.970 
only things i use were wrecks or real
diamond<00:00:35.969> extreme<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.360> mean<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:37.290> visual

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
diamond extreme I mean and a visual

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.260 
diamond extreme I mean and a visual
enhancement<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.579> i<00:00:38.700> downloaded<00:00:38.760> yesterday

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
enhancement that i downloaded yesterday

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.510 
enhancement that i downloaded yesterday
i<00:00:39.780> could<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.500> definitely<00:00:40.860> wrong<00:00:41.219> with<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
i could be definitely wrong with the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.819 
i could be definitely wrong with the
name<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:41.760> i<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.420> called<00:00:42.480> e<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.379> b

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
name but i think it's called e in b

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.670 
name but i think it's called e in b
series<00:00:44.579> i<00:00:44.969> guess<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.960> adds<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.230> little<00:00:46.320> bloom

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
series i guess it adds a little bloom

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.740 
series i guess it adds a little bloom
and<00:00:46.950> color<00:00:47.129> enhancement<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> little

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
and color enhancement I was a little

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.240 
and color enhancement I was a little
skeptical<00:00:49.079> about<00:00:49.379> installing<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.129> after

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
skeptical about installing it but after

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.119 
skeptical about installing it but after
really<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.789> about<00:00:50.850> five<00:00:51.180> seconds<00:00:51.750> I

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
really just about five seconds I

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.110 
really just about five seconds I
realized<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.250> did<00:00:53.370> nothing<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:53.760> enhanced

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
realized it did nothing but enhanced

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.150 
realized it did nothing but enhanced
shots<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.660> read<00:00:55.500> somewhere<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.039> was

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
shots I read somewhere that it was

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.920 
shots I read somewhere that it was
originally<00:00:56.730> an<00:00:56.820> enhancement<00:00:57.210> used<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.719> grand

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
originally an enhancement used for grand

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.830 
originally an enhancement used for grand
theft<00:00:57.989> auto<00:00:58.320> four<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> pc<00:00:59.520> but<00:01:00.359> again<00:01:00.809> i

theft auto four for the pc but again i
could<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.170> wrong<00:01:01.640> either<00:01:02.640> way<00:01:02.870> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
could be wrong either way the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.390 
could be wrong either way the
enhancements<00:01:04.379> nice<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.010> definitely
