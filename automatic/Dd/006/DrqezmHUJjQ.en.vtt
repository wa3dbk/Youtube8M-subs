00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.960
 both attack and defense around 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.250
 to raise a point 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.370
 why do we sit here with these 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.070
 frequencies should be reversed this 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.509
 critical explained only again to 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.310
 new starting point and the 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:23.089
 original output book when i am 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.169

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.359
 just say no 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.339
 now you have to defend we have to 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.279
 nothing at all but that's how the rules are 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.070

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.800
 like bernie and nobody comes for example 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.039
 weather ok then we defend ourselves 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.260
 you can like our sun wall 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.879
 if you want to do something stupid 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.769
 through my attacking reversal I would 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.600
 your thorns broke through and all 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:56.149

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.510
 spontaneously conjures pitch that is bad luck the 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:05.049
 hamas then you probably do not have 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:08.990
 bad but we also have a rule 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:22.790
 whoever wins must drink this potion 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:26.500

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.500

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.640
 wishes come true 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.200

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.910
 prague and we will come out again 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.060

 just as you say that kind of child now 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.400
