it's<00:01:14.760> good<00:01:14.910> in<00:01:15.120> a<00:01:15.210> sense<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.600> won't<00:01:15.750> fall<00:01:15.990> out

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
it's good in a sense it won't fall out

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.110 
it's good in a sense it won't fall out
so<00:01:16.980> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.160> really<00:01:17.400> kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.850> shake<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
so you can really kind of shake it

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.150 
so you can really kind of shake it
around<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.450> stuff<00:01:18.660> but<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.980> going<00:01:20.070> to

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
around and stuff but it's not going to

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.710 
around and stuff but it's not going to
yank<00:01:20.280> out<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.760> only<00:01:20.910> thing<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.210> noticed<00:01:21.540> as

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
yank out and the only thing I noticed as

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.540 
yank out and the only thing I noticed as
well<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.380> see<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:22.740> from<00:01:23.100> pulling<00:01:23.370> it

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
well you can see just from pulling it

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.760 
well you can see just from pulling it
out<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.820> kind<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.870> bent<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.440> little<00:01:25.650> bit

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
out and kind of get bent up a little bit

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.370 
out and kind of get bent up a little bit
there<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.220> unless<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.940> can<00:01:27.060> figure<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.380> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
there so unless you can figure out you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.570 
there so unless you can figure out you
know<00:01:28.410> a<00:01:28.500> better<00:01:28.650> way<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.860> grab<00:01:29.160> it<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.400> get<00:01:29.550> it

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
know a better way to grab it and get it

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.880 
know a better way to grab it and get it
out<00:01:29.760> which<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.150> haven't<00:01:30.390> been<00:01:30.450> able<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.890> you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
out which I haven't been able to you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.920 
out which I haven't been able to you
might<00:01:32.070> end<00:01:32.190> up<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.030> top

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
might end up with that so this top

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.180 
might end up with that so this top
portion<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.440> it<00:01:34.500> kind<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.680> gets<00:01:34.800> bent<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
portion here it kind of gets bent a

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.320 
portion here it kind of gets bent a
little<00:01:35.220> bit<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> shape<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.120> I<00:01:36.150> say

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
little bit out of shape so I say

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.900 
little bit out of shape so I say
overtime<00:01:36.950> might<00:01:37.950> wear<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.130> little<00:01:38.370> bit<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.760> can

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
overtime might wear a little bit you can

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.690 
overtime might wear a little bit you can
