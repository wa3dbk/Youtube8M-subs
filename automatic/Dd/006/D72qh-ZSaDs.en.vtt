00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.529
 in short, in this video we will teach those who are not 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.919
 Lost Lenka can refer 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.160
 faked his end badly n 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.960
 merge it all starts with what for 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.170
 start you need to put it right 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.189
 this one with t r p plus one con -1 or 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.380
 Tester plus 4x minus 4 without any of these tattoo 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.170
 that one will not merge well or merge 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.609
 only if he has a chain with plus 20 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.170
 and in parts this is important very much for if 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.780
 no roller that place 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.379
 view plus 4 and minus 4 put dex 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.989
 plus 4 con mind s4 is even less 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.320
 lower kp somewhere to about two 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:52.050
 thousand nine hundred and that is enough to 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.149
 merge well as a rule it is necessary 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.120
 have an equal x world without equal cam 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.680
 drain will not happen because equal x 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:06.150
 the world gives gp somewhere on top of him 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.350
 is caught onion which gives competition to one 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.530
 200 kb will help there 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.270
 if I'm not mistaken, well, even if I catch 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.299
 his power is 126 p. 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.330
 it will be enough drain is to 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.450
 tolling for 5 seconds 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.799
 if you have a weak point you may not even 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.080
 try to merge not require any concerns 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.439
 for starters, we just do 2 maxx a1 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.720
 This light set and play on 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.659
 English server then for me this 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.930
 vorpal light set + com and all the rest 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.140
 public part of which is given to the n 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.420
 there is a little run shirt shirts all 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.850
 then removed the yard was in the cycle of being 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.320
 plus 0 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.240
 Here is a macro with such 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.310
 pilot sequence in order to 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.470
 with persons need vorpal 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:03.590
 heavy set well he is called like kira 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.030
 sepsis the first Russian-speaking he should 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.520
 be plus 6 no less 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.920
 you can even 8 movies and part of it is not 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.200
 welcome to the cafe attached and easier with 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.670
 persons shirts to n + 6 + 6 but here so 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.739
 I with a minimum amount as 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.290
 merging need a ticket because it gives 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.260
 weave HP 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.790
 roller different cameras here to me without 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.840
 notation because enough 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.090
 local belongings settle dense shield 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.310
 I endure 6 density 4 weights of difference 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.989
 no special rose than higher warm 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.110
 it turns out the bills the more as he gives 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.560
 at a point so well, let's say on the shaft 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:49.819
 just something on x10 game I have ogrebesh there 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.860
 squeals 0 9 native cameras roller can 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.459
 merging without a roller having just been 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.570
 a breakdown here but the mohair is 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:02.930
 to exhibit falls here 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.579
 the end of this panel is the fence all 12 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.519
 slots are crammed into one mage not 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:10.340
 but here I have it called heavy goal 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:15.290
 that is, with his clothes all dress 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:18.769
 parts that you need to be here and 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.850
 so take off for Olympus outright 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:27.580

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:30.580
 I shoot everything I go out preparing for what year 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:35.170
 many may notice that now here 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:38.350
 conditions usually in a city setting i'm not 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.720
 smog from the face on Olympus everything works 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.730
 ok so 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.450
