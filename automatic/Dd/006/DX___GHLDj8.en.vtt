half diagonally you should now have four

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.899 
half diagonally you should now have four
triangles<00:01:41.840> then<00:01:42.840> using<00:01:43.530> an<00:01:43.649> iron<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.189> low<00:01:44.610> heat

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.190 

then<00:02:30.590> using<00:02:31.129> a<00:02:31.370> half<00:02:31.579> inch<00:02:31.609> seam<00:02:31.909> allowance<00:02:32.200> so

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
then using a half inch seam allowance so

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.929 
then using a half inch seam allowance so

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
row twice

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:51.510 
row twice
you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.760 

then<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.120> two<00:02:53.330> rows<00:02:53.569> together<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:54.350> make<00:02:54.560> a

then so the two rows together to make a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.940 
then so the two rows together to make a
block

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.530

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
the pillowcase now the rule of the day

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.620 
the pillowcase now the rule of the day
is<00:03:12.790> just<00:03:12.819> pin

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
is just pin

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.690 
is just pin
when<00:03:13.780> in<00:03:13.900> doubt<00:03:14.020> put<00:03:14.530> in<00:03:14.650> another<00:03:14.920> pin<00:03:15.250> you

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
when in doubt put in another pin you

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.820 
when in doubt put in another pin you
just<00:03:15.910> need<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.209> do<00:03:16.660> use<00:03:16.959> lots<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.290> pins<00:03:17.470> when<00:03:17.739> it

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
just need to do use lots of pins when it

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.010 
just need to do use lots of pins when it
comes<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.480> something<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.569> I<00:03:19.750> found

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
comes to this and something that I found

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.750 
comes to this and something that I found
that<00:03:20.200> worked<00:03:20.410> really<00:03:20.620> well<00:03:20.739> is<00:03:21.100> especially<00:03:21.520> on

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
that worked really well is especially on

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.330 
that worked really well is especially on
the<00:03:21.850> really<00:03:22.090> bulky<00:03:22.480> seams<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:24.069> have<00:03:24.220> to

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
the really bulky seams that you have to

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.340 
the really bulky seams that you have to
go<00:03:24.459> across<00:03:24.580> if<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.120> put<00:03:25.300> a<00:03:25.330> pin<00:03:25.540> on<00:03:25.630> each<00:03:25.870> side

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
go across if you put a pin on each side

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.199 
go across if you put a pin on each side
of<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.830> seam<00:03:27.069> like<00:03:27.280> right<00:03:27.550> next<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.000> it

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
of the seam like right next to it it

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.440 
of the seam like right next to it it
helps<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:28.959> line<00:03:29.110> up<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.410> lot<00:03:29.739> easier<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:30.819> just<00:03:31.360> a

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
helps it line up a lot easier so just a

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.350 
helps it line up a lot easier so just a
little<00:03:31.540> trick<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.959> learned<00:03:32.670> then<00:03:33.670> sew<00:03:34.209> the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
little trick I learned then sew the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:54.320 
little trick I learned then sew the
blocks<00:03:34.600> together

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.540 

all<00:03:54.540> right<00:03:55.290> it's<00:03:55.500> coming<00:03:55.650> together<00:03:55.920> let's

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
all right it's coming together let's

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.850 
all right it's coming together let's
keep<00:03:56.730> going<00:03:57.210> two<00:03:57.990> of<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.230> blocks<00:03:58.470> aren't

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
keep going two of the blocks aren't

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.650 
keep going two of the blocks aren't
quite<00:03:59.130> wide<00:03:59.400> enough<00:03:59.430> for<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.970> pillow<00:04:00.240> so<00:04:00.570> we

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
quite wide enough for a pillow so we

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.630 
quite wide enough for a pillow so we
need<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:00.960> take<00:04:01.170> six<00:04:01.620> squares<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.220> cut<00:04:02.370> them<00:04:02.550> in

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
need to take six squares and cut them in

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.400 
need to take six squares and cut them in
half<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:03.090> add<00:04:03.240> a<00:04:03.270> little<00:04:03.540> width<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:04.020> each<00:04:04.140> side

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
half to add a little width to each side

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.600 
half to add a little width to each side
of<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.620> pillow<00:04:06.350> take<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.710> half<00:04:07.950> blocks<00:04:08.310> and

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
of the pillow take the half blocks and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.270 
of the pillow take the half blocks and
sew<00:04:08.880> them<00:04:09.150> into<00:04:09.570> rows<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:10.470> match<00:04:10.650> your<00:04:10.890> pattern

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
sew them into rows to match your pattern

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.780 
sew them into rows to match your pattern
add<00:04:12.320> one<00:04:13.320> to<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.590> top<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:14.040> one<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.400> bottom

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
add one to the top and one to the bottom

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.320 
add one to the top and one to the bottom
of<00:04:14.910> your<00:04:15.180> pinwheel<00:04:15.390> blocks<00:04:17.060> to<00:04:18.060> make<00:04:18.090> the

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
of your pinwheel blocks to make the

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.849 
of your pinwheel blocks to make the
pillowcase<00:04:18.720> long<00:04:19.019> enough<00:04:19.290> we<00:04:19.500> need<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.709> add<00:04:19.830> a

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
pillowcase long enough we need to add a

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.280 
pillowcase long enough we need to add a
column<00:04:20.250> of<00:04:20.459> squares<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.000> end<00:04:21.269> this<00:04:22.140> will

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
column of squares to the end this will

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.380 
column of squares to the end this will
be<00:04:22.410> four<00:04:22.710> blocks<00:04:22.950> tall<00:04:23.250> with<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.610> half<00:04:23.880> block<00:04:24.180> on

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
be four blocks tall with a half block on

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.980 
be four blocks tall with a half block on
each<00:04:24.600> end<00:04:24.930> so<00:04:25.170> the<00:04:26.160> squares<00:04:26.430> together<00:04:26.990> then

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
each end so the squares together then

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.680 
each end so the squares together then
taking<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.800> long<00:04:29.010> column<00:04:29.460> take<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.120> raw<00:04:30.420> edge

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
taking the long column take the raw edge

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.630
