go to a shop and routes and times no to

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.520 
go to a shop and routes and times no to
have<00:00:47.879> issues<00:00:48.180> water<00:00:48.539> when<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.050> twist<00:00:49.350> my

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.700 
hair and I don't really reach whisk you
often<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.449> also<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.930> water<00:00:55.170> doesn't<00:00:55.469> really

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
often and also the water doesn't really

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.330

hold<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.460> available<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.829> gyms<00:00:59.129> because

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
hold up is available as the gyms because

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.180 
hold up is available as the gyms because
they're<00:00:59.640> made<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.850> hold<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.359> hair<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.690> place

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
so they could have some low do we just

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.750 
so they could have some low do we just
use<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:05.060> first<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.330> combined<00:01:07.200> locks<00:01:07.760> second

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
