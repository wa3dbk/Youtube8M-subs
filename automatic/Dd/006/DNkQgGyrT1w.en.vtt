00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.200
 the reggiano within the system o 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.540
 in our muscular awakening section 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.370
 with us pier luigi de pascalis already 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.980
 Welcome pr also found in tea 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.529
 this is the first day of the month 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.480
 of July 2014 last month for what 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.970
 it's about mobbing and we talk 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.460
 of food ceo no food today inside 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.890
 our brica because pierre exactly 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.220
 The third initiative is being 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.059
 discussion by the world 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.739
 federation on how much they can do 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.719
 bad some foods and above all 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.760
 those foods that would make us then 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.219
 fatten up subject of this discussion 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.789
 and the application of a label 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.260
 these foods these winds particularly 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.579
 gracious of ours of ours 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.039
 health and precisely with regard to the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.770
 caloric share and therefore similarly to 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.510
 As already it happens today with 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.980
 cigarettes so we could find ourselves by a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.440
 day to day with this food written 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.870
 seriously harms health right on 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.180
 the symbol we think that we too 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.860
 we often call junk food ie 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.020
 what makes us a little fat that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.970
 very tasty but then apart from that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.040
 he doesn't have much else 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.240
 the inter is apparently interesting 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.799
 apparently could also have gods 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.420
 advantages because maybe it can be a 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.210
 deterrent to foods that do not 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.790
 we believe to be good and healthy 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.619
 certainly to eat lightly and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.880
 so all of us could be 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.950
 agree in this way there is an alarm 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.509
 compared to this food actually 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.430
 we would also need to have a parallel with 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.280
 I don't know how many smokers smoke then 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.079
 really are not aware of the year and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.070
 that his brings , however, and 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.020
 continue to smoke 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.220
 how many people got scared in 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.869
 see the writing and the smoke harms 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.820
 seriously ill to the point of 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.560
 put and how many now the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.229
 they ignore quietly so it is part 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.460
 of the magazine of the plan package that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.229
 also regarding the slope 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.130
 food would risk the same 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.840
 thing 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.250
 I think this is my new opinion 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.530
 which would be much more appropriate instead 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.500
 educate people educating them since 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.960
 when they go to school for healthy food 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.880
 and towards physical activity rather than 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.740
 put a simple label that makes us 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.240
 feel all the best but it was 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.920
 high is absolutely not changing 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.239
 things also because we go to 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.739
 analyze everything what it does 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.400
 bad all that brings us to 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.830
 put on weight 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.510
 sooner or later we will have to 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.680
 in a general's label on the sofa 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.330
 for example this very sofa 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.040
 seriously ill because it makes me 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.420
 become particularly sedentary or 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.560
 what he wanted to put on the consoles 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.970
 of video games 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.680
 in short it would be a bit anachronistic 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.780
 put your head and a little everywhere 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.610
 much better I repeat would also be from a 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.770
 pedagogical point of view teach ai 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.180
 children the pleasure of physical activity 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.320
 if I bring a child to do 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.550
 an excursion that leads him to do 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.380
 physical activity 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.790
 certainly then he will be himself a 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.920
 want a similar experience 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.900
 rather than simply playing from 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.970
 just in a room with a video game 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.860
 as well as without anything to children too 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.480
 to prepare food also a food 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.640
 particularly simple and therefore 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.050
 taking advantage of the fun element 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.240
 the playful element to entertain 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.330
 most likely these children then 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.590
 also as adults and even growing up 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.450
 would confirm the pleasure of preparing 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.650
 food is probably a plus cycle 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.300
 do it for then it's not through 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.070
 a label that somehow 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.330
 we try to educate a flock is not 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.310
 this we should do but we will have to 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.440
 look for how to do it in a company instead 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.610
 to teach something different then 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.280
 be careful because what we have 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.780
 apparently interesting only you 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.040
 to make headlines in the newspapers but not 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.900
 they have great results 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.190
 absolutely yes thanks to our piero 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.050
 obviously our section and back to 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.500
 next Tuesday a muscle awakening a 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.500
 hug
