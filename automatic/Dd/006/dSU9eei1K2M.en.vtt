00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
really interested in that we have

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.800 
really interested in that we have

blizzards and

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.810 
blizzards and
it<00:04:20.109> was<00:04:20.320> just<00:04:20.560> really<00:04:21.070> hard<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.400> be<00:04:21.489> able<00:04:21.549> to<00:04:21.730> do

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
it was just really hard to be able to do

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.960 
it was just really hard to be able to do
that<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.270> do<00:04:22.360> have<00:04:22.750> an<00:04:22.870> elliptical<00:04:23.410> here<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.520> I

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
that I do have an elliptical here and I

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.960

would<00:04:25.030> go<00:04:25.300> on<00:04:25.450> that<00:04:25.720> but<00:04:26.650> running<00:04:27.310> obviously

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
would go on that but running obviously

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.500 
would go on that but running obviously
is<00:04:28.090> more<00:04:28.690> effective<00:04:30.000> although<00:04:31.000> the

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
is more effective although the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.870 
is more effective although the
elliptical<00:04:31.960> is<00:04:32.080> user<00:04:32.290> in<00:04:32.530> your<00:04:32.620> joints<00:04:32.980> some
