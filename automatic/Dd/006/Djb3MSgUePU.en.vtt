is a Formula One race car and on top of
that<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.430> actually<00:00:23.730> street-legal<00:00:24.420> which

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
that it is actually street-legal which

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.710 
that it is actually street-legal which
is<00:00:25.109> pretty<00:00:25.350> crazy<00:00:26.330> obviously<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.359> don't<00:00:27.480> think

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
is pretty crazy obviously I don't think

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.230 
is pretty crazy obviously I don't think
this<00:00:27.810> competes<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.470> big<00:00:28.650> dogs

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
this competes with the big dogs

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.009 
this competes with the big dogs
considering<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> size<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:30.960> thing

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
considering just the size of this thing

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.950 
considering just the size of this thing
but<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.769> mean<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.610> an<00:00:32.790> amazing<00:00:33.450> car<00:00:33.480> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
but I mean it's it's an amazing car and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.780 
but I mean it's it's an amazing car and
about<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.980> Indy<00:00:35.160> cars<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.489> tried<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
about of all the Indy cars have tried to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.299 
about of all the Indy cars have tried to
drift<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:37.020> has<00:00:37.829> been<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> most

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
drift with this one has been the most

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.180 
drift with this one has been the most
successful<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:39.120> me<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:40.710> all<00:00:40.890> came<00:00:41.129> down

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
successful for me and it all came down

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.850 
successful for me and it all came down
to<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.579> tune<00:00:41.820> itself<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.110> car<00:00:43.410> stock

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
to the tune itself like the car stock

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.580 
to the tune itself like the car stock
was<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.460> complete<00:00:45.719> when<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.289> came<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
was just complete when it came to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.200 
was just complete when it came to
trying<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.890> drift<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.489> mean<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.059> was<00:00:48.149> just

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
trying to drift it I mean it was just

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.049 
trying to drift it I mean it was just
impossible<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> actually<00:00:50.730> started

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
impossible so when I actually started

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.840 
impossible so when I actually started
tuning<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:52.070> really<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.340> helped

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
tuning it it really really helped

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.310 
tuning it it really really helped
especially<00:00:54.300> when<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:54.690> making<00:00:54.809> smart

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
especially when I was making smart

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.619 
especially when I was making smart
decisions<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.949> my<00:00:56.039> tuning<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:57.210> car<00:00:57.449> only

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
decisions and my tuning this car only

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.040 
decisions and my tuning this car only
has<00:00:57.840> 319<00:00:58.710> horsepower<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.820> 317<00:01:00.660> pounds<00:01:00.809> of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
has 319 horsepower with 317 pounds of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.959 
has 319 horsepower with 317 pounds of
torque<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.559> really<00:01:02.129> upped<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> torque<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.850> this

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
torque I really upped the torque in this

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.000 
torque I really upped the torque in this
thing<00:01:03.120> because<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.780> when<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.650> was<00:01:04.860> going

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
thing because it's just when I was going

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.469 
thing because it's just when I was going
into<00:01:05.220> fourth<00:01:05.549> gear<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> lot<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> turns

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
into fourth gear and a lot of the turns

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.390 
into fourth gear and a lot of the turns
there<00:01:06.810> wasn't<00:01:07.170> enough<00:01:07.380> torque<00:01:07.680> behind<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
there wasn't enough torque behind it and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.580 
there wasn't enough torque behind it and
I<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.000> bogging<00:01:09.450> down<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.990> really

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
I was just bogging down so you really

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.780 
I was just bogging down so you really
want<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.770> make<00:01:10.890> sure<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.400> torque<00:01:11.640> in

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
want to make sure you have torque in

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.550 
want to make sure you have torque in
this<00:01:11.909> thing<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.930> didn't<00:01:13.200> add<00:01:13.350> any

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
this thing and I didn't add any

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.070 
this thing and I didn't add any
turbochargers<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.150> I'm<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.750> don't

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
turbochargers just because I'm I don't

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.999 
turbochargers just because I'm I don't
want<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.799> don't<00:01:17.670> need<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.530> 300<00:01:19.530> 300

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
want that I don't need it but 300 300

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.410 
want that I don't need it but 300 300
horsepower<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.490> pretty<00:01:20.700> good<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.060> carling

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
horsepower is pretty good the carling

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.969 
horsepower is pretty good the carling
weighs<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> thousand<00:01:22.110> pounds<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.710> don't<00:01:22.860> need

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
weighs a thousand pounds you don't need

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.700 
weighs a thousand pounds you don't need
much<00:01:23.189> more<00:01:23.220> than<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:24.140> but<00:01:25.140> your<00:01:25.259> preference

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
much more than that but your preference

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.070 
much more than that but your preference
you<00:01:25.890> know<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.369> whatever<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.759> want<00:01:27.080> so

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you know you can do whatever you want so

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.539 
you know you can do whatever you want so
when<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.439> actually<00:01:28.590> came<00:01:28.890> down<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> tune

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
when it actually came down to the tune

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.460 
when it actually came down to the tune
because<00:01:29.759> that's<00:01:30.060> where<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.420> made<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:31.049> that's

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
because that's where it made like that's

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.770 
because that's where it made like that's
that's<00:01:31.890> where<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.100> car<00:01:32.509> that's<00:01:33.509> where<00:01:33.659> it's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that's where this car that's where it's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.399 
that's where this car that's where it's
at<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.759> unfortunately<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.479> don't<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:37.079> why<00:01:37.380> I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
at so unfortunately I don't know why I

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.469 
at so unfortunately I don't know why I
did<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.430> never<00:01:38.640> changed<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> tire

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
did this but I never changed the tire

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.060 
did this but I never changed the tire
pressure<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.259> you're<00:01:40.500> gonna<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:40.950> this

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
pressure so you're gonna have to do this

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.490 
pressure so you're gonna have to do this
yourself<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.820> don't<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.810> have

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
yourself you don't really have to I have

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.340 
yourself you don't really have to I have

I'd<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.869> lower<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.229> down<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.770> about<00:01:49.829> 24

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
I'd like to lower that down to about 24

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.569 
I'd like to lower that down to about 24
in<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> front<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.990> 26<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.740> rear<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.430> you

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
in the front and 26 in the rear but you

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.630 
in the front and 26 in the rear but you
can<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:53.820> make<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:54.540> own<00:01:54.659> adjustment<00:01:55.229> there

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
can just make your own adjustment there

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.280 
can just make your own adjustment there
the<00:01:56.640> gearing<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.240> want<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.600> make<00:01:57.780> sure<00:01:57.810> you

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the gearing you want to make sure you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.530 
the gearing you want to make sure you
move<00:01:58.619> man<00:01:59.040> don't<00:01:59.520> leave<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.880> gearing<00:02:00.149> stock

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
move man don't leave the gearing stock

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.740 
move man don't leave the gearing stock
at<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.909> were<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.180> I'd<00:02:03.329> copy<00:02:03.570> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
at all so if I were you I'd copy the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.060 
at all so if I were you I'd copy the
gear<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.649> don't<00:02:04.829> know<00:02:04.950> what

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
gear and I have if you don't know what

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.280 
gear and I have if you don't know what
you're<00:02:05.250> doing<00:02:05.520> other<00:02:06.390> than<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.719> I'll<00:02:07.110> leave

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
you're doing other than that I'll leave

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.320 
you're doing other than that I'll leave
it<00:02:07.439> I'll<00:02:07.590> leave<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.009> when<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.060> came<00:02:09.209> to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
it I'll leave it to you when it came to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.630 
it I'll leave it to you when it came to
the<00:02:09.420> alignment<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.289> follow<00:02:10.470> what<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.709> did<00:02:10.979> now

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the alignment just follow what I did now

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.550 
the alignment just follow what I did now
the<00:02:11.700> anti-roll<00:02:12.690> bars<00:02:12.930> you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the anti-roll bars you

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.920 
the anti-roll bars you
really<00:02:14.280> stiffen<00:02:14.700> them<00:02:14.819> up<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.180> usually<00:02:15.720> like<00:02:15.780> to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
really stiffen them up I usually like to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.020 
really stiffen them up I usually like to
try<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> soft<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.950> know<00:02:17.099> really<00:02:17.670> soft

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030

try to soft you know really soft
actually<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.569> guys<00:02:18.690> know<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:18.950> but<00:02:19.950> for<00:02:20.069> this

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
actually you guys know that but for this

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.010 
actually you guys know that but for this
car<00:02:20.459> just<00:02:20.489> how<00:02:20.819> light<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.180> was<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.599> just<00:02:21.690> not

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
car just how light it was it's just not

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.320 
car just how light it was it's just not
working<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.560> i<00:02:22.590> stiffen<00:02:23.040> them<00:02:23.160> up<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.370> bit<00:02:23.400> but

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
working so i stiffen them up a bit but

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.350 
working so i stiffen them up a bit but
like<00:02:24.540> i<00:02:24.630> said<00:02:24.660> it's<00:02:24.959> your<00:02:25.020> preference<00:02:25.349> and

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
like i said it's your preference and

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.210 
like i said it's your preference and
also<00:02:27.360> when<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.080> go<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.260> springs<00:02:28.770> i<00:02:28.980> know<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.130> lot

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
also when you go to springs i know a lot

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.830 
also when you go to springs i know a lot
of<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.489> guys<00:02:29.520> like<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.849> lower<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.720> out

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
of you guys like to lower the out

of you guys like to lower the out
of<00:02:30.870> your<00:02:31.019> car<00:02:31.230> because<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.680> think<00:02:31.860> that's

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
of your car because you think that's

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.490 
of your car because you think that's
what<00:02:32.250> drift<00:02:32.519> cars<00:02:32.730> are<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.870> i<00:02:33.930> mean<00:02:34.110> this

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
what drift cars are but i mean this

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.240 
what drift cars are but i mean this
thing<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.430> low<00:02:35.700> like<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.980> two<00:02:37.980> inches

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
thing is so low like it's two inches

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.420 
thing is so low like it's two inches
above<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.000> ground<00:02:39.150> okay<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:40.260> you're<00:02:41.250> going<00:02:41.370> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
above the ground okay so you're going to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.339 
above the ground okay so you're going to
want<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.700> make<00:02:41.849> sure<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.300> raise<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:42.989> up<00:02:43.200> a

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
want to make sure you raise it up a

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.380 
want to make sure you raise it up a
little<00:02:43.470> bit<00:02:43.739> about<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.430> three<00:02:44.700> inches<00:02:44.970> above

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
little bit about like three inches above

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.030 
little bit about like three inches above
the<00:02:45.450> ground<00:02:45.569> I'm<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.380> do<00:02:46.530> not

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
the ground I'm just do not

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.410 
the ground I'm just do not
hitting<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.489> ground<00:02:47.670> as<00:02:47.880> you're<00:02:48.000> drifting

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
hitting the ground as you're drifting

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.130 
hitting the ground as you're drifting
down<00:02:49.110> hill<00:02:49.410> or<00:02:49.560> something<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.940> damping<00:02:51.450> like

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
down hill or something the damping like

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.720 
down hill or something the damping like
I<00:02:52.260> said<00:02:52.470> it's<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:53.010> can<00:02:53.160> do<00:02:53.220> whatever<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.549> want

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
I said it's you can do whatever you want

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.550 
I said it's you can do whatever you want
before<00:02:54.269> what<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.450> did<00:02:54.720> or<00:02:54.750> your<00:02:54.989> own<00:02:55.080> preference

before what I did or your own preference
and<00:02:56.180> for<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.239> aerodynamics<00:02:58.049> now<00:02:58.459> for<00:02:59.459> this

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
and for the aerodynamics now for this

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.610 
and for the aerodynamics now for this
car<00:02:59.819> since<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.180> an<00:03:00.269> IndyCar<00:03:00.750> you're<00:03:01.470> going

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620

to<00:03:01.680> have<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.950> move<00:03:02.099> them<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.400> bit<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.760> for<00:03:03.209> the

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
to have to move them a bit and for the

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.150 
to have to move them a bit and for the
front<00:03:03.599> I<00:03:03.750> actually<00:03:03.959> moved<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.349> up<00:03:04.470> because<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.830> I

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
front I actually moved it up because I I

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.979 
front I actually moved it up because I I
want<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.670> product<00:03:06.000> more<00:03:06.180> better<00:03:06.450> cornering

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
want this product more better cornering

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.110 
want this product more better cornering
and<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.620> same<00:03:07.830> with<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.040> rear<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.489> moved<00:03:08.970> up

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
and I same with the rear I moved up

and I same with the rear I moved up
because<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.569> want<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.810> be<00:03:09.930> better<00:03:10.080> at<00:03:10.260> fun<00:03:10.730> now

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
because I want to be better at fun now

because I want to be better at fun now
the<00:03:12.239> breaking<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:13.099> put<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.190> balance<00:03:14.519> at

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
the breaking I put the balance at

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.039 
the breaking I put the balance at
thirty-five<00:03:15.000> percent<00:03:15.150> which<00:03:15.599> is<00:03:15.780> the

thirty-five percent which is the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
personal salvation and that was pretty

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.080 
personal salvation and that was pretty
