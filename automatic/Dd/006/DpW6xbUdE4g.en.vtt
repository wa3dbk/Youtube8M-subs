you<00:01:26.700> put<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.180> second<00:01:27.689> back<00:01:27.900> part<00:01:28.200> then

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you put on the second back part then

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.960 
you put on the second back part then
you're<00:01:28.920> really<00:01:29.070> adding<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.460> protection

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you're really adding the protection

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.969 
you're really adding the protection
layer<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.329> that's<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.600> hard<00:01:30.900> case<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.470> that'll

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
layer so that's a hard case and that'll

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.319 
layer so that's a hard case and that'll
add<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.159> whole<00:01:32.369> second<00:01:32.729> layer<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.000> protection

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
add a whole second layer of protection

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.819 
add a whole second layer of protection
so<00:01:33.720> you're<00:01:33.900> paying<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.500> bit<00:01:34.590> extra

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
so you're paying for a little bit extra

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.039 
so you're paying for a little bit extra
here<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> incipio<00:01:36.060> double<00:01:36.420> cover<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:36.869> I

it to be similar for that so it looks

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.420 
it to be similar for that so it looks
