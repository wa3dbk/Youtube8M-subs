00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.650
 interesting a how-to tutorial 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.799
 download an iso image of windows xp 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.529
 service pack 3 in this tutorial 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.640
 basically because I just installed 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:20.800
 windows 7 but before it was 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.150
 trying to install windows xp and good 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.440
 I found other than this because 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.330
 all the links all the things that you 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.599
 the lessons all they tell you in 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.440
 internet then it comes to broken links you 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.750
 they carry links that a file this 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.350
 file weighs 590 vegas for the people you 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.820
 it divides it into 50 billion pieces and 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.190
 have to let download all 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.750
 of all the balls and good those links 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.180
 of shit then also those of utorrent 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.550
 that youtube is not super slow but good 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.290
 so what I have done has been to upload 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.470
 good to have downloaded 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.560
 this iso and good help mediafire and 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.110
 I'm going to put the link to the description of 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.940
 Direct download of the iso only 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.430
 this is going to be like downloading the iso 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.490
 and it's basically putting by clicking 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.250
 in the link in that description I'll leave you 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.840
 also in the description a few 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.340
 a few keys to the product of 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.610
 windows xp for when you install the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.040
 windows so you have it validated what 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.380
 that is then I will also do a tutorial 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.409
 of 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.140
 how to install how to record on a cedÃ© 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.390
 and in a usb and how to install it in a 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.520
 computer but if already within x 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.869
 time because it 's a computer that I'm going 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.200
 to give in a while I do not know how much 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.409
 exactly but good then I'm going to 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.030
 take the link 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.299
 I've done it by the way 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.490
 I uploaded mediafire and put the link that 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.590
 is solely so that it does not derive for you 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.659
 that are not servers to addresses to 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.229
 pages shit or links shit or broken 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.850
 I will not eliminate chicken through this link and 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.610
 you only have it that you have to 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.680
 click this link here you have the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.380
 description and automatically it 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.390
 will expose download here what is coming 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.640
 being the file that is the image and that 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.300
 is this from here 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.300
 so 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.990
 Now all this is worth to me because I'm 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.640
 with the guy recording I'm with the 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.560
 program but good is basically that 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.080
 the iso software light will be downloaded 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.320
 It is not this, even if it comes with a 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.190
 winrar icon normally the iso is 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.250
 characterized because he was told not to 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.280
 a cd but I'm going to who is this 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.990
 but in this case it has the icon of 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.460
 A winrar does not equal these evils 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.840
 you can also record this in a 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.950
 I gave you what you can mount what will make it difficult 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.440
 You can do whatever you want with her 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.390
 but good as you can see here I have already been 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.560
 put to download without needing 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.730
 redirect me to nowhere 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.960
 simply put the link but it has 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.890
 lowered so you can have this for 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.360
 those downloads if you want to see how many 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.790
 megabytes or how many kilobytes per second 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.770
 you have what you want but it's good 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.170
 basically that and I'm going to cancel the 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.840
 download because the same thing is basically 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.690
 that although I hope you liked it 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.750
 We have served this video and well 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.100
 see you 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.100
 goodbye to strain
