and<00:01:24.149> you<00:01:24.240> pull<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.720> behind<00:01:24.899> you<00:01:25.350> all<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and you pull it up behind you all the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.990 
and you pull it up behind you all the
way<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:26.369> top<00:01:28.399> it's<00:01:29.399> a<00:01:29.550> lot<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
way to the top it's a lot like a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.540 
way to the top it's a lot like a
spacewalk<00:01:30.750> where<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.160> remember<00:01:32.369> to

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
spacewalk where you have to remember to

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.919 
spacewalk where you have to remember to
bring<00:01:32.729> everything<00:01:33.179> you're<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.660> to<00:01:33.810> need

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
bring everything you're going to need

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:40.910 
bring everything you're going to need
because<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.039> long<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:35.580> down<00:01:39.740> once<00:01:40.740> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
because it's a long way down once you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.969 
because it's a long way down once you
reach<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.160> top<00:01:41.399> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.819> tower<00:01:42.030> itself<00:01:42.979> it's

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
reach the top of the tower itself it's

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:56.110 
reach the top of the tower itself it's
time<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.520> go<00:01:44.670> outside

free climbing is more dangerous of

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.110 
free climbing is more dangerous of
course<00:02:27.280> but<00:02:28.280> OSHA<00:02:28.520> rules<00:02:28.940> do<00:02:29.300> allow<00:02:29.570> for<00:02:29.930> it

these spiky flowers on their long stems
are<00:03:39.080> used<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.860> attract<00:03:40.239> electrical<00:03:41.239> charges

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.280 
are used to attract electrical charges
in<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.260> air<00:03:43.239> this<00:03:44.239> helps<00:03:44.599> to<00:03:44.630> dissipate<00:03:45.230> the

in the air this helps to dissipate the
charges<00:03:46.040> before<00:03:46.370> they<00:03:46.670> build<00:03:46.940> up<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.300> create<00:03:47.510> a

now we've reached the base of the
