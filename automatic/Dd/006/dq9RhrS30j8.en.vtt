share with you some tips and tricks that

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.960 
share with you some tips and tricks that
I<00:00:21.670> use<00:00:22.030> when<00:00:22.330> preparing<00:00:22.960> a<00:00:23.350> digital<00:00:24.220> file<00:00:24.490> for

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
I use when preparing a digital file for

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.270 
I use when preparing a digital file for
print<00:00:25.650> specifically<00:00:26.650> when<00:00:26.860> printing<00:00:27.190> a

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
print specifically when printing a

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.180 
print specifically when printing a
gallery<00:00:27.640> wrap<00:00:27.790> image<00:00:28.440> this<00:00:29.440> is<00:00:29.650> a<00:00:29.680> photo<00:00:29.980> that

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
gallery wrap image this is a photo that

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.400 
gallery wrap image this is a photo that
I<00:00:30.220> took<00:00:30.280> of<00:00:30.520> a<00:00:30.610> Chicago<00:00:30.760> River<00:00:31.300> it's<00:00:32.200> a<00:00:32.260> digital

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
I took of a Chicago River it's a digital

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.060 
I took of a Chicago River it's a digital
photo<00:00:32.860> and<00:00:33.630> I'm<00:00:34.630> starting<00:00:35.230> out<00:00:35.350> by<00:00:35.559> correcting

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
photo and I'm starting out by correcting

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.460 
photo and I'm starting out by correcting
the<00:00:36.190> perspective<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:37.059> I<00:00:38.020> can<00:00:38.170> accomplish

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
the perspective and I can accomplish

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.710 
the perspective and I can accomplish
that<00:00:38.680> by<00:00:39.630> selecting<00:00:40.630> the<00:00:40.989> entire<00:00:41.320> image

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
that by selecting the entire image

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.810 
that by selecting the entire image
grabbing<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.809> corners<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:44.559> then<00:00:45.190> doing<00:00:45.700> a

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
grabbing the corners and then doing a

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.410 
grabbing the corners and then doing a
free<00:00:46.120> transform<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.700> goal<00:00:48.910> here<00:00:48.940> is<00:00:49.390> to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
free transform and the goal here is to

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.720 
free transform and the goal here is to
make<00:00:49.750> the<00:00:49.930> edges<00:00:50.440> of<00:00:50.470> the<00:00:50.620> buildings<00:00:51.100> parallel

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
make the edges of the buildings parallel

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.540 
make the edges of the buildings parallel
with<00:00:52.630> the<00:00:52.660> sides<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.560> canvas<00:00:53.830> or<00:00:54.250> the

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
with the sides of the canvas or the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
image the guides that I laid out serve

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.400 
image the guides that I laid out serve
as<00:00:59.350> a<00:00:59.380> kind<00:00:59.829> of<00:00:59.950> a<00:01:00.010> visual<00:01:00.370> reference<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:02.260> line

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
as a kind of a visual reference to line

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.550 
as a kind of a visual reference to line
up<00:01:02.560> the<00:01:02.680> edges<00:01:02.800> of<00:01:02.950> the<00:01:03.070> building<00:01:03.460> with<00:01:04.560> once

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
up the edges of the building with once

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.230 
up the edges of the building with once
it's<00:01:05.800> done<00:01:06.040> I'm<00:01:06.250> going<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.430> hit<00:01:06.520> enter<00:01:06.580> clear

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
it's done I'm going to hit enter clear

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.180 
it's done I'm going to hit enter clear
the<00:01:07.360> guides<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.680> I'm<00:01:11.680> also<00:01:11.800> going<00:01:12.009> to<00:01:12.070> go

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
the guides and I'm also going to go

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.800 
the guides and I'm also going to go
ahead<00:01:12.280> and<00:01:12.430> crop<00:01:12.700> off<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.030> bottom<00:01:13.360> portion<00:01:13.720> of

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
ahead and crop off the bottom portion of

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.410 
ahead and crop off the bottom portion of
this<00:01:13.899> picture<00:01:14.759> there<00:01:15.759> was<00:01:15.940> a<00:01:15.970> railing<00:01:16.270> that

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
this picture there was a railing that

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.880 
this picture there was a railing that
got<00:01:16.690> in<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:16.869> way<00:01:16.990> this<00:01:17.170> photo<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:17.680> it<00:01:17.740> really

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
got in the way this photo and it really

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.469 
got in the way this photo and it really
doesn't<00:01:18.100> do<00:01:18.280> anything<00:01:18.580> for<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.820> composition

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
doesn't do anything for the composition

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.620 
doesn't do anything for the composition
so<00:01:19.720> we're<00:01:19.869> just<00:01:19.899> going<00:01:20.110> to<00:01:20.140> eliminate<00:01:20.530> that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
so we're just going to eliminate that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.840 
so we're just going to eliminate that
now<00:01:22.630> I'm<00:01:22.750> going<00:01:22.899> to<00:01:22.960> go<00:01:23.020> ahead<00:01:23.050> and<00:01:23.399> change<00:01:24.399> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
now I'm going to go ahead and change the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.389 
now I'm going to go ahead and change the
size<00:01:25.119> of<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.450> image<00:01:25.920> preparing<00:01:26.920> it<00:01:26.979> for<00:01:27.009> print

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
size of the image preparing it for print

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:28.559 
size of the image preparing it for print
so<00:01:27.759> we're<00:01:27.880> going<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.060> change<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.390> resolution

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
so we're going to change the resolution

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:32.969 
so we're going to change the resolution
to<00:01:29.020> 300<00:01:29.470> dpi<00:01:29.830> or<00:01:29.950> pixels<00:01:30.550> per<00:01:30.729> inch<00:01:30.759> and<00:01:31.979> we

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
to 300 dpi or pixels per inch and we

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.050 
to 300 dpi or pixels per inch and we
want<00:01:33.160> to<00:01:33.220> make<00:01:33.340> sure<00:01:33.369> constrain<00:01:34.030> proportions

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
want to make sure constrain proportions

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.389 
want to make sure constrain proportions
is<00:01:35.020> selected<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.740> we're<00:01:35.890> going<00:01:36.009> to<00:01:36.039> change

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
is selected and we're going to change

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.600 
is selected and we're going to change
the<00:01:36.729> height<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.450> 16<00:01:37.899> inches<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:39.369> going<00:01:39.550> to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
the height to 16 inches it's going to

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.219 
the height to 16 inches it's going to
automatically<00:01:40.090> set<00:01:40.360> our<00:01:40.479> width<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:43.660> width<00:01:43.869> is

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
automatically set our width the width is

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.620 
automatically set our width the width is
going<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:44.500> be<00:01:44.679> larger<00:01:45.280> than<00:01:45.310> 20<00:01:45.970> inches<00:01:46.330> based

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
going to be larger than 20 inches based

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.830 
going to be larger than 20 inches based
on<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.170> frame<00:01:47.740> size<00:01:47.979> of<00:01:48.280> my<00:01:48.429> camera<00:01:48.880> so<00:01:49.630> next

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
on the frame size of my camera so next

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.090 
on the frame size of my camera so next
we<00:01:50.020> need<00:01:50.050> to<00:01:50.259> crop<00:01:50.470> off<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:52.509> edges<00:01:52.720> of<00:01:53.200> the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
we need to crop off the edges of the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.600 
we need to crop off the edges of the
width<00:01:54.459> to<00:01:55.030> equal<00:01:55.690> our<00:01:55.780> 20<00:01:56.110> inches<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.490> a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
width to equal our 20 inches and a

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.279 
width to equal our 20 inches and a
visually<00:01:57.970> line<00:01:58.209> up<00:01:58.709> the<00:01:59.709> selection<00:02:00.190> tool<00:02:00.340> here

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
visually line up the selection tool here

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.050 
visually line up the selection tool here
delete<00:02:02.399> ok<00:02:03.399> now<00:02:03.550> we<00:02:03.610> have<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:03.880> proper

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
delete ok now we have the proper

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.499 
delete ok now we have the proper
proportion<00:02:04.810> 16<00:02:05.349> by<00:02:05.470> 20<00:02:05.530> on<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:07.030> about<00:02:07.149> every

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
proportion 16 by 20 on just about every

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.690 
proportion 16 by 20 on just about every
photo<00:02:07.780> that<00:02:07.869> I<00:02:08.020> print<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.530> run<00:02:08.740> a<00:02:08.770> levels

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
photo that I print I run a levels

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.140 
photo that I print I run a levels
adjustment<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:11.340> by<00:02:12.340> adjusting<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.819> levels

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
adjustment and by adjusting the levels

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.820 
adjustment and by adjusting the levels
you're<00:02:13.540> adjusting<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.020> contrast<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.740> the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
you're adjusting the contrast to the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.620 
you're adjusting the contrast to the
picture<00:02:15.220> making<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:15.940> darks<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.330> little<00:02:16.540> bit

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
picture making the darks a little bit

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.600 
picture making the darks a little bit
darker<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.260> lights<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.620> little<00:02:17.650> bit<00:02:17.950> whiter<00:02:18.190> or

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
darker the lights a little bit whiter or

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.330 
darker the lights a little bit whiter or
brighter<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:23.140> step<00:02:23.500> will<00:02:23.530> make<00:02:23.860> your<00:02:23.980> photos

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340

printing<00:03:10.300> a<00:03:10.450> 16<00:03:10.900> by<00:03:11.020> 20<00:03:11.080> canvas<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.480> first

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
printing a 16 by 20 canvas so the first

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.390 
printing a 16 by 20 canvas so the first
thing<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.900> do<00:03:13.960> is<00:03:14.080> lay<00:03:14.380> out<00:03:14.410> guides<00:03:14.830> around<00:03:15.160> the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
thing I do is lay out guides around the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.730 
thing I do is lay out guides around the
perimeter<00:03:15.820> of<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:15.970> image<00:03:16.240> and<00:03:16.620> then<00:03:17.620> we're

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
perimeter of the image and then we're

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.950 
perimeter of the image and then we're
going<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:17.890> change<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.580> canvas<00:03:19.030> size<00:03:19.240> let's

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
going to change the canvas size let's

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.270 
going to change the canvas size let's
also<00:03:20.170> pretend<00:03:20.410> we<00:03:20.770> have<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:20.920> one<00:03:21.130> inch

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
also pretend we have a one inch

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.580 
also pretend we have a one inch

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
canvas with an inch per side and I also

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.290 
canvas with an inch per side and I also
give<00:03:29.830> it<00:03:29.860> an<00:03:30.010> extra<00:03:30.130> half-inch<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:31.030> allow<00:03:31.270> a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
give it an extra half-inch to allow a

give it an extra half-inch to allow a
little<00:03:31.630> bit<00:03:31.750> extra<00:03:31.990> the<00:03:32.200> image<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.680> wrap

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
little bit extra the image to wrap

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.220 
little bit extra the image to wrap
around<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:34.030> backside<00:03:34.270> of<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.690> stretcher<00:03:35.050> bar

around the backside of the stretcher bar

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.370 
around the backside of the stretcher bar
with<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.220> said<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.880> new<00:03:37.060> canvas<00:03:37.540> size<00:03:37.720> is<00:03:37.960> 22

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
with that said the new canvas size is 22

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.820 
with that said the new canvas size is 22
and<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.560> half<00:03:38.590> by<00:03:39.250> 18<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.880> half<00:03:40.590> next<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.710> want

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
and a half by 18 and a half next I want

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.460 
and a half by 18 and a half next I want
to<00:03:42.010> reflect<00:03:42.310> or<00:03:42.790> mirror<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.900> edges<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.320> the

to reflect or mirror the edges of the
canvas<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.870> we<00:03:46.990> start<00:03:47.170> out<00:03:47.320> by<00:03:47.470> selecting<00:03:47.980> the
