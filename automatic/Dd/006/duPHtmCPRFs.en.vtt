00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.629
 hello guys how good are you welcome to 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.790
 a new video first of all I want 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.350
 to thank jordi ya or for 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.270
 to have stuck a currada so big 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.529
 for all of us I will leave the 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.029
 description of the video the channel of the 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.910
 kid to pass and you throw a 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:20.089
 glance jordi wanted that this so what 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.849
 will raffle I asked my opinion several 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:25.730
 options and others but I decided 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.640
 talking to him that's clear it 's from 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.679
 give it to all of you all do not do 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.720
 a raffle does not simply put a 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.490
 small goal that was to reach 300 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.400
 likes that I think it's more than I've 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.350
 done since in many of my 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.740
 videos we have not already made 300 we have done 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.630
 a lot more 400 500 things like that 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.490
 then no longer for me but for jordi 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.620
 I think that is what he deserves for all the 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.300
 effort for what has been worked 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.910
 for all of us guys for giving us 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.610
 this exclusive theme for our play 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.050
 so good the only requirement for 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.540
 that everyone can enjoy this new 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.020
 have given him a lay video and if 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.110
 we reached the figure of 300 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.870
 because the link will appear in a 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.040
 snapshot in the video according to the 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.170
 video information so that everyone 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.400
 you can download as soon as you all have 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.890
 the link the only thing you have to do 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.230
 is to put a pendrive in your 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.990
 computer 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.210
 We open a new folder that folder 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.950
 called ps3 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.960
 inside that folder we will create a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.330
 new folder this time it has to be called 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.940
 issue of h &amp; m both the ps3 folder and 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.730
 the tm folder must be uppercase 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.040
 everything and in the tm folder the only thing that 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.570
 we have to do is put our theme 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.710
 in exclusive agreement for playstation 3 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.200
 we put it there we extract the pen 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.170
 and we put it in our system 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.390
 playstation3 once we have done all 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.760
 all these steps the only thing that we have 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.250
 what to do 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:59.040
 it's no theme settings we select 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.500
 and we select theme here by default 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.200
 will put us original or we will have it in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.000
 classic or previously if some already 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.800
 you have installed some new topic 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.170
 I'm going to know how to do it let's go to the 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.030
 top part where good to install you 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.410
 we give x and there we will appear our 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.050
 device in our pendrive of 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.700
 agreement we select and within this 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.630
 pendrive there is our theme 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.070
 it's called gh and tm we give it to the x and y 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.440
 our system is already being installed 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.060
 play station 3 now the only thing 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.099
 we have to do is give the X 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.069
 and here as you can see it has been installed 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:37.300
 our our new subject we give to the 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.300
 right and we apply 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.629
 we already have it here there is a total of 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.629
 three images I think he told me 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.360
 to see if I'm not wrong heights sometimes 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.550
 I'm pretty clueless but I think 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.930
 very much the guy that we had a total 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.390
 of 3 and well guys that's all I think 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.750
 300 likes work circle around the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.300
 effort and dedication that I have made and 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.220
 forget all of us mega guys a 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.270
 final hug we see in the next video 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.270
 until next time
