plug it into stereo so in an onion I
didn't<00:01:42.189> like<00:01:42.340> just<00:01:42.579> norm<00:01:42.820> line<00:01:43.030> in<00:01:43.180> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
didn't like just norm line in and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.260 
didn't like just norm line in and
basically<00:01:44.590> acts<00:01:45.100> as<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.369> kind<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:45.759> receiver<00:01:46.149> so

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
basically acts as a kind of receiver so

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.090 
basically acts as a kind of receiver so
you<00:01:46.329> can<00:01:46.450> stream<00:01:46.659> with<00:01:46.840> music<00:01:47.229> straight<00:01:47.950> to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
you can stream with music straight to

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.249 
you can stream with music straight to
your<00:01:48.250> stereo<00:01:48.579> and<00:01:48.880> play<00:01:49.509> it<00:01:49.630> with<00:01:49.869> actual

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
your stereo and play it with actual

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.719
