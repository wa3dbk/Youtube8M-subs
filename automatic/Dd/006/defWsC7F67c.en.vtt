running it to progress in the game

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.440 
running it to progress in the game
I<00:04:17.160> think<00:04:17.490> people<00:04:17.670> are<00:04:17.910> just<00:04:17.940> trying<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.330> do<00:04:18.390> it

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
I think people are just trying to do it

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.600 
I think people are just trying to do it
for<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.690> views<00:04:18.930> now<00:04:19.170> and<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:20.100> think<00:04:20.310> this<00:04:20.400> was

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
for the views now and I think this was

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.520 
for the views now and I think this was
becoming<00:04:21.420> a<00:04:21.570> gameplay<00:04:21.930> channels<00:04:22.260> it's<00:04:22.380> not

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
becoming a gameplay channels it's not

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.930 
becoming a gameplay channels it's not
about<00:04:22.770> it's<00:04:22.980> trying<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.250> get<00:04:23.370> big<00:04:23.580> it's<00:04:23.850> not

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
about it's trying to get big it's not

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.550 
about it's trying to get big it's not
trying<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.270> improve<00:04:24.720> yourself<00:04:25.140> as<00:04:25.260> a<00:04:25.290> player
