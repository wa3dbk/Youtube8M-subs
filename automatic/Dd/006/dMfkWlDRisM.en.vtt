processor has a certain capacity for
liquid<00:00:22.740> okay<00:00:23.460> if<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.210> overfill<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.140> will

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
liquid okay if you overfill it it will

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.769 
liquid okay if you overfill it it will
leak<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.010> you'll<00:00:26.820> notice<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.570> has<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
leak and you'll notice that it has a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.960 
leak and you'll notice that it has a
line<00:00:28.230> most<00:00:28.740> food<00:00:29.039> processors<00:00:29.670> will<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:29.939> a

liquid and you can fill them up pretty
much<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.969> way<00:00:42.320> now<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:44.399> other

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
much all the way now the other

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.389 
much all the way now the other
difference<00:00:44.850> are<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.600> blades<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:47.129> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
difference are the blades you have a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.209 
difference are the blades you have a
blade<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.600> serrated<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> food

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
blade that is serrated for a food

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.189 
blade that is serrated for a food
processor<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:52.500> blade<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:54.020> blender<00:00:55.020> is

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
processor and the blade for a blender is

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.619 
processor and the blade for a blender is
not<00:00:55.260> serrated<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.280> they're<00:00:56.850> actually<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
not serrated and they're actually in a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.569 
not serrated and they're actually in a
different<00:00:57.960> manner<00:00:58.140> somewhat<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.460> can

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
different manner somewhat so it can

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.000 
different manner somewhat so it can
aerate<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.359> force<00:01:01.020> air<00:01:01.260> into<00:01:01.829> whatever

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
aerate and force air into whatever

you can absolutely use your food
processor<00:01:26.580> for<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.750> you're

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
processor for that because you're

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.330 
processor for that because you're
probably<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.650> go<00:01:28.829> over<00:01:28.860> this

probably not going to go over this
liquid<00:01:29.759> max<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.930> other<00:01:31.110> difference<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:32.000> that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
liquid max the other difference is that

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
can use it to shred cheese you can use

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.230 
can use it to shred cheese you can use
it<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.579> slice<00:01:39.140> now<00:01:40.140> that's<00:01:40.950> simply<00:01:41.640> by<00:01:41.820> using

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
it to slice now that's simply by using

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.670 
it to slice now that's simply by using

utilizing it in the manner in which you
need<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.570> now<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:49.500> blender<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.340> not<00:01:50.520> going<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> be

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
need it now a blender is not going to be

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.420 
need it now a blender is not going to be
able<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.530> you'll<00:01:53.009> need<00:01:53.220> to

able to do that so you'll need to

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.730 
able to do that so you'll need to
utilize<00:01:53.850> your<00:01:54.090> food<00:01:54.299> processor<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.140> slicing

your<00:02:11.050> food<00:02:11.230> processor<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:12.280> blender<00:02:12.730> is

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
your food processor the blender is

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.300 
your food processor the blender is
generally<00:02:13.510> for<00:02:13.690> liquids<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.319> try<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.860> go<00:02:15.130> with

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
generally for liquids and try to go with

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.949 
generally for liquids and try to go with
that<00:02:15.490> that's<00:02:15.880> probably<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.450> good<00:02:16.690> rule<00:02:16.900> of

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
that that's probably a good rule of

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.990 
that that's probably a good rule of
thumb<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.500> difference<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.340> between<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.970> two

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
thumb the difference is between the two

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.720 
thumb the difference is between the two
if<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:20.140> don't<00:02:20.350> have<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> food<00:02:20.950> processor<00:02:21.160> you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
if you don't have a food processor you

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.449 
if you don't have a food processor you
can<00:02:22.420> by<00:02:22.870> all<00:02:22.900> means<00:02:23.319> use<00:02:23.680> your<00:02:23.890> blender<00:02:24.280> to

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
can by all means use your blender to

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.730 
can by all means use your blender to
let's<00:02:24.670> say<00:02:24.850> blend<00:02:25.180> down<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.780> almonds<00:02:26.470> or

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
let's say blend down the almonds or

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.810 
let's say blend down the almonds or
blend<00:02:27.670> down<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:29.320> I'm<00:02:29.770> using<00:02:30.130> blending<00:02:30.670> I

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
blend down and I'm using blending I

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.300 
blend down and I'm using blending I
don't<00:02:31.300> mean<00:02:31.420> use<00:02:31.600> blending<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.440> can<00:02:32.680> chop

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
don't mean use blending you can chop

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.430 
don't mean use blending you can chop
down<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.880> almonds<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.870> size<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:35.290> you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
down the almonds to the size that you

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.840 
down the almonds to the size that you
want<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.830> you'll<00:02:35.980> probably<00:02:36.160> be<00:02:36.459> able<00:02:36.670> to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
want and you'll probably be able to

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.570 
want and you'll probably be able to
accomplish<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.300> with<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.660> blender<00:02:38.050> but<00:02:38.890> you'd

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
accomplish that with a blender but you'd

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.660 
accomplish that with a blender but you'd
probably<00:02:39.880> be<00:02:40.300> better<00:02:40.510> off<00:02:40.630> having<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.920> choice

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
probably be better off having the choice

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.320 
probably be better off having the choice
of<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.360> food<00:02:43.690> processor<00:02:43.959> or<00:02:44.560> blender<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:45.430> if<00:02:45.700> all

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
of a food processor or blender so if all

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.930 
of a food processor or blender so if all
you<00:02:46.360> have<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:47.110> blender<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.769> might<00:02:48.580> be<00:02:48.730> able

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
you have is a blender you might be able

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.690 
you have is a blender you might be able
to<00:02:49.000> make<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.450> but<00:02:50.350> if<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.739> have<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:50.980> choice<00:02:51.340> I

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
to make do but if I have the choice I

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.720 
to make do but if I have the choice I
would<00:02:52.510> absolutely<00:02:52.660> choose<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:54.519> food

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
would absolutely choose the food

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.570 
would absolutely choose the food
processor<00:02:55.450> because<00:02:56.019> it's<00:02:56.950> what<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:57.370> made

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
processor because it's what it's made

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.490 
processor because it's what it's made
for<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.750> has<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.080> many<00:02:59.170> different

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
for and it has so many different

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.949 
for and it has so many different
applications<00:02:59.700> see<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.880> difference<00:03:01.269> then

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
applications see the difference then

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.530 
applications see the difference then
you'll<00:03:02.140> know<00:03:02.350> and<00:03:02.620> then<00:03:03.160> you'll<00:03:03.310> realize

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
you'll know and then you'll realize

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.910 
you'll know and then you'll realize
where<00:03:04.540> you'll<00:03:04.720> make<00:03:04.900> your<00:03:05.050> choices<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.560> when

where you'll make your choices of when

where you'll make your choices of when
to<00:03:06.040> use<00:03:06.070> your<00:03:06.220> blender<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.880> when<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.510> use<00:03:07.540> your
