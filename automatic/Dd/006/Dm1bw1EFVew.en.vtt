window<00:02:26.870> into<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.709> future<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.130> gaming<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:32.630> what

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
window into the future of gaming so what

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.660 
window into the future of gaming so what
I'm<00:02:32.870> going<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.080> do<00:02:33.380> is<00:02:33.650> I'm<00:02:34.250> actually<00:02:34.370> going<00:02:34.610> to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:42.250 
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
try<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:34.910> run<00:02:35.240> a<00:02:35.510> game<00:02:36.020> in<00:02:36.459> dx11<00:02:38.650> on<00:02:39.650> my<00:02:40.550> epad<00:02:41.260> so

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
try and run a game in dx11 on my epad so

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.030 
try and run a game in dx11 on my epad so
this<00:02:42.800> is<00:02:42.980> actually<00:02:43.130> now<00:02:43.810> my<00:02:44.810> computer<00:02:45.350> desktop

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
this is actually now my computer desktop

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.890 
this is actually now my computer desktop
here<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:47.360> can<00:02:47.750> basically<00:02:48.970> use<00:02:49.970> this<00:02:50.660> to

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
here and I can basically use this to

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.949 
here and I can basically use this to
control<00:02:51.290> my<00:02:51.500> computer<00:02:52.100> remotely<00:02:52.660> say<00:02:53.660> for

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
control my computer remotely say for

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.240 
control my computer remotely say for
example<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.470> can<00:02:54.530> open<00:02:54.920> up<00:02:55.060> my<00:02:58.840> games<00:02:59.840> folder

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
example I can open up my games folder

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.009 
example I can open up my games folder
but<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.310> think<00:03:01.519> we're<00:03:01.670> going<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.880> have<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.780> go

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
but I think we're going to have a go

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.430 
but I think we're going to have a go
with<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.590> Sid<00:03:03.860> Meier's<00:03:04.070> Civilization<00:03:04.489> today

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
with that Sid Meier's Civilization today

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.990 
with that Sid Meier's Civilization today
and<00:03:06.440> now<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:06.650> haven't<00:03:06.890> tried<00:03:07.160> this<00:03:07.459> I'm<00:03:07.820> not

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
and now I haven't tried this I'm not

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.280 
and now I haven't tried this I'm not
under<00:03:08.209> percent<00:03:08.420> certain<00:03:08.780> it's<00:03:08.900> going<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.050> work

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
under percent certain it's going to work

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.180 
under percent certain it's going to work
but<00:03:09.680> we'll<00:03:09.890> see<00:03:10.220> what<00:03:10.400> happens<00:03:14.890> ok<00:03:15.890> let's

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
but we'll see what happens ok let's

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.000 
but we'll see what happens ok let's
doing<00:03:16.459> something

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.800 

and<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.500> screen<00:03:25.830> on<00:03:26.069> here<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.489> 1280<00:03:27.390> x<00:03:27.629> 800

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
and so the screen on here is 1280 x 800

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.119 
and so the screen on here is 1280 x 800
pixels<00:03:29.450> it's<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.540> beautiful<00:03:30.720> screen<00:03:31.620> made<00:03:31.950> with

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
pixels it's a beautiful screen made with

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.429 
pixels it's a beautiful screen made with
Gorilla<00:03:32.459> Glass<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.450> it's<00:03:33.689> not<00:03:33.870> going<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.230> break

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
Gorilla Glass so it's not going to break

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.399 
Gorilla Glass so it's not going to break
anytime<00:03:34.829> soon<00:03:35.720> let's<00:03:36.720> see<00:03:36.870> what's<00:03:37.079> happening

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
anytime soon let's see what's happening

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:44.509 
anytime soon let's see what's happening
here<00:03:40.400> okay<00:03:41.400> looks<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.390> we're<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:44.340> I'm

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
here okay looks like we're in so I'm

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.949 
here okay looks like we're in so I'm
going<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.730> just<00:03:44.790> start<00:03:45.150> up<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.390> single<00:03:45.569> player

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
going to just start up a single player

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:54.229 
going to just start up a single player
game<00:03:48.409> it's<00:03:49.409> picked<00:03:49.650> me<00:03:49.799> as<00:03:49.890> Elizabeth<00:03:53.239> I'll

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
game it's picked me as Elizabeth I'll

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.520 
game it's picked me as Elizabeth I'll
turn<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.659> volume<00:03:54.900> down<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:55.109> bit<00:03:56.450> um<00:03:57.530> so

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
turn the volume down a bit um so

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.680 
turn the volume down a bit um so
basically<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.609> going<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.790> allow<00:04:00.060> me<00:04:00.299> to

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
basically this is going to allow me to

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.300 
basically this is going to allow me to
play<00:04:01.139> my<00:04:01.379> games<00:04:01.739> remotely<00:04:02.609> and<00:04:03.920> this<00:04:04.920> really

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
play my games remotely and this really

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.119 
play my games remotely and this really
is<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.639> simple<00:04:06.480> eyes<00:04:06.599> diversion<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.530> cloud

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
is a simple eyes diversion of the cloud

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.000 
is a simple eyes diversion of the cloud
computing<00:04:08.879> that<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.870> new<00:04:10.019> on<00:04:10.260> live<00:04:10.590> system

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
computing that the new on live system

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.000 
computing that the new on live system
offers<00:04:11.849> so<00:04:12.720> here<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:12.959> am<00:04:13.109> I<00:04:13.230> got<00:04:13.409> my<00:04:13.530> settlers

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
offers so here I am I got my settlers

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.949 
offers so here I am I got my settlers
let's<00:04:14.400> move<00:04:14.760> them<00:04:15.889> let's<00:04:16.889> uh<00:04:17.070> let's<00:04:17.959> settle

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
let's move them let's uh let's settle

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.680 
let's move them let's uh let's settle
them<00:04:19.289> shall<00:04:19.620> we<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:20.669> there<00:04:20.850> we<00:04:20.940> go<00:04:20.970> is<00:04:21.269> founded

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
them shall we so there we go is founded

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.830 
them shall we so there we go is founded
London<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:23.610> we've<00:04:23.760> got<00:04:23.850> some<00:04:24.060> workers<00:04:24.570> will

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
London and we've got some workers will

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.320 
London and we've got some workers will
move<00:04:25.050> those<00:04:25.410> over<00:04:25.460> here<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:29.030> there<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.120> go

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
move those over here and there you go

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.260 
move those over here and there you go

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
and what cloud computing allows you to

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.400 
and what cloud computing allows you to
do<00:04:35.310> is<00:04:35.580> run<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:35.940> comb<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.780> program<00:04:37.229> or<00:04:37.380> the

watching<00:04:43.919> on<00:04:44.039> settings<00:04:44.460> devices<00:04:44.970> like<00:04:45.120> this

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
watching on settings devices like this

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.589 
watching on settings devices like this
and<00:04:46.560> even<00:04:46.740> your<00:04:46.979> television<00:04:47.639> will<00:04:48.240> be<00:04:48.330> able<00:04:48.419> to

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
and even your television will be able to

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.240 
and even your television will be able to
run<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.780> most<00:04:49.020> powerful<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.949> most<00:04:50.870> dynamically

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
run the most powerful a most dynamically

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.820 
run the most powerful a most dynamically
engaging<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:53.960> graphically<00:04:54.960> intensive<00:04:55.500> games

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
engaging and graphically intensive games

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.490 
engaging and graphically intensive games
on<00:04:56.280> just<00:04:56.760> about<00:04:56.880> any<00:04:57.210> machine<00:04:57.630> because<00:04:58.380> all

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
on just about any machine because all

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.990 
on just about any machine because all
you're<00:04:58.650> doing<00:04:58.860> is<00:04:58.949> streaming<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.430> video<00:04:59.699> and

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
you're doing is streaming the video and

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.960 
you're doing is streaming the video and
then<00:05:00.120> streaming<00:05:00.539> the<00:05:00.630> controls<00:05:01.020> back<00:05:01.789> so<00:05:02.789> I

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
then streaming the controls back so I

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.089 
then streaming the controls back so I
think<00:05:03.120> that<00:05:03.630> is<00:05:03.750> pretty<00:05:03.990> darn<00:05:04.470> impressive<00:05:07.099> now

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
think that is pretty darn impressive now

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.360 
think that is pretty darn impressive now
obviously<00:05:08.430> this<00:05:09.320> this<00:05:10.320> tablet<00:05:10.680> does<00:05:11.130> have<00:05:11.280> an

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
obviously this this tablet does have an

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.659
