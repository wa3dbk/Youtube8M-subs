00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
called all the way up to back to the top

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.470 
called all the way up to back to the top
of<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.869> prison<00:00:31.289> or<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:32.850> start<00:00:33.239> off

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
of the prison or you can just start off

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.440 
of the prison or you can just start off
where<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.050> are<00:00:34.350> when<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> spawn<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.000> then<00:00:36.149> go

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
where you are when you spawn and then go

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.959 
where you are when you spawn and then go
up<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.899> think<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.399> third<00:00:38.610> floor<00:00:38.640> and

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
up I think it is to the third floor and

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.959 
up I think it is to the third floor and
just<00:00:39.750> buy<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.320> couple<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> doors<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.879> were

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
just buy a couple of doors and you were

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.850 
just buy a couple of doors and you were
there<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.690> option<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.350> best<00:00:43.559> just

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
there I like that option the best just

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.029 
there I like that option the best just
because<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.879> very<00:00:45.000> fast<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.989> also<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.500> cost

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
because it's a very fast and also a cost

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.350 
because it's a very fast and also a cost
less<00:00:47.340> than<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.670> through<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.969> Citadel

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
less than going through the Citadel

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.080 
less than going through the Citadel
tunnels<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.530> also<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.129> don't<00:00:50.520> really<00:00:50.730> get<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
tunnels but also you don't really get to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.970 
tunnels but also you don't really get to
go<00:00:51.329> past<00:00:51.809> drug<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:52.440> because<00:00:52.649> they're

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
go past drug or not because they're

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.520 
go past drug or not because they're
going<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.219> spot<00:00:53.520> down<00:00:53.850> by<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> dock<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.079> it's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
going to spot down by the dock so it's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.220 
going to spot down by the dock so it's
kind<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.829> unfortunate<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:56.780> pick<00:00:57.780> which<00:00:57.989> one

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
kind of unfortunate but pick which one
