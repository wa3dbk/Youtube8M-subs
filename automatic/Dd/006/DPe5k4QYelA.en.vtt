said it's going to do but I think it's

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.270 
said it's going to do but I think it's
even<00:04:03.580> gone<00:04:03.970> beyond<00:04:04.240> that<00:04:04.480> I<00:04:04.750> think<00:04:05.740> everybody

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
even gone beyond that I think everybody

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.380 
even gone beyond that I think everybody
really<00:04:06.520> knows<00:04:06.670> that<00:04:06.850> we're<00:04:06.940> making<00:04:07.060> something

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
really knows that we're making something

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.990 
really knows that we're making something
special<00:04:07.540> right<00:04:07.900> now<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.860> whole<00:04:12.010> genesis<00:04:12.520> game

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
special right now the whole genesis game

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.700 
special right now the whole genesis game
was<00:04:13.300> trying<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.840> create<00:04:14.200> something<00:04:14.290> that's

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
was trying to create something that's

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.180 
was trying to create something that's
been<00:04:15.310> in<00:04:15.460> my<00:04:15.490> imagination<00:04:15.880> for<00:04:16.720> 20<00:04:17.620> years<00:04:17.890> and

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
been in my imagination for 20 years and

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.920 
been in my imagination for 20 years and
I<00:04:18.910> think<00:04:18.940> we've<00:04:19.209> definitely<00:04:19.420> delivered<00:04:19.840> on

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
I think we've definitely delivered on

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.080 
I think we've definitely delivered on
that
