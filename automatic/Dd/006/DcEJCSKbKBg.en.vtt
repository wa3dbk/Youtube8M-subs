almost like they were making fun of the
games<00:01:26.100> themselves<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.840> that's<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
games themselves so that's one of the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.039 
games themselves so that's one of the
two<00:01:29.400> things<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.119> notable<00:01:30.509> about<00:01:30.869> this

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.490 
two things that are notable about this
release<00:01:32.210> maybe<00:01:33.210> three<00:01:33.570> things<00:01:33.900> depending<00:01:34.409> on

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
release maybe three things depending on

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.830 
release maybe three things depending on
how<00:01:34.710> interested<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.790> 3d<00:01:36.299> blast<00:01:36.479> in

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
how interested you are in 3d blast in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:02:22.040 
how interested you are in 3d blast in
the<00:01:36.930> first<00:01:37.170> place<00:01:37.470> but

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.830 

so<00:02:23.050> that's<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.830> I'm<00:02:24.760> not<00:02:25.030> sure<00:02:25.270> what<00:02:25.420> purpose

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
so that's that I'm not sure what purpose

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.140 
so that's that I'm not sure what purpose
that<00:02:26.050> song<00:02:26.350> is<00:02:26.620> meant<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.040> serve<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.940> game

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
that song is meant to serve in the game

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.050 
that song is meant to serve in the game
but<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.410> do<00:02:29.530> know<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.220> actually<00:02:30.730> still

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
but I do know that it actually still

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.450 
but I do know that it actually still
exists<00:02:31.720> in<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.170> final<00:02:32.560> version<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:33.190> through

safe state hacking can be accessed

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.620 
safe state hacking can be accessed
depending<00:02:37.510> on<00:02:37.630> how<00:02:37.930> many<00:02:38.380> people<00:02:38.770> actually

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
depending on how many people actually

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.450 
depending on how many people actually
comment<00:02:40.630> on<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.200> saying<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.650> they'd<00:02:41.920> want<00:02:41.950> to

hear it in the final
I<00:02:43.900> might<00:02:44.740> actually<00:02:44.950> put<00:02:45.460> up<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.700> link<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.150> safe

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
I might actually put up a link to a safe

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.470 
I might actually put up a link to a safe
state<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:48.340> I'm<00:02:48.640> not<00:02:48.820> going<00:02:49.210> to<00:02:49.240> do<00:02:49.450> it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
state of it but I'm not going to do it

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.800 
state of it but I'm not going to do it
like<00:02:49.930> online<00:02:50.320> I<00:02:51.210> know<00:02:52.210> that<00:02:52.600> they're<00:02:52.780> out

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
like online I know that they're out

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.940 
like online I know that they're out
there<00:02:52.990> somewhere<00:02:55.170> because<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.590> certainly

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
there somewhere because I certainly

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.900 
there somewhere because I certainly
didn't<00:02:57.340> make<00:02:57.490> them<00:02:57.700> myself<00:02:57.880> but<00:02:59.370> anyway<00:03:00.370> one

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
didn't make them myself but anyway one

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.240 
didn't make them myself but anyway one
last<00:03:01.750> thing<00:03:02.200> really<00:03:02.650> worth<00:03:02.980> noting<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.850> think

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
last thing really worth noting I think

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.220 
last thing really worth noting I think
well<00:03:06.250> first<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.760> all<00:03:06.820> that<00:03:07.060> says<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.810> final

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
well first of all that says is the final

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.420

thing I forget if the box music
against<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.069> bosses<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:31.700> gives<00:03:31.849> what<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.120> is

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
against the bosses it gives what it is

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.750 
against the bosses it gives what it is
in<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.480> final<00:03:32.870> then<00:03:33.080> I<00:03:33.530> just<00:03:34.190> want<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.519> check

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
in the final then I just want to check

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.690 
in the final then I just want to check
for<00:03:35.110> rusty<00:03:36.110> room<00:03:36.410> as<00:03:36.530> well<00:03:36.709> if<00:03:37.010> they<00:03:37.250> just<00:03:37.459> used

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
for rusty room as well if they just used

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.070 
for rusty room as well if they just used
a<00:03:37.849> single<00:03:38.090> song<00:03:38.480> oh<00:03:39.280> no<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:40.670> guess<00:03:41.569> they<00:03:41.810> only

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
a single song oh no I guess they only

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.720 
a single song oh no I guess they only
used<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.800> song<00:03:43.099> and<00:03:43.400> not<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:43.760> shorter<00:03:44.150> one<00:03:45.730> also

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
used a song and not the shorter one also

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.640 
used a song and not the shorter one also
sonic<00:03:48.580> feebly<00:03:49.580> the<00:03:49.819> plaster<00:03:50.569> coming<00:03:51.290> think<00:03:51.530> of

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
sonic feebly the plaster coming think of

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.449 
sonic feebly the plaster coming think of
it<00:03:53.980> just<00:03:54.980> interesting<00:03:56.950> which<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.190> final

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
it just interesting which the final

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:07.539 
it just interesting which the final
version<00:03:59.030> wasn't<00:03:59.239> fast<00:03:59.780> is<00:04:00.140> that<00:04:06.220> okay<00:04:07.220> check

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
version wasn't fast is that okay check

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.780 
version wasn't fast is that okay check
again<00:04:07.970> in<00:04:08.180> spring<00:04:08.420> stadium<00:04:09.049> I<00:04:11.019> don't<00:04:12.019> know

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
again in spring stadium I don't know

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.789 
again in spring stadium I don't know
maybe<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:14.030> was<00:04:14.150> just<00:04:14.209> some<00:04:14.660> weird<00:04:15.049> flute<00:04:15.530> at

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
maybe it was just some weird flute at

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.440 
maybe it was just some weird flute at
that<00:04:16.040> level<00:04:16.310> or<00:04:16.669> something

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
that level or something

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.050 
that level or something
he<00:04:18.019> doesn't<00:04:18.350> seem<00:04:18.560> quite<00:04:18.979> as<00:04:19.160> fast<00:04:19.489> in<00:04:19.880> this

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
he doesn't seem quite as fast in this

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.379 
he doesn't seem quite as fast in this
one<00:04:23.860> yeah<00:04:24.860> this<00:04:25.160> seems<00:04:25.340> about<00:04:25.580> normal<00:04:26.090> speed

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
one yeah this seems about normal speed

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.360 
one yeah this seems about normal speed
so<00:04:26.600> maybe<00:04:26.870> I<00:04:26.990> was<00:04:27.200> just<00:04:27.410> to<00:04:27.680> loosen<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:28.160> ting

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
so maybe I was just to loosen a ting

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.360 
so maybe I was just to loosen a ting
there<00:04:28.550> or<00:04:29.470> ultimately<00:04:30.470> that<00:04:30.770> level<00:04:31.130> played

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
there or ultimately that level played

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.940 
there or ultimately that level played
slower<00:04:31.790> than<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.330> should<00:04:35.440> is<00:04:36.440> there<00:04:36.740> anything

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
slower than it should is there anything

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.120 
slower than it should is there anything
else<00:04:37.370> here<00:04:37.970> I<00:04:38.210> don't<00:04:39.639> really<00:04:40.639> think<00:04:40.760> so<00:04:41.360> I

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
else here I don't really think so I

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.430 
else here I don't really think so I
think<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.550> level<00:04:43.760> order<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.510> even<00:04:45.080> as<00:04:45.229> it

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
think the level order is even as it

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.129 
think the level order is even as it
should<00:04:45.680> be<00:04:45.889> and<00:04:46.880> some<00:04:47.180> of<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.360> other<00:04:47.479> ones<00:04:47.780> for

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
should be and some of the other ones for

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.070 
should be and some of the other ones for
example<00:04:48.610> gene<00:04:49.610> gadget<00:04:50.180> was<00:04:50.360> actually<00:04:50.870> put

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
example gene gadget was actually put

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.879 
example gene gadget was actually put
first<00:04:51.500> on<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.860> list<00:04:53.229> music<00:04:54.229> choices<00:04:54.470> are<00:04:54.800> all

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
first on the list music choices are all

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.330 
first on the list music choices are all
pretty<00:04:55.190> much<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.400> same<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:57.010> yeah<00:04:58.010> that's<00:04:58.250> the

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
pretty much the same and yeah that's the

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.140 
pretty much the same and yeah that's the
ending<00:04:59.120> for<00:04:59.510> that<00:04:59.660> also<00:05:00.620> special<00:05:01.490> stages<00:05:01.760> do

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
ending for that also special stages do

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.279 
ending for that also special stages do
exist<00:05:02.539> and<00:05:02.840> they<00:05:02.930> are<00:05:03.440> complete<00:05:04.750> so<00:05:05.750> in<00:05:06.050> case

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
exist and they are complete so in case

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.529 
exist and they are complete so in case
you're<00:05:06.530> wondering<00:05:06.650> about<00:05:07.039> that<00:05:10.030> black<00:05:11.030> ring

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
you're wondering about that black ring

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.640 
you're wondering about that black ring
counter<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.229> same<00:05:12.500> layout<00:05:13.130> seemed<00:05:13.700> to<00:05:13.940> be

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
counter the same layout seemed to be

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.580 
counter the same layout seemed to be
well<00:05:15.520> it's<00:05:15.730> hard<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.000> tell<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:20.230> I've<00:05:20.410> never

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
well it's hard to tell and I've never

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.290 
well it's hard to tell and I've never
really<00:05:21.100> pulled<00:05:21.460> that<00:05:21.700> close<00:05:22.000> of<00:05:22.210> the

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
really pulled that close of the

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.650 
really pulled that close of the
attention<00:05:22.690> to<00:05:23.280> where<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.310> wings<00:05:24.670> replaced<00:05:25.240> in

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
attention to where the wings replaced in

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.260 
attention to where the wings replaced in
this<00:05:25.990> game<00:05:27.390> what<00:05:28.390> I<00:05:29.370> do<00:05:30.370> like<00:05:30.700> the<00:05:30.880> software

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
this game what I do like the software

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.270 
this game what I do like the software
squealing<00:05:31.990> that<00:05:32.140> they<00:05:32.320> have<00:05:32.560> here<00:05:32.860> it's<00:05:33.070> much

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
squealing that they have here it's much

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.800 
squealing that they have here it's much
better<00:05:33.490> than<00:05:33.790> the<00:05:33.850> time<00:05:34.180> that<00:05:34.420> they<00:05:34.540> had

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
better than the time that they had

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.890 
better than the time that they had
initially<00:05:35.350> came<00:05:35.670> for<00:05:36.670> the<00:05:36.820> sonic<00:05:37.300> choose

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
initially came for the sonic choose

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.560 
initially came for the sonic choose
special<00:05:38.500> fades<00:05:38.830> they<00:05:39.220> use<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.700> software<00:05:40.120> and

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
special fades they use the software and

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.550 
special fades they use the software and
that<00:05:40.840> really<00:05:41.200> didn't<00:05:41.710> turn<00:05:41.890> out<00:05:42.040> well<00:05:42.100> and<00:05:43.560> if

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
that really didn't turn out well and if

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.260 
that really didn't turn out well and if
you<00:05:44.740> ought<00:05:44.920> to<00:05:44.950> know<00:05:45.130> that<00:05:45.340> I<00:05:45.460> mean<00:05:45.700> you<00:05:46.060> should

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
you ought to know that I mean you should

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.270 
you ought to know that I mean you should
check<00:05:46.540> out<00:05:46.750> all<00:05:46.930> of<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.110> prototype<00:05:47.920> believe

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
check out all of the prototype believe

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.030 
check out all of the prototype believe
is<00:05:48.520> good<00:05:48.700> at<00:05:48.790> the<00:05:48.970> make<00:05:49.290> because<00:05:50.290> that's<00:05:50.800> where

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
is good at the make because that's where

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.810 
is good at the make because that's where
you'll<00:05:51.220> see<00:05:51.250> them<00:05:51.670> in<00:05:51.910> beta<00:05:52.780> five<00:05:53.820> indication

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
you'll see them in beta five indication

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.260 
you'll see them in beta five indication
also<00:05:55.570> probably<00:05:55.960> a<00:05:55.990> couple<00:05:56.200> of<00:05:56.380> the<00:05:56.500> later<00:05:56.710> ones

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
also probably a couple of the later ones
