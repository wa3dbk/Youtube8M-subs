juggling tutorials so here's one that I

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.749 
juggling tutorials so here's one that I
haven't<00:00:09.510> shown<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:09.870> yet<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.219> where<00:00:11.429> you

haven't shown you yet this is where you

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.870 
haven't shown you yet this is where you
go<00:00:11.849> like<00:00:12.000> this<00:00:15.890> and<00:00:16.890> then<00:00:17.250> another<00:00:17.490> variation

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
go like this and then another variation

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.700 
go like this and then another variation
of<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:19.760> like<00:00:20.760> this

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:34.520 

or<00:00:24.710> I<00:00:25.339> quit

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.069 

yeah<00:00:35.530> that's<00:00:35.859> pretty<00:00:36.039> tough<00:00:36.309> I'm<00:00:37.030> teaching<00:00:37.960> my

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
yeah that's pretty tough I'm teaching my

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
see it see if they can learn so the idea

your two fingers so once it's there then
what<00:00:54.879> you<00:00:55.000> do<00:00:55.149> is<00:00:55.180> you<00:00:55.479> just<00:00:55.510> let<00:00:55.809> go<00:00:55.930> if<00:00:56.079> it's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
what you do is you just let go if it's

fall<00:00:56.439> okay<00:00:57.100> but<00:00:57.519> you<00:00:57.579> don't<00:00:57.699> just<00:00:57.820> let<00:00:58.030> go<00:00:58.210> of

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
fall okay but you don't just let go of

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.229 
fall okay but you don't just let go of
it<00:00:58.479> you<00:00:58.739> throw<00:00:59.739> this<00:00:59.920> ball<00:01:00.159> up<00:01:00.369> like<00:01:00.609> that<00:01:00.789> so

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
it you throw this ball up like that so

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.689 
it you throw this ball up like that so
it's<00:01:01.390> you<00:01:02.229> can<00:01:02.260> even<00:01:02.589> just<00:01:02.949> practice<00:01:03.339> with<00:01:03.519> two

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
it's you can even just practice with two

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.300 
it's you can even just practice with two
balls<00:01:03.939> throw<00:01:04.360> this<00:01:04.509> one<00:01:04.720> up<00:01:04.899> and<00:01:05.140> let<00:01:05.799> go<00:01:05.979> and

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
balls throw this one up and let go and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.520 
balls throw this one up and let go and
throw<00:01:06.819> this<00:01:06.940> one<00:01:07.090> up<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:07.390> catch<00:01:07.569> and<00:01:08.319> throw

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
throw this one up and catch and throw

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:18.610 
throw this one up and catch and throw
and<00:01:09.030> let<00:01:10.030> go<00:01:10.179> let<00:01:10.990> go

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:36.080 

you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210 

once<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.009> pretty

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
once you can do that so that it's pretty

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.700 
once you can do that so that it's pretty
fast<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.939> then<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.200> try<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.590> it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
fast like this then you can try to do it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.100 
fast like this then you can try to do it
in<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.040> juggling<00:01:41.399> pattern<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:42.899> this

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
in a juggling pattern so it's like this

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.100 
in a juggling pattern so it's like this
and<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:44.490> ball<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.659> ball<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:45.990> just

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
and this ball is just this ball is just

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.039 
and this ball is just this ball is just
going<00:01:46.289> up<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.710> down<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> so

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
going up and down as you as you do it so

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.620 
going up and down as you as you do it so
it's<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.479> can

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
it's like this and you can and you can

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.060 
it's like this and you can and you can
stop<00:01:51.840> right<00:01:52.049> here<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.220> 1<00:01:53.640> 2<00:01:54.030> 3<00:01:54.360> 4<00:01:54.840> back<00:01:55.679> so

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
stop right here so it's 1 2 3 4 back so

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.929 
stop right here so it's 1 2 3 4 back so
just<00:01:56.100> try<00:01:56.369> doing<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
just try doing that

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.090 
just try doing that
it's<00:01:57.539> drop<00:01:57.960> throws<00:01:58.470> like<00:01:59.310> that<00:02:00.649> okay<00:02:01.649> slow

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it's drop throws like that okay slow

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:11.729 
it's drop throws like that okay slow
motion

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.860 

yeah<00:02:12.739> and<00:02:12.860> then<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.610> just<00:02:13.819> keep<00:02:13.939> doing<00:02:14.750> it

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
yeah and then you just keep doing it

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:24.380 
yeah and then you just keep doing it
Hanna<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.980> pretty<00:02:16.129> cool<00:02:16.340> pattern

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:37.059 

you

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.300 

and<00:02:37.159> then<00:02:37.939> as<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.510> as<00:02:39.349> a<00:02:39.409> variation<00:02:40.069> of<00:02:40.159> this

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
and then as a as a variation of this

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.520 
and then as a as a variation of this
pattern<00:02:40.670> what<00:02:40.999> you<00:02:41.090> can<00:02:41.239> do<00:02:41.389> is<00:02:41.810> instead<00:02:42.469> of

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
pattern what you can do is instead of

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.599 
pattern what you can do is instead of
going<00:02:42.739> up<00:02:43.069> like<00:02:43.099> this<00:02:43.519> you<00:02:44.359> can<00:02:44.540> go<00:02:44.689> underneath

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
going up like this you can go underneath

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:59.920 
going up like this you can go underneath
like<00:02:46.609> that<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:47.120> it's<00:02:47.680> it's<00:02:48.680> like<00:02:49.209> this

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.650 

you

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:15.730 

or<00:03:05.660> like<00:03:05.870> or<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.380> can<00:03:06.410> do<00:03:06.650> like<00:03:06.680> that

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.160 

and<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.430> idea<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:16.880> this<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.330> in<00:03:17.900> order<00:03:18.050> to

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
and the idea of this is that in order to

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.840
