silenced<00:02:41.450> Makarov<00:02:42.450> i<00:02:42.720> believe<00:02:43.549> which<00:02:44.549> is

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
silenced Makarov i believe which is

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.819 
silenced Makarov i believe which is
pretty<00:02:44.940> weak<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.660> know<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.200> get<00:02:46.650> like

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
pretty weak you know so you get like

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.350 
pretty weak you know so you get like
double<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.579> you<00:02:47.640> know<00:02:47.730> we've<00:02:47.880> been<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.180> last

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
double and you know we've been the last

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.660 
double and you know we've been the last
weapon<00:02:48.599> they<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.680> gives<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.160> chance<00:02:50.400> to

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
weapon they it gives you the chance to

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.539 
weapon they it gives you the chance to
like<00:02:50.970> bust<00:02:51.420> up<00:02:51.630> through<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.930> leaderboards

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
like bust up through the leaderboards

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.890 
like bust up through the leaderboards
because<00:02:53.549> it's<00:02:53.730> not<00:02:53.940> necessarily<00:02:54.540> on<00:02:54.660> how<00:02:54.840> many

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
because it's not necessarily on how many

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.300 
because it's not necessarily on how many
kills<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.410> get<00:02:55.590> but<00:02:55.799> more<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.130> how<00:02:56.250> many

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
kills you get but more so how many

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.190 
kills you get but more so how many
points<00:02:56.579> you<00:02:56.730> get<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.180> those<00:02:57.299> points<00:02:57.629> very<00:02:57.810> on

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
points you get and those points very on

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.850 
points you get and those points very on
certain<00:02:59.010> things<00:02:59.180> like<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.599> get<00:03:00.860> double

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
certain things like if you get double

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.970 
certain things like if you get double
bonus<00:03:02.010> points<00:03:02.579> you<00:03:03.060> know<00:03:03.530> but<00:03:04.530> relatively
