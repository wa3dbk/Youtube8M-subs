because I once tried to stream a video
and<00:03:18.659> it<00:03:18.780> ended<00:03:19.049> up<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.980> phone<00:03:20.129> ended<00:03:20.400> up

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
and it ended up and the phone ended up

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.819 
and it ended up and the phone ended up
rebooting<00:03:21.739> so<00:03:23.629> what<00:03:24.629> else<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:25.019> there<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.230> see<00:03:25.620> a

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
rebooting so what else is there to see a

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.119 
rebooting so what else is there to see a
use<00:03:26.579> one<00:03:26.610> problem<00:03:27.180> though<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:28.530> internal

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
use one problem though the internal

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.280 
use one problem though the internal
storage<00:03:29.519> doesn't<00:03:29.909> work<00:03:30.030> right<00:03:30.239> now<00:03:30.299> so<00:03:30.659> when<00:03:31.260> I

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
storage doesn't work right now so when I

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.110 
storage doesn't work right now so when I
go<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.680> gallery<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.250> only<00:03:32.400> shows<00:03:32.700> me<00:03:32.909> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
go to the gallery it only shows me the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.300 
go to the gallery it only shows me the
photos<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.750> videos<00:03:34.109> which<00:03:34.440> are<00:03:34.620> available<00:03:35.160> on

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
photos and videos which are available on

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.750 
photos and videos which are available on
my<00:03:36.299> external<00:03:36.810> sd<00:03:37.470> card<00:03:37.500> but<00:03:38.129> not<00:03:38.430> on<00:03:38.609> the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
my external sd card but not on the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.460 
my external sd card but not on the
internal<00:03:39.090> storage<00:03:39.569> and<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.700> rest<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:42.470> working

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
internal storage and the rest is working

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.490 
internal storage and the rest is working
fine<00:03:44.129> I<00:03:44.190> believe<00:03:44.879> it<00:03:45.359> does<00:03:45.959> seem<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.290> little

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
fine I believe it does seem a little

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.190 
fine I believe it does seem a little
buggy<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:49.019> music<00:03:49.349> player<00:03:49.530> does<00:03:49.799> work<00:03:51.200> there

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
buggy the music player does work there

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.530 
buggy the music player does work there
you<00:03:52.319> go<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.739> has<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.250> kind<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.120> different

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
you go it has a kind of different

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.849 
you go it has a kind of different
interface<00:03:56.540> even<00:03:57.540> when<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:57.989> play<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.500> song

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
interface even when you like play a song

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.030 
interface even when you like play a song
for<00:03:58.890> example<00:04:00.349> let's<00:04:01.349> say<00:04:01.590> you're<00:04:01.739> trying<00:04:01.980> to

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
for example let's say you're trying to

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.119 
for example let's say you're trying to
apply<00:04:02.190> at<00:04:02.519> play<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:02.970> days<00:04:03.890> here's<00:04:04.890> the

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
apply at play the days here's the

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:12.559 
apply at play the days here's the
interface<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:10.220> really<00:04:11.220> not<00:04:11.730> much<00:04:12.299> has

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
interface and really not much has

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.289 
interface and really not much has
changed<00:04:12.599> and<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.709> ROM<00:04:14.099> is<00:04:14.430> still<00:04:14.940> not<00:04:15.150> feeling

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
changed and the ROM is still not feeling

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.170 
changed and the ROM is still not feeling
very<00:04:15.480> stable<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:17.039> you're<00:04:17.700> gonna<00:04:17.789> have<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.150> wait

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
very stable so you're gonna have to wait

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.349 
very stable so you're gonna have to wait
on<00:04:18.539> it<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:19.639> but<00:04:20.639> it's<00:04:20.760> looking<00:04:21.000> really<00:04:21.150> good

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
on it and but it's looking really good

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.830 
on it and but it's looking really good
though<00:04:21.740> so<00:04:22.740> if<00:04:22.830> we<00:04:22.889> wait<00:04:23.099> on<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.340> things<00:04:24.150> will

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
though so if we wait on it things will

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.950 
though so if we wait on it things will
improve<00:04:25.610> anyway<00:04:26.610> guys<00:04:26.789> this<00:04:27.539> brings<00:04:27.780> us<00:04:27.930> to
