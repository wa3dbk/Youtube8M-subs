it's Busquets and I'm talking about

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.790 
it's Busquets and I'm talking about
Busquets<00:00:24.240> because<00:00:24.539> he's<00:00:24.630> gone<00:00:24.810> very<00:00:25.080> very<00:00:25.260> low

on<00:00:26.039> price<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.640> moment<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:28.050> think<00:00:28.710> it's

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
on price at the moment and I think it's

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.529 
on price at the moment and I think it's
because<00:00:28.920> everyone's<00:00:29.400> used<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.090> fact<00:00:30.390> that

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
because everyone's used to the fact that

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.190 
because everyone's used to the fact that
that<00:00:30.750> Pacey<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.710> such<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> big<00:00:32.250> man<00:00:32.430> off<00:00:32.640> but

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
that Pacey is such a big man off but

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.139 
that Pacey is such a big man off but
since<00:00:34.200> strength<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.800> he's<00:00:35.370> six<00:00:35.640> foot<00:00:35.850> two<00:00:36.120> and

since strength is he's six foot two and

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.139 
since strength is he's six foot two and
he's<00:00:36.600> got<00:00:36.780> 78<00:00:37.200> strength<00:00:37.649> which<00:00:37.950> means<00:00:38.250> he's

he's got 78 strength which means he's

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.729

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.580 
factor I think he will be he's one of
the<00:01:08.460> best<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.790> defensive<00:01:09.210> Meads<00:01:09.450> there<00:01:10.380> is
