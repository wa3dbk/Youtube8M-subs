00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
make them a little bit more interesting

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.099 
make them a little bit more interesting
I've<00:00:14.040> done<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.460> popcorns<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.299> contrasting

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
I've done the popcorns in a contrasting

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.220 
I've done the popcorns in a contrasting
color<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.250> background<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.050> how

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
color to the background and this is how

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.120 
color to the background and this is how
we<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:23.840> so<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.140> say<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> background<00:00:25.890> is

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
we do that so as I say the background is

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.690 
we do that so as I say the background is
just<00:00:26.189> rows<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.970> double<00:00:27.359> crochets<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:30.140> to<00:00:31.700> use

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
just rows of double crochets and to use

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.389 
just rows of double crochets and to use
that<00:00:33.140> contrasting<00:00:34.140> color<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.040> do<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.280> we

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
that contrasting color what we do is we

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.670 
that contrasting color what we do is we
weave<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.940> into<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.420> back<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> work<00:00:37.200> until

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
weave it into the back of the work until

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.680 
weave it into the back of the work until
the<00:00:37.800> point<00:00:38.040> where<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.399> needed<00:00:38.670> when<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.390> do

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the point where it's needed when you do

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.650 
the point where it's needed when you do
that<00:00:39.899> simply<00:00:40.590> by<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.090> go<00:00:42.300> through<00:00:42.510> your
