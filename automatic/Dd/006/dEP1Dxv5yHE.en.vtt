00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
pass protect though but you know that's

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.240 
pass protect though but you know that's
the<00:00:27.420> main<00:00:27.630> thing<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> NFL<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.189> don't

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the main thing in the NFL is you don't

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.560 
the main thing in the NFL is you don't
want<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:29.670> quarterback<00:00:30.029> killed<00:00:30.330> and

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
want to get your quarterback killed and

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.690 
want to get your quarterback killed and
you<00:00:31.529> know<00:00:31.619> it'll<00:00:31.830> be<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.949> long<00:00:32.099> time<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.399> think

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
you know it'll be a long time I think

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.799 
you know it'll be a long time I think
before<00:00:32.820> they<00:00:33.030> comfortable<00:00:33.390> with<00:00:33.540> him<00:00:33.660> doing

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
before they comfortable with him doing

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.780 
before they comfortable with him doing
that<00:00:34.020> some<00:00:34.559> other<00:00:34.680> quick<00:00:35.010> takeaways<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.670> know

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
that some other quick takeaways you know

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.190 
that some other quick takeaways you know
I<00:00:35.820> thought<00:00:36.270> Christian<00:00:36.630> Jones<00:00:36.809> line

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
I thought Christian Jones line

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.170 
I thought Christian Jones line
linebacker<00:00:37.860> was<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.250> undrafted<00:00:38.520> free<00:00:38.910> agent

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
linebacker was the undrafted free agent

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.970 
linebacker was the undrafted free agent
for<00:00:39.300> Florida<00:00:39.629> State<00:00:39.660> certainly<00:00:40.559> looks<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
for Florida State certainly looks the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.729 
for Florida State certainly looks the
part<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.719> plays<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> position<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> Bears

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
part I and it plays a position the Bears

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.639 
part I and it plays a position the Bears
could<00:00:43.920> use<00:00:43.980> fuller<00:00:44.760> looked<00:00:45.030> fine<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:46.530> know

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
could use fuller looked fine you know

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.560 
could use fuller looked fine you know
will<00:00:46.860> Sutton<00:00:47.190> look<00:00:47.309> slim<00:00:47.640> down<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:48.510> you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
the obvious choice you know you know the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.660 
the obvious choice you know you know the
candidates<00:02:40.500> there<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.980> started<00:02:41.460> both

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
candidates there to started both

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.580 
candidates there to started both
positions<00:02:42.300> they<00:02:42.480> might<00:02:42.660> not<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.110> sexiest

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
positions they might not be the sexiest

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.350

in<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.800> world<00:02:44.010> but<00:02:44.430> it's<00:02:44.580> certainly<00:02:44.880> their

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
in the world but it's certainly their

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.330 
in the world but it's certainly their
biggest<00:02:45.690> problem<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.710> Bears<00:02:46.890> need<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.220> be

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
biggest problem and the Bears need to be

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.620 
biggest problem and the Bears need to be
comfortable<00:02:47.700> with<00:02:47.820> both<00:02:48.000> their<00:02:48.180> safeties

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
comfortable with both their safeties

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.780
