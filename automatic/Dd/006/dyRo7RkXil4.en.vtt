00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.450
 hello in this tutorial i will you 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.970
 explain that we have to make the adjustments 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.900
 on the holes to have a picture in 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:20.150
 nike is so a photo or a hic 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.849
 is already it's a photo or very clear 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.529
 we have a lot of white where we brighten 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.999
 many things 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.650
 like all the settings anyway we 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:35.329
 will need here we went on 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.920
 mortgage already slightly overexposed on 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.570
 see it on the histogram where precisely 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.859
 in the white parts we have donations 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.000
 who if I want my photo or who 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.870
 so I'm going to pass and a black and 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.090
 white the euro why hard because we have 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.660
 much more information from a 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:02.800
 file a poorer quality in the end 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.210
 there I pass my file in black and white 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.610
 Then I will work with the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.420
 basic settings and the curve of 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.700
 tone then at the settings of 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.630
 base has increased 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.509
 clear already we can also perceive at 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.009
 level the histogram that the parts 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.009
 clear are being cleared 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.689
 after will have to adapt the settings 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:37.189
 function or white TV so that's it 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.719
 really in the very clear parts at 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.950
 level of exposure I do not touch 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:44.259
 because we already have a little bit of 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.259
 explode so I will need 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.700
 I will go up the shadows we are going 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.930
 clear up the French towers auque la 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.810
 photo of jacques becker 6 me rest 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.250
 still a lot of details to a good 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.250
 clearing here is 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.450
 I mount it thoroughly also on this photo 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.500
 we now see that photo 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.810
 is very clear now she is a 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.370
 not too clear up further 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.660
 so at the level of the histogram on 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.260
 this part at the base of the lists 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:22.330
 program no longer worth 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:25.750
 good I'm going to drop blacks like that 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.150
 to have water with a little more 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.850
 contrast with blacks so the vox and 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:41.800
 better now I'm going to increase a 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:43.780
 little but contrasts like that my case 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.400
 already I'm on a picture and cake is 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.959
 not too bad to eat now I'm going 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.470
 go to finish a little bit this setting 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:54.580
 by going to then on the court I'm going 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.100
 work directly on the bench so 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:05.680
 the black hair parties when you we 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:08.100
 darken a little bit then against 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.600
 frankly as I lowered my curve 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.470
 the clear parts if they become a 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.470
 little bit less than before 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.860
 and here finally I arrive at high tech 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:35.440
 and already not too bad then head down 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:36.750
 a little lost to think that's all 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.660
 way you understood 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.700
 roughly like hell in ajka after 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.750
 it's according to your picture of you to go 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.100
 tweak your little tweaks and july 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.720
 clarity clarity you can 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.660
 eventually lower it a little bit 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.010
 on this one not too much of that's how 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.650
 without buying them minard was coming out a 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.980
 little slightly softer image and 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.830
 by ending up with a nice little 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:08.590
 hacker my faith so now too 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:12.269
 photo level it will have avoided you a lot 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.269
 settings at the photo complex 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.850
 There it is, thanks
