bit more guys this is the ua g case for
the<00:00:13.980> galaxy<00:00:14.490> s5<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.150> let's<00:00:15.750> check<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.170> out

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.790 

so<00:00:27.279> as<00:00:27.429> I<00:00:27.550> said<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:27.970> Samsung<00:00:28.449> Galaxy<00:00:28.630> s5<00:00:29.289> does

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
so as I said the Samsung Galaxy s5 does

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.249 
so as I said the Samsung Galaxy s5 does
feature<00:00:30.130> a<00:00:30.519> new<00:00:30.820> kind<00:00:31.119> of<00:00:31.239> build<00:00:31.509> quality<00:00:31.570> is

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
feature a new kind of build quality is

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.680 
feature a new kind of build quality is
this<00:00:32.860> nice<00:00:33.100> matte<00:00:33.610> finish<00:00:33.640> that<00:00:34.300> they<00:00:34.420> put<00:00:34.660> on

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
this nice matte finish that they put on

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.259 
this nice matte finish that they put on
the<00:00:34.930> back<00:00:35.110> it's<00:00:35.680> still<00:00:35.980> plastic<00:00:36.309> but<00:00:37.000> I<00:00:37.149> do

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
the back it's still plastic but I do

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.810 
the back it's still plastic but I do
have<00:00:37.600> to<00:00:37.780> say<00:00:38.019> it<00:00:38.469> feels<00:00:38.739> a<00:00:39.010> lot<00:00:39.190> better<00:00:39.430> in<00:00:39.699> the

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
have to say it feels a lot better in the

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.420 
have to say it feels a lot better in the
hand<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.420> it<00:00:40.780> definitely<00:00:40.930> has<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.650> better<00:00:42.040> grip

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
hand and it definitely has a better grip

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.850 
hand and it definitely has a better grip
but<00:00:43.239> it<00:00:43.420> doesn't<00:00:43.690> really<00:00:43.809> look<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.409> best<00:00:44.589> and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
but it doesn't really look the best and

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.399 
but it doesn't really look the best and
the<00:00:45.129> sides<00:00:45.400> are<00:00:45.610> still<00:00:45.909> plastic<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.690> that<00:00:47.260> can

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
the sides are still plastic and that can

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.170 
the sides are still plastic and that can
still<00:00:47.680> cause<00:00:47.920> slipping<00:00:48.430> out<00:00:48.519> of<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.760> hands

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
still cause slipping out of the hands

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.170 
still cause slipping out of the hands
that's<00:00:49.750> when<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.079> UAG<00:00:50.350> case<00:00:50.829> comes<00:00:51.190> in<00:00:51.430> I<00:00:51.610> have

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
that's when the UAG case comes in I have

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.139 
that's when the UAG case comes in I have
reviewed<00:00:52.540> some<00:00:52.750> UAG<00:00:53.110> cases<00:00:53.800> before<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.579> by

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
reviewed some UAG cases before and by

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.329 
reviewed some UAG cases before and by
far<00:00:55.479> they<00:00:55.689> have<00:00:55.839> the<00:00:55.960> most<00:00:56.140> unique<00:00:56.439> design<00:00:57.040> and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
they also make the device feel a lot

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.270 
they also make the device feel a lot
more<00:01:00.220> sturdy<00:01:00.580> and<00:01:01.320> more<00:01:02.320> comfortable<00:01:02.860> in<00:01:03.100> the

very easy to access and it actually adds

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.590 
very easy to access and it actually adds
larger<00:02:02.859> buttons<00:02:03.219> so<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.819> should<00:02:04.030> be<00:02:04.060> easier

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
larger buttons so it should be easier

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.080 
larger buttons so it should be easier
for<00:02:04.659> you<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.109> click<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:06.130> volume<00:02:06.520> marker<00:02:06.880> and

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
for you to click the volume marker and

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.320 
for you to click the volume marker and
the<00:02:07.329> power<00:02:07.539> button<00:02:08.100> now<00:02:09.100> as<00:02:09.250> I<00:02:09.399> said<00:02:09.459> before<00:02:09.850> it

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
the power button now as I said before it

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.870 
the power button now as I said before it
also<00:02:10.509> does<00:02:11.020> feel<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.350> lot<00:02:11.740> sturdier<00:02:12.160> in<00:02:12.610> the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
also does feel a lot sturdier in the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.750 
also does feel a lot sturdier in the
hand<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.660> as<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:14.410> can<00:02:14.500> see<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:14.980> can<00:02:15.220> still<00:02:15.459> use

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
hand and as you can see I can still use

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.970 
hand and as you can see I can still use
the<00:02:15.970> phone<00:02:16.000> with<00:02:16.450> one<00:02:16.690> hand<00:02:17.020> even<00:02:17.230> though<00:02:17.770> this

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
the phone with one hand even though this

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.430 
the phone with one hand even though this
case<00:02:18.250> does<00:02:18.580> add<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.850> little<00:02:19.270> bulkiness<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.260> it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
case does add a little bulkiness to it

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.410 
case does add a little bulkiness to it
it<00:02:20.920> definitely<00:02:21.069> gives<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.730> better<00:02:22.030> grip

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
it definitely gives you a better grip

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.020 
it definitely gives you a better grip
with<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.349> grips<00:02:23.620> on<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.980> sides<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.550> on<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
with the grips on the sides and on the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.510 
with the grips on the sides and on the
back<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.540> thankfully<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.680> case<00:02:26.920> also<00:02:27.310> does

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
back and thankfully the case also does

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.030 
back and thankfully the case also does
not<00:02:27.700> increase<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.240> thickness<00:02:28.690> factor<00:02:29.470> by

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
not increase the thickness factor by

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.520 
not increase the thickness factor by
that<00:02:30.340> much<00:02:30.670> letting<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:31.720> still<00:02:32.050> use<00:02:32.350> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
that much letting you still use the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.770 
that much letting you still use the
device<00:02:32.800> as<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.130> said<00:02:33.370> before<00:02:33.550> very<00:02:34.120> comfortably

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
device as I said before very comfortably

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.170
