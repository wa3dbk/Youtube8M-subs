00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:12.009
 therefore how to extract the pin of the 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.009
 fork without removing the fork 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:26.060
 I used an extractor from 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:37.550
 this is what the beta bearings have 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:51.680
 pointed in the fork in the pin and I have 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:58.270
 got a small trolley so I have 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:06.860
 warmed slightly I put it around 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:17.210
 as sheen I pull the extractor then I have 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:19.720
 slightly warmed the support so as to 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.720
 under 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.110
 this point I started at 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.210
 creak and began to come 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:38.200
 off the torch I started 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:47.980
 to act on the key and he has 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:50.400
 started to come out another bit and leaves 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.400
 all 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:10.229
 let's see if I can keep the phone in 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:10.229
 hand in hand, we all support it 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:48.880
 comes all we see has set up the 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:03:00.360
 phone in the wheel of the song me 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:03:00.360
 turning the weight on us children 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.140
 I will not leave the snip I do here 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.940
 our plan came out 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:23.229
 without removing the fork without disassembling 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:38.990
 nothing and the tools used 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:42.130
 I'm the berta and gas extractor 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.130
 goodbye see you soon
