00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hello to you Denis healthier mountain 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:10.040
 section mw and today is the last day 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.040
 speleo trekking and so the story of 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.029
 story cards 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.529
 we sang about the campaign we have here a lot of helmets 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.040
 but surprisingly 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.430
 This all helmets were firms wrote 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.140
 different models of different years 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.489
 which is actually quite strong 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.949
 surprises it turns out that u loop is not only 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.870
 strong enough marketing and advertising 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.510
 well, really good products 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.930
 because in our group people are different 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.629
 not all are conducted only on advertising well or 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.170
 There many beautiful pictures choose 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.809
 there for a thousand parameters frozen in 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.320
 Generally choose or but the fact that everyone 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.800
 helmets pizza that's my right hand 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.080
 viburnum casco and this is special 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.530
 speleo casco she has ready 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.930
 carbide mount q is such a hook 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.670
 for hose 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.130
 maybe well here here is even a spare 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.130
 nozzle mounted for carbide ki and 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.800
 probably in mountaineering and and use 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.880
 it is possible but not very cool because she 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.400
 heavy enough because it's not 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.430
 some standard head is attached 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.890
 there is no flashlight hooks 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.060
 the rest is good reliable 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.060
 there is a head fullness adjustment there is 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.360
 adjustment of the occipital region of the strap 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.740
 Here they weigh under my head the same paint 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.680
 for mountaineering 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.790
 petzl elios helmet distinguishes it from 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:07.290
 previous little weight she is enough 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.540
 thin and looks such a grain and 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.900
 damping part of this helmet 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.840
 made of zen filler actually 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.620
 This is the foam that transmits 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.910
 load just from the stone there to your 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.860
 head and extinguishes the blow of this load 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.520
 gifts straps 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:36.530
 much thinner and lighter than the previous one 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.990
 again the position is adjusted well here 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.390
 here you see the position of the fastener under 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.330
 Chin can be moved forward and backward. 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.640
 further the depth of this occipital 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.860
 the belt is adjustable it here here you 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:55.220
 carries on the head and the girth is regulated 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.390
 Heads in general adjustments fully there is 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.300
 inside here are such a wiring 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.980
 you can eat on the headrest 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.430
 right inside the helmet to the battery compartment 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.410
 hide it 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.030
 well, you can just 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:19.160
 probably this power to lay outside 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:22.610
 then there are four hooks for 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.820
 gum these four hooks allows you to 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.910
 first secure on frontal mount for 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.280
 I see an action camera here 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.650
 just mount camera action 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.680
 I managed over this forehead 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.640
 attachments for the same roots cling more 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.420
 my light ventilation well in my opinion 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.170
 for some summer hot hikes for 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.080
 there summer lasagna can be 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.720
 but not enough there 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.450
 activity for mountaineering 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.410
 at the level there with snow or in general 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:04.790
 temperatures up to 15 degrees Celsius will be 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.370
 quite acceptable probably all of the important 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.550
 such qualities of this helmet is super weight 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.670
 I also know this helmet is quite acceptable 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.850
 for the price of probably choosing a fairy tale now 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.460
 out of the whole loop of the pskov series i would for myself 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.790
 chose her because she 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.050
 light enough and enough 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.139
 universal 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.879
 with you was dinistor drink the mountain section 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.620
