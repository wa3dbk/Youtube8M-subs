00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
but as this was rolling through and it

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:21.840 
but as this was rolling through and it
actually<00:04:21.130> didn't<00:04:21.340> go<00:04:21.430> for<00:04:21.609> too<00:04:21.700> much<00:04:21.790> money

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
actually didn't go for too much money

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.580 
actually didn't go for too much money
was<00:04:22.090> only<00:04:22.150> twenty<00:04:22.540> three<00:04:22.570> thousand<00:04:23.140> miles<00:04:23.290> on

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
was only twenty three thousand miles on

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.450 
was only twenty three thousand miles on
it<00:04:23.620> which<00:04:23.770> is<00:04:23.919> you<00:04:24.010> know<00:04:24.100> really<00:04:24.250> low

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
it which is you know really low

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.850 
it which is you know really low
obviously<00:04:25.030> for<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.210> 2008<00:04:25.750> but<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:26.590> went<00:04:26.680> for

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
obviously for a 2008 but it went for

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.380 
obviously for a 2008 but it went for
right<00:04:26.980> around<00:04:27.070> fifteen<00:04:27.550> thousand<00:04:28.000> bucks<00:04:28.180> I

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
right around fifteen thousand bucks I

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.850 
right around fifteen thousand bucks I
think<00:04:28.450> which<00:04:28.870> was<00:04:29.020> a<00:04:29.050> pretty<00:04:29.410> good<00:04:29.590> price

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
think which was a pretty good price

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.380 
think which was a pretty good price
considering<00:04:30.370> these<00:04:30.490> normally<00:04:30.910> go<00:04:31.030> for<00:04:31.270> close

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
considering these normally go for close

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.020
