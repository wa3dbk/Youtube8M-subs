 the clubs hire me and I play in 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.760
 a description but what kind of music 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:00.020
 is the one that fixes mainly house 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.020
 a while ago, but I 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.160
 I wanted everything 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.530
 I have a lot of love every time 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.090
 I find that he sees it somewhere 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.439
 we hug with a lot of love is a woman 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.600
 besides being absolute truth 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.610
 absolutely talented has a heart 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.469
 fantastic i like to see her that to weigh herself 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.159
 you in the middle at two years seven 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:31.619
 months and that you had context he had 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.289
 nine years of career andrea legarreta 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.689
 no no no with is that the teacher jiménez or 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:41.789
 two Americans or children's carousel and 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.470
 jail lip differences and 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.590
 How about working this age with so many 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.399
 other children manage to control it for 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.270
 recordings of the complicated bio that yes 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.860
 I would have to say that we had to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 control because I had 9 yo 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.509
 I enjoyed but with my family of 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.470
 musicians I always understood that it was something 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.659
 what I had to do with a lot 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.729
 responsibility although never appearing 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.439
 is to act yes but to date no no 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.970
 I see it as work is something that we are going to 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.319
 do that but for example you find it 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.369
 easy to stay where you have to 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.590
 cry 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.360
 today not much is done was not but in 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.890
 that then yes at that time I know something 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.299
 we did theater also took us 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.430
 they gave several courses of things and all 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.739
 We were but like and I think very teacher 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.140
 there is a spirit today and something in 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.280
 common not because you ten years ago was 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.950
 more or less that you became the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.110
 Christianity 14-14 good from now for 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.000
 make it on August 15 cynthia and yuri 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.200
 also a few years ago that is what was 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.329
 what motivated this change in your life 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.769
 we were looking for something not Christ like 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.450
 so the truth is that since I was born 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.799
 much believed in God I have always 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.629
 known that what I have and what I do 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.700
 know when I was very little I sang in 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.980
 somewhere at age 34 he sang and the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.959
 people would come together to see me then from 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.000
 very little I said that how weird is for 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.519
 me who want to see something that I never 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.530
 I asked, I never asked to open my mouth 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.579
 It sounds nice and since I was little I understood 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.349
 that someone had to have it 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.060
 given because I never did anything to have it 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.340
 that's why all my life I believed in 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.099
 god and at age 16 I wanted to know more about 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.239
 god and I want to know more about the belief 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.560
 that I have I want to know more about who I 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.240
 gave all this of who fills me with 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.090
 whose blessings 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.860
 the world began to read more the bible 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.510
 I started to know I did a Christian work 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.830
 and he was not a Christian and inside that work 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.140
 he began to know a little more about god and 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.060
 I fell deeply in love with him hey 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.860
 kalimba what is his real name 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.230

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.480
 birth the full name is kalimba 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.190
 Kadjaly Marichal Ibar juan leyva that 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.190
 kalimba kadjaly marichal ibar 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.360
 Marichal Ibar exactly against 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.360
 the phone book 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.040
 Kalimba is a musical instrument 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:48.150
 Cubas guitar has three names 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.010
 different is good in Africa sorry 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.040
 called kalimba empire and another name that 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:58.890
 I do not know and in English they say they are piano 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:02.040
 because he is father of an aitana daughter and 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.180
 the father weighs yes yes yes I have it very 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.180
 well you get along very well with her 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.150
 keep it in reserve as it is no longer 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.150
 dedicate to this 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.540
 I'm a little loner, making music 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.479
 Enjoy as you do with your daughter stay 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.490
 far so much time is now not 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.690
 she wants to be used also yes 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.340
 but in fact right now we write to each other 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.910
 very much by skype I say we are marked 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:34.620
 talking in Mexico and good obviously 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.240
 I determined I'm running to see the 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.139
 exact sometimes you take it 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.699
 with you on your tours, not any 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.470
 could the time that mom allow more 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.910
 but it is not either has been necessary and 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.500
 I think that suddenly you will not be able to 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.479
 dedicate all the attention they need 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.090
 or if it depends on when you have a tour where 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.520
 I really leave enough time as 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.229
 to say I already have to be 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.210
 you also have to take care a lot I prefer 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:01.410
 take care of the school and take care of other things 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.300
 for five years still on top of her 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.970
 exact and hot from your former colleagues 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.770
 of ov7 feeling friend relations of 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.600
 some special 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.889
 we are more like brothers than friends in 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.960
 neither did my sister both 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.039
 so much then we see also the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.169
 connection when they meet again 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.510
 it's fantastic now that they got wise 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.640
 that I send to twitter talk to them 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.050
 I find them just before coming 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.370
 two of sanse come I went to eat a place 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.040
 in Mexico and I found myself at the hospital 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.040
 erika to two tables of me I stood hugging 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.700
 55 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.690
 you played professional football was going to 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.370
 dedicate myself to be a professional footballer 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.320
 they told me about the oliver dragons 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.750
 We knew in Mexico in Mexico justly 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.890
 I played seven years soccer team the 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.410
 chivas the america 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.670
 I wanted so I am americanista of 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.610
 fact I was staying in america but 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.350
 I went to the cougars I really like the 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.340
 quarry of the cougars since it is a great 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.650
 quarry and produces a lot of 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.960
 footballers and later I had 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.530
 calls from oaxaca de aguascalientes 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.130
 when necaxa just went and I almost 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:17.370
 almost nothing of being a footballer for 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.470
 Kalimba would not be fair black 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.620
 that technology helps us is now 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.030
 but with everything you travel with everything 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.610
 the instability that has to 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.440
 settle in one place 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.180
 you usually live in Mexico if you're not 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.070
 if you were not making the voice but you live 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.790
 in mexico all the chinese my house is easy 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:39.420
 for you to get a stable partner 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:41.670
 and it's really that this is my life 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.100
 then anyone who did it 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.870
 from so small that it is not I never had a 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.070
 a face but you understand it like that but 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.900
 the person that comes into your life and you 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.610
 find with this handle it know how to be 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.080
 by your side of the people who believe that 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.790
 who loves you has to love you with everything 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.200
 what comes if I look for a person who 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.790
 I want to change or do not understand the 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.740
 center so I'm with a person 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.740
 that understand me kalimba this for you
