00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.560
Whew! This place makes me itch.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.360
Better keep an eye out for that guy.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.260
Where is... ok.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:08.320
Greetings.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.880
Cherie, your outfit is so stylish today.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.140
It is like the most luxurious...

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.320
...tent.

00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:17.574
Ooook. It's an improvement!

00:00:17.574 --> 00:00:19.194
I don't think so.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.040
Ha ha. Oh, I think I'm up to snuff.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.420
*This guy's a real egomaniac...*

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.040
You can't win, super!

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.260
Ha haaa!

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.380
I will crush you!

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.140
Huh...

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.380
Fine. Don't worry about me, I'll be right on your tail.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.100
Good evening, this is-AAAGGHHH!

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.880
I hate you, old friend.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.000
Yikes. Talk about a compliment!

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.940
Uhhm... sorry.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.900
Very well.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.460
YOU FOOL! Where are-

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.200
Abupbupbup!

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.820
What is that racket?

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.000
I would much rather be riding a camel with three humps.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.080
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-kay... look.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.940
You're off to a good start.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.760
I see you are correct.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.420
First, I grant the fellow's wish.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.540
Great! Is it a robotic turtle butler?

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.620
NO!!

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.780
Oh, how do you know this?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.220
Uhh, no reason.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.220
Anyway, tell me about your friend.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.200
Hopefully he's had his nap today.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.480
That thief's a friend.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.520
He is always one more thing.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.780
So Sir Goof's guilty?

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.620
He's honest, trust me.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.220
He owns many, many shops.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.580
The perfect fellow!

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.560
Yeah. *laughs*

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.040
Hmm. Fine. Shall I bring you-

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.340
Come vermin! Rush to your doom!

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.840
My brother, are you alright?

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.520
You have been imprisoned!

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.820
Agh, stupid filthy hoodlums.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.480
Always leaving a mess!

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.480
Tell your guards to bring a handkerchief next time.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.660
LITTLE CHANCE!

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.160
You wild man.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.560
*I don't think "vain" BEGINS to describe this guy.*

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.540
How can you stand to listen to yourself with those ears?

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.740
Sorry. It's my camel hair.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.980
I just shampooed.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.900
*Great. It's gonna be a looong day...*

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.760
Ok. Time to argue!

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.360
You there! You DARE question ME?!

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.120
Wait until I tell the judge 'bout this!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.220
My mind isn't clear.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.460
Who would you have reason to hate?

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.780
Without proof, you aaare...

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.680
YES! Right! Haha!

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.280
So... I suppose you want his picture.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.620
Yes...

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.380
This evidence will suffice.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.680
What is this? You make it sound so easy.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.080
Dah! Prove it. I would like to see you press for time!

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.340
Whoa, one thing at a time.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.060
*Can't slow down now!*

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.160
Of all the things to get busted for...

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.960
I can't believe it's "hippie dumping."

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.300
Ah-hah-haaaa, flattery will get you nowhere.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.980
I tire of this charade. There's just no evi-

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.740
*I just need to slow things down with a bluff!*

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.280
Ooook, slow down turbo.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.500
There's somethin' fishy going on here.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.200
I do not understand. There are no scams, no traps.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.980
Why is it when there are no stakes...

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.060
...you make me the angry elephant?

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.620
Is that bad?

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.520
Did I mention I was retired?

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.960
Oooh, look who made a funny.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.920
How's that security system comin', pal?

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.400
That was definitely not his best side.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.340
Amazing! Expect the unexpected!

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.500
I took a correspondence course.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.620
Or watch too many spy movies.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.220
I see...

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.400
Excellent. I'll make good use of this.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.640
I will confront this creature with my VHS deck!

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.140

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.360
Uhhh, well, that part's kind of...

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.340
No no no, I don't think so.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.560
Why don't you just give me your tape...

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.840
...and I'll make it painless for you.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.960
WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER HERE AND TAKE IT?!

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.900
No. Why should you care if I played the tape?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.580
I wonder if it's fake?

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.180
Hmm. Then tell me...

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.540
Is there something wrong with your plan?

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.940
Well... we have it. But, it wouldn't have worked out.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.820
Humiliation is a crossroads.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.200
If you truly wish to aid me, I see little action.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.240
*Thank you, Mr. Obvious!*

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.420
Whoo-hoo-hoo-o. It's so cold my EYEBALLS are numb!

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.860
Well it would seem this game is finished.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.320
Because you failed.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.940
Ah well!

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.060
*I can't BELIEVE this place!*

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.960
*Guess I'm a little out of practice.*

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.700
*I HAVE to remember to use the court record!*

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.140
*Alright. If I was this guy...*

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.560
*I would hang my picture everywhere.*

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.320
*Gimme some cover, pal!*

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.660
*Excellent. No way I could forget that.*

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.160
Insolent child!

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.160
You shall pay dearly for your disrespect.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.820
Sorry, gotta take a rain check. I'll call you!

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.120
It's too bad I lost my pho-WHAT?!

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.920
YOU CHEATED!

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.640
HA! Timid creature.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.820
That was a little tricky.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.360
Open Sesame!

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.300
"Look, bro. I see you are a tough cowboy."

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.840
"YOU BLASTED IMBECILE!"

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.420
"Don't fall!"

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.400
"AAAAAUUUGGGHHH!!"

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.360
This is not right! My plan was PERFECT!

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.180
Just... please!

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.960
HELP ME!

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.360
No.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.880
NNNNNNOOOOOOO!!!
