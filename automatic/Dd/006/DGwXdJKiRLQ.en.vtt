where<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.109> oil<00:00:31.850> plug<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.320> it's<00:00:34.320> up<00:00:34.890> under<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
where the oil plug is it's up under the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.119 
where the oil plug is it's up under the
more<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:37.340> square<00:00:38.340> shape<00:00:38.640> right<00:00:39.300> there<00:00:39.920> and<00:00:40.920> I

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
more it's square shape right there and I

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.330 
more it's square shape right there and I
hope<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.579> see<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:44.570> that's<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:46.160> that's<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
hope you can see it that's it that's the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.400 
hope you can see it that's it that's the
plug<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.640> can<00:00:50.640> use<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.239> ratchet<00:00:52.020> extension

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
plug and you can use a ratchet extension

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.220 
plug and you can use a ratchet extension
on<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.309> plug<00:00:54.120> I've<00:00:54.360> come<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.750> find<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
on that plug I've come to find out I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.150 
on that plug I've come to find out I
believe<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:56.329> 3/8<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.600> an<00:00:57.750> inch<00:00:59.809> attachment

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
believe it's 3/8 of an inch attachment

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:09.050 
believe it's 3/8 of an inch attachment
you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.340> put<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.609> your<00:01:02.730> ratchet<00:01:02.940> head

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.170 

and<00:01:09.570> that's<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.930> oil<00:01:10.460> oil<00:01:11.460> reservoir

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.969 

actually<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.690> more<00:01:15.960> suited<00:01:16.850> for<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.909> car

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
actually this is more suited for a car

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:27.260 
actually this is more suited for a car
because<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.220> bit<00:01:21.860> made<00:01:22.860> too<00:01:23.159> tall<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:26.270> for

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
because it's a bit made too tall but for

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.639 
because it's a bit made too tall but for
my<00:01:27.420> purposes<00:01:28.520> its<00:01:29.520> makeshift<00:01:30.149> I<00:01:31.280> had<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.430> use<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
my purposes its makeshift I had to use a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.719 
my purposes its makeshift I had to use a
pipe<00:01:34.649> for<00:01:35.430> leverage<00:01:36.020> because<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.860> couldn't

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
pipe for leverage because I couldn't

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.620 
pipe for leverage because I couldn't
break<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.960> oil<00:01:40.649> plug<00:01:41.149> so<00:01:42.149> that's<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.600> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
break that oil plug so that's what that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.240 
break that oil plug so that's what that
is<00:01:42.929> actually<00:01:43.440> it's<00:01:43.619> part<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.640> floor<00:01:45.570> lamp

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
is actually it's part of a floor lamp

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.820 
is actually it's part of a floor lamp
that<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.369> scrapped<00:01:47.789> and<00:01:48.200> when<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.350> unscrewed

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
that was scrapped and when we unscrewed

00:01:49.830 --> 00:02:00.580 
that was scrapped and when we unscrewed
it<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:51.570> sound<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.649> good<00:01:53.159> leverage<00:01:53.850> tool

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.590 

and<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:02.010> you<00:02:02.160> notice<00:02:02.550> there's<00:02:02.850> some<00:02:03.000> cardboard

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and if you notice there's some cardboard

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.970 
and if you notice there's some cardboard
under<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.110> setup<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.970> as<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.750> see<00:02:06.980> it's

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
under the setup and as you can see it's

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.330 
under the setup and as you can see it's
there<00:02:08.250> for<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.820> good<00:02:09.240> reason

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
there for a good reason

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.670 
there for a good reason
just<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.520> case<00:02:11.700> your<00:02:11.940> spill<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:13.500> that's

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
just in case your spill and that's

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.710 
just in case your spill and that's
that's<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.220> good<00:02:14.400> thing<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.700> do<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.150> make<00:02:15.540> sure

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
that's a good thing to do to make sure

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:27.880 
that's a good thing to do to make sure
you<00:02:15.810> have<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.910> cardboard<00:02:18.410> under<00:02:19.410> your<00:02:19.530> setup

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.830 

and<00:02:28.520> with<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.760> plug<00:02:29.000> out<00:02:29.210> on<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.780> Tilted<00:02:31.840> and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
and with the plug out on the Tilted and

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.490 
and with the plug out on the Tilted and
as<00:02:33.740> I<00:02:33.920> mentioned<00:02:34.400> before<00:02:35.050> actually<00:02:36.050> that<00:02:37.000> oil

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
as I mentioned before actually that oil

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.190 
as I mentioned before actually that oil
container<00:02:39.500> it's<00:02:39.800> too<00:02:40.430> tall<00:02:40.870> because<00:02:41.870> you

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
container it's too tall because you

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.640 
container it's too tall because you
can't<00:02:43.270> lower<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.510> more<00:02:44.780> completely<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:45.620> you

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
can't lower you more completely but you

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.820 
can't lower you more completely but you
can<00:02:45.890> see<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.190> draining<00:02:49.360> okay<00:02:50.560> it's<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.710> little

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
can see it draining okay it's a little

00:02:51.830 --> 00:03:01.870 
can see it draining okay it's a little
mess<00:02:57.580> we're<00:02:58.580> finished<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.300> that<00:03:00.520> I've<00:03:01.520> sealed

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
mess we're finished and that I've sealed

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:17.949 
mess we're finished and that I've sealed
up<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.440> flux<00:03:04.240> screwed<00:03:05.240> it<00:03:05.390> back<00:03:05.540> in

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.550 

and<00:03:19.519> when<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.750> one<00:03:21.750> thing<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.109> mention<00:03:22.409> when

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
and when a one thing to mention when

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.770 
and when a one thing to mention when
you're<00:03:22.650> doing<00:03:22.890> your<00:03:22.920> oil<00:03:23.189> changes<00:03:23.790> or<00:03:23.969> when

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
you're doing your oil changes or when

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.319 
you're doing your oil changes or when
you're<00:03:24.930> tilting<00:03:25.409> you<00:03:25.530> more<00:03:25.799> it's<00:03:26.329> it's

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
you're tilting you more it's it's

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.729 
you're tilting you more it's it's
important<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.900> tilt<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.439> in<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:29.819> direction<00:03:30.030> of

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
important to tilt it in the direction of

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.720 
important to tilt it in the direction of
IV<00:03:32.480> when<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.689> oil<00:03:33.719> is<00:03:34.139> located<00:03:34.799> because<00:03:35.579> if

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
IV when the oil is located because if

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.000 
IV when the oil is located because if
you<00:03:35.849> tilt<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.450> other<00:03:36.540> way<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.650> end<00:03:37.829> up

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
you tilt it the other way you end up

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.330 
you tilt it the other way you end up
having<00:03:38.459> oil<00:03:38.939> go<00:03:39.269> towards<00:03:39.689> your<00:03:39.780> filter<00:03:40.340> which

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
having oil go towards your filter which
