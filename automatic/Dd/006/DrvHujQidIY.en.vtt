00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
for basically every console and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.150 
for basically every console and
basically<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.170> hotfix<00:00:52.469> stayed<00:00:52.949> was

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
basically what this hotfix stayed was

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.250 
basically what this hotfix stayed was
and<00:00:53.399> first<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.670> all<00:00:53.730> nerf<00:00:54.000> t<00:00:54.210> system<00:00:54.629> hack<00:00:54.809> so

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and first of all nerf t system hack so

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.810 
and first of all nerf t system hack so
now<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.680> doesn't<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> big<00:00:56.370> cross<00:00:56.579> on

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
now it doesn't have a big cross on

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000 
now it doesn't have a big cross on
screen<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> also<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.870> does<00:00:58.079> cost<00:00:58.289> 700<00:00:58.859> points

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
screen and also it does cost 700 points

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.470 
screen and also it does cost 700 points
so<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.219> costs<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> little<00:00:59.670> bit<00:00:59.789> more<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.300> it

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
so it costs a little bit more to get it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.540 
so it costs a little bit more to get it
so<00:01:00.870> hopefully<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.379> does<00:01:01.590> cut<00:01:01.829> down<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
so hopefully that does cut down on the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.880 
so hopefully that does cut down on the
system<00:01:03.059> hack<00:01:03.210> spam<00:01:03.650> honestly<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:04.769> you're

video is I had to get 30 kills with an
SMG<00:01:27.479> could<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:27.990> any<00:01:28.200> SMG<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:29.189> once<00:01:29.369> you

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
SMG could be any SMG and then once you

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.069 
SMG could be any SMG and then once you
do<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:29.970> actually<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.420> back<00:01:30.659> out<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
do it you can actually just back out and

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.870 
do it you can actually just back out and
get<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.350> supply<00:01:31.710> drive<00:01:32.009> now<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> way<00:01:32.759> it's

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
get your supply drive now the way it's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.069 
get your supply drive now the way it's
going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> work<00:01:33.090> honestly<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.840> probably

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
going to work honestly it's probably

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.330 
going to work honestly it's probably
gonna<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.380> little<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.710> easier<00:01:35.070> than<00:01:35.159> some

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
gonna be a little bit easier than some

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.620 
gonna be a little bit easier than some
of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.490> other<00:01:35.610> ones<00:01:35.850> i'm<00:01:36.000> assuming<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.420> did

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
of the other ones i'm assuming they did

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.700 
of the other ones i'm assuming they did
this<00:01:36.780> because<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> way<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.590> people

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
this because of the way that people

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.740 
this because of the way that people
wanted<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.310> kind<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.579> earn<00:01:38.909> or<00:01:39.210> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.509> by

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
wanted to kind of earn or kind of by

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.390 
wanted to kind of earn or kind of by
supply<00:01:40.259> drops<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.100> guess<00:01:41.280> they

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
supply drops and I guess they

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.800 
supply drops and I guess they
implemented<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.210> something<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.659> would

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
implemented this is something that would

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.210 
implemented this is something that would
make<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.200> little<00:01:43.320> bit<00:01:43.500> easier<00:01:43.860> maybe<00:01:44.100> a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
make it a little bit easier maybe a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
make it a little bit easier maybe a
little<00:01:44.340> more<00:01:44.490> accessible<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.540> little<00:01:45.750> more

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
little more accessible and a little more

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.929 
little more accessible and a little more
fun<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.170> go<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.979> honestly<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.880> a

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
fun to go to so honestly I think it's a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.010 
fun to go to so honestly I think it's a
good<00:01:48.030> thing<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.329> lot<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.479> people<00:01:48.570> are<00:01:48.780> being<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
good thing a lot of people are being a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.690 
good thing a lot of people are being a
little<00:01:49.049> bit<00:01:49.320> more<00:01:49.470> objective<00:01:50.040> with<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.460> you

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
little bit more objective with this you

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.800 
little bit more objective with this you
know<00:01:50.790> some<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.060> them<00:01:51.210> are<00:01:51.329> gonna<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.600> like

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
know some of them are gonna be like

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.480 
know some of them are gonna be like
getting<00:01:52.020> 25<00:01:52.619> tags<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.130> kill<00:01:53.280> confirmed

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
getting 25 tags and kill confirmed

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.330 
getting 25 tags and kill confirmed
getting<00:01:54.030> 20<00:01:54.689> kills<00:01:54.960> with<00:01:55.320> an<00:01:55.470> SMG<00:01:55.799> stuff<00:01:56.189> like

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
getting 20 kills with an SMG stuff like

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.410 
getting 20 kills with an SMG stuff like
that<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.670> hopefully<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.090> means<00:01:57.210> we're<00:01:57.360> gonna

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that so hopefully this means we're gonna

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.819 
that so hopefully this means we're gonna
see<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> lot<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.899> people<00:01:58.110> actually<00:01:58.530> trying<00:01:58.740> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
see a lot of people actually trying to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.410 
see a lot of people actually trying to
go<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.130> Supply<00:01:59.430> Drop<00:01:59.490> challenges<00:02:00.180> which

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
go for the Supply Drop challenges which

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.730 
go for the Supply Drop challenges which
hopefully<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.960> end<00:02:01.049> means<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.590> we're

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
hopefully in the end means that we're

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.080 
hopefully in the end means that we're
gonna<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> lot<00:02:02.219> more<00:02:02.250> people<00:02:02.640> playing<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
might be a little bit more difficult but

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.350 
might be a little bit more difficult but
it's<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.980> great<00:02:14.190> way<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.430> get<00:02:14.610> an<00:02:14.790> extra<00:02:15.120> supply

makes it so it's it adds a little more

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.190 
makes it so it's it adds a little more
replayability<00:02:30.060> along<00:02:30.569> with<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:31.019> regular
