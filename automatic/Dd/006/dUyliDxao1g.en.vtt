00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.590 
stick your chin out and not expect to
get<00:04:47.170> punched<00:04:47.440> that's<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.130> way<00:04:48.250> it<00:04:48.310> works<00:04:48.490> on

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.330 

all<00:04:52.600> my<00:04:52.750> records<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:53.230> write<00:04:53.470> songs<00:04:53.740> that<00:04:54.190> are

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
all my records I write songs that are

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.980 
all my records I write songs that are
revealing<00:04:54.790> about<00:04:55.120> my<00:04:55.270> feelings<00:04:55.660> but<00:04:55.870> also

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
revealing about my feelings but also

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.500 
revealing about my feelings but also
sometimes<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:56.680> don't<00:04:56.740> like<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.250> be<00:04:57.370> so<00:04:57.639> literal

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
sometimes I don't like to be so literal

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.950 
sometimes I don't like to be so literal
or<00:04:58.960> so<00:04:59.620> specific<00:05:00.370> I<00:05:00.639> like<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:01.810> be<00:05:01.930> more

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
or so specific I like to be more

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.870 
or so specific I like to be more
mysterious<00:05:02.770> so<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:03.190> guess<00:05:03.340> it<00:05:03.460> depends<00:05:03.700> on<00:05:03.790> the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
mysterious so I guess it depends on the

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.540 
mysterious so I guess it depends on the
mood<00:05:04.030> I'm<00:05:04.150> in<00:05:06.720> if<00:05:07.720> you're<00:05:08.050> an<00:05:08.139> artist<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.919> don't

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
mood I'm in if you're an artist I don't

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.120 
mood I'm in if you're an artist I don't
know<00:05:09.790> any<00:05:10.090> other<00:05:10.210> way<00:05:10.419> except<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.110> offer<00:05:11.260> up<00:05:11.530> my

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
know any other way except to offer up my
