00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.940 
be but I think it looks just like a
little<00:02:25.850> firework<00:02:26.360> or<00:02:26.569> like<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> dynamite<00:02:27.770> or

something<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.489> don't<00:02:28.760> know<00:02:28.970> if<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.180> think<00:02:29.360> this

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
something I don't know if you think this

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.510
