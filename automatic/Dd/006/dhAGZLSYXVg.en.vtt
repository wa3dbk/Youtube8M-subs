00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
you think it's better sonic or Mario I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.030 
you think it's better sonic or Mario I
mean<00:01:56.520> Sonny<00:01:56.880> catches<00:01:57.329> rings<00:01:57.630> Mario<00:01:58.619> catches

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040

coins<00:01:59.460> I<00:02:00.350> don't<00:02:01.350> know<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.040> say

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
coins I don't know I have to say

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.999 
coins I don't know I have to say
probably<00:02:02.420> sonic<00:02:03.420> sonic<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:04.200> jump<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.740> go

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
probably sonic sonic can jump and go

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.429 
probably sonic sonic can jump and go
really<00:02:05.250> fast<00:02:05.490> at<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> same<00:02:05.969> time<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.479> tails

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
really fast at the same time if tails

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.680 
really fast at the same time if tails
can<00:02:07.799> fly<00:02:08.129> every<00:02:08.789> time<00:02:08.940> sonic<00:02:09.300> falls<00:02:09.479> down<00:02:09.660> a

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
can fly every time sonic falls down a

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.510 
can fly every time sonic falls down a
hole<00:02:09.899> why<00:02:10.170> can't<00:02:10.470> tails<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:11.099> pick<00:02:11.310> them<00:02:11.400> up

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
hole why can't tails just pick them up

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.590 
hole why can't tails just pick them up
and<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:11.910> flying<00:02:12.690> off

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
and be like flying off

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.870 
and be like flying off
I<00:02:13.690> think<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.500> perhaps<00:02:14.920> Sonic<00:02:15.460> is<00:02:15.580> heavier

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
I think that perhaps Sonic is heavier

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.060 
I think that perhaps Sonic is heavier
than<00:02:15.940> he<00:02:16.180> looks<00:02:17.340> or<00:02:18.340> tails<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:19.450> lazy<00:02:20.070> kind

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
than he looks or tails is just lazy kind

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.130 
than he looks or tails is just lazy kind
of<00:02:21.130> like<00:02:21.310> me<00:02:23.190> okay<00:02:24.190> it's<00:02:24.490> possible<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.480> like<00:02:25.960> it
