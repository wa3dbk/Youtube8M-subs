next<00:00:04.960> up<00:00:05.140> we<00:00:05.770> have<00:00:06.010> the<00:00:06.250> refine<00:00:06.730> edge<00:00:07.020> for<00:00:08.020> our

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:08.109 
next up we have the refine edge for our

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.180 
next up we have the refine edge for our
selections<00:00:08.530> now<00:00:08.680> I'm<00:00:08.740> looking<00:00:08.980> at<00:00:09.040> this

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190 
selections now I'm looking at this

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.480 
selections now I'm looking at this
picture<00:00:09.430> here<00:00:10.120> and<00:00:10.240> we're<00:00:10.389> just<00:00:10.450> in<00:00:10.929> on<00:00:11.139> this

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
picture here and we're just in on this

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.129 
picture here and we're just in on this
tree<00:00:12.490> we're<00:00:12.969> going<00:00:13.090> to<00:00:13.179> use<00:00:13.269> the<00:00:13.450> magic<00:00:13.900> wand

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
tree we're going to use the magic wand

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.470 
tree we're going to use the magic wand
and<00:00:14.530> let's<00:00:14.800> do<00:00:14.980> a<00:00:15.009> basic<00:00:15.400> selection<00:00:16.000> using<00:00:16.330> the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
and let's do a basic selection using the

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.099 
and let's do a basic selection using the
magic<00:00:16.779> wand<00:00:16.810> and<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:18.400> choose<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.390> a<00:00:19.420> dad<00:00:19.990> in

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.109 
magic wand and this choose the a dad in

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.109 
magic wand and this choose the a dad in
this<00:00:20.230> section<00:00:20.529> in<00:00:20.800> that<00:00:21.010> section<00:00:21.310> I'll<00:00:21.609> then

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
this section in that section I'll then

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.790 
this section in that section I'll then
invert<00:00:22.570> that<00:00:22.810> that<00:00:22.990> will<00:00:23.109> give<00:00:23.260> me<00:00:23.350> just<00:00:23.650> this

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
invert that that will give me just this

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.330 
invert that that will give me just this
area<00:00:24.070> here<00:00:27.510> there<00:00:28.510> we<00:00:28.630> go<00:00:28.810> let's<00:00:29.590> now<00:00:29.769> zoom<00:00:29.800> in

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
area here there we go let's now zoom in

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.780 
area here there we go let's now zoom in
a<00:00:30.430> little<00:00:30.699> tighter<00:00:30.970> on<00:00:31.269> this<00:00:32.519> and<00:00:33.519> here's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
a little tighter on this and here's

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.600 
a little tighter on this and here's
where<00:00:33.910> we<00:00:34.030> can<00:00:34.180> use<00:00:34.480> that<00:00:34.980> modify<00:00:35.980> -<00:00:36.040> unless<00:00:36.430> we

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
where we can use that modify - unless we

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.430 
where we can use that modify - unless we
didn't<00:00:36.880> really<00:00:37.120> catch<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.600> edges<00:00:37.930> completely

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
didn't really catch the edges completely

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.780 
didn't really catch the edges completely
it's<00:00:38.530> kind<00:00:38.710> of<00:00:38.739> missing<00:00:38.980> a<00:00:39.190> little<00:00:39.340> bit<00:00:39.550> here

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
it's kind of missing a little bit here

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.450 
it's kind of missing a little bit here
and<00:00:39.850> there<00:00:40.440> cover<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.590> select<00:00:41.950> and<00:00:42.160> refine

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
and there cover to select and refine

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.479 
and there cover to select and refine
edge<00:00:43.110> now<00:00:44.110> first<00:00:44.680> off<00:00:44.890> you'll<00:00:45.070> notice<00:00:45.190> that<00:00:45.399> we

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
edge now first off you'll notice that we

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.500 
edge now first off you'll notice that we
have<00:00:45.700> this<00:00:45.969> tool<00:00:46.930> here<00:00:47.200> with<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:48.149> across<00:00:49.149> the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
have this tool here with a across the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.240 
have this tool here with a across the
middle<00:00:49.809> and<00:00:49.930> then<00:00:50.469> a<00:00:50.500> circle<00:00:50.829> around<00:00:51.010> that

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
middle and then a circle around that

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.279 
middle and then a circle around that
that<00:00:51.460> is<00:00:51.700> the<00:00:52.000> selection<00:00:52.450> tweak<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:53.020> use<00:00:53.110> that

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
that is the selection tweak and use that

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.439 
that is the selection tweak and use that
to<00:00:53.500> spot<00:00:54.430> where<00:00:54.579> you<00:00:54.670> want<00:00:54.879> to<00:00:55.000> add<00:00:55.180> an

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
to spot where you want to add an

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.549 
to spot where you want to add an
additional<00:00:55.600> selection<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:58.390> can<00:00:58.600> change<00:00:59.020> that

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
additional selection you can change that

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.139 
additional selection you can change that
size<00:00:59.920> right<00:01:00.250> down<00:01:00.370> here<00:01:00.489> at<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.609> bottom<00:01:00.789> that

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
size right down here at the bottom that

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.049 
size right down here at the bottom that
make<00:01:01.629> that<00:01:01.780> much<00:01:02.440> larger<00:01:02.739> or<00:01:03.190> much<00:01:03.609> smaller

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
make that much larger or much smaller

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.120 
make that much larger or much smaller
little<00:01:04.360> slider<00:01:04.750> control<00:01:05.199> right<00:01:05.560> down<00:01:05.800> there

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
little slider control right down there

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.950 
little slider control right down there
I'm<00:01:06.790> not<00:01:06.909> sure<00:01:06.970> why<00:01:07.210> this<00:01:07.270> isn't<00:01:07.540> up<00:01:07.750> in<00:01:07.869> the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
I'm not sure why this isn't up in the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.240 
I'm not sure why this isn't up in the
box<00:01:08.170> it<00:01:08.380> really<00:01:08.590> should<00:01:08.799> be<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:10.450> we<00:01:10.630> have<00:01:10.810> that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
box it really should be so we have that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.490 
box it really should be so we have that
adjust<00:01:12.250> that<00:01:12.369> size<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:13.630> can<00:01:13.840> look<00:01:14.229> at<00:01:14.409> your

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
adjust that size you can look at your

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.800 
adjust that size you can look at your
image<00:01:14.770> in<00:01:14.890> different<00:01:15.010> ways<00:01:15.600> little<00:01:16.600> drop-down

image in different ways little drop-down

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.330 
image in different ways little drop-down
lists<00:01:17.140> here<00:01:17.380> this<00:01:17.770> is<00:01:17.920> what's<00:01:18.070> called<00:01:18.220> the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
lists here this is what's called the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.140 
lists here this is what's called the
marching<00:01:18.729> ants

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
marching ants

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.570 
marching ants
that's<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.659> little<00:01:19.920> dashed<00:01:20.920> line<00:01:21.310> that

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
that's the little dashed line that

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.740 
that's the little dashed line that
overlay<00:01:22.509> view<00:01:23.610> do<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:24.700> on<00:01:24.820> black<00:01:25.150> pretty<00:01:25.570> easy

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
overlay view do it on black pretty easy

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.359 
overlay view do it on black pretty easy
to<00:01:25.900> see<00:01:26.110> this<00:01:26.259> if<00:01:26.409> it's<00:01:26.560> on<00:01:26.650> black<00:01:26.979> you<00:01:27.189> can<00:01:27.310> do

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
to see this if it's on black you can do

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.069 
to see this if it's on black you can do
it<00:01:27.460> on<00:01:27.549> white<00:01:28.979> black<00:01:29.979> and<00:01:30.009> white<00:01:30.340> or<00:01:30.610> just<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
it on white black and white or just the

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.420 
it on white black and white or just the
layers<00:01:32.320> this<00:01:32.890> is<00:01:32.950> what<00:01:33.130> it<00:01:33.189> would<00:01:33.280> look<00:01:33.369> like

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
layers this is what it would look like

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.039 
layers this is what it would look like
if<00:01:33.670> we've<00:01:33.850> removed<00:01:34.210> that<00:01:34.540> area<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:34.840> was

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
if we've removed that area that was

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.929 
if we've removed that area that was
selected<00:01:35.200> or<00:01:35.710> look<00:01:36.189> at<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.310> whole<00:01:36.490> layer<00:01:36.700> as

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
selected or look at the whole layer as

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.420 
selected or look at the whole layer as
well<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:37.450> different<00:01:38.320> ways<00:01:38.439> of<00:01:38.680> looking<00:01:39.100> at

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
well so different ways of looking at

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.249 
well so different ways of looking at
this<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.530> can<00:01:42.450> expand<00:01:43.450> your<00:01:43.600> detection<00:01:44.079> area

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
this you can expand your detection area

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.620 
this you can expand your detection area
here<00:01:44.650> or<00:01:44.680> subtract<00:01:45.579> from<00:01:45.790> your<00:01:45.850> detection

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
here or subtract from your detection

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.639 
here or subtract from your detection
area<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:48.549> can<00:01:48.670> adjust<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.390> edge<00:01:50.020> detection

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
area we can adjust the edge detection

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.880 
area we can adjust the edge detection
here<00:01:51.070> using<00:01:51.549> there<00:01:51.670> our<00:01:51.790> radius<00:01:52.180> tool<00:01:52.420> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
here using there our radius tool a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.230 
here using there our radius tool a
little<00:01:53.890> larger<00:01:54.220> or<00:01:54.340> smaller<00:01:54.369> on<00:01:54.909> our<00:01:55.090> edge

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
little larger or smaller on our edge

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.999 
little larger or smaller on our edge
detection<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:57.369> can<00:01:57.490> smooth<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.240> edge<00:01:58.390> out<00:01:59.009> so

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
detection we can smooth the edge out so

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.520 
detection we can smooth the edge out so
it<00:02:00.070> kind<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.310> softens<00:02:00.549> up<00:02:00.969> that<00:02:01.210> edge<00:02:01.450> or<00:02:01.780> we

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
it kind of softens up that edge or we

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.550 
it kind of softens up that edge or we
can<00:02:02.649> feather<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.130> edge<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.960> I<00:02:05.110> kind<00:02:05.259> of<00:02:05.290> see

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
can feather the edge if I kind of see

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.590 
can feather the edge if I kind of see
through<00:02:05.799> we<00:02:05.979> can<00:02:06.159> increase<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.670> contrast<00:02:07.240> at

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
through we can increase the contrast at

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.150 
through we can increase the contrast at
the<00:02:08.170> edge

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
the edge

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.250 
the edge
and<00:02:09.880> one<00:02:10.120> if<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.330> was<00:02:10.450> most<00:02:10.690> useful<00:02:10.780> right<00:02:11.110> down

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
and one if I was most useful right down

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.950 
and one if I was most useful right down
here<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.830> shift<00:02:12.190> edge<00:02:12.600> this<00:02:13.600> allows<00:02:13.840> you

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
here is the shift edge this allows you

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.600 
here is the shift edge this allows you
to<00:02:14.080> expand<00:02:14.650> or<00:02:15.070> contract<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:17.050> selection<00:02:17.610> so

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
to expand or contract the selection so

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.290 
to expand or contract the selection so
I'm<00:02:18.670> going<00:02:18.820> to<00:02:20.280> shift<00:02:21.280> my<00:02:21.460> edge<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.940> is

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
I'm going to shift my edge in is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.030 
I'm going to shift my edge in is
contracting<00:02:23.050> this<00:02:23.140> house<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.620> getting<00:02:23.890> in

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
contracting this house it is getting in

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.420 
contracting this house it is getting in
tighter<00:02:24.790> now<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.300> tree<00:02:25.600> or<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:26.920> expand

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
tighter now to the tree or I can expand

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.220 
tighter now to the tree or I can expand
out<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.730> little<00:02:28.240> bit<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:28.780> case<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:28.990> want<00:02:29.170> to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
out a little bit and this case I want to

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.060 
out a little bit and this case I want to
expand<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.800> just<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.160> little<00:02:30.310> bit<00:02:31.920> notice<00:02:32.920> as<00:02:33.040> it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
expand it just a little bit notice as it

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.620 
expand it just a little bit notice as it
expands<00:02:33.580> doing<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.820> pretty<00:02:34.030> good<00:02:34.240> job<00:02:34.420> of

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
expands doing a pretty good job of

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.650 
expands doing a pretty good job of
finding<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.200> rest<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.620> those<00:02:35.740> edges<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:37.450> this

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
finding the rest of those edges so this

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.690 
finding the rest of those edges so this
one<00:02:37.870> control<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.440> doing<00:02:38.920> pretty<00:02:39.250> much<00:02:39.340> what<00:02:39.670> I

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
one control is doing pretty much what I

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.510 
one control is doing pretty much what I
want<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.210> hear<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:41.710> I'll<00:02:41.890> come<00:02:42.010> out<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.160> little

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
want to hear and I'll come out a little

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.260 
want to hear and I'll come out a little
bit<00:02:42.760> further<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:45.060> kind<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.090> edging<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.630> out

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
bit further just kind of edging it out

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.310 
bit further just kind of edging it out
that's<00:02:49.270> about<00:02:49.450> as<00:02:49.570> far<00:02:49.720> as<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:50.050> will<00:02:50.110> call<00:02:50.260> it

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
that's about as far as it will call it

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.060 
that's about as far as it will call it
on<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.560> quote<00:02:50.770> quite<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.250> far<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.950> there

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
on you to quote quite that far so there

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.280 
on you to quote quite that far so there
we<00:02:54.160> go<00:02:54.190> pretty<00:02:54.820> good<00:02:55.150> now<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.390> can<00:02:55.720> subtract

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
we go pretty good now I can subtract

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.720 
we go pretty good now I can subtract
this<00:02:56.530> color<00:02:56.800> right<00:02:57.010> down<00:02:57.190> here<00:02:57.520> let's<00:02:57.670> click

this color right down here let's click

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.100 
this color right down here let's click
on<00:02:57.880> our<00:02:57.970> subtract<00:02:58.330> button<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.750> I'll<00:02:58.840> click<00:02:58.870> on

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
on our subtract button and I'll click on

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.060 
on our subtract button and I'll click on
that<00:02:59.200> white<00:02:59.440> area<00:02:59.710> there<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:01.570> just<00:03:02.070> remove

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
that white area there and just remove

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.740 
that white area there and just remove
that<00:03:03.900> from<00:03:04.900> our<00:03:05.110> selection<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:07.450> click<00:03:07.660> on

that little blue area right in there

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.620 
that little blue area right in there
because<00:03:11.260> we<00:03:11.500> know<00:03:11.620> what<00:03:11.710> I<00:03:11.740> do<00:03:11.830> anything<00:03:12.070> there

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
because we know what I do anything there

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.300 
because we know what I do anything there
you<00:03:13.630> can<00:03:13.750> see<00:03:13.930> how<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.320> can<00:03:14.650> by<00:03:14.920> using<00:03:14.980> these

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
you can see how this can by using these

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.790 
you can see how this can by using these
different<00:03:15.520> tools<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.120> different<00:03:16.900> parts

different tools and different parts

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.050 
different tools and different parts
these<00:03:17.890> tools<00:03:18.130> will<00:03:18.310> work<00:03:18.340> better<00:03:18.790> with

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
these tools will work better with

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.450 
these tools will work better with
different<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.690> your<00:03:20.050> options<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:21.070> use<00:03:21.250> this

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
different of your options you use this

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.410 
different of your options you use this
to<00:03:21.700> come<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.120> in<00:03:22.470> kind<00:03:23.470> of<00:03:23.500> refine<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.130> edge

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
to come in in kind of refine the edge

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.460 
to come in in kind of refine the edge
let's<00:03:25.420> increase<00:03:25.750> our<00:03:25.930> contrast<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.770> bit<00:03:27.100> here

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
let's increase our contrast a bit here

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.510 
let's increase our contrast a bit here
sometimes<00:03:29.470> with<00:03:29.620> this<00:03:29.740> kind<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.040> plant<00:03:30.310> edge

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
sometimes with this kind of a plant edge

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.980 
sometimes with this kind of a plant edge
it<00:03:30.670> will<00:03:30.760> bring<00:03:31.300> it<00:03:31.390> into<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.660> edge<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.810> little

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
it will bring it into the edge a little

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.830 
it will bring it into the edge a little
bit<00:03:32.230> of<00:03:32.350> I'm<00:03:32.470> not<00:03:32.530> seeing<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.010> in<00:03:33.100> here<00:03:33.840> you

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
bit of I'm not seeing it in here you

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.120 
bit of I'm not seeing it in here you
also<00:03:34.990> if<00:03:35.110> you<00:03:35.200> want<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.740> you<00:03:35.920> can<00:03:36.130> output<00:03:36.790> this

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
also if you want to you can output this

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.820 
also if you want to you can output this
to<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.160> layer<00:03:39.400> mask<00:03:39.430> or<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.060> new<00:03:40.330> layer<00:03:40.600> or<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:41.500> new

even<00:03:44.640> when<00:03:45.640> you're<00:03:45.760> happy<00:03:46.030> with<00:03:46.180> your

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
even when you're happy with your

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.330 
even when you're happy with your
solution<00:03:46.510> just<00:03:46.810> choose<00:03:47.110> okay<00:03:47.590> but<00:03:48.070> first<00:03:48.220> you

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
solution just choose okay but first you

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.820 
solution just choose okay but first you
can<00:03:48.459> take<00:03:48.550> a<00:03:48.580> fast<00:03:48.850> look<00:03:49.000> at<00:03:49.240> it<00:03:49.390> check<00:03:49.830> your

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
can take a fast look at it check your

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.140 
can take a fast look at it check your
overlay<00:03:51.130> that<00:03:51.310> looks<00:03:51.520> pretty<00:03:51.760> good

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
overlay that looks pretty good

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.840 
overlay that looks pretty good
I<00:03:52.590> like<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.680> see<00:03:53.800> how<00:03:53.890> much<00:03:54.040> tighter<00:03:54.459> this<00:03:54.670> is

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
I like to see how much tighter this is

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.850 
I like to see how much tighter this is
little<00:03:55.180> better<00:03:55.360> selection<00:03:55.840> it's<00:03:56.590> still<00:03:56.830> a

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
little better selection it's still a

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.800 
little better selection it's still a
little<00:03:57.190> bit<00:03:57.370> out<00:03:57.640> we<00:03:57.790> have<00:03:57.910> some<00:03:58.060> met<00:03:58.209> blue

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
little bit out we have some met blue
