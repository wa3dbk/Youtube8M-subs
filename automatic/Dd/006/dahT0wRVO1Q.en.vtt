00:00:02.228 --> 00:00:04.499
So let's set up our play field.

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:07.043
The play field for our game will be very simple.

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:09.361
We will place walls around the edges

00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:11.885
to keep our player game object from falling off

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:14.440
and we will create and place a set of collectable

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.149
objects for our player to pick up.

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:19.606
First let's create a new game object

00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:21.427
and rename it Walls.

00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:24.099
This will be an organising parent game object

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.685
for our Wall objects.

00:00:26.603 --> 00:00:28.603
Reset this game object to origin.

00:01:11.783 --> 00:01:13.783
Now we will build our walls.

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:15.935
Let's start by creating a new cube

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:17.935
to be our first wall.

00:01:19.138 --> 00:01:21.439
Rename this West Wall.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.090
Reset this game object to origin.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.826
Now parent West Wall to our Walls game object.

00:01:31.504 --> 00:01:33.392
Let's focus our Scene view camera

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:34.961
to our Wall object.

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.556
We can do this by typing the F key

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:39.556
while the cursor is over the Scene view

00:01:40.056 --> 00:01:43.353
or by selecting Edit - Frame Selected.

00:01:46.602 --> 00:01:48.602
We need to change the size of the cube to fit

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:50.602
one side of our play area.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.318
Change the cube's transform scale of X, Y and Z to

00:01:56.318 --> 00:02:01.338
.5 for thin, 2 for tall and 20.5 for long.

00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:04.292
Now we can simply push the wall in to place

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:05.698
using the Translate tool

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:09.700
or we could enter a value in to the transform component.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.700
In this case we can set the transform's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.822
position X value to -10.

00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:18.181
This places the wall neatly to the edge of our play area.

00:02:19.532 --> 00:02:21.532
To create the next wall we could

00:02:21.532 --> 00:02:23.201
start with another new cube,

00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:25.201
but then we'd have to rescale this

00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:27.020
new cube before we placed it.

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:31.065
Our current West Wall is already the perfect size.

00:02:31.502 --> 00:02:35.151
So let's duplicate the West Wall game object.

00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:37.841
Let's rename it East Wall.

00:02:39.023 --> 00:02:41.682
To place the wall simply remove the negative sign

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:44.985
and it pops in to place on the east side of our game area.

00:02:45.692 --> 00:02:47.692
Now let's duplicate the east wall

00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:52.192
and call it North Wall.

00:02:54.037 --> 00:02:56.037
Reset the X position so the north wall

00:02:56.037 --> 00:02:58.037
is in the centre of the play area.

00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:00.522
We now have two choices.

00:03:00.522 --> 00:03:03.144
We can rotate the wall by 90 degrees,

00:03:03.144 --> 00:03:05.392
or, as this is a cuboid,

00:03:05.392 --> 00:03:12.173
we can rescale the wall to 20.5 in the X and 0.5 in the Z.

00:03:12.648 --> 00:03:14.648
Now it's scaled correctly for it's orientation

00:03:14.648 --> 00:03:16.407
as the north wall.

00:03:17.018 --> 00:03:19.018
We can drag the wall in to place,

00:03:19.018 --> 00:03:21.018
or we can simply use the value of 10

00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:24.123
in the transform's position Z field to place it.

00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:28.577
Duplicate North Wall and call it South Wall,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.515
and -10 in the Z axis pops it in to place.

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:35.469
Enter play mode and test.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.014
Fantastic, the walls work fine.

00:03:42.014 --> 00:03:44.292
Remember to test early and test often,

00:03:44.292 --> 00:03:45.964
don't wait to test.

00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:48.196
Let's exit play mode.

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:52.596
Let's highlight the Player game object

00:03:52.596 --> 00:03:54.693
and set the editor to Local mode,

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:55.773
and try again.

00:03:56.392 --> 00:03:58.991
Note how in Local mode we can see the transform rotate.

00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:05.701
Let's exit play mode.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.228
In the next episode we will be creating

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:11.228
our collectable pickup object.

00:04:11.228 --> 00:04:14.000
