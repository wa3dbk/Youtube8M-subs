00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
here I am so excited about to go

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.580 
here I am so excited about to go
swimming<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.600> whale<00:01:36.780> sharks<00:01:37.140> I'm

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
swimming with the whale sharks I'm

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.440 
swimming with the whale sharks I'm
wearing<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.920> wetsuit<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> rule

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
wearing a wetsuit because it was a rule

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.880 
wearing a wetsuit because it was a rule
you<00:01:39.659> had<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> either<00:01:39.990> wear<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> wetsuit<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
you had to either wear a wetsuit or a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.950 
you had to either wear a wetsuit or a
lifejacket<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.150> thought<00:01:42.360> I'd<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> lot

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
lifejacket and I thought I'd have a lot

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.539 
lifejacket and I thought I'd have a lot
more<00:01:42.990> freedom<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.710> wetsuit<00:01:43.920> compared<00:01:44.490> to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
more freedom in a wetsuit compared to

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.580 
more freedom in a wetsuit compared to
lugging<00:01:44.850> around<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.270> lifejacket<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.079> you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
lugging around a lifejacket and you

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.929 
lugging around a lifejacket and you
don't<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:46.890> need<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.280> though<00:01:47.430> because<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
don't really need it though because the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.120 
don't really need it though because the
water<00:01:48.180> itself<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.869> super<00:01:49.079> warm<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.799> really

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
water itself is super warm it's really

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.560 
water itself is super warm it's really
comfortable<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.670> swim<00:01:50.880> around<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.479> like

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
comfortable to swim around and it's like

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.929 
comfortable to swim around and it's like
lukewarm<00:01:52.020> bath<00:01:52.470> water<00:01:52.799> will<00:01:53.430> sharks<00:01:53.759> prefer

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
lukewarm bath water will sharks prefer

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.700 
lukewarm bath water will sharks prefer
warmer<00:01:54.540> waters<00:01:54.899> that's<00:01:55.170> why<00:01:55.320> they're<00:01:55.500> found

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
warmer waters that's why they're found

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.289 
warmer waters that's why they're found
in<00:01:55.829> all<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> tropical<00:01:56.729> oceans<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.270> the
