00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.010
 the gateway off 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.000
 and this to all welcome we are on the 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.369
 online game with my little map of 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.380
 takata i'm in matchmaking like 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.930
 hab I was hanging out on the wandering game 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.950
 on matchmaking and I propose you 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.079
 a little video that I shot there 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.059
 two three days and so this comment 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.850
 is not live but I'm going to 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.320
 so talk about a little topic where I 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.300
 need 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.879
 I need your opinions simply 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.589
 so then look I'm I was looking for 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.280
 an opponent so the game it was 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:54.229
 complete and I saw this blues blood guy 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.339
 shot I do not know what and in fact I 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.979
 had crossed it three days ago 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.780
 he had me downright spam and to handle 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.369
 made two games with him the first one he 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.530
 had taken me that beat he had made me 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:06.170
 total flat and then he had taken 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.909
 neji and you know I suppose 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.560
 the noob with neji who are purring 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.090
 purring they keep on pressing 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.189
 round all the time by getting in 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.530
 wake up by finally disabling you short 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.760
 know he had me soul and suddenly there 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.340
 I told myself my iron age they 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.390
 parade and he is open pardon it's 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.520
 the occasion of this film is perhaps a 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.360
 interesting clip to tell them about this 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.939
 I want to talk to them 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.079
 so I armed myself it was all 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.909
 first part of the day 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.409
 I give you get up I remember 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.549
 I took this what is it that I 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.570
 never take elsewhere because I 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.979
 know he's faster than the host 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.659
 so I thought, I'll take it 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.920
 and I took 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.200
 karin jugo so I took it as a 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.320
 Team rather strong because I suspected 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.899
 that this young man was going to take a 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.850
 team which I was not appreciated 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.159
 that's integrity I was going to say that's it 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.670
 so we are in the presence of masking 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.950
 our donkeys nagato punishments and it's rather 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.569
 of the body so that's me I wanted 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.499
 pronounced in blue because good bah with 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.630
 this kind of player I take a 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.530
 solution in blue but 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.390
 the habit has made that unfortunately 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.450
 I took djougou in orchard was not too 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.340
 I have not calculated too much short I have 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.330
 tried to get by with so I want 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.530
 comment a bit on the match and I'll 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.450
 were talking about what I want what I 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.690
 wanted to talk to you then I start at 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.069
 melee I jump everything then 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.920
 hide the trigger so the prelate thesis 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.920
 you know we start with chabal and 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.480
 nallet 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.180
 I somewhat wary though ye 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.130
 know the loustic here I am 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.950
 resume a nighy ballet with my two 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.989
 the guard and red it's interesting 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.660
 tomb finally short I'm breaking to be 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.860
 for celebrities but it will work 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.480
 so in fact I wanted to ask you a 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.269
 question which simply is what you 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.370
 are in favor of yes or no 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.810
 so that's the question I wanted 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.989
 to ask you is what to disappoint my 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.450
 return of the two families 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.190
 even if six games cij to the hague if I 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.140
 do one this new section on this 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.489
 we think we know a new us but 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.900
 basically that's it 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.959
 are you in favor in 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.140
 palm trees to know a rubric where I 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.840
 post the gameplay of other players from 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.090
 the naruto community where he shows us 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.609
 that fair play simply can 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.200
 win against people not fair play 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.410
 so I asked myself the question is it 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.579
 on 33 that you are ok you would be ok 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.530
 for this section 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.930
 unfortunately 63 you know it there 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.780
 is there more system of 2 could 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.880
 film our gameplay and keep it on the 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.519
 game so unfortunately the only people 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.810
 all those who will have the opportunity to 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.340
 send me their gameplay will be people 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.049
 who have acquisition equipment that 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.459
 can film so but I tell myself that 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.109
 it can be interesting for them for 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.680
 the little chains that have trouble getting 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.470
 start 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.970
 or even for days that 1p 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.420
 green is not necessarily string 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.739
 Youtube 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.799
 I think it's always interesting 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.639
 to expose other people because on 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.319
 a youtube channel would be that it's a 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.690
 little staff anyway so I 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.160
 said that drinks it could be a 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.420
 a good idea then is what you 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.709
 are just favorable here I am 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.500
 you ask and that's my comment 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.930
 yes or no to a heading so where 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.730
 I expose other players than me and who 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.800
 shows us everyone 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.360
 coupvray fair play and beat people 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.879
 who are not fair play so that would be 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.140
 I think videos of 2,3 and then with 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.519
 two three different players 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.010
 I think it will be a little bit 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.390
 format so that's just 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.220
 like the whole thing it feels good 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.320
 so just what are you 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.549
 are favorable or not to a return of 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.160
 this section which will be called I am 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.949
 I think fair play or die so let 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.150
 me a message if you can you 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.530
 do not like you find that by humiliating 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.910
 to see people who beat spammers 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.680
 tell me there's no problem 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.479
 take into account your opinions and if you 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.000
 are favre tell me too and according to 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.449
 the statistics I want to say I 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.639
 will see if I if I start again this 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.960
 exposed heading of other players ago 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.840
 broken lagoon and I enjoy it we feel a 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.400

 good position there anyway despite everything 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.199
 he starts a combo to wildlife will be 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.660

 oh if the support of each senate are there 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.190

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.900
