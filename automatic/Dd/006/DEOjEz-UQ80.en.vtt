00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi everybody i'm glad welcome 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.179
 you on my channel today i want 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.870
 continue the topic of growing banzai 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.139
 Japanese pine from seeds purchased 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.770
 we know those who know and follow my 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.289
 the channel knows that just recently a little 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.380
 less than a month ago I started the experiment 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.210
 on growing a banzai and took three lo 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.260
 there are such cones that you are now 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.300
 see planted sowed seeds but they have 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.120
 the whole process I have previous 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.100
 anyone interested can watch the video 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.320
 today what i wanted to do today i 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.070
 I wanted to take the first results on 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.190
 growing a base i'm seed here's three 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.940
 cones like i said and how are you 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.079
 see in two of them already very principle 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.750
 sprouts appeared well and grow 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.480
 banzai begin to grow 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.760
 This is the first cone. This is the cone. 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.860
 in which the similarity appeared the most 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.460
 first very first shoots 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.400
 went up planted and and as you remember just 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.920
 on the wet ground they put the seeds and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.500
 she stood at room temperature already 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.500
 two weeks later the first first appeared 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.960
 sprout that is characteristic I do not know why 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.950
 these are the first two times. what appeared 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.720
 in two weeks, while they are actively growing 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.560
 3 sprout that appeared a little later there 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.329
 a day after two lasted 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.510
 weeks and a half weeks and now he 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.660
 as you see she 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.110
 Flint it dies here in this 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:45.410
 I have a little bit of land 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.240
 loosened start to make another 2 1. 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.160
 over there and over there that is through 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.890
 for a while I think that those shoots 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.130
 who make their way too will grow and 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.650
 will normally continue to grow here this 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.980
 cap conditionally number two was she 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.110
 us 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.670
 I put this cone cold on the window and 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.920
 stood on there principle pretty 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.250
 long long 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.840
 2 weeks almost insisted on the window 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.260
 all that time when in two weeks 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.610
 began to descend into 1 cones I shoots her 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.050
 also withdrew from the window and put on 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.060
 room temperature next to this one 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.760
 flasks number one and literally through 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.340
 a week and a half for 100 how I did it in 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.440
 This flask also appeared sprouts as 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.220
 you see two very active ones already and 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.620
 plus there is another two times and somewhere else 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.430
 there I saw 3 germs also appear 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.360
 that is, it will all grow up as for 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.120
 the third flask as you remember i put it 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.130
 the very heat right on the battery will take 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.260
 the battery was put here actively 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.470
 evaporation in this cone all this 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.360
 and there was no result and so did 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.970
 how in two weeks they started to go 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.090
 inputs in 1 cones I and removed from the battery and 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.060
 also put on the table next to all three 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.000
 I have stood here in this flask so far 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.130
 then do not have any skoda he did well, I 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.750
 so I assume that most likely here 7 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.989
 on just died but still 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.850
 I do not want to unpack looking through here 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.950
 this flask is opaque to us I see that 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.080
 the ground here is still less moisture there is not 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.360
 so unpack and and while I will not 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.290
 let him stand still and see further what 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.420
 with her as I wanted to bring a little and 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.070
 make the first results since this video 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.390
 this is the first talk and say the following 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.300
 grow sprouting pine seeds 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.550
 Japanese banzai is quite homely 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.400
 similarity can be as you see pretty 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.069
 not bad i mean seeds sprout their skete 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.340
 order 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.739
 it is possible and on the way optimum for 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.459
 I consider myself to be the way to take 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.260
 base of some kind of flower garden there that you have 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.329
 brother seed 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.280
 actively water the land ie actively 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.590
 polity 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.650
 spread out neatly seeds and top 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.609
 completely completely easy to sprinkle all new 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.709
 dry soil 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.810
 not pressing anything cover it all 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.969
 film in such food 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.829
 cover well so that there is a greenhouse 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:18.449
 created and put at room 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:20.190
 temperature dot in two weeks 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.660
 I got worse so i think on 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.199
 two weeks after two weeks 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.900
 watch out and germination will appear once 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.000
 . similarity will be so this way 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.389
 considering the best for seeds 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.099
 Bought from China for Japanese pine 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.560
 banzai 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:40.199
 so that 1 result we summed up to whom 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.210
 interesting subscribe see through 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.919
 literally I don't know what time it is 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.380
 the first leaf will open like it 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.560
 bloom better I'll them 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.810
 repot I saw him as I 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.780
 I do that is lay out again as 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.130
 promised to be completely the whole process until 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.169
 already more or less such a serious escape 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.560
 thanks to everyone 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.909
 subscribe to me on the channel 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.599
 ask ask questions to everyone 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.449
 I will answer 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.590
 under the video there will be a link to the group 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.860
 in contact with 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:17.270
 who are interested in here such 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.830
 First of all we are quite with you 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.650
 serious normal i honestly option 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.710
 I expected that there will be a lot worse all all 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.340
 thank you all see subscribe 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.340
