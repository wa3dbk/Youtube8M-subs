00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.900
 hello motorists want you 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:10.570
 tell me how i charge the battery 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:14.620
 the battery can be charged and on 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.730
 the car does not have to be removed 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.940
 don't even take off the battery terminal 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.070
 Of course it is desirable to remove it, I also shoot 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.830
 in order to charge the battery you need 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.490
 first check whether you need it 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.989
 generally charge for this we take 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:38.309
 voltmeter and attach minus to minus 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:43.510
 plus plus see what we have shows 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.780
 the voltmeter shows almost 13 volts then 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.370
 There is everything below 13 volts 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.089
 need to charge means we will 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:01:04.530
 recharge my battery charger 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:04.530
 most commonly who has control 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:23.320
 Ammeter regular and still redone here 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.230
 here it is converted 123 here 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.190
 minimum voltage is set 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:37.030
 medium and high voltage we 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:44.250
 now put it on let it stand on 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.250
 average voltage connect minus 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:58.530
 plus to plus 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:02:01.180
 minus to minus and turn on charging 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:09.479
 look at the voltmeter on the voltmeter with us 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:09.479
 shows almost 13 charging served 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:23.620
 some current is given even here one two three 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:29.470
 three clicks went charging shows 1 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:34.260
 The ampere is charged with a current of 1 ampere and 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.260
 voltmeter already voltage 13 and a half 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.980
 we will charge three to four hours after 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:48.180
 I will increase this 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:53.230
 god if you now put on maximum 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.430
 here shows two feathers and on 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.630
 the voltmeter will already show almost 15 volts 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.579
 Oswald is immediately undesirable to give 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.579
 because the battery will boil 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:13.209
 let's make one amp somewhere so everything is worth 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.410
 charging well of course i have time 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.900
 in order to charge 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.670
 if you have no time you can safely 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:25.420
 set to 5 amps this is a current equal to 1 10 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:30.519
 battery 60k battery and how much 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.709
 there it is 60 60 ampere hours our 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.180
 as much as possible it can be charged with current 6 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.639
 ampere 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.829
 here should be 6 amps that's it 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:42.519
 set and let him chase him to me 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.889
 there is a time with a minimum of the same style as 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:50.170
 minimum current, it is better charged and not 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:52.500
 there will be a chain-link battery when on 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.500
 voltmeter 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:03.030
 grow to 15 then you can put 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.480
 raising a little bit of vamp and so 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.580
 way we will battery stronger up 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.580
 charge while it is enough 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:18.000
 for now let it stand and let it charge 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.870
 total charging time in this mode and this 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.360
 it will be hours of hours 8 9 well, the truth is mine 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.520
 the battery is not discharged 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.670
 I was initially charged well percent 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.670
 there at 80 let's say it was 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:42.650
 12.8 volts and it is necessary to fully charge 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:47.330
 to ensure that the battery was 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:50.810
 somewhere around 14 and a half volts at 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.180
 volume when we fully charge and 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.350
 check with a voltmeter what was 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.860
 fourteen and a half years 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.860
 charge correctly
