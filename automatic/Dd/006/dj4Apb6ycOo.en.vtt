00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
much the strange exterior unless of

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.840 
much the strange exterior unless of
course<00:00:19.470> you're<00:00:20.189> starting<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.460> look<00:00:20.520> at<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.760> now

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
course you're starting to look at it now

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.769 
course you're starting to look at it now
and<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.060> starting<00:00:21.330> look<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.480> little<00:00:21.600> familiar

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
and it starting look a little familiar

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.410 
and it starting look a little familiar
we<00:00:22.619> got<00:00:22.769> some<00:00:22.980> posts<00:00:23.580> holding<00:00:23.820> up<00:00:23.910> wood<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
we got some posts holding up wood in a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.290 
we got some posts holding up wood in a
three<00:00:24.660> by<00:00:24.779> three<00:00:24.810> hallway<00:00:25.849> deep<00:00:26.849> underground

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
three by three hallway deep underground

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.790 
three by three hallway deep underground
so<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.630> would<00:00:27.750> seem<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.170> water<00:00:28.410> pouring<00:00:28.710> out

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
so it would seem with water pouring out

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040 
so it would seem with water pouring out
of<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> walls<00:00:29.630> already<00:00:30.630> got<00:00:30.900> too<00:00:30.960> much

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
of the walls already got too much

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.530 
of the walls already got too much
torches<00:00:31.439> down<00:00:31.470> because<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:31.920> super<00:00:32.250> dark

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
torches down because it's super dark

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.350 
torches down because it's super dark
it's<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.050> pretty<00:00:34.590> strange<00:00:35.360> strange

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
it's it's a pretty strange strange

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.049 
it's it's a pretty strange strange
interior<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.920> I'm<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> go<00:00:38.879> ahead<00:00:38.969> and

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
interior so I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.810 
interior so I'm going to go ahead and
keep<00:00:39.270> walking<00:00:39.510> here<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.100> then<00:00:41.280> look<00:00:41.640> around

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
keep walking here and then look around

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.670 
keep walking here and then look around
and<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.719> see<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.930> i'm<00:00:43.140> also<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
and you can see that i'm also in a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.119 
and you can see that i'm also in a
ravine<00:00:44.190> now<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.989> some<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.500> guys<00:00:46.680> it's

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
ravine now for some of you guys it's

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.260 
ravine now for some of you guys it's
probably<00:00:47.430> starting<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.820> get<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.969> little

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
probably starting to get a little

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.709 
probably starting to get a little
familiar<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.460> that's<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:51.329> should<00:00:51.600> be

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
familiar and that's because it should be

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.569 
familiar and that's because it should be
familiar<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:52.949> necessarily<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.460> what

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
familiar now not necessarily and what

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
familiar now not necessarily and what
exactly<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.510> sort<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> terrain

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
exactly it is but sort of the terrain

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
exactly it is but sort of the terrain
generation<00:00:55.920> if<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.489> will<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.969> that's

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
generation if you will and that's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.599 
generation if you will and that's
because<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:59.329> minecraft<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.690> space<00:01:01.350> now<00:01:02.309> a

I've been working on which is made
entirely<00:02:15.540> from<00:02:15.960> blocks<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.770> I've<00:02:16.890> found

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
entirely from blocks that I've found

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.580 
entirely from blocks that I've found
from<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.460> planet<00:02:17.760> which<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.540> huge<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:19.440> way

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.620 
bigger than the normal star made planets
but<00:02:22.770> everything<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:23.490> I<00:02:23.610> said<00:02:23.670> he's<00:02:24.390> made

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
but everything like I said he's made

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.760 
but everything like I said he's made
from<00:02:24.810> blocks<00:02:24.990> that<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.200> found<00:02:25.380> here<00:02:25.470> except<00:02:25.740> for

don't<00:03:26.130> think<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.310> grab<00:03:26.430> at<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.730> time<00:03:27.769> let's<00:03:28.769> go

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
don't think to grab at the time let's go

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.960 
don't think to grab at the time let's go
ahead<00:03:29.160> down<00:03:29.220> here<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.519> can<00:03:29.640> see<00:03:29.760> there's

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
ahead down here you can see there's

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.050 
ahead down here you can see there's
quite<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.630> fortress<00:03:30.989> down<00:03:31.140> here<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.530> then<00:03:32.060> we

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
quite a fortress down here and then we

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.729 
quite a fortress down here and then we
got<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.300> lit<00:03:33.420> up<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.630> most<00:03:33.810> areas<00:03:33.959> where<00:03:34.230> where

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
got it lit up in most areas where where

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.350 
got it lit up in most areas where where
we<00:03:34.860> already<00:03:35.160> were<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.850> can<00:03:35.970> see<00:03:36.090> over<00:03:36.269> there

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
here is a portal to the end so this is

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.199 
here is a portal to the end so this is
what<00:03:43.019> it<00:03:43.110> looks<00:03:43.230> like<00:03:43.320> in<00:03:43.440> Star<00:03:43.620> made<00:03:44.180> now<00:03:45.180> I

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
what it looks like in Star made now I

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.750 
what it looks like in Star made now I
don't<00:03:45.450> know<00:03:45.690> if<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:46.350> don't<00:03:47.070> know<00:03:47.160> how<00:03:47.310> much<00:03:47.459> time

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
don't know if I don't know how much time

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.910 
don't know if I don't know how much time
Tom<00:03:48.540> spent<00:03:48.840> designating<00:03:49.320> what<00:03:49.470> blocks<00:03:49.709> were

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
Tom spent designating what blocks were

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.410 
Tom spent designating what blocks were
going<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.160> be<00:03:50.250> converted<00:03:50.580> into<00:03:50.700> what<00:03:51.410> but

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
going to be converted into what but

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.400 
going to be converted into what but
whether<00:03:54.420> he<00:03:54.630> did<00:03:54.780> or<00:03:54.959> whether<00:03:55.260> it

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
whether he did or whether it

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.410 
whether he did or whether it
automatically<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.400> makes<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.910> really<00:03:56.940> cool

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
automatically it makes a really cool

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.460 
automatically it makes a really cool
effect

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
effect

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.340 
effect
I<00:03:58.550> mean<00:03:59.550> like<00:03:59.760> you<00:04:00.000> know<00:04:00.030> it's<00:04:00.300> obviously<00:04:01.200> it's

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
I mean like you know it's obviously it's

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.480 
I mean like you know it's obviously it's
not<00:04:01.410> like<00:04:01.590> oh<00:04:01.710> well<00:04:01.920> this<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.070> mossy

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
not like oh well this is mossy

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.910 
not like oh well this is mossy
cobblestone<00:04:02.790> but<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.690> looks<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:04.410> cool<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.800> this

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
cobblestone but it looks so cool in this

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.600 
cobblestone but it looks so cool in this
kind<00:04:05.070> of<00:04:05.100> futuristic<00:04:05.370> setting<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:08.250> then

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
kind of futuristic setting and then

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.130 
kind of futuristic setting and then
there<00:04:08.880> is<00:04:09.150> over<00:04:09.930> here<00:04:10.200> somewhere<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:12.420> library

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
there is over here somewhere the library

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.380 
there is over here somewhere the library
there<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.380> is<00:04:13.730> this<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:14.850> what<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.030> libraries

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
there it is this is what the libraries

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.270 
there it is this is what the libraries
look<00:04:15.600> which<00:04:16.320> is<00:04:16.530> pretty<00:04:16.709> funny<00:04:16.980> because<00:04:17.100> it

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
look which is pretty funny because it

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.699 
look which is pretty funny because it
looks<00:04:17.400> exactly<00:04:17.760> like<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.030> server<00:04:18.329> room<00:04:18.600> so<00:04:19.440> it's

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
looks exactly like a server room so it's

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:20.750 
looks exactly like a server room so it's
kind<00:04:19.920> of<00:04:19.950> this<00:04:20.100> sort<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.370> room<00:04:20.519> deep

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
kind of this sort of room deep

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.600 
kind of this sort of room deep
underground<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.540> all<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.680> cobwebs<00:04:23.400> or

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
underground and all of the cobwebs or

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.550 
underground and all of the cobwebs or
hanging<00:04:23.940> lights<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.420> then<00:04:24.870> all<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:24.990> fence

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
hanging lights and then all the fence

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.740 
hanging lights and then all the fence
posts<00:04:26.010> or<00:04:26.130> cacti<00:04:26.520> because<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:27.000> it's<00:04:27.480> about<00:04:27.690> as

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
posts or cacti because it it's about as

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.600 
posts or cacti because it it's about as
close<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:28.050> it<00:04:28.170> as<00:04:28.290> a<00:04:28.350> look<00:04:28.560> but<00:04:29.340> it's<00:04:29.490> been<00:04:29.580> a

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
close to it as a look but it's been a

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.890 
close to it as a look but it's been a
really<00:04:29.760> cool<00:04:29.970> effect<00:04:30.060> what<00:04:30.390> I<00:04:30.420> think<00:04:30.660> over

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
really cool effect what I think over

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.260 
really cool effect what I think over
here<00:04:31.290> here<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:32.070> is<00:04:32.190> we<00:04:32.940> didn't<00:04:33.090> have<00:04:33.180> any

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
here here it is we didn't have any

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.090 
here here it is we didn't have any
creepers<00:04:33.570> so<00:04:33.870> we<00:04:34.080> decided<00:04:34.350> to<00:04:34.440> spawn<00:04:34.710> in<00:04:34.860> some

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
creepers so we decided to spawn in some

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.950 
creepers so we decided to spawn in some
of<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.250> enemies<00:04:35.550> now<00:04:36.270> these<00:04:36.600> are<00:04:36.720> going<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.870> be

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
of the enemies now these are going to be

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.100 
of the enemies now these are going to be
the<00:04:37.290> enemy<00:04:37.530> aliens<00:04:38.040> that<00:04:38.250> will<00:04:38.400> be<00:04:39.050> having<00:04:40.050> an

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
the enemy aliens that will be having an

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.020 
the enemy aliens that will be having an
attack<00:04:40.320> us<00:04:40.500> presumably<00:04:40.920> sometime<00:04:41.850> in<00:04:41.970> the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
attack us presumably sometime in the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.430 
attack us presumably sometime in the
future<00:04:42.150> now<00:04:42.780> they<00:04:42.870> don't<00:04:42.960> currently<00:04:43.200> do

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
future now they don't currently do

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.680 
future now they don't currently do
anything<00:04:43.800> but<00:04:44.580> eventually<00:04:45.390> they<00:04:45.570> will

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
anything but eventually they will

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.930 
anything but eventually they will
because<00:04:45.990> but<00:04:46.830> right<00:04:47.310> now<00:04:47.430> all<00:04:47.460> you<00:04:47.700> can<00:04:47.820> do<00:04:47.880> is

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
because but right now all you can do is

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.330 
because but right now all you can do is
fond<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.300> but<00:04:48.930> eventually<00:04:49.220> you'll<00:04:50.220> be<00:04:50.280> able

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
fond of it but eventually you'll be able

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.970 
fond of it but eventually you'll be able
to<00:04:50.430> attack<00:04:50.640> them<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.780> know<00:04:51.900> fear<00:04:52.800> them
