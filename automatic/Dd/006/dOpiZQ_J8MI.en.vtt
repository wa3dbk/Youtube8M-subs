last<00:00:00.539> week<00:00:00.840> in<00:00:01.110> that<00:00:01.860> video<00:00:02.100> there<00:00:02.520> we<00:00:03.120> took

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
last week in that video there we took

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.599 
last week in that video there we took
you<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.629> tarantula<00:00:04.470> nebula<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:05.069> showed

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
you to the tarantula nebula and showed

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.280 
you to the tarantula nebula and showed
you<00:00:05.730> its<00:00:05.879> core<00:00:06.240> filled<00:00:06.839> with<00:00:06.960> some<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.230> the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
you its core filled with some of the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.669 
you its core filled with some of the
most<00:00:07.410> massive<00:00:07.980> stars<00:00:08.309> in<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.610> universe

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
most massive stars in the universe

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.509 
most massive stars in the universe
unfortunately<00:00:10.679> because<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.950> time<00:00:11.280> we

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
unfortunately because of time we

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.850 
unfortunately because of time we
actually<00:00:11.820> left<00:00:12.120> part<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> story<00:00:12.960> out<00:00:13.200> but

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
actually left part of the story out but

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.470 
actually left part of the story out but
today<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.400> want<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.580> take<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.910> back<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.179> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
today we want to take you back to the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.689 
today we want to take you back to the
tarantula<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.230> tell<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.890> amazing<00:00:17.130> story

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
tarantula and tell you the amazing story

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.800 
tarantula and tell you the amazing story
of<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.510> runaway<00:00:18.869> star<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> work<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.510> massive

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
of a runaway star so I work on massive

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.630 
of a runaway star so I work on massive
stars<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.590> fact<00:00:22.800> I'm<00:00:22.920> now<00:00:23.010> part<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.460> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
stars and in fact I'm now part of a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.370 
stars and in fact I'm now part of a
collaboration<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.660> we're<00:00:24.810> now<00:00:24.900> looking<00:00:25.109> at

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
collaboration that we're now looking at

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.099 
collaboration that we're now looking at
a<00:00:25.760> thousand<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.000> brightest<00:00:27.449> stars<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
a thousand of the brightest stars in the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.750 
a thousand of the brightest stars in the
tarantula<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.010> we've<00:00:29.310> basically<00:00:29.429> been

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
tarantula and we've basically been

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.880 
tarantula and we've basically been
observing<00:00:30.150> them<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.720> VLT<00:00:30.990> telescope<00:00:31.769> in

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
observing them with the VLT telescope in

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.560 
observing them with the VLT telescope in
Chile<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.340> we've<00:00:32.759> been<00:00:32.910> trying<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.210> work<00:00:33.329> out

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
Chile and we've been trying to work out

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.299 
Chile and we've been trying to work out
how<00:00:33.930> old<00:00:33.960> they<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.770> how<00:00:34.860> big<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.280> are

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
how old they are and how big they are

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.130 
how old they are and how big they are
and<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.059> trying<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.630> come<00:00:36.780> piece<00:00:36.960> together

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and and trying to come piece together

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.290 
and and trying to come piece together
the<00:00:37.500> dynamics<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.460> region<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.000> know<00:00:39.059> for

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the dynamics of this region you know for

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.450 
the dynamics of this region you know for
example<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.840> star<00:00:40.170> which<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.800> kind<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.250> very

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
example one star which is kind of very

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.389 
example one star which is kind of very
peripheral<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:43.050> tarantula<00:00:43.469> nebula<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
peripheral in the tarantula nebula and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.830 
peripheral in the tarantula nebula and
it's<00:00:44.789> kind<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> why<00:00:45.180> how'd<00:00:45.390> they<00:00:45.510> get<00:00:45.629> there

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
it's kind of why how'd they get there

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.209 
it's kind of why how'd they get there
and<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.260> turns<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.770> think<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.129> actually

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
and it turns out we think it's actually

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.850 
and it turns out we think it's actually
it<00:00:47.969> was<00:00:48.090> born<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.600> central<00:00:48.930> cluster<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.590> was

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
it was born in a central cluster and was

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.970 
it was born in a central cluster and was
kicked<00:00:50.070> out<00:00:50.219> at<00:00:50.969> Birth<00:00:51.180> basically<00:00:51.930> by<00:00:52.500> by<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
kicked out at Birth basically by by the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.010 
kicked out at Birth basically by by the
big<00:00:53.250> boys<00:00:53.399> big<00:00:54.000> even<00:00:54.270> bigger<00:00:54.420> boys<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
big boys big even bigger boys in the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.869 
big boys big even bigger boys in the
club<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:55.680> kicked<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:55.980> out<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.430> now<00:00:56.579> off

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
club they kicked it out and it's now off

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.540 
club they kicked it out and it's now off
one<00:00:57.300> side<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> wide<00:00:58.739> field<00:00:59.070> view

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
one side so this is a wide field view

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.119 
one side so this is a wide field view
with<00:01:00.199> combination<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.379> telescopes<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.100> Chile

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
with combination of telescopes in Chile

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.310 
with combination of telescopes in Chile
and<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> Hubble<00:01:02.969> telescope<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
and the Hubble telescope of the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.600 
and the Hubble telescope of the
tarantula<00:01:04.769> nebula<00:01:04.949> which<00:01:05.159> kind<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.369> gives<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
tarantula nebula which kind of gives you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.219 
tarantula nebula which kind of gives you
a<00:01:05.640> feel<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:06.060> why<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.330> got<00:01:06.479> its<00:01:06.600> name<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.110> this

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
a feel for why it's got its name so this

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.469 
a feel for why it's got its name so this
is<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> main<00:01:07.650> region<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> tarantula<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
is a main region of a tarantula the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.630 
is a main region of a tarantula the
central<00:01:09.900> cluster<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.439> over<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.520> one

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
central cluster is over here and the one

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.219 
central cluster is over here and the one
that<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:11.909> think<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.180> kicked<00:01:12.390> out<00:01:12.570> from<00:01:13.020> our

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
that we think was kicked out from our

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.870 
that we think was kicked out from our
survey<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.830> stars<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:14.250> around<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.670> region

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
survey of stars all around this region

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300 
survey of stars all around this region
was<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.869> little<00:01:16.049> blue<00:01:16.290> thing<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.189> this

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
was this little blue thing here so this

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.520 
was this little blue thing here so this
one<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.759> an<00:01:17.880> 80<00:01:18.150> Salama<00:01:18.750> star<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
one is like an 80 Salama star it's a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.740 
one is like an 80 Salama star it's a
real<00:01:19.710> monster<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.390> was<00:01:21.509> kicked

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
real monster but we think it was kicked

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.530 
real monster but we think it was kicked
out<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.890> region<00:01:23.369> about<00:01:23.820> two<00:01:24.270> million

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
out of this region about two million

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
out of this region about two million
years<00:01:24.600> ago<00:01:24.840> when<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.320> cluster<00:01:25.770> was<00:01:25.860> forming

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
years ago when this cluster was forming

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.310 
years ago when this cluster was forming
and<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:26.970> think<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.330> now<00:01:27.479> gone<00:01:27.720> around<00:01:27.960> about

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
and we think it's now gone around about

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.310 
and we think it's now gone around about
300<00:01:28.710> light<00:01:29.430> years<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.810> cupola<00:01:31.049> million

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
300 light years in the cupola million

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.600 
300 light years in the cupola million
years<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.860> gonna<00:01:31.950> keep<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.490> way

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
years and it's gonna keep going that way

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.920 
years and it's gonna keep going that way
we<00:01:32.790> think<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.180> then<00:01:33.479> probably<00:01:33.600> close

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
we think and then probably close

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.080 
we think and then probably close
supernova<00:01:34.500> sometime<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> next<00:01:35.430> million

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
supernova sometime the next million

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.080 
supernova sometime the next million
years<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:40.009> well<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.700> what<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.880> call<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
years or so well it's what we call a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.880 
years or so well it's what we call a
runaway<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.350> either<00:01:43.439> get<00:01:43.649> two

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
runaway and so you can either get two

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.830 
runaway and so you can either get two
types<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.220> runaway<00:01:44.520> star<00:01:44.790> ones<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.750> are

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
types of runaway star ones that are

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.420 
types of runaway star ones that are
kicked<00:01:46.049> out<00:01:46.229> from<00:01:46.619> when<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.009> stars<00:01:47.280> are

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
kicked out from when the stars are

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.249 
kicked out from when the stars are
forming<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.000> basically<00:01:48.390> hey<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.720> maybe<00:01:48.960> at

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
forming and basically hey if maybe at

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.109 
forming and basically hey if maybe at
the<00:01:49.439> binary<00:01:49.799> system<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.490> pair<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.790> stars

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the binary system with a pair of stars

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.149 
the binary system with a pair of stars
and<00:01:51.450> ever<00:01:51.930> star<00:01:52.140> comes<00:01:52.380> along<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> kind<00:01:53.040> of

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and ever star comes along and it kind of

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.830 
and ever star comes along and it kind of
kind<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.880> dance<00:01:54.090> around<00:01:54.270> each<00:01:54.450> other<00:01:54.659> for<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
kind of dance around each other for a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.719 
kind of dance around each other for a
while<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.829> Dias<00:01:56.040> one<00:01:56.250> gets<00:01:56.520> kicked

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
while but the we Dias one gets kicked

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.550 
while but the we Dias one gets kicked
out<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.450> other<00:01:57.570> way<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.869> getting<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.290> star

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
out the other way of getting a star

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.100 
out the other way of getting a star
moving<00:01:59.219> at<00:01:59.399> high<00:01:59.520> velocity<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.899> bit

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
moving at high velocity is if it's a bit

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.840 
moving at high velocity is if it's a bit
again<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:01.799> it's<00:02:01.979> born<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.579> binary

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
again it's if it's born in a binary

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.969 
again it's if it's born in a binary
system<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> companion<00:02:03.840> if<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> companion

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
system with a companion if the companion

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.320 
system with a companion if the companion
goes<00:02:05.130> back<00:02:05.369> super

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
goes back super

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.870 
goes back super
it<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.900> get<00:02:07.020> kind<00:02:07.230> of<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.380> shock<00:02:07.800> a<00:02:07.830> recoil<00:02:08.310> from

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
it can get kind of a shock a recoil from

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.910 
it can get kind of a shock a recoil from
that<00:02:09.060> explosion<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.780> then<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.200> shot<00:02:10.350> off<00:02:10.530> too

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
that explosion and then be shot off too

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.790 
that explosion and then be shot off too
later<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.430> there's<00:02:12.270> all<00:02:12.420> these<00:02:12.600> cool<00:02:13.260> kinds<00:02:13.710> of

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
later on there's all these cool kinds of

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.740 
later on there's all these cool kinds of
stars<00:02:14.100> I've<00:02:14.520> never<00:02:14.790> even<00:02:14.880> heard<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.360> runaway

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
stars I've never even heard of runaway

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.070 
stars I've never even heard of runaway
stars<00:02:16.080> yeah<00:02:16.820> yeah<00:02:17.820> yeah<00:02:18.030> it's<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.390> Sun<00:02:18.660> one<00:02:19.050> of

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
stars yeah yeah yeah it's the Sun one of

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.110 
stars yeah yeah yeah it's the Sun one of
these<00:02:19.320> cool<00:02:19.590> stars<00:02:19.860> were<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.400> boring<00:02:20.580> no

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
these cool stars were we that boring no

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.340 
these cool stars were we that boring no
it's<00:02:21.330> pretty<00:02:21.510> boring<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.020> good<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.260> us

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
it's pretty boring but it's good for us

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.470 
it's pretty boring but it's good for us
most<00:02:22.950> likely<00:02:23.070> these<00:02:23.520> things<00:02:23.820> because<00:02:24.270> they

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
most likely these things because they

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.500 
most likely these things because they
are<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.440> big<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.730> radiation<00:02:27.120> from<00:02:27.390> them

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
are so big and the radiation from them

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.480 
are so big and the radiation from them
so<00:02:27.690> kind<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.960> crazy<00:02:28.110> they've<00:02:29.010> kind<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.250> died

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
so kind of crazy they've kind of died

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.340 
so kind of crazy they've kind of died
before<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.600> know<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.840> could<00:02:30.960> even<00:02:31.080> get

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
before you know you could even get

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.750 
before you know you could even get
planets<00:02:31.680> forming<00:02:31.950> even<00:02:32.190> if<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.340> planets<00:02:32.610> were

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
planets forming even if the planets were

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.640 
planets forming even if the planets were
to<00:02:32.910> form<00:02:33.150> but<00:02:33.360> most<00:02:33.630> likely<00:02:33.960> these<00:02:34.260> are<00:02:34.410> these

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
to form but most likely these are these

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.240 
to form but most likely these are these
big<00:02:35.010> stars<00:02:35.280> probably<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.790> our<00:02:35.910> planets
