00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.140 
he's got a really muscular looking but
this<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.560> super<00:02:19.860> stiff<00:02:20.400> still<00:02:20.700> his<00:02:20.879> knees<00:02:21.120> are

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
this is super stiff still his knees are

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.720 
this is super stiff still his knees are
so<00:02:21.720> stiff<00:02:22.379> tail<00:02:22.620> because<00:02:22.800> i<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:23.280> opened<00:02:23.459> them

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
so stiff tail because i just opened them

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.920 
so stiff tail because i just opened them
up<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:26.190> he<00:02:26.370> doesn't<00:02:26.640> have<00:02:26.760> any<00:02:26.970> footer<00:02:27.480> to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
up and he doesn't have any footer to

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.350 
up and he doesn't have any footer to
work

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
work

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.890 
work
anything<00:02:28.810> like<00:02:28.960> that<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:31.540> that's<00:02:31.720> pretty

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
anything like that and that's pretty

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.660 
anything like that and that's pretty
much<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.200> i<00:02:32.530> mean<00:02:32.680> he<00:02:32.860> is<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.070> DC<00:02:33.370> figure

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
much it i mean he is the DC figure

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.910 
much it i mean he is the DC figure
doesn't<00:02:33.910> have<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.990> much<00:02:35.170> articulation<00:02:35.470> and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
doesn't have that much articulation and

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.860 
doesn't have that much articulation and
you<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.160> see<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.520> this<00:02:37.270> brings<00:02:37.450> me<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.690> the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
you can see so this brings me to the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.570 
you can see so this brings me to the
next<00:02:37.900> point<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> wings<00:02:38.800> this<00:02:39.400> just

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
next point is that the wings this just

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.880 
next point is that the wings this just
came<00:02:39.790> off<00:02:40.030> like<00:02:40.630> it's<00:02:41.050> really<00:02:41.410> cool<00:02:41.560> how<00:02:41.620> they

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
came off like it's really cool how they

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.220 
came off like it's really cool how they
made<00:02:42.100> these<00:02:42.280> because<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:43.660> can<00:02:43.810> see<00:02:43.960> there's<00:02:44.170> a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
made these because you can see there's a

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.780 
made these because you can see there's a
dream<00:02:44.410> right<00:02:44.560> here<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.040> can<00:02:45.640> actually

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
dream right here and you can actually

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.880 
dream right here and you can actually
pose<00:02:46.210> them<00:02:46.420> but<00:02:46.630> this<00:02:46.930> thing<00:02:47.200> kind<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.650> sucks

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
pose them but this thing kind of sucks

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.030 
pose them but this thing kind of sucks
because<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:49.600> was<00:02:49.780> really<00:02:50.110> hard<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.350> get<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.740> and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
because it was really hard to get in and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.830 
because it was really hard to get in and
then<00:02:51.700> once<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.030> put<00:02:52.210> it<00:02:52.300> in<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.480> think<00:02:52.690> that's

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
then once you put it in you think that's

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.630 
then once you put it in you think that's
just<00:02:53.020> going<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.260> move<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.770> doesn't<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.370> I

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
just going to move and it doesn't and I

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.490 
just going to move and it doesn't and I
started<00:02:55.300> moving<00:02:55.630> this<00:02:55.810> one<00:02:56.020> you<00:02:56.140> know<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.290> make

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
started moving this one you know to make

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.650 
started moving this one you know to make
them<00:02:56.650> more<00:02:56.680> outward<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.550> started<00:02:58.209> moving<00:02:58.480> this

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
them more outward I started moving this

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.020 
them more outward I started moving this
one<00:02:58.900> right<00:02:59.020> here<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.590> it<00:03:00.430> literally<00:03:00.760> like

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
one right here and it literally like

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.270 
one right here and it literally like
cracked<00:03:01.450> right<00:03:01.720> in<00:03:01.870> here<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.380> I've<00:03:03.070> heard

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
cracked right in here and I've heard

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.860 
cracked right in here and I've heard
like<00:03:03.430> another<00:03:03.640> reviewer<00:03:03.880> on<00:03:04.150> YouTube<00:03:04.630> said

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
like another reviewer on YouTube said

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.180 
like another reviewer on YouTube said
the<00:03:04.990> same<00:03:05.170> thing<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.709> happened<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.070> him

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
the same thing that that happened to him

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.910 
the same thing that that happened to him
too<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:07.180> obviously<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:07.900> not<00:03:07.959> just<00:03:08.290> me<00:03:08.440> but<00:03:08.470> it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
too so obviously it's not just me but it

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.620 
too so obviously it's not just me but it
should<00:03:09.220> just<00:03:09.370> come<00:03:09.640> out<00:03:09.790> nice<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.120> like<00:03:10.450> that

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
should just come out nice and like that

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.870 
should just come out nice and like that
but<00:03:10.930> see<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:12.040> can<00:03:12.190> see<00:03:12.370> it's<00:03:12.489> still<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.760> little

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
but see you can see it's still a little

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.070 
but see you can see it's still a little
bit<00:03:13.060> hindered<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.570> if<00:03:13.630> they<00:03:13.780> should<00:03:13.989> be

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
bit hindered and if they should be

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.990 
bit hindered and if they should be
coming<00:03:14.200> out<00:03:14.470> more<00:03:14.739> so<00:03:15.400> that's<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.670> only<00:03:15.730> thing

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
coming out more so that's the only thing

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.660 
coming out more so that's the only thing
that<00:03:16.150> sucks<00:03:16.450> about<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.840> wings<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.459> just

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
that sucks about the wings and it just

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.800 
that sucks about the wings and it just
ah<00:03:19.770> it's<00:03:20.770> just<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:21.130> try<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:21.970> pop<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.420> in<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.570> it

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
ah it's just I try to pop it in and it

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.780 
ah it's just I try to pop it in and it
just<00:03:22.959> really<00:03:23.140> I<00:03:23.590> don't<00:03:24.040> know<00:03:24.100> mine<00:03:24.340> still<00:03:24.580> new

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
lot but the way the wing looks though is

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.680 
lot but the way the wing looks though is
