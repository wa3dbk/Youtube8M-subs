plasma grenades that when you respond
you<00:04:41.910> spawn<00:04:42.120> war<00:04:42.390> so<00:04:42.540> they<00:04:42.570> kill<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:42.960> like<00:04:43.080> 20

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
you spawn war so they kill it like 20

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.360 
you spawn war so they kill it like 20
times<00:04:43.590> then<00:04:44.310> they<00:04:44.430> Park<00:04:44.790> a<00:04:46.040> warthog<00:04:47.040> on<00:04:47.250> these

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
times then they Park a warthog on these

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.850 
times then they Park a warthog on these
piles<00:04:47.669> of<00:04:47.940> grenades<00:04:48.270> then<00:04:48.930> throw<00:04:49.260> one<00:04:49.500> grenade

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
piles of grenades then throw one grenade

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.500 
piles of grenades then throw one grenade
at<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.310> pile<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.640> grenades<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.330> thing

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
at the pile of grenades and the thing

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.240 
at the pile of grenades and the thing
will<00:04:51.630> go<00:04:51.780> plucking<00:04:52.110> back<00:04:52.590> flipping<00:04:52.979> through

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
will go plucking back flipping through

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.440 
will go plucking back flipping through
the<00:04:53.370> air<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:53.669> they<00:04:53.760> would<00:04:53.880> time<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.300> perfectly

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
the air and they would time it perfectly

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.409 
the air and they would time it perfectly
so<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.110> would<00:04:55.200> hit<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:56.070> beacon<00:04:56.610> as<00:04:56.790> it<00:04:57.270> like

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
so it would hit the beacon as it like

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.600 
so it would hit the beacon as it like
shoots<00:04:57.690> in<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.900> air<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.500> Warthog<00:04:58.919> just
