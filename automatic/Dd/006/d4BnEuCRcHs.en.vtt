and start landing punches that's what

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.420 
and start landing punches that's what
that's<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.170> think<00:01:10.470> what<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.369> in

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
that's what I think what was going on in

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.850 
that's what I think what was going on in
the<00:01:11.760> first<00:01:12.150> fight<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> mean<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:13.439> one<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the first fight I mean that's one of the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.190 
the first fight I mean that's one of the
reasons<00:01:14.130> why<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.640> coverage<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.869> able<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
reasons why your coverage was able to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.950 
reasons why your coverage was able to
land<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.470> good<00:01:16.619> shot<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.659> last

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
land a good shot and that that last

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.080 
land a good shot and that that last
round<00:01:19.229> when<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> ref<00:01:19.799> stopped<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> fight<00:01:20.520> but

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
round when the ref stopped the fight but

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.020 
round when the ref stopped the fight but
it<00:01:21.450> was<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> BS<00:01:21.960> stoppage<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.650> mean<00:01:23.030> George
