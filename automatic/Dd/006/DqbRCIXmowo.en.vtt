00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.349
 well hello everyone again and we're going to 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.790
 make a video of these specials 

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:08.260
 enlargement of the guide that is very short 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.490
 what is the minigame of jumping to the 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.410
 camber 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.389
 We can do it at various times of the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.799
 game and in the CD4 we do what we can 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.230
 do all the times we want 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.080
 as long as we get to live in the 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.630
 group is jumping rope and 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.650
 that nothing this is a pretty minigame 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.349
 simple in operation but complicated 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.720
 because it has a complication so 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.750
 nothing let's see how it skips we have 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.390
 to talk to these girls 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.760
 and will go live and jump and this will 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.480
 consists is that we have to click on the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.489
 X every time he lives touch the ground 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.840
 it's worth living as soon as again 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.960
 floor with the feet is not that back to 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.110
 jump like this is worth now as soon as 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.000
 we hear or as soon as he makes contact 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.660
 with him only lives we press again to 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.519
 press each time it will go faster and each 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.420
 time will be more complicated and when 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.909
 we reached a certain number of jumps 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.799
 they give us an award another let him 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.830
 on the screen what the prize consists of 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.710
 when they reach 1,000 they give us the prize of 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.320
 champion of the rope that is simply 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.450
 an important object that 's for the 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.789
 geeks for whoever wants to get all 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.070
 the objects but good now I'll fall 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.990
 because with the command I'm doing very badly 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.810
 I'm doing better with the emulator 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.390
 it takes some delay the command goes better 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.729
 do it with the keyboard in emulator 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.000
 and nothing you have already seen what is that 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.140
 it's a very big nonsense but good is 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.140
 a mini game with which you can 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.600
 get letters are mostly letters 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.540
 the prizes and I will leave you on the screen 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.340
 what is said can come in 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.740
 several moments of the game and at the end in 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.430
 the disc 4 putting on vivienne the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.180
 group you can come and I'll leave you too 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.900
 both the prizes and the speed 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.630
 of the jumps in each in each stage of 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.020
 speed because it starts slow and goes 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.479
 increasing speed and sometimes in the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.429
 final table I think alternating is worth it 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.940
 which is a bit more complicated besides 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.590
 because it is changing the speed and had 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.540
 a little bit because if it was all the time to 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.780
 the same speed could choose the 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.610
 tempo and it would be easier but do not you 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.430
 they complicate and they do it sometimes more 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.590
 fast be slower and that's because 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.610
 that plays the balls a little bit not so 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.060
 nothing 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.130
 I leave that list and I hope that we 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.950
 overwhelm a lot with this video game 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.950
 I greet everyone and see another video bye bye
