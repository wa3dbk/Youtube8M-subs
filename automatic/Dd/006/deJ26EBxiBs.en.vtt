00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
over a and even though it looked really

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.229 
over a and even though it looked really
cool<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.270> really<00:01:00.870> didn't<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:02.640> corals<00:01:03.059> of

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239

cool I really didn't like the corals of
course<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.660> went<00:01:03.930> into<00:01:04.710> some<00:01:05.070> shock

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
course they went into some shock

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.270 
course they went into some shock
initially<00:01:06.049> but<00:01:07.049> they<00:01:07.320> didn't<00:01:07.680> really<00:01:07.979> seem

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
initially but they didn't really seem

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.440 
initially but they didn't really seem
like<00:01:08.310> they<00:01:08.670> were<00:01:08.729> liking<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.740> bluish<00:01:10.740> purple

like they were liking that bluish purple
light<00:01:12.450> really<00:01:12.810> looked<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.409> needed

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
light really looked like they needed

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.950

over<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.209> pc<00:03:20.800> was<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:23.360> appears<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.140> be<00:03:24.320> the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
over the pc was it appears to be the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.440 
over the pc was it appears to be the
same<00:03:24.709> amount<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.430> light<00:03:25.670> if<00:03:25.850> not<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.120> little<00:03:26.330> bit

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450

more<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.140> it<00:03:28.010> runs<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.490> lot<00:03:28.640> cooler<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.300> I'm

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
more and it runs a lot cooler and I'm

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.070 
more and it runs a lot cooler and I'm
going<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.709> cycle<00:03:30.709> through<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.459> different

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
does a good job like I say but first for

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.080 
does a good job like I say but first for
growth<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:26.620> am<00:04:27.620> convinced<00:04:28.100> that<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.520> needs<00:04:28.760> the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.180 

10k<00:04:32.090> white<00:04:35.620> let's<00:04:36.620> pull<00:04:36.889> them<00:04:36.979> all<00:04:37.039> together

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
10k white let's pull them all together

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.920 
10k white let's pull them all together
and<00:04:37.490> that's<00:04:37.729> what<00:04:37.880> you<00:04:38.030> got<00:04:38.210> I'll<00:04:38.389> open<00:04:38.630> up<00:04:38.750> the

another pro about the aquatic life is
that<00:04:55.319> had<00:04:55.530> one<00:04:55.800> chord<00:04:56.220> so<00:04:57.090> where<00:04:57.419> my<00:04:58.050> other

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
that had one chord so where my other

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:03.379 
that had one chord so where my other
fixtures<00:04:59.150> were<00:05:00.150> taking<00:05:00.599> up<00:05:01.759> three<00:05:02.759> outlets<00:05:03.120> on

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389

fixtures were taking up three outlets on
my<00:05:04.819> controller<00:05:06.440> this<00:05:07.440> one<00:05:07.620> only<00:05:07.770> takes<00:05:08.130> one<00:05:09.380> so

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
my controller this one only takes one so

freeing up two outlets on a controller

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:19.820 
freeing up two outlets on a controller
is<00:05:12.889> pretty<00:05:13.889> big<00:05:14.069> deal<00:05:18.199> so<00:05:19.199> anyway<00:05:19.500> that's<00:05:19.650> what
