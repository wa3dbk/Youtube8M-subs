Motorcycle Hall or anything like that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.170 
Motorcycle Hall or anything like that
and<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.070> notice<00:00:23.340> when<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.609> put<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> item

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and you notice when you put the item

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.300 
and you notice when you put the item
into<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.480> receiver<00:00:24.779> end<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> car<00:00:25.560> there's

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
into the receiver end on the car there's

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.890 
into the receiver end on the car there's
a<00:00:26.369> lot<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.609> play<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> rocks<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.570> back<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
a lot of play and it rocks it back and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.140 
a lot of play and it rocks it back and
forth<00:00:28.140> well<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.890> eliminates<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
forth well this eliminates that and the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.600 
forth well this eliminates that and the
pieces<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.510> make<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.960> up<00:00:31.340> obviously<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> end

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
pieces that make it up obviously the end

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.569 
pieces that make it up obviously the end
which<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> lot<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.460> one<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.489> those

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
which is a lot it's just one of those

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.819 
which is a lot it's just one of those
this<00:00:36.390> particular<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.290> actually<00:00:37.380> made<00:00:37.710> by

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
this particular one is actually made by

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.990 
this particular one is actually made by
Coleman<00:00:38.340> they<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.579> several<00:00:38.879> different

Coleman they have several different
manufacturers<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.739> run<00:00:40.890> about<00:00:41.040> 25

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
manufacturers and if you run about 25

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
manufacturers and if you run about 25
bucks<00:00:41.670> by<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:41.969> way<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.360> mean<00:00:42.870> you've<00:00:42.989> got<00:00:43.110> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
bucks by the way I mean you've got this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.229 
bucks by the way I mean you've got this
sleeve<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.550> then<00:00:44.670> you've<00:00:44.760> got<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.000> piece

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
sleeve and then you've got this piece

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.880 
sleeve and then you've got this piece
with<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> spring<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.370> simply<00:00:48.770> loosen<00:00:49.770> that

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
with the spring on it simply loosen that

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.069 
with the spring on it simply loosen that
up<00:00:52.640> see<00:00:53.640> that's<00:00:53.820> threaded<00:00:54.149> there's<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.840> spring

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
up see that's threaded there's a spring

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.470 
up see that's threaded there's a spring
on<00:00:55.170> one<00:00:55.320> side<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.309> actually<00:00:56.850> gonna<00:00:56.969> look

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
on one side this is actually gonna look

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.060 
on one side this is actually gonna look
like<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.870> nut<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.140> one<00:00:58.379> side<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.739> does<00:00:58.859> come<00:00:59.039> with

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
like a nut on one side it does come with

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.880 
like a nut on one side it does come with
a<00:00:59.250> wrench<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.730> misplace<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.750> wrench<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.710> those

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
a wrench I misplace the wrench so those

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.160 
a wrench I misplace the wrench so those
are<00:01:01.920> essentially<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> parts<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.329> i'll

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
are essentially the parts of it and i'll

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.509 
are essentially the parts of it and i'll
show<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.439> how<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.769> works<00:01:04.920> we'll<00:01:05.189> be<00:01:05.339> right

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
show you how it works we'll be right

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.740 
show you how it works we'll be right
back<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.970> i'll<00:01:06.360> give<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.570> an<00:01:06.659> example<00:01:06.689> feijen

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
back and i'll give you an example feijen

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.359 
back and i'll give you an example feijen
okay<00:01:09.750> first<00:01:10.560> thing<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.770> want<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.189> this

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
okay first thing you want to do is this

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.190 
okay first thing you want to do is this
piece<00:01:11.640> actually<00:01:11.880> does<00:01:12.240> not<00:01:12.390> go<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:13.049> it

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
piece actually does not go in here it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.590 
piece actually does not go in here it
actually<00:01:13.770> goes<00:01:14.100> into<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.520> tube<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:15.090> whatever

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
actually goes into the tube of whatever

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.910 
actually goes into the tube of whatever
you're<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.110> connected<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.710> your

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
you're going to be connected to your

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.219 
you're going to be connected to your
receiver<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.509> would<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.689> squeeze<00:01:19.200> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
receiver and you would just squeeze it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.530 
receiver and you would just squeeze it
in<00:01:19.439> there<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.770> line<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.369> at<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> holes<00:01:20.790> but

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
in there and line it up at the holes but

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.060 
in there and line it up at the holes but
for<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.900> demonstration<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:22.860> going<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
for this demonstration I'm not going to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.200 
for this demonstration I'm not going to
put<00:01:23.189> anything<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.180> see

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
put anything in here so you can see

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270 
put anything in here so you can see
actually<00:01:24.479> how<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> works<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.770> again<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.100> goes

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
actually how it works so again this goes

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760 
actually how it works so again this goes
on<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> other<00:01:26.729> end<00:01:27.439> it<00:01:28.439> would<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
on the other end it would go on the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.770 
on the other end it would go on the
inside<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.909> slide<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
inside and you slide that in and you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.960 
inside and you slide that in and you
line<00:01:30.960> up<00:01:30.990> your<00:01:31.140> hole<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.650> assuming<00:01:32.100> we've<00:01:32.759> got

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
line up your hole so assuming we've got

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.100 
line up your hole so assuming we've got
that<00:01:33.450> piece<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.430> which<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.579> don't<00:01:36.110> we're

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
that piece in here which we don't we're

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.399 
that piece in here which we don't we're
going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> line<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:39.810> notice<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.170> side

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
going to line it up you notice one side

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.740 
going to line it up you notice one side
goes<00:01:40.650> towards<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.479> want<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.689> do

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
goes towards there what you want to do

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.670 
goes towards there what you want to do
is<00:01:42.869> start<00:01:43.439> threading<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.829> pin

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.340 

we're<00:01:48.340> just<00:01:48.430> one<00:01:48.580> was<00:01:48.670> started<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:50.110> other

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
we're just one was started in this other

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.570 
we're just one was started in this other
end<00:01:50.910> get<00:01:51.910> you<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.090> shot<00:01:52.300> over<00:01:52.450> here<00:01:53.460> see<00:01:54.460> how

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
end get you a shot over here see how

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.040 
end get you a shot over here see how
it's<00:01:54.730> already<00:01:54.970> started<00:01:55.300> over<00:01:55.450> here<00:01:55.630> this<00:01:55.930> is

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
it's already started over here this is

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.320 
it's already started over here this is
where<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.290> put<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.590> sleeve<00:01:56.920> sleeve<00:01:57.910> goes<00:01:58.120> in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
where you put the sleeve sleeve goes in

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.210 
where you put the sleeve sleeve goes in
there<00:02:03.270> tighten<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.330> down<00:02:04.830> I'm<00:02:05.830> not<00:02:06.010> going<00:02:06.160> to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
there tighten it down I'm not going to

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.380 
there tighten it down I'm not going to
tighten<00:02:06.520> it<00:02:06.580> down<00:02:06.610> a<00:02:06.729> little<00:02:06.880> tighter<00:02:07.150> you'd

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
tighten it down a little tighter you'd

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.940 
tighten it down a little tighter you'd
like<00:02:07.570> that<00:02:07.750> push<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.050> sleep<00:02:08.380> back<00:02:08.590> through

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
like that push the sleep back through

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.720 
like that push the sleep back through
and<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:10.030> see<00:02:10.330> is<00:02:10.840> hardly<00:02:11.110> any<00:02:11.320> rock<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:12.490> that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
and you see is hardly any rock to that

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.170 
and you see is hardly any rock to that
and<00:02:13.000> then<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.240> simply<00:02:13.450> would<00:02:13.810> put<00:02:13.990> your<00:02:15.180> lock

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and then you simply would put your lock

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.670 
and then you simply would put your lock
on<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.510> other<00:02:16.630> end<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.580> oh<00:02:19.500> it's<00:02:20.500> already

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
on the other end and oh it's already

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.930 
on the other end and oh it's already
locked<00:02:20.920> actually<00:02:22.380> see<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.500> inside<00:02:23.860> here<00:02:24.280> how

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
locked actually see the inside here how

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.300 
locked actually see the inside here how
way<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.150> can<00:02:25.390> see<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:26.850> on<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:27.970> other<00:02:28.090> side

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
way you can see that on the other side

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.070 
way you can see that on the other side
that's<00:02:30.310> essentially<00:02:30.820> how<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.000> works<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.450> what

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
that's essentially how it works and what

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.260 
that's essentially how it works and what
that<00:02:32.230> does<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.680> sleeve<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:34.030> we<00:02:34.150> just

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
that does is that sleeve that we just

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.570 
that does is that sleeve that we just
put<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.510> in<00:02:34.540> there<00:02:34.600> is<00:02:35.160> perfect<00:02:36.160> size<00:02:36.310> for<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
put it in there is perfect size for the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.520 
put it in there is perfect size for the
hole<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.810> threaded<00:02:38.140> into<00:02:38.320> that

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
hole and this is threaded into that

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.650 
hole and this is threaded into that
section<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:39.250> allows<00:02:39.459> hardly<00:02:40.030> any<00:02:40.180> rocket

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
section so it allows hardly any rocket

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.420 
section so it allows hardly any rocket
at<00:02:40.750> any<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.170> that's<00:02:41.860> essentially<00:02:42.250> how<00:02:42.340> it

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
at any of it that's essentially how it

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.560 
at any of it that's essentially how it
works<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.120> if<00:02:43.540> you've<00:02:43.720> got<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.870> hitch<00:02:45.570> anything

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
works so if you've got a hitch anything

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.420 
works so if you've got a hitch anything
like<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:46.800> highly<00:02:47.800> recommend<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.340> especially

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
like that highly recommend it especially

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.030 
like that highly recommend it especially
if<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.820> need<00:02:48.880> one<00:02:49.000> with<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.330> lot<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:50.290> covers

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
if you need one with a lot this covers

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.370 
if you need one with a lot this covers
two<00:02:51.370> things<00:02:51.640> i<00:02:51.940> would<00:02:52.600> recommend<00:02:53.260> them

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
two things i would recommend them

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.840 
two things i would recommend them
because<00:02:53.560> they're<00:02:53.709> usually<00:02:53.830> about<00:02:54.100> 17<00:02:54.610> bucks

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
because they're usually about 17 bucks

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.550 
because they're usually about 17 bucks
just<00:02:55.090> with<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.330> lock<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:55.870> why<00:02:56.170> not<00:02:56.320> the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
just with the lock so why not the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.890 
just with the lock so why not the
threaded<00:02:56.860> piece<00:02:57.040> they<00:02:57.970> do<00:02:58.030> have<00:02:58.330> them<00:02:58.480> for<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
threaded piece they do have them for the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.500 
threaded piece they do have them for the
smaller<00:02:59.890> hitches<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.790> one<00:03:00.910> in<00:03:01.000> two<00:03:01.090> receivers

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
smaller hitches the one in two receivers

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.150 
smaller hitches the one in two receivers
they<00:03:01.630> do<00:03:01.690> have<00:03:01.930> those<00:03:02.080> as<00:03:02.230> well<00:03:02.380> this<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.130> a

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
they do have those as well this is a

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.240 
they do have those as well this is a
2-inch<00:03:03.370> so<00:03:04.140> anyway<00:03:05.140> that's<00:03:05.470> really<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:06.220> just

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
2-inch so anyway that's really it just

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.850
