00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.020
 there we are again we have the yellow arsi 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.390
 back with us 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.160
 He recovered again after a crash of the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.110
 last time 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.189
 today we go nice or big 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.400
 pesce 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.009
 look how this should be yes that's that 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.379
 scale 1 on 12 yellow arsi street racer 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.210
 brushless darcy car that comes in a few 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.539
 videos already showed back included 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.210
 the unboxing the contents of the chassis 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.160
 racing on asphalt and including one 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.350
 unintended bang against the curb 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.239
 resulting in a broken handlebar 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.400
 link that prevents the steering servo from entering 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.020
 was connected to the for whom the 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.970
 trying out unfortunately came so abruptly 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.590
 until an early end and we had to 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.960
 so come back with a second part left 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.460
 this car because we were certainly not yet 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.170
 tested 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.579
 the car must therefore be returned to the workbench 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.229
 and as mentioned stood by the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.450
 front wheels are no longer in contact with 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.070
 the steering servo and if you get it from 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.329
 when you look closely, you can immediately see something 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.770
 The problem is 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.630
 one of the plastic arms of the handlebars 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.009
 as a place that was demolished here 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.590
 on the right 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.000
 yes then you can send whatever you want 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.560
 luckily yellow marcy delivers one 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.539
 comprehensive manual with the car 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.639
 equipped with a detailed xplod 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.130
 it attacked with apart from it in all 

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:28.139
 part numbers so drawings good 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.420
 and send us broken 

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:32.579
 part with article number you are already in 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.719
 2009 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.159
 the parts are fortunately good 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.899
 so our friends are available from 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.179
 jealous who had him in no time 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.340
 us in the bus so it's about this 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.409
 specific part here so let's 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.060
 to replace me immediately with a 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.889
 Phillips screwdriver gets you 8 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.630
 screws loose on the front so that 

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:49.859
 you can put the aluminum nose leaf 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.509
 to release 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.579
 now we can send both broken as 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.200
 a relationship that is in three places with 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.969
 ball links so you get them 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.429
 carefully release with a point and it you 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.609
 you can now lift the broken part 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.609
 from 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.289
 and so we replace it with renewal 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.510
 issue of good placement and the ball link 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:15.040
 is fixing again with everything on again 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.390
 the aluminum plate can take its place 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.700
 back again and the steering action has been restored 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.440
 a child can do the laundry by car 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.380
 We will continue to restore the recovered one 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.600
 missing the yellow marcy test 1 in 12 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.440
 street racer breathless on the big 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.440
 cross track 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.730
 boots well there you need to be able 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.730
 yet 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.100
 oops or not we succeeded 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.480
 to break the front bumper 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.040
 it didn't look that bad anyway 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.900
 without 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.520
 but no good bumper is fine too 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.740
 drive so we do not let ourselves through 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.360
 stop the straps this time 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.340
 a grainy off-road terrain such as this 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.110
 job well anyway you can tasty 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.330
 powerslide there without too much of a 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.820
 break and with full throttle straight ahead fact 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.350
 the straps I fasten well here on grass 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.850
 keep streetracer brochure itself 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.720
 good rolling not so very fast 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.340
 of course 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.930
 as long as the grass is not too high 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.930
 otherwise you're stuck fast 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.090
 jumping a little offroad does fresh 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.470
 one on January 12 street racer brushes 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.320
 so okay 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.120
 at those broken points after day the 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.390
 conclusion is therefore simple 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.640
 good for driving on asphalt good for the 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.610
 long jobs 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.620
 so he does nice but you jump 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.810
 must therefore be somewhat careful 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.400
 participate for really hard offroad 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.560
 the car seems to pop because of the 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.390
 sustainability is therefore not really suitable 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.890
 ok fair is fair this is a small one 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.900
 in on 12 cart 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.460
 so that the scale is by not also 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.190
 For example, jealousy also has a lot 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.880
 heavier dressed one on 8 june razr x 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.230
 l 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.150
 And it won't surprise you 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.670
 service performance is a lot higher 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.920
 but that also applies to the price 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.780
 d-doing 12 borssele street racer is one 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.800
 fantastic car for the beginner 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.410

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.300
