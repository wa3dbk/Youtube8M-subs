 I like they are good so already it is 1 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.649
 5 pc one is not a real one but what about 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.189
 you believed in them because that 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.320
 represent 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.490
 but it's a page here and also I 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.829
 makes a difference in my skin 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.240
 now I have the glasses of 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.229
 thank Has save making me 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.270
 because I'm a bit of a mother 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.520
 in scream so really a big big up 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.469
 did he tell his wife to undermine me 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.090
 had to heal his binoculars north of 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.079
 peace kima so elsewhere then 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.909
 found with all the objects a little 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.670
 in the pvp mc in the pvp 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.399
 we find of course the camp 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.679
 werewolf with pickaxe 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.569
 the lava leaps the skins are born 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.680
 on anything that interests you the 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.019
 plus it's the events that the and b 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.269
 are in quotation marks in hd 1 so that's 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.890
 and not do it and then years of us 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.019
 stone swords I think it's 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.870
 whole children I think we do not 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.489
 not move I know more and which ones a 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.200
 good background and you will see well with the no 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.130
 excuse me if some resemblance 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.810
 is a bit weird but I think that 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.610
 can see better when you have in hand and 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.620
 the diamond sword next we have 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.150
 So they are a little limited they 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.010
 are in hd in ores in hd on 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.780
 notice the iron ore that has 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.720

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.780
 get closer to the right path we hear 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.519
 the sense of the game is pretty funny 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:45.240

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.710
 you a little pissed off because I 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.600
 find that a little bonus we have are 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.949
 quite common that they noted having on 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.840
 our land spa resort that's from the 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.919

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.800
 particles here is it's the 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.520
 particles when we tape normally 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.610
 it's particles 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.430
 pretty basic enough so that's sir 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.840
 above parties that are surprising to me 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.639
 a little bit when the stuff that makes serge and 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.949
 kara big it's me who made the voice 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.110
 of course so here is each note 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.699
 every room pleases you yeah that's it for 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.099
