00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.890
 I recommend you when you go 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:08.349
 cornalitos in the room his palo de lolo 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.890
 cornalito with eyes with all of 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:18.410
 die you ate cornalitos sometime 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.410
 to bite the little fish like that and so on 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.840
 they are place tito as if I eat you I do not know 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:31.920
 I am italian 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.920
 but sometimes 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:43.710
 ram things but what thing is what 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:47.850
 started 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.440
 some vegetables eggs bananas that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.449
 yes also but what would be what 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.090
 would we go to meat proteins not 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.090
 eat meat pork 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.410
 flesh no god for example today I am 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.410
 I 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.670
 clear then a salmon trade 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.470
 chicken chicken 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.470
 and the game and the egg 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.260
 clear how 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.260
 I am vegetarian 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.939
 here 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.939
 but there is the investment found 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:45.540
 I think crab with the protein 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.450
 very good very good caribbean crabs 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.870
 crab yes only when I travel and a 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:57.740
 little lobster and what else 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.740
 and what more damn oysters 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.970
 or almost 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.229
 and stop little by little and I think I'm going to have 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.830
 that leaving the crab is the process 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.950
 channel 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.490
 I am a vegetarian 40 years ago 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.320
 and the process the process is first you 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.270
 leave the red meat 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.640
 then the birds are left and the last 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.130
 that is left as a natural process what 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.800
 the body is asking for that is the fish 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.300
 it's the last thing left but you can 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.390
 live perfectly and anemic 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.310
 broken lentils of all kinds so the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.220
 true that we can live perfectly 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:47.900
 without doing so much damage and without using skins 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.900
 also skins nor have to use skins 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.580
 he's not talking about the food but he 's 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.470
 well to use skins is also true 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.910
 Do not throw garbage on the street 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.880
 since we are giving anything else 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.970
 not things to hunt or give priority to 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.970
 pedestrian 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.550
 but it is here is to say that 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.860
 just when I felt like saying that many 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.150
 Sometimes the pedestrian crosses in the USA 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.150
 let's leave it past 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.010
 little by little I have to leave home now 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.819
 his mind but I'll stop by little 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.819
 it's a process like good
