parts diagram which yes

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.700 
parts diagram which yes
I<00:00:47.390> don't<00:00:48.390> know<00:00:48.479> if<00:00:48.569> a<00:00:48.600> tray<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:48.839> not<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.319> just<00:00:49.350> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
I don't know if a tray or not it just it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.360 
I don't know if a tray or not it just it
came<00:00:49.859> with<00:00:50.069> it<00:00:50.569> but<00:00:51.569> these<00:00:51.929> are<00:00:52.889> interesting

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
came with it but these are interesting

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.090 
came with it but these are interesting
this<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.569> the<00:00:54.780> electronics<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:55.769> inside

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
this is the electronics that was inside

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.709 
this is the electronics that was inside
of<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.870> what<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:57.989> discovered<00:00:58.280> was<00:00:59.280> first

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
of there so what we discovered was first

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.460 
of there so what we discovered was first
take<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> body<00:01:01.139> off<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:02.569> yes<00:01:03.569> it<00:01:04.199> has<00:01:04.440> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
take the body off and yes it has a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.830 
take the body off and yes it has a
9-volt<00:01:05.070> battery<00:01:05.489> which<00:01:06.180> goes<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> toggle

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
9-volt battery which goes to a toggle

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.870 
9-volt battery which goes to a toggle
switch<00:01:07.200> which<00:01:07.500> goes<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> backside<00:01:08.850> of

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
switch which goes to the backside of

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.779 
switch which goes to the backside of
lights<00:01:09.180> which<00:01:09.630> gives<00:01:09.869> me<00:01:09.990> working<00:01:10.320> headlights

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
lights which gives me working headlights

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.000 
lights which gives me working headlights
which<00:01:11.789> is<00:01:11.939> really<00:01:12.180> awesome

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.570 

so<00:01:15.700> inside<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:17.650> see<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:17.920> server<00:01:18.130> was<00:01:18.310> taken

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
so inside you see the server was taken

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.980 
so inside you see the server was taken
out<00:01:18.730> there's<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.180> three<00:01:19.330> holes<00:01:19.570> where<00:01:19.840> the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
out there's the three holes where the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.160 
out there's the three holes where the
servo<00:01:20.950> mount<00:01:21.280> goes<00:01:21.490> into<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.810> you<00:01:22.900> can<00:01:22.930> see

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
servo mount goes into and you can see

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.120 
servo mount goes into and you can see
when<00:01:23.380> I<00:01:23.410> turn<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:24.400> wheels<00:01:24.870> and<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:26.950> there's

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
when I turn the wheels and then there's

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.000 
when I turn the wheels and then there's
the<00:01:27.310> controller<00:01:27.700> here<00:01:28.030> for<00:01:28.440> economy<00:01:29.440> or<00:01:29.740> power

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
the controller here for economy or power

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.460 
the controller here for economy or power
mode<00:01:30.400> so<00:01:31.360> if<00:01:31.450> I<00:01:31.540> let<00:01:31.660> me<00:01:31.720> get<00:01:31.840> Seymour<00:01:32.110> driving

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
mode so if I let me get Seymour driving

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.990 
mode so if I let me get Seymour driving
time<00:01:32.620> power<00:01:32.890> mode<00:01:33.130> gets<00:01:33.370> you<00:01:33.460> more<00:01:33.610> climbing

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
time power mode gets you more climbing

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.540 
time power mode gets you more climbing
time<00:01:34.260> so<00:01:35.260> inside<00:01:35.590> of<00:01:35.620> here<00:01:35.920> was<00:01:36.100> this<00:01:36.250> great

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
time so inside of here was this great

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.240 
time so inside of here was this great
big<00:01:36.760> thing<00:01:37.080> which<00:01:38.080> we<00:01:38.230> found<00:01:38.410> out<00:01:38.740> is<00:01:38.920> an<00:01:39.100> ace

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
big thing which we found out is an ace

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.360 
big thing which we found out is an ace
electronics<00:01:40.090> 1210<00:01:41.100> marine<00:01:42.180> speed<00:01:43.180> controller

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
electronics 1210 marine speed controller

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.350 
electronics 1210 marine speed controller
now<00:01:45.370> this<00:01:45.760> is<00:01:46.180> old-school<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:48.130> probably<00:01:49.030> still

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
now this is old-school it probably still

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.000 
now this is old-school it probably still
works<00:01:49.390> but<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.000> hands<00:01:52.120> on<00:01:52.360> there<00:01:53.010> yeah

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
works but see the hands on there yeah

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.720 
works but see the hands on there yeah
now<00:01:54.670> it's<00:01:54.940> different<00:01:56.010> then<00:01:57.010> find<00:01:57.370> out<00:01:57.550> what

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
now it's different then find out what

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.480 
now it's different then find out what
this<00:01:57.940> thing<00:01:58.210> is<00:01:58.240> here<00:01:59.190> but<00:02:00.190> it's<00:02:00.310> got<00:02:00.460> all

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
this thing is here but it's got all

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.830 
this thing is here but it's got all
kinds<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.910> marking<00:02:01.270> over<00:02:01.480> there<00:02:01.630> including

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
kinds of marking over there including

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.220 
kinds of marking over there including
the<00:02:02.080> harley-davidson<00:02:03.150> but<00:02:04.150> that<00:02:04.330> fit<00:02:05.020> into

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
the harley-davidson but that fit into

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.230 
the harley-davidson but that fit into
that<00:02:05.470> mechanism<00:02:05.860> tray<00:02:06.250> which<00:02:06.460> sits<00:02:06.730> on<00:02:06.850> top<00:02:07.090> of

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
that mechanism tray which sits on top of

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.460 
that mechanism tray which sits on top of
here<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:09.490> this<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:10.000> block<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:11.050> an<00:02:11.140> antenna

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
here and in this a block and an antenna

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.360 
here and in this a block and an antenna
so<00:02:11.710> must<00:02:12.280> have<00:02:12.430> been<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:13.390> receiver<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:15.010> then

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
so must have been the receiver and then

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.020 
so must have been the receiver and then
we<00:02:15.490> have<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.700> whole<00:02:16.000> block<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.510> outs<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:18.030> I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
we have a whole block of outs and I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.640 
we have a whole block of outs and I
think<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.420> don't<00:02:19.480> know<00:02:19.660> any<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:20.050> them<00:02:20.140> do<00:02:20.320> or

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
think is I don't know any of them do or

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.040 
think is I don't know any of them do or
hiding<00:02:20.950> them<00:02:21.160> hookup<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.910> there's<00:02:22.720> another

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
hiding them hookup and there's another

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.810 
hiding them hookup and there's another
one<00:02:23.350> for<00:02:23.380> an<00:02:23.620> out<00:02:23.740> and<00:02:24.900> there's<00:02:26.250> power<00:02:27.250> switch

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
one for an out and there's power switch

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.370 
one for an out and there's power switch
which<00:02:28.300> I'm<00:02:29.140> not<00:02:29.260> sure<00:02:29.530> what<00:02:29.740> that<00:02:29.980> was<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:30.400> but

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
which I'm not sure what that was for but

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.160 
which I'm not sure what that was for but
power<00:02:32.380> switch<00:02:32.739> has<00:02:32.920> those<00:02:33.160> cables<00:02:33.640> too<00:02:34.170> and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
power switch has those cables too and

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.650 
power switch has those cables too and
some<00:02:35.950> great<00:02:36.130> big<00:02:36.370> huge<00:02:36.670> block<00:02:37.000> thing<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.510> got<00:02:37.630> to

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
some great big huge block thing I got to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.930 
some great big huge block thing I got to
steal<00:02:38.020> this<00:02:38.470> off<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:39.010> put<00:02:39.220> back<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.730> clot

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
steal this off to put back in the clot

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.140 
steal this off to put back in the clot
buster<00:02:40.360> go<00:02:41.230> break<00:02:42.220> down<00:02:42.489> in<00:02:42.640> there<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.970> power

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
buster go break down in there the power

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.060 
buster go break down in there the power
switch<00:02:43.360> goes<00:02:44.459> if<00:02:45.459> I'm<00:02:45.640> get<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.910> around<00:02:46.180> there

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
switch goes if I'm get you around there

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.050 
switch goes if I'm get you around there
so<00:02:48.070> that'd<00:02:48.220> be<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.370> side<00:02:48.610> with<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.850> power

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
so that'd be the side with the power

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.729 
so that'd be the side with the power
which<00:02:49.570> looks<00:02:49.810> like<00:02:49.959> there's<00:02:50.140> some<00:02:50.260> holes<00:02:50.470> been

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
which looks like there's some holes been

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.500 
which looks like there's some holes been
drilled<00:02:50.920> in<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.220> I'm<00:02:51.880> not<00:02:51.940> sure<00:02:52.060> if<00:02:52.360> it's

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
drilled in it I'm not sure if it's

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.280 
drilled in it I'm not sure if it's
factory<00:02:52.900> or<00:02:52.989> not

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.590 

pretty<00:02:56.290> much<00:02:56.500> everything<00:02:56.980> was<00:02:57.250> here<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:58.480> old

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
pretty much everything was here the old

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.530 
pretty much everything was here the old

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.220 
Futaba FPS 28 in direct drive hmm
interesting<00:03:06.209> but<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.420> see<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:07.810> had<00:03:08.050> its

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
interesting but you see it's had its

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.580 
interesting but you see it's had its
toll<00:03:08.560> it's<00:03:09.100> probably<00:03:09.900> probably<00:03:10.900> works<00:03:11.110> but<00:03:11.410> I

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
toll it's probably probably works but I

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.160 
toll it's probably probably works but I
don't<00:03:11.770> know<00:03:11.830> how<00:03:11.950> well<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:13.450> I'll<00:03:13.660> just<00:03:13.840> replace

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
don't know how well so I'll just replace

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.800 
don't know how well so I'll just replace
that<00:03:14.200> with<00:03:14.500> another<00:03:14.709> servo<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.540> then<00:03:17.580> there

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
that with another servo and then there

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.280 
that with another servo and then there
there's<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.959> guard<00:03:20.380> on<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.770> back<00:03:20.980> here<00:03:22.290> like

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
there's a guard on the back here like

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.020 
there's a guard on the back here like
this<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.799> bumper<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.340> everything<00:03:24.700> on<00:03:24.850> it

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
this is the bumper and everything on it

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.309 
this is the bumper and everything on it
and<00:03:25.959> then<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.890> one<00:03:27.100> on<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.280> front<00:03:27.459> here

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
and then the one on the front here

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.989 
and then the one on the front here
does<00:03:29.249> not<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:30.930> discover<00:03:31.530> because<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.849> does

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:32.999 
does not and I discover because it does

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:36.619 
does not and I discover because it does
not<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:35.459> must<00:03:35.730> have<00:03:35.819> been<00:03:35.909> talking<00:03:36.060> off<00:03:36.329> but

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
not it must have been talking off but

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.500 
not it must have been talking off but
these<00:03:37.260> braces<00:03:37.829> here<00:03:38.189> are<00:03:38.819> missing<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.239> gap

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
these braces here are missing a gap

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.140 
these braces here are missing a gap
right<00:03:39.780> there<00:03:40.170> where<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.799> bar<00:03:41.760> would<00:03:41.969> go

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
right there where that bar would go

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.349 
right there where that bar would go
through<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:42.749> hooking<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.920> bush<00:03:44.370> front<00:03:45.180> bar

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
through for hooking the bush front bar

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.839 
through for hooking the bush front bar
up<00:03:45.599> to<00:03:45.840> there<00:03:45.989> same<00:03:46.980> thing<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.400> other<00:03:47.430> side

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
up to there same thing on the other side

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.819 
up to there same thing on the other side
here<00:03:48.859> mmm<00:03:49.889> right<00:03:50.639> there<00:03:50.909> so<00:03:51.900> has<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.530> little<00:03:52.769> bit

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
here mmm right there so has a little bit

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.170 
here mmm right there so has a little bit
of<00:03:52.920> play<00:03:53.069> because<00:03:53.400> there's<00:03:53.549> no<00:03:53.670> screws<00:03:54.000> in

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
of play because there's no screws in

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.420 
of play because there's no screws in
there<00:03:54.299> either<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:55.500> I'm<00:03:55.709> contemplating<00:03:56.370> on

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
there either so I'm contemplating on

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.670 
there either so I'm contemplating on
finding<00:03:56.790> another<00:03:56.969> bar<00:03:57.269> or<00:03:57.900> just<00:03:58.079> finding<00:03:58.560> some

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
finding another bar or just finding some

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.080 
finding another bar or just finding some
spacers<00:03:59.129> and<00:03:59.400> putting<00:03:59.700> them<00:03:59.790> in<00:03:59.879> there

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
spacers and putting them in there

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.959 
spacers and putting them in there
because<00:04:00.900> really<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.319> don't<00:04:01.530> want<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.709> be

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:01.969 
because really I don't want to be

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.899 
because really I don't want to be
digging<00:04:02.969> up<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.329> bar<00:04:04.129> for<00:04:05.129> a<00:04:05.189> tie<00:04:05.430> rod<00:04:05.669> end

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
digging up this bar for a tie rod end

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.449 
digging up this bar for a tie rod end
here<00:04:06.209> breaking<00:04:06.870> any<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.260> plastic<00:04:08.040> off<00:04:08.159> and

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
here breaking any of the plastic off and

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.939 
here breaking any of the plastic off and
stuff<00:04:08.609> like<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:09.000> right<00:04:09.349> so<00:04:10.349> I<00:04:10.379> might<00:04:10.590> look<00:04:10.769> up

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
stuff like that right so I might look up

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.849 
stuff like that right so I might look up
one<00:04:11.159> of<00:04:11.280> those<00:04:11.810> so<00:04:12.810> this<00:04:12.989> does<00:04:13.260> actually<00:04:13.590> work

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
one of those so this does actually work

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.939 
one of those so this does actually work
I<00:04:14.370> actually<00:04:15.180> had<00:04:15.449> the<00:04:15.540> headlights<00:04:15.810> go<00:04:15.989> me<00:04:16.169> but

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
I actually had the headlights go me but

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.360 
I actually had the headlights go me but
this<00:04:17.549> stuff<00:04:17.789> is<00:04:18.000> so<00:04:18.239> old<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:19.799> think<00:04:20.190> it's

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
this stuff is so old that I think it's

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.110 
this stuff is so old that I think it's
junk<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:22.250> don't<00:04:23.250> know<00:04:23.460> if<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.669> want<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.849> throw<00:04:24.030> it

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
junk I don't know if I want to throw it

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.719 
junk I don't know if I want to throw it
out<00:04:24.180> right<00:04:24.389> away<00:04:24.449> then<00:04:25.160> somebody<00:04:26.160> can<00:04:26.340> use<00:04:26.370> it

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
out right away then somebody can use it

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.890 
out right away then somebody can use it
to<00:04:26.960> definitely<00:04:27.960> give<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.229> to<00:04:28.320> them<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:29.720> have<00:04:30.720> no

in there and see what I can do with that

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.450 
in there and see what I can do with that
and<00:04:48.110> maybe<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.229> can<00:04:49.440> get<00:04:49.590> this<00:04:49.710> thing<00:04:49.889> going

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
and maybe I can get this thing going

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.050 
and maybe I can get this thing going
might<00:04:51.360> have<00:04:51.479> to<00:04:51.599> rub<00:04:51.780> some<00:04:52.050> stuff<00:04:52.349> out<00:04:52.500> of<00:04:52.530> my

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
might have to rub some stuff out of my

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.420 
might have to rub some stuff out of my
other<00:04:54.060> project<00:04:54.659> there<00:04:54.870> but<00:04:55.190> it'll<00:04:56.190> be<00:04:56.280> worth

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
other project there but it'll be worth

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.170 
other project there but it'll be worth
it<00:04:58.009> so<00:04:59.009> then<00:04:59.280> on<00:04:59.820> a<00:04:59.880> party<00:05:00.300> note<00:05:01.970> these<00:05:02.970> are

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
it so then on a party note these are

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.659 
it so then on a party note these are
actually<00:05:03.690> bulbs

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.300 

yeah<00:05:08.330> hard<00:05:09.199> to<00:05:09.289> tell<00:05:09.499> it's<00:05:09.680> so<00:05:09.860> far<00:05:10.069> back<00:05:10.249> in

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
yeah hard to tell it's so far back in

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.969 
yeah hard to tell it's so far back in
there<00:05:10.840> but<00:05:11.840> they're<00:05:12.050> actually<00:05:12.229> lightbulbs

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
there but they're actually lightbulbs

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.580 
there but they're actually lightbulbs
just<00:05:13.159> like<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.490> old<00:05:13.840> Tamiya<00:05:14.840> tractor<00:05:15.379> truck

light kit so won't be running those all
the<00:05:19.759> time<00:05:19.789> might<00:05:20.479> upgrade<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:20.960> LEDs<00:05:21.319> but<00:05:21.680> and

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669
