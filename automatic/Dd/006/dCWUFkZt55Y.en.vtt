00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
little carts we're going to practice the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.000 
little carts we're going to practice the
first<00:00:41.240> page<00:00:41.480> all<00:00:41.750> on<00:00:42.110> once<00:00:42.440> if<00:00:42.680> you<00:00:42.800> look<00:00:42.920> at

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
first page all on once if you look at

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.470 
first page all on once if you look at
the<00:00:43.040> first<00:00:43.280> measure<00:00:43.520> it's<00:00:43.880> the<00:00:44.030> same<00:00:44.210> as<00:00:44.390> the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
the first measure it's the same as the

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.330 
the first measure it's the same as the
second<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.050> third<00:00:45.080> so<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:45.950> practice

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
second and the third so you practice

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.510 
second and the third so you practice
that<00:00:46.370> like<00:00:46.640> this<00:00:50.770> okay<00:00:51.770> it's<00:00:51.980> pretty<00:00:52.190> even

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
that like this okay it's pretty even

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.729 
that like this okay it's pretty even
easy<00:00:52.880> and<00:00:53.150> then<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.660> last<00:00:53.809> measure<00:00:54.170> is<00:00:54.380> tricky

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
easy and then the last measure is tricky

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.500 
easy and then the last measure is tricky
too<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.460> practice<00:00:55.610> all<00:00:55.940> that<00:00:56.090> first<00:00:56.300> page

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
too so practice all that first page

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.840 
too so practice all that first page
together<00:00:56.720> do<00:00:57.170> that<00:00:57.320> like<00:00:57.440> five<00:00:57.620> times<00:00:57.850> then

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
together do that like five times then

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.400 
together do that like five times then
when<00:00:58.970> you<00:00:59.030> get<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.150> the<00:00:59.300> second<00:00:59.600> page<00:00:59.750> practice

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
when you get to the second page practice

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.009 
when you get to the second page practice
these<00:01:00.559> four<00:01:00.920> measures<00:01:01.370> like<00:01:01.910> five<00:01:02.210> times<00:01:02.480> it's

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
these four measures like five times it's

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.620 
these four measures like five times it's
the<00:01:03.080> same<00:01:03.290> pattern<00:01:03.769> but<00:01:04.250> just<00:01:05.239> different

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
the same pattern but just different

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.090 
the same pattern but just different
notes<00:01:05.810> same<00:01:06.410> as<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.650> beginning<00:01:06.980> just

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
notes same as the beginning just

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.850 
notes same as the beginning just
different<00:01:07.430> notes<00:01:07.990> lying<00:01:08.990> three<00:01:09.320> is<00:01:09.440> a<00:01:09.590> tricky

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
different notes lying three is a tricky

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.620 
different notes lying three is a tricky
part<00:01:10.100> line<00:01:10.280> three<00:01:10.610> uses<00:01:10.850> we're<00:01:11.300> going<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:11.480> say

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
part line three uses we're going to say

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.890 
part line three uses we're going to say
all<00:01:11.810> finger<00:01:12.260> three<00:01:12.710> for<00:01:13.159> this<00:01:13.280> whole<00:01:13.520> part<00:01:13.900> so

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
all finger three for this whole part so

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.630 
all finger three for this whole part so
watch<00:01:15.140> my<00:01:15.350> hands<00:01:15.950> we're<00:01:16.159> going<00:01:16.250> to<00:01:16.340> be<00:01:16.430> above

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
watch my hands we're going to be above

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.820 
watch my hands we're going to be above
middle<00:01:16.909> seat<00:01:17.240> middle<00:01:17.270> seat<00:01:17.570> here<00:01:17.990> we're<00:01:18.740> going

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
middle seat middle seat here we're going

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.260 
middle seat middle seat here we're going
to<00:01:18.920> be<00:01:19.010> up<00:01:19.100> here<00:01:19.130> watch<00:01:19.610> how<00:01:19.760> I<00:01:19.790> do<00:01:19.940> that<00:01:20.150> 3<00:01:22.810> 3333

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
to be up here watch how I do that 3 3333

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.080 
to be up here watch how I do that 3 3333
and<00:01:25.869> we<00:01:25.960> stopped<00:01:26.229> right<00:01:26.439> before<00:01:26.560> we<00:01:26.829> do<00:01:27.009> f<00:01:27.219> okay

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
and we stopped right before we do f okay

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.230 
and we stopped right before we do f okay
so<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:28.990> left<00:01:29.170> hand<00:01:29.259> starts<00:01:29.859> here<00:01:30.100> then<00:01:30.670> we<00:01:30.759> go

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.539 

it's<00:01:34.240> hard<00:01:34.509> to<00:01:34.570> read<00:01:34.920> look<00:01:35.920> at<00:01:36.070> music<00:01:36.159> through

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
it's hard to read look at music through

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.749 
it's hard to read look at music through
it<00:01:36.610> keepo<00:01:36.969> a<00:01:37.259> videotape<00:01:38.259> don't<00:01:39.100> fill<00:01:39.640> up<00:01:39.670> that

it keepo a videotape don't fill up that

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.819 
it keepo a videotape don't fill up that
fluoresced<00:01:40.270> and<00:01:40.600> then<00:01:41.289> we<00:01:41.380> go<00:01:41.469> back<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.679> the

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
fluoresced and then we go back to the

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:48.029 
fluoresced and then we go back to the
same<00:01:41.979> as<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.159> beginning<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.530> cord<00:01:47.799> at<00:01:47.950> the

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
same as the beginning the cord at the

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.770 
same as the beginning the cord at the
end<00:01:48.189> is<00:01:48.340> three<00:01:48.640> notes<00:01:48.880> on<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.090> left<00:01:49.270> hand<00:01:49.479> and

end is three notes on the left hand and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.039 
end is three notes on the left hand and
one<00:01:50.110> note<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.439> right<00:01:50.619> hand<00:01:54.179> okay<00:01:55.179> so<00:01:55.840> there's

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
one note the right hand okay so there's

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.090 
one note the right hand okay so there's
little<00:01:56.229> parts<00:01:56.590> make<00:01:56.770> sure<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:56.979> practice

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
little parts make sure you practice

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.340 
little parts make sure you practice
little<00:01:57.759> sections<00:01:58.299> do<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.780> first<00:01:59.020> four

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
little sections do the first four

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.100 
little sections do the first four
measures<00:01:59.560> like<00:02:00.159> 10<00:02:00.429> times<00:02:00.719> then<00:02:01.719> do<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.960> next

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
measures like 10 times then do the next

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.169 
measures like 10 times then do the next
four<00:02:02.350> measures<00:02:02.530> like<00:02:02.860> 10<00:02:03.100> times<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.700> then

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
four measures like 10 times and then

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.089 
four measures like 10 times and then
learn<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.569> middle<00:02:04.840> section<00:02:04.990> practice<00:02:05.979> like

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
learn that middle section practice like

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:10.769 
learn that middle section practice like
that<00:02:06.280> would<00:02:06.490> be<00:02:06.610> easy<00:02:06.819> alright<00:02:07.599> hit<00:02:08.380> button
