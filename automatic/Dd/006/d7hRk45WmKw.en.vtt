00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
jump straight and your weight is going

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.580 
jump straight and your weight is going
that<00:00:32.160> way<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.489> still<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.960> against<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
that way it's still going against the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.160 
that way it's still going against the
transition<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.670> towards<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.899> opposite

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
transition and like towards the opposite

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.139 
transition and like towards the opposite
side<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.410> quarter<00:00:37.710> wall<00:00:38.550> rides<00:00:38.760> it's

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
side of the quarter wall rides it's

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.850 
side of the quarter wall rides it's
kinda<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.450> hearing<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:39.899> which<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.530> when<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
kinda like hearing out which is when you

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.080 
kinda like hearing out which is when you
plant<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:42.059> body<00:00:43.340> has<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> always<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.940> like

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
plant the body has to always be like

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.240 
plant the body has to always be like
lean<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.930> way<00:00:46.110> because<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> don't<00:00:47.100> do

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
lean in this way because if you don't do

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.799 
lean in this way because if you don't do
that<00:00:47.280> you're<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.579> gonna<00:00:47.730> flat<00:00:48.450> against<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
that you're just gonna flat against the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.790 
that you're just gonna flat against the
wall<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> bug<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.710> windshield

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
wall like a bug on a windshield

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.510 
wall like a bug on a windshield
so<00:00:51.899> long<00:00:52.899> as<00:00:53.079> you<00:00:53.170> lean<00:00:53.410> in<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:54.190> be<00:00:54.309> all<00:00:54.399> right

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
so long as you lean in to be all right

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.979 
so long as you lean in to be all right
so<00:00:55.480> if<00:00:56.170> you<00:00:56.410> go<00:00:56.590> up<00:00:56.829> pull<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.790> little<00:00:58.270> bit<00:00:58.719> at<00:00:58.870> an

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
so if you go up pull a little bit at an

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.689 
so if you go up pull a little bit at an
angle<00:00:59.410> like<00:00:59.590> going<00:00:59.949> up<00:01:00.129> straight<00:01:00.399> you<00:01:00.519> could

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
angle like going up straight you could

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.719 
angle like going up straight you could
hit<00:01:00.820> hoping<00:01:01.210> away<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.730> you<00:01:04.119> turn<00:01:04.600> 90<00:01:05.080> right

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
hit hoping away and you turn 90 right

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.760 
hit hoping away and you turn 90 right
and<00:01:06.729> as<00:01:06.909> soon<00:01:07.060> as<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:07.210> turn<00:01:07.330> 90<00:01:07.630> push<00:01:08.500> you<00:01:08.619> to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
and as soon as you turn 90 push you to

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.590 
and as soon as you turn 90 push you to
extend<00:01:08.979> your<00:01:09.220> leg<00:01:09.400> so<00:01:09.940> as<00:01:10.060> soon<00:01:10.180> as<00:01:10.240> I<00:01:10.360> hit<00:01:10.540> the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
extend your leg so as soon as I hit the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.109 
extend your leg so as soon as I hit the
wall<00:01:10.860> then<00:01:11.860> you<00:01:11.979> can<00:01:12.369> you<00:01:12.490> compress<00:01:12.940> down

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
wall then you can you compress down

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.760 
wall then you can you compress down
because<00:01:13.360> going<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:13.570> be<00:01:13.900> on<00:01:14.110> that<00:01:14.259> wall<00:01:14.470> longer

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
because going to be on that wall longer

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.609 
because going to be on that wall longer
and<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:14.920> actually<00:01:15.040> think<00:01:15.340> so<00:01:16.270> it's<00:01:16.450> just<00:01:16.619> long

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
and you actually think so it's just long

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.430 
and you actually think so it's just long
as<00:01:17.830> you<00:01:17.920> go<00:01:18.070> up<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:18.610> 90<00:01:19.330> push<00:01:19.899> your<00:01:20.050> feet<00:01:20.229> in

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
as you go up you 90 push your feet in

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.499 
as you go up you 90 push your feet in
the<00:01:21.220> plant<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.909> then<00:01:23.009> crouch<00:01:24.009> down<00:01:24.330> jump<00:01:25.330> off

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
the plant and then crouch down jump off

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:26.910 
the plant and then crouch down jump off
a<00:01:25.539> little<00:01:25.780> bit<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.229> you'll<00:01:26.470> go<00:01:26.560> straight<00:01:26.619> back

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
a little bit and you'll go straight back

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.969 
a little bit and you'll go straight back
in<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.160> corner<00:01:27.490> just<00:01:28.500> kind<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.560> practice

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
in the corner just kind of practice

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.609 
in the corner just kind of practice
going<00:01:30.789> like<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.509> lower<00:01:31.780> like<00:01:32.110> obviously<00:01:32.440> don't

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
going like a lower like obviously don't

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.230 
going like a lower like obviously don't
try<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.950> boost<00:01:33.220> it<00:01:33.429> to<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.580> top<00:01:33.729> of<00:01:33.940> wall<00:01:34.090> or

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
try to boost it to the top of wall or

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.510 
try to boost it to the top of wall or
anything<00:01:34.270> at<00:01:34.630> first<00:01:34.830> start<00:01:35.830> low<00:01:36.009> so<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.340> know

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
anything at first start low so you know

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.859 
anything at first start low so you know
how<00:01:36.700> far<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.060> jump<00:01:37.270> in<00:01:37.450> without<00:01:37.600> hitting

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
how far to jump in without hitting

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.139 
how far to jump in without hitting
coping<00:01:38.320> or<00:01:38.979> if<00:01:39.039> you<00:01:39.100> go<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.250> flat<00:01:39.550> if<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:40.000> hit

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
coping or if you go to flat if you hit

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.730 
coping or if you go to flat if you hit
coping<00:01:40.600> you're<00:01:40.960> in<00:01:41.080> trouble<00:01:41.200> if<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.560> go<00:01:41.679> to

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
coping you're in trouble if you go to

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.469 
coping you're in trouble if you go to
flat<00:01:42.009> you're<00:01:42.670> in<00:01:42.729> just<00:01:42.759> as<00:01:42.970> much<00:01:43.119> trouble<00:01:43.179> as

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
flat you're in just as much trouble as

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.870 
flat you're in just as much trouble as
if<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:43.750> were<00:01:43.869> at<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.050> top<00:01:44.200> of<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.350> quarter<00:01:44.619> so

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
if you were at the top of the quarter so

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.680 
if you were at the top of the quarter so
