my<00:00:16.340> newest<00:00:16.730> set<00:00:17.060> of<00:00:17.180> custom<00:00:17.570> figures<00:00:17.960> which<00:00:18.230> is

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
my newest set of custom figures which is

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.100 
my newest set of custom figures which is
a<00:00:18.560> batch<00:00:18.950> of<00:00:19.189> multiple<00:00:19.670> Man<00:00:19.880> figures<00:00:20.330> my

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
a batch of multiple Man figures my

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.690 
a batch of multiple Man figures my
customer<00:00:21.500> wanted<00:00:21.860> three<00:00:22.160> of<00:00:22.279> them

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
customer wanted three of them

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.480 
customer wanted three of them
and<00:00:22.900> since<00:00:23.900> customs<00:00:24.710> take<00:00:24.920> a<00:00:24.949> lot<00:00:25.130> of<00:00:25.220> work<00:00:25.369> we

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
and since customs take a lot of work we

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.980 
and since customs take a lot of work we
decided<00:00:25.760> to<00:00:25.820> make<00:00:25.880> them<00:00:26.029> relatively<00:00:26.570> simple

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
decided to make them relatively simple

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.660 
decided to make them relatively simple
but<00:00:27.170> multiple<00:00:27.560> man<00:00:27.770> is<00:00:27.920> a<00:00:27.980> fairly<00:00:28.279> simple

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
but multiple man is a fairly simple

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.240 
but multiple man is a fairly simple
design<00:00:29.330> in<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.660> first<00:00:29.900> place<00:00:30.199> so<00:00:30.800> that<00:00:30.830> worked

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
design in the first place so that worked

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.229 
design in the first place so that worked
out<00:00:31.430> just<00:00:31.490> fine

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
got a gun hand from protector so they

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.819 
got a gun hand from protector so they
all<00:01:49.909> have<00:01:50.119> new<00:01:50.270> hands<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:51.020> then<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.470> course<00:01:51.680> we

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
all have new hands and then of course we

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.780 
all have new hands and then of course we
needed<00:01:51.979> heads<00:01:52.280> for<00:01:52.610> him<00:01:52.930> so<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:53.960> took<00:01:54.790> DC

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.810 
closed mouth this is Superman Reds head
I<00:02:02.600> took<00:02:02.960> three<00:02:03.439> casts<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.070> those<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.700> re

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
I took three casts of those and re

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.179 
I took three casts of those and re
sculpted<00:02:05.270> them<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.509> have<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.649> hood<00:02:06.860> part

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
sculpted them to have the the hood part

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.609 
sculpted them to have the the hood part
and<00:02:08.119> then<00:02:08.239> we<00:02:08.420> painted<00:02:08.780> them<00:02:08.929> where<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.229> painted

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
and then we painted them where I painted

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.170 
and then we painted them where I painted
them<00:02:09.709> differently<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:10.340> each<00:02:10.489> one<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:10.759> looking

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
them differently so each one is looking

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.680 
them differently so each one is looking
in<00:02:11.299> a<00:02:11.360> different<00:02:11.660> direction<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:13.239> that's<00:02:14.239> cool

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
in a different direction so that's cool

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.180 
in a different direction so that's cool
I<00:02:14.750> think<00:02:15.079> and<00:02:15.739> then<00:02:15.860> they're<00:02:16.010> interchangeable

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
I think and then they're interchangeable

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.100 
I think and then they're interchangeable
so<00:02:16.879> if<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.090> want<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.360> guy<00:02:17.510> looking<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
so if you want the guy looking to the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.869 
so if you want the guy looking to the
left<00:02:18.349> to<00:02:18.500> hold<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.860> gun<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.190> can<00:02:19.340> do<00:02:19.459> that<00:02:19.670> or

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
left to hold the gun you can do that or

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.320 
left to hold the gun you can do that or
you<00:02:19.970> can<00:02:20.090> swap<00:02:20.360> them<00:02:20.540> out

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
you can swap them out

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.380 
you can swap them out
and<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.630> him<00:02:21.930> looking<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.830> right<00:02:23.330> do<00:02:24.330> you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
and have him looking to the right do you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.580 
and have him looking to the right do you
do<00:02:24.480> whatever<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.780> want<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:25.020> do<00:02:25.140> with<00:02:25.320> them<00:02:25.470> so

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
do whatever you want to do with them so

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
do whatever you want to do with them so
it<00:02:25.710> gives<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.130> little<00:02:26.310> bit<00:02:26.460> of

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
it gives you a little bit of

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.220 
it gives you a little bit of
interchangeability<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:27.930> all<00:02:28.050> have

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
interchangeability so they all have

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.420 
interchangeability so they all have
different<00:02:28.260> hands<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:29.100> all<00:02:29.190> have

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
different hands and they all have

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.540 
different hands and they all have
different<00:02:29.510> heads<00:02:30.510> technically<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:32.280> then<00:02:32.400> the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
different heads technically and then the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.230 
different heads technically and then the
body<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:34.310> black<00:02:35.310> with<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.610> really<00:02:36.000> dark

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
body is just a black with a really dark

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.870 
body is just a black with a really dark
blue<00:02:36.980> dry-brush<00:02:37.980> over<00:02:38.280> top<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.670> then<00:02:38.790> he's

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
blue dry-brush over top and then he's

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.970
