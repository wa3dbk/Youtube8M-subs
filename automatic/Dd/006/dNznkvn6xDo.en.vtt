how to set up on serious fpd planes
going<00:00:24.600> now<00:00:25.670> here<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.820> serious<00:00:27.420> plane<00:00:27.660> with

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
going now here is the serious plane with

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.260

1.3 g boo to 800 MW video TX set up
behind<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.989> still<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.950> tape<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
behind here I still have to tape the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.979 
behind here I still have to tape the
cables<00:00:38.700> because<00:00:39.149> they<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.750> running

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
cables because they are just running

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.950 
cables because they are just running
under<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:41.460> now<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.879> will<00:00:42.000> tape<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.450> when<00:00:42.780> we

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
under it for now I will tape it when we

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.000 
under it for now I will tape it when we
go<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.620> field<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:45.450> Fayette<00:00:45.899> AG<00:00:46.260> GPS<00:00:46.800> is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
go to the field the Fayette AG GPS is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.160 
go to the field the Fayette AG GPS is
sitting<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:52.670> then<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.420> horn<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.809> OSD

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
sitting here and then the horn at OSD

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.869 
sitting here and then the horn at OSD
just<00:00:56.129> neatly<00:00:56.699> fits<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.930> there<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
just neatly fits in there for the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.810 
just neatly fits in there for the
serious<00:01:00.480> plane<00:01:00.719> rust<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.489> one

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
serious plane rust we can see I have one

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.759 
serious plane rust we can see I have one
or<00:01:02.940> two<00:01:03.090> batteries<00:01:03.510> i<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.809> easily<00:01:04.140> fit<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.559> i

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
or two batteries i can easily fit in i

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.240 
or two batteries i can easily fit in i
can<00:01:04.949> put<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.339> little<00:01:05.640> bit<00:01:05.909> free<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> fpv

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
can put one little bit free for the fpv

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.580 
can put one little bit free for the fpv
power<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.880> few<00:01:09.299> system<00:01:09.689> powering<00:01:09.960> behind

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
power up a few system powering behind

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.740 
power up a few system powering behind
here<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> main<00:01:11.610> battery<00:01:12.000> goes<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.450> here

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750

sitting<00:01:18.630> inside<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.350> ok<00:01:20.159> let<00:01:20.520> me<00:01:20.549> put<00:01:20.820> this

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
sitting inside here ok let me put this

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.899 
sitting inside here ok let me put this
thing<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.390> first<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.320> I'll<00:01:22.979> move<00:01:23.340> for

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
thing up first and then I'll move for

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.320 
thing up first and then I'll move for
further<00:01:24.560> this<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> camera<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.580> some<00:01:27.060> pen

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
further this is the camera with some pen

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.640 
further this is the camera with some pen
ok<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:30.290> my<00:01:31.290> replay<00:01:31.770> XD<00:01:32.130> that's<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> plan

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
ok and my replay XD that's what I plan

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.700 
ok and my replay XD that's what I plan
will<00:01:34.650> sit<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.840> i<00:01:36.869> will<00:01:37.140> set<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.590> up

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
will sit right here so i will set it up

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.560 
will sit right here so i will set it up
nice<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.790> very<00:01:38.970> very<00:01:39.240> good<00:01:39.390> for

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
nice and it will be very very good for

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.620 
nice and it will be very very good for
you<00:01:39.680> unless<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.130> falls<00:01:41.820> into<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you unless if it falls into the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.710 
you unless if it falls into the
propeller<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.320> there's<00:01:43.530> enough<00:01:43.799> space

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
propeller but there's enough space

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.219 
propeller but there's enough space
anyway<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.710> you're<00:01:46.920> looking<00:01:47.250> under<00:01:48.229> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
anyway and if you're looking under you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.130 
anyway and if you're looking under you
can<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.829> one<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> diversity<00:01:51.149> RX<00:01:51.750> antenna

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
can see one of the diversity RX antenna

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.859 
can see one of the diversity RX antenna
is<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:52.560> ok<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> antenna<00:01:54.720> is

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
is here ok and one of the antenna is

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.560 
is here ok and one of the antenna is
there<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.500> chain-link<00:01:56.460> diversity<00:01:57.240> RX

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
there that is a chain-link diversity RX

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.000 
there that is a chain-link diversity RX
so<00:01:57.780> two<00:01:57.960> antennas

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
so two antennas

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.900 
so two antennas
at<00:01:59.370> the<00:01:59.850> either<00:02:00.120> side<00:02:01.220> okay<00:02:02.220> left<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.940> right

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
at the either side okay left and right

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.900 
at the either side okay left and right
all<00:02:05.910> right<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.540> hopefully<00:02:07.610> once<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.850> thing

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
all right so hopefully once this thing

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.630 
all right so hopefully once this thing
is<00:02:09.390> successful<00:02:10.020> today<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.770> very<00:02:11.100> very<00:02:11.250> windy

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
is successful today is very very windy

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.540 
is successful today is very very windy
but<00:02:11.790> hey<00:02:11.970> who<00:02:12.270> cares<00:02:12.480> we'll<00:02:12.810> fly<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.430> once<00:02:14.430> it

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
but hey who cares we'll fly it once it

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.420 
but hey who cares we'll fly it once it
is<00:02:14.580> successful<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.540> fpv<00:02:16.020> system<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.950> going

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
is successful this fpv system is going

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.490 
is successful this fpv system is going
