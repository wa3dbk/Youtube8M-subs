hey guys it's reaker from cut the
recordings<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.690> today<00:00:13.080> I'm<00:00:13.200> gonna<00:00:13.320> talk

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
recordings and today I'm gonna talk

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.929 
recordings and today I'm gonna talk
about<00:00:13.620> editing<00:00:14.549> guitars<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:16.699> why<00:00:17.699> might<00:00:17.880> you

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
about editing guitars so why might you

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.420 
about editing guitars so why might you
want<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.270> do<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:19.260> some<00:00:19.890> genres

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
want to do this in some genres

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.090 
want to do this in some genres
especially<00:00:21.150> metal<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:22.289> need<00:00:22.440> the<00:00:22.590> guitars<00:00:22.920> to

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
especially metal you need the guitars to

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.040 
especially metal you need the guitars to
be<00:00:23.190> unusually<00:00:23.370> tight<00:00:24.120> like<00:00:24.420> almost<00:00:24.810> robotic

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
be unusually tight like almost robotic

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.439 
be unusually tight like almost robotic
sounding<00:00:26.360> and<00:00:29.750> maybe<00:00:30.750> maybe<00:00:31.289> also<00:00:31.530> you<00:00:32.340> just

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
sounding and maybe maybe also you just

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.369 
sounding and maybe maybe also you just
recorded<00:00:33.449> someone<00:00:33.660> they<00:00:33.840> did<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.230> bad

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
recorded someone they did a really bad

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:35.660 
recorded someone they did a really bad
performance<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.039> you<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.219> need<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.399> edit

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
performance and you just need to edit

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.660 
performance and you just need to edit
everything<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.570> be<00:00:37.350> sort<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.739> time<00:00:37.980> or

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
everything to be sort of on time or

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.830 
everything to be sort of on time or
maybe<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:38.970> just<00:00:39.060> one<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> little<00:00:39.540> part<00:00:39.720> that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
maybe it's just one a little part that

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.000 
maybe it's just one a little part that
you<00:00:39.899> need<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.110> edit<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:42.320> first<00:00:43.320> thing<00:00:43.560> is<00:00:43.739> you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
you need to edit so first thing is you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.850 
you need to edit so first thing is you
want<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.430> use<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.720> clean<00:00:46.200> di<00:00:46.440> signal

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
want to use the the clean di signal

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.420 
want to use the the clean di signal
completely<00:00:47.899> unaffected<00:00:49.130> because<00:00:50.130> it's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
completely unaffected because it's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.430 
completely unaffected because it's
easiest<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> transients<00:00:52.290> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
easiest to see the transients and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.670 
easiest to see the transients and
individual<00:00:53.280> notes<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.790> these<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.469> is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
individual notes on these so this is

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.860 
individual notes on these so this is
what<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.640> guitar<00:00:57.000> track<00:00:57.239> looked<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.629> when

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
what this guitar track looked like when

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.860 
what this guitar track looked like when
it<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.140> first<00:00:58.350> recorded<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:59.550> I<00:01:00.210> went<00:01:00.809> ahead

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
it was first recorded now I went ahead

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.080 
it was first recorded now I went ahead
and<00:01:01.020> ant<00:01:01.290> like<00:01:01.559> did<00:01:01.829> an<00:01:01.980> amp<00:01:02.340> version<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.969> it

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
and ant like did an amp version of it

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.830 
and ant like did an amp version of it
and<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.629> looks<00:01:03.780> like

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
and this is what it looks like

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.300 
and this is what it looks like
afterwards<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:06.409> it's<00:01:07.409> almost<00:01:07.619> impossible<00:01:07.979> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
afterwards so it's almost impossible to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.289 
afterwards so it's almost impossible to
tell<00:01:08.610> what's<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.509> here<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:11.610> hard

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
tell what's going on here but this hard

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.609 
tell what's going on here but this hard
to<00:01:12.360> believe<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.600> turns<00:01:12.960> into<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.380> whenever

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
to believe that turns into this whenever

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.390 
to believe that turns into this whenever
it's<00:01:13.890> amped<00:01:15.650> so<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:19.740> also<00:01:19.890> want<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.190> get<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
it's amped so you also want to get the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.969 
it's amped so you also want to get the
best<00:01:20.580> performance<00:01:20.729> possible<00:01:21.270> because<00:01:21.979> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
best performance possible because the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.039 
best performance possible because the
less<00:01:23.210> stretching<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.330> editing<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.900> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
less stretching and editing you have to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.320 
less stretching and editing you have to
do<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:26.070> better<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.400> will<00:01:26.490> sound<00:01:26.729> because

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
do the better it will sound because

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.000 
do the better it will sound because
whenever<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.200> start<00:01:28.439> moving<00:01:28.560> things<00:01:28.890> around

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
whenever you start moving things around

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.830 
whenever you start moving things around
you<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.460> what's<00:01:29.610> called<00:01:29.670> artifacts<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
you get what's called artifacts and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.440 
you get what's called artifacts and
things<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.950> tune<00:01:32.210> just<00:01:33.210> weird

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
things can get out of tune just weird

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.980 
things can get out of tune just weird
things<00:01:33.659> happen<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.270> yeah<00:01:36.479> I'll<00:01:36.570> go<00:01:36.750> ahead<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
things happen so yeah I'll go ahead and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.539 
things happen so yeah I'll go ahead and
start<00:01:37.170> showing<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.530> how<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.680> edit<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
start showing you how to edit the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.530 
start showing you how to edit the
guitars<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.380> main<00:01:40.530> thing<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.299> keep<00:01:42.299> doing

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
guitars so the main thing you keep doing

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.920 
guitars so the main thing you keep doing
that<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.710> main<00:01:46.710> thing<00:01:47.000> is<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.869> just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
that so the the main thing is you just

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.539 
that so the the main thing is you just
need<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.860> gonna<00:01:50.009> take<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> lot<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.400> time

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
need to it's gonna take a lot of time

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.999 
need to it's gonna take a lot of time
but<00:01:50.700> you're<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> need<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.180> learn<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
but you're going to need to learn to

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.230 
but you're going to need to learn to
sort<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.100> pick<00:01:53.280> between<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> different<00:01:54.030> notes

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
sort of pick between the different notes

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.590 
sort of pick between the different notes
and<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.680> found<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.189> helps<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.549> lot<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:57.060> zoom

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
and I found that it helps a lot to zoom

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.230 
and I found that it helps a lot to zoom
in<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.869> out<00:01:58.040> quite<00:01:59.040> often<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.729> way<00:01:59.909> you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
in and out quite often so that way you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.520 
in and out quite often so that way you
can<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> new<00:02:00.630> perspective<00:02:00.900> on<00:02:01.290> how

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
can get a new perspective on how

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.980 
can get a new perspective on how
everything<00:02:01.740> looks<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> from<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.540> right<00:02:03.720> here

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
everything looks so from like right here

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.819 
everything looks so from like right here
I<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.259> actually<00:02:04.380> see<00:02:04.710> pretty<00:02:04.920> well<00:02:06.829> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
I can actually see pretty well the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.289 
I can actually see pretty well the
difference<00:02:08.099> between<00:02:08.250> these<00:02:08.459> notes<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.119> then

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
difference between these notes and then

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.089 
difference between these notes and then
I<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.569> zoom<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.289> then<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.470> can<00:02:10.500> really<00:02:10.769> sort

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
I can zoom in and then I can really sort

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.190 
I can zoom in and then I can really sort
of<00:02:11.159> pick<00:02:11.370> out<00:02:11.579> where<00:02:12.360> those<00:02:12.450> need<00:02:12.659> to<00:02:12.689> be<00:02:12.780> split

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
of pick out where those need to be split

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.129 
of pick out where those need to be split

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.470 

around<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.879> section<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.360> you're

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
around like the section that you're

the<00:02:39.720> other<00:02:39.810> side<00:02:40.049> of<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.319> so<00:02:40.620> if<00:02:41.959> let's<00:02:42.959> say<00:02:43.049> if

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
the other side of it so if let's say if

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.420 
the other side of it so if let's say if
I<00:02:43.260> was<00:02:43.379> gonna<00:02:43.470> stretch<00:02:43.709> this<00:02:43.860> right<00:02:44.069> here<00:02:44.310> and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
I didn't split this over here whenever I

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.770 
I didn't split this over here whenever I
start<00:02:47.250> stretching<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:48.349> everything<00:02:50.420> on<00:02:51.420> the

I've<00:04:38.650> got<00:04:38.800> highlighted<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.910> looks<00:04:40.120> like<00:04:40.240> it

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
I've got highlighted it looks like it

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.490 
I've got highlighted it looks like it
might<00:04:40.570> actually<00:04:40.599> be<00:04:40.990> part<00:04:41.229> of<00:04:41.289> the<00:04:41.410> note<00:04:41.620> but

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
might actually be part of the note but

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.659 
might actually be part of the note but
things<00:04:44.500> like<00:04:44.620> this<00:04:44.770> can<00:04:44.979> throw<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.190> off<00:04:45.430> this

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
things like this can throw you off this

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.760 
things like this can throw you off this
is<00:04:45.910> this<00:04:46.300> right<00:04:46.510> here<00:04:46.780> is<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.050> actual<00:04:47.500> part<00:04:47.710> of

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
is this right here is the actual part of

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.409 
is this right here is the actual part of
the<00:04:47.830> note<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:48.250> I'm<00:04:48.340> assuming<00:04:48.729> this<00:04:49.180> right

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
the note and I'm assuming this right

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.990 
the note and I'm assuming this right
here<00:04:49.690> is<00:04:50.320> actually<00:04:50.830> some<00:04:51.039> kind<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.370> fret<00:04:51.729> noise

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
here is actually some kind of fret noise

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.510 
here is actually some kind of fret noise
or<00:04:52.240> something<00:04:52.440> so<00:04:53.440> if<00:04:53.800> you<00:04:54.010> were<00:04:54.130> to<00:04:54.250> stretch

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
or something so if you were to stretch

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.719 
or something so if you were to stretch
this<00:04:54.910> and<00:04:55.150> you<00:04:55.300> were<00:04:55.419> to<00:04:55.539> actually<00:04:56.610> if<00:04:57.610> you

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
this and you were to actually if you

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.279 
this and you were to actually if you
were<00:04:57.849> to<00:04:57.940> actually<00:04:58.090> use<00:04:58.720> this<00:04:58.960> as<00:04:59.169> the

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
were to actually use this as the

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.050 
were to actually use this as the
beginning<00:04:59.440> of<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.770> note<00:04:59.979> it<00:05:00.280> would<00:05:00.490> sound<00:05:00.729> off

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
beginning of the note it would sound off

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:11.290 
beginning of the note it would sound off
so

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:19.430 

so<00:05:12.300> now<00:05:12.479> if<00:05:12.630> I<00:05:12.750> bring<00:05:13.020> that<00:05:13.139> back<00:05:16.729> you<00:05:17.729> see<00:05:18.440> so

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
so now if I bring that back you see so

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.510 
so now if I bring that back you see so
yeah<00:05:19.590> you<00:05:19.650> got<00:05:19.830> to<00:05:19.889> kind<00:05:19.949> of<00:05:20.039> watch<00:05:20.100> out<00:05:20.370> for

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
yeah you got to kind of watch out for

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.350 
yeah you got to kind of watch out for
those<00:05:20.669> things

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
those things

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.469 
those things
listen<00:05:21.990> often<00:05:22.410> and<00:05:22.639> one<00:05:23.639> trick<00:05:23.910> I've<00:05:24.120> I've

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
listen often and one trick I've I've

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.760 
listen often and one trick I've I've
learned<00:05:24.870> that<00:05:25.020> really<00:05:25.229> helps<00:05:25.470> me<00:05:25.620> when

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
learned that really helps me when

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.490 
learned that really helps me when
editing<00:05:26.070> guitars<00:05:26.460> is<00:05:26.930> you<00:05:27.930> can<00:05:28.050> use<00:05:28.199> a<00:05:28.229> loop

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
editing guitars is you can use a loop

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.960 
editing guitars is you can use a loop
and<00:05:29.660> just<00:05:30.660> put<00:05:31.380> like<00:05:31.530> small<00:05:32.280> sections<00:05:32.759> of<00:05:32.880> the

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
and just put like small sections of the

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.390 
and just put like small sections of the
note<00:05:33.150> into<00:05:33.570> that<00:05:33.720> loop<00:05:33.930> or<00:05:34.229> the<00:05:34.830> part<00:05:35.190> that<00:05:35.310> you

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
note into that loop or the part that you

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.260 
note into that loop or the part that you
think<00:05:35.699> is<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:35.970> note<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.530> you<00:05:37.669> can<00:05:38.669> sort<00:05:38.910> of<00:05:39.000> it

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
think is the note and you can sort of it

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.939 
think is the note and you can sort of it
would<00:05:39.599> be<00:05:39.660> a<00:05:39.690> little<00:05:39.780> obnoxious<00:05:39.990> sounding<00:05:40.800> but

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
would be a little obnoxious sounding but

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.499 
would be a little obnoxious sounding but
it<00:05:41.039> kind<00:05:41.190> of<00:05:41.220> helps<00:05:41.430> you<00:05:41.520> pinpoint<00:05:41.729> like<00:05:42.270> where

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
it kind of helps you pinpoint like where

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:49.279 
it kind of helps you pinpoint like where
the<00:05:42.660> actual<00:05:43.050> note<00:05:43.199> starts<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:43.740> ends<00:05:44.840> so<00:05:48.080> if<00:05:49.080> I

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
the actual note starts and ends so if I

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.860 
the actual note starts and ends so if I
just<00:05:49.949> highlight<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:50.550> note<00:05:53.570> see<00:05:54.570> it<00:05:54.630> sounds

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
just highlight the note see it sounds

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.540 
just highlight the note see it sounds
like<00:05:54.990> a<00:05:55.020> full<00:05:55.289> it<00:05:55.770> sounds<00:05:55.949> like<00:05:56.039> a<00:05:56.099> full<00:05:56.280> note

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.999
