talked about Nats the power trailers I

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.330 
talked about Nats the power trailers I
just<00:05:39.630> don't<00:05:39.840> really<00:05:39.990> care<00:05:40.320> for<00:05:40.350> the<00:05:40.590> CVT<00:05:40.950> all

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
just don't really care for the CVT all

just don't really care for the CVT all
that<00:05:41.580> much<00:05:41.820> and<00:05:42.150> honestly<00:05:42.480> if<00:05:42.990> I<00:05:43.139> were<00:05:43.260> buying

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
that much and honestly if I were buying

that much and honestly if I were buying
this<00:05:43.830> car<00:05:44.130> I'd<00:05:44.550> probably<00:05:44.820> look<00:05:45.150> at<00:05:45.389> the

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
this car I'd probably look at the

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.720 
this car I'd probably look at the
four-cylinder<00:05:46.440> engine<00:05:46.830> because<00:05:47.250> the

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
four-cylinder engine because the

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.790 
four-cylinder engine because the
six-cylinder<00:05:48.419> isn't<00:05:48.720> all<00:05:48.810> that<00:05:48.840> exciting<00:05:49.139> and

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
six-cylinder isn't all that exciting and

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.070 
six-cylinder isn't all that exciting and
four<00:05:50.639> cylinders<00:05:51.060> probably<00:05:51.450> going<00:05:51.780> to<00:05:51.900> get

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
four cylinders probably going to get

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.770 
four cylinders probably going to get
better<00:05:52.320> fuel<00:05:52.680> economy<00:05:53.040> so<00:05:53.490> that<00:05:53.520> said<00:05:54.060> we're

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
better fuel economy so that said we're

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.409 
better fuel economy so that said we're
