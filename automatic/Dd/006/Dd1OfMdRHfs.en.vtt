00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.840
 so 1 1 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.789
 this thing works like that 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.610
 filming goes hello to you again 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.489
 Chelyabinsk doctor and today we will spend 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.789
 With you another operation let's see what 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:35.080
 we generally have to do 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:37.089
 called she is a brain transplant so 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.940
 okay order there is an order therefore 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:43.320
 let's not pull the cat by the balls and 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.680
 let's get started right away so we have 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.239
 brain 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.109
 the skull and cool invented but just as it were 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.780
 we get it 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.910
 but we have a nurse for this case 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.190
 prepared us a lot of different 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.989
 tools look hammer saw 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.820
 the whole hatchet viking give it take 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.450
 Now you know at Easter how am I here for you 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:16.300
 recently but uhhh from dryers and cool let's 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:20.190
 try again with a hatchet not 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.190
 so easy 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.520
 hell is he bleeding okay god 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.160
 let's go with him 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.899
 stick him a tickler so he doesn't 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:38.679
 then complained to us that we didn't give him something 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:39.840
 I did it go nuts I feel that he will soon 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.319
 will die 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.050
 will be and what is this let's see 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:49.569
 what is it that we have something new apparently 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.700
 the state began budgeting experience and 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:58.319
 laser but listen apparently state 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.420
 when began to finance our hospital 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:05.189
 because before this was not 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.979
 earlier similar operations from similar 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:17.550
 operation for the first time I do, I would do them 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:18.959
 that's what it is oh god no he was 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.630
 terribly killed in one minute 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:26.850
 Okay, well it does not matter we pretend that it is 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.060
 it wasn’t us who ever had a vacation 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.360
 so goodbye to new meetings 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.080
 And hello again, I was lying down at the bottom 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.580
 about a week and ready again 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.720
 operate and what we have here on tasks 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:46.230
 Again marrow transplant well, let 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.269
 try again of course the first pancake 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.670
 always lumpy we did not sleep for 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.340
 this business is behind this process but i think 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.069
 that this time everything will be more successful and 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.000
 I will not take this Vitebsk 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:03.360
 yes yes, I appeal to you more so 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.940
 we are not friends and it seems to start going 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.640
 crazy in this hospital because 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.700
 talking to all sorts of axes this already 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.920
 terrible so oh well hammer suddenly he 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:21.660
 we always always helped us out 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:24.500
 try this what the hell is so 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.500
 charged in the forehead 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.020
 so how do they swing it and so 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:42.840
 Yumi waving them right and that's it 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:46.890
 Understandable, let's take it like this 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.189
 Immediately as the shells on the Yeti 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:57.209
 listen immediately everything beats and everything is fine 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:04:03.510
 We are about listening, we have almost taken off 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:05.939
 the shell is fine like hard boiled eggs 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:11.040
 In general, we’ll make a snare so that our 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:14.629
 the patient did not suspect anything now 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.769
 would dodge again at orlov 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:20.910
 so so everything is great injection we did 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.900
 it means we have things to do 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.479
 take out both that and that his brain 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.849
 which he somehow changes apparently was 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.080
 not too smart but too cunning to 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.810
 earn money for a transplant 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:39.800
 brain or can he have there through declare 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.800
 he decided to change them so now some 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.250
 something in general stretches and goes to the abyss 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.860
 him there abyss okay let's or 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.870
 Lights to call because it was 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.629
 apparently another lecture that skipped 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:05:02.060
 let's take scissors and try plates 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:04.699
 have a brain will appoint a pull yah 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.620
 listen cool you can do will stuffing 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:12.490
 tonight and make mince well and 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:16.750
 eat and wife okay damn brain left 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:21.460
 transplant another so let's take care of 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:24.860
 no although it may be worth it to throw it in 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.680
 this water is our transplanted brain but she 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.050
 It does not matter in general, this is essentially nonsense 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.430
 complete because the brain is already in my hands 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.960
 and and Chelyabinsk doctor makes another 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.440
 successful operation before 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.240
 in general, dear viewers and I shoot it 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:47.360
 video for you for you 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:49.400
 young young doctors young surgeons in my 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.259
 video you can successfully do everything 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.479
 operations and you will be fine 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.669
 get so do not forget 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.460
 subscribe to our reality show 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.279
 Chelyabinsk doctor and put huskies 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.099
 so we are generally satisfied with the result 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:06.620
 because this second operation is the first 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.690
 the client of course died with us but my good 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.830
 successfully for 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:16.100
 lay down on the bottom and the second operation is just 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:20.290
 super successful and even we have stuffing 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.290
 stayed for the evening but so here
