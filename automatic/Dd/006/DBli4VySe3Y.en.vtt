00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
for the center of the shadow caused by

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.590 
for the center of the shadow caused by
be<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> light<00:02:20.950> pole<00:02:21.160> over<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.480> just

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
be a light pole over here so you just

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.449 
be a light pole over here so you just
want<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.840> aim<00:02:23.019> your<00:02:23.200> scope<00:02:23.650> right<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.160> and

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
want to aim your scope right in it and

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.550 
want to aim your scope right in it and
then<00:02:25.239> without<00:02:25.570> moving<00:02:25.630> your<00:02:25.989> scope<00:02:26.290> at<00:02:26.470> all

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
then without moving your scope at all

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.830 
then without moving your scope at all
you<00:02:26.680> want<00:02:26.829> to<00:02:26.920> zoom<00:02:27.040> out<00:02:27.220> like<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.660> you

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
you want to zoom out like so and you

don't<00:02:30.760> jump<00:02:30.940> right<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.360> it's<00:02:31.540> not<00:02:31.660> gonna<00:02:31.780> hurt

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
don't jump right and it's not gonna hurt

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.420 
don't jump right and it's not gonna hurt
you

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.430 

excellent<00:02:37.299> now<00:02:37.780> what<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.019> see<00:02:38.140> here<00:02:38.319> is<00:02:38.409> that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
excellent now what you see here is that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.990 
excellent now what you see here is that
the<00:02:38.650> tree<00:02:38.860> fell<00:02:39.010> over<00:02:39.069> but<00:02:39.489> it's<00:02:39.580> against<00:02:39.909> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
the tree fell over but it's against the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.539 
the tree fell over but it's against the
fence<00:02:40.209> here<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:40.950> what<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.069> can<00:02:42.220> do<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.489> can

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
fence here so what you can do is you can

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.309 
fence here so what you can do is you can
actually<00:02:42.730> go<00:02:42.909> up<00:02:43.060> on<00:02:43.209> this<00:02:43.299> tree<00:02:43.569> go<00:02:44.080> on<00:02:44.200> to

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
actually go up on this tree go on to

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.440 
actually go up on this tree go on to
these<00:02:44.440> crates<00:02:44.769> over<00:02:45.099> here<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.879> if<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.239> want

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
these crates over here and if you want

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.089 
these crates over here and if you want
to<00:02:46.659> even<00:02:47.049> place<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.500> beacon

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
to even place the beacon

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.759 
to even place the beacon
you<00:02:48.250> can<00:02:48.400> place<00:02:48.549> weaken<00:02:48.909> down<00:02:49.349> other<00:02:50.349> speaker

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
you can place weaken down other speaker

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.460 
you can place weaken down other speaker
is<00:02:50.830> very<00:02:51.040> hard<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.280> see<00:02:51.489> from<00:02:51.640> far<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:53.290> like

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
is very hard to see from far but like

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.140 
is very hard to see from far but like
every<00:02:53.709> other<00:02:53.799> beacon<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.489> can<00:02:54.670> be<00:02:54.819> heard<00:02:55.000> if

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
every other beacon it can be heard if

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.149 
every other beacon it can be heard if
you're<00:02:55.299> close<00:02:55.450> enough<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.079> but<00:02:56.829> yes<00:02:56.950> this

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.190 

I'll<00:03:36.579> just<00:03:36.819> spawn<00:03:37.000> on<00:03:37.150> my<00:03:37.269> beacon<00:03:37.629> as<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.049> can

I'll just spawn on my beacon as you can

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.420 
I'll just spawn on my beacon as you can
see<00:03:38.319> it's<00:03:38.440> behind<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.799> tree<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.159> it's<00:03:39.310> well

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
see it's behind the tree so it's well

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.490 
see it's behind the tree so it's well
hidden<00:03:39.660> from<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.810> enemy<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:44.079> get<00:03:44.230> out<00:03:44.349> you

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
hidden from the enemy and to get out you

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.319 
hidden from the enemy and to get out you
just<00:03:44.590> jump<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:44.889> fence<00:03:45.069> like<00:03:45.609> so<00:03:45.819> it's<00:03:46.239> very

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
just jump the fence like so it's very

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:54.540 
just jump the fence like so it's very
easy<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.630> go<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:47.079> place

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.330 

hopefully<00:03:55.550> nobody<00:03:55.730> joins<00:03:56.030> them<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.390> match<00:03:57.340> now

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
hopefully nobody joins them to match now

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.830 
hopefully nobody joins them to match now
this<00:03:58.489> place<00:03:58.700> is<00:03:58.849> really<00:03:59.000> neat

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
this place is really neat

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.160 
this place is really neat
I<00:03:59.900> like<00:04:00.410> saw<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.620> few<00:04:00.980> other<00:04:01.160> people<00:04:01.430> do<00:04:01.550> it<00:04:01.730> I
