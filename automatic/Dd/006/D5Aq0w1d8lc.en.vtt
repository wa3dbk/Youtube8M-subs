00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.170
 we are back with a recipe that 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.810
 he visit 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.270
 he wants to devour what are we going to do 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.700
 he wants all the muffins and these mobiles 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.300
 They are special because they have chocolate and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.040
 they have this that my favorite is 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.570
 that we are going to make it very simple 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.570
 do the truth they only need a few 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.270
 chocolate cookies in this case I 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.080
 I chose these chocolate cookies a 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:32.510
 little cream cheese sugar a little bit 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 vanilla essence cream eggs flour 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.559
 and the same cookies but crushed 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.769
 as chopped not to be as 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.900
 in the pieces in our mobile 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.390
 and they are very easy to do first 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.010
 what we are going to realize is that we are going to 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.880
 take the cookies and we're going to put them 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.280
 on a baking sheet and I here I have 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.010
 with a cap he cited 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.710
 and put our cookie in the background 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.710
 then we will place in each 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.250
 cap cited 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.460
 a cookie 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.460
 The k corridors plus the k corridors more 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.530
 good in a blender let's put 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.280
 our cream cheese 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.260
 which we are going to cremate 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.260
 we are going to add sugar 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.180
 and let's start 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.020
 nava your to start taking as a 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.090
 consistency more be softer and 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.549
 that they incorporate a little 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.789
 and little sugar is added to 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.950
 little this took a little bit of time 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.250
 I recommend that you use it on 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.719
 cream cheese then at room temperature 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.719
 let's add the essence of vanilla 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:58.580
 and I will incorporate the cream 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.580
 I'm going to give a little help to this one 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.770
 and now 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.170
 first I'm going to clean this up because 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.660
 here nothing happened nothing happened nothing 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.830
 calm and we are going to add the eggs 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.830
 one by one 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.680
 one 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.990
 Bah 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.019
 everyone 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.340
 go 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.240
 3 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.850
 and the last 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.190
 4 eggs and let's let it 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.530
 incorporate first of all I will do 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.720
 one thing because on the walls of my 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.400
 blender is staying a bit of 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.900
 cheese that does not want to work 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.909
 then we are going to 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.909
 download all our walls 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.280
 to the center of our blender 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.500
 to make sure that everything is 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.490
 properly incorporating not to 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.490
 this hour 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.450
 to this one 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.410
 etc 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:28.290
 thank you very much to a hand not good for 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:34.430
 add the flour little by little and 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:38.319
 They put his shot shots 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.030
 let's go adding in the flour 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.170
 incorporate the good toga let's go to 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.170
 incorporate a little more 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.930
 I get back and that's it 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.270
 perfectly well mixed and now you 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.310
 let's go down to speed for 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.230
 add our laws 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.450
 and that is well mixed 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.980
 that it's even for everyone, not because 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.840
 then if it's horrible that you touch one 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.629
 that does not have as much cookie 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.629
 is that there is that claw bite and that 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.909
 stay and cross and then well let's 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.150
 get this out of here and we're going to put it in 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.800
 our molds 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.000
 then hijole this is going to fight 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:23.690
 true if I put it here reserved and 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.520
 let's put in our molds a little 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.740
 of the mixture so that it is not so full 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.510
 because remember that going to sponges three 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.040
 matches 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.480
 mix 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.500
 one goes out to visit 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.500
 another one 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.210
 visit 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.900
 is to get him to work 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.080
 so that others can take away their energy and 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.500
 Now if we 're going to put it in the oven 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.449
 at about 180 degrees and the joke is that 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.069
 cooked through and when you are 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.069
 insert the stick come out clean 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.730
 to this and by the way when you go to 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.550
 bake our friends so that as 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:14.040
 they do not always have a super suggestion 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.360
 super useful never use the tray 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.970
 to bake while they are still hot 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.640
 since you will get an uneven cooking 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.310
 always cool them before turning them on 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.340
 use and remember that only the 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.500
 jams matters offers you the greatest 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.290
