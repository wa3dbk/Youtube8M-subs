00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.299
 ah 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.830
 good austere merck we are again 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.660
 micrometers a new 1.6 minecraft engine 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.150
 point four called trade and blogs or 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.699
 blocks in 3d works with because and is 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.849
 a fucking wonder is something so simple and 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.439
 so and so easy to do that I do not know why 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.509
 what wet they still have not done is 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.300
 very very cool and as an example we can see 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.610
 this train track and if you look you go to 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.550
 to notice something a bit strange is to note that 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.199
 it's not exactly the train track that 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.930
 you want to see you see that it's the same 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.059
 but you see that something is missing or left 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.260
 something not better said if we put here 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.670
 that I have put a few layers of 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.010
 snow so you can see a little bit 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.190
 better you will see that this layer 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.440
 Normally in a rod it is not visible and as 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.510
 you can see this that really if what 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.539
 we see from afar it looks worse and worse but 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.480
 is very very cool they are like small 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.370
 layers of the same train track that you 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.280
 they have put one on top of another 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.170
 there's like I do not know how 20 layers or more I do not know 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.210
 if I have not put to tell it really 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.550
 because I would present the eye but the 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.110
 effect that you get is amazing if you do not 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.080
 he bites me here he's going to see me a little bit 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.120
 clearer the truth that 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.100
 I am a little bit more in 3-d but here in 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.510
 this part like you see a little 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.640
 results if we move will not be like this 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.890
 the layers a little strange but at 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.560
 look at it from above you will see what is 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.690
 very very very cool is that look here look 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.760
 of this part of the road that is 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.890
 quite pretty cool not only with this 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.680
 not only with this is good this is just 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.380
 the beginning of the mod is a mode 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.530
 only graphic does not add anything except 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.480
 this but that I would like to see it 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.670
 in vanilla I would like that before 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.930
 come out 1.7 this will apply to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.180
 vanilla because the truth is that it is 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.860
 very very very cool well then here 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.300
 we have the sugar cane answers from 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.240
 a little water so he can grow 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.790
 and such and you can see how the cane 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.369
 as sugar are not always 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.780
 remembered not so good if we look 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.630
 here you will see that we have also 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.369
 layers and it's that it's not just an image that 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.440
 it has doubled that one has been put in 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.600
 one side diagonally and the other side 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.790
 diagonally but they are several images 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.770
 diagonally on one side and several images 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.360
 in diagonal of the other what causes that 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.190
 have a 3d effect 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.710
 there I love the truth I'm looking 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.080
 android the more I look at it the more I like it 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.030
 it happens exactly the same if we look at it 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.310
 it also has several layers here we can 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.260
 check it a little better and it's good 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.300
 the same goes for the trees that are 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.310
 superchulo put this obviously for 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.590
 that the trees do not grow but also 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.750
 we can look at it with good with some 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.640
 with some parts of the glass is that it 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.140
 modify many things are modified 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.080
 many things and you see a lot more 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.930
 realistic what is minecraft not here 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.939
 we also have the trees 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.400
 here we have also this other tree is 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.769
 well this other that this for example I 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.510
 love that he is very cool and is 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.980
 good the tree of all life the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.019
 lifecraft sampling from minecraft 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.849
 we also have that with the mushrooms 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.790
 Exactly the same thing has also happened 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.230
 with this and with this the only one 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.359
 hit that you have is when looking at it from 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.549
 up looking at the good in parallel to 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.139
 the images are not duplicated a 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.000
 next to another but looking at it from 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.739
 far is that is is great is left 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.099
 fantastic kid here you have the other 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.169
 mushroom the yellow flower the red flower and 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.180
 see if they put it in the 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.919
 snapshot is that it would be a 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.989
 wonder this would be the real cane 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:30.209
 well here we have also in the 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.700
 herbs and the tree is dead too 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.769
 It is very cool but not only that but 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.780
 also happens with the network, this is that if 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.280
 dancing means on the net this does not have 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.560
 depth once with depth 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.450
 it's the cane so it's the host this is 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.150
 the host is very very very cool 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.069
 It's great even if we use it 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.010
 You can also see the depth 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.379
 also in the rest we are going to bend 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.540
 to try to see it you see what 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.710
 wonder what a wonderful wonder the network 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.980
 They are also with 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.810
 depth is very very very well it has 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.360
 done with several things with this too 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.460
 although I do not know very well the change I can 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.950
 see here that there is something strange can be 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.810
 here if it is possible that it is a 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.930
 little this part that becomes too 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.550
 in 3-d but it happens with also with the 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.750
 stairs for example you are seeing the 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.430
 download also that they are a bit 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.800
 strange and have a shading like a 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.570
 not a little strange little're not 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.180
 used to seeing it since also 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.510
 they are 3d in their own way but you are in 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.580
 3-d then it's good that it's in the cane 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.130
 is very very very well also happens with 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.770
 this with the vine is very cool 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.600
 even with the cobweb that is left 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.030
 great there I love I love me 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.120
 love I love this very much 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.730
 also with the plants of both 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.010
 melon like pumpkin also happens 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.990
 that are in 3-d and we are going to plant 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.670
 some of us are going to plant the one from scratch 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.920
 so you can see since from the 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.170
 seed until the seed is also in 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.620
 three from the beginning is that look what 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.150
 wonder what a wonder this looks at this 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.040
 it's a bug so look here we have a 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.020
 Vessel according as the look 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.270
 from one side of the other good is really 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.190
 we can not do anything to remedy 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.340
 that will not also happen with this I suppose 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.010
 yes then also happens well then you see 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.320
 what wonder what more amazing things 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.970
 of mod is very very very well and not because 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.620
 I say it but because it is that I think 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.610
 play with this mode all the time that 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.930
 I can put the 1.6 point 4 and good here 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.370
 we also have let's also put 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.680
 the seeds the seeds also of 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.940
 Wheat are also seen in 3ds bed good 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.620
 all these objects with the senate are seen 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.790
 in 3d and I hope that I have not 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.260
 escaped in none more 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.700
 before finishing I would like that 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.620
 Did you know that it also works if 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.380
 we put the shapplin the flowers or the 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.020
 mushrooms inside the pots and also a 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.780
 thing that is also very very very cool and 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.490
 is that if we put a pack of textures 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.160
 different for example to put this on 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.110
 john smith legacy that changes a lot 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.260
 things are going to see that it is still working 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.330
 the mod is not only works with the 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.470
 default reading park 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.600
 minecraft but it works with 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.520
 any textures pack that you 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.900
 let's say the rest works the same 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.880
 here you see that the rest is also a 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.190
 little changed works the same 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.639
 bushes the flowers that works all 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.979
 exact 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.749
 same but that was great is that 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.699
 anyone who read what you put it 

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:16.409
 it's very cool, let's see 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.909
 another serum pack if I have any 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.499
 that works let's put for example 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.840
 this from the war of time 2 the 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:23.400
 killer 55 let's see what happens too 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.039
 with this father of reading good as 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.990
 you can see this is great is also 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.370
 good are things that are from the map of the 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.080
 war in time 2 that by the way 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.719
 I'm about to finish it so I do not 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.610
 it would have been very soon and well you can already 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:38.310
 see that it still works the same and that 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:41.279
 still remains the street continues 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.900
 being the whore and seriously good because I 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:45.629
 I already think that with this we have finished 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.490
 I'm going to change again with come because 

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:49.770
 the textures peace really change 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.990
 he is very very cool animated enchanted this 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.879
 mod and I hope that you too and with 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.229
 this I say goodbye is something very simple like 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.000
 I already said at the beginning of the video but 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.830
 which is great and I hope they put them 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.270
 someday on the spreadsheet so I hope that 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.919
 you liked the video if you like to press 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.870
 the favorite X and see you in the 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:05.870
 next video see you later
