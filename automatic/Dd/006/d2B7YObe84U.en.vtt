their I locked them up they're supposed
to<00:03:16.709> be<00:03:16.860> moving<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.970> this<00:03:18.900> Technic

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
to be moving like that this Technic

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.460 
to be moving like that this Technic
piece<00:03:19.620> like<00:03:20.160> moves<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.660> pops<00:03:21.870> out<00:03:22.050> that<00:03:22.320> way

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
piece like moves so it pops out that way

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.050 
piece like moves so it pops out that way
but<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.709> don't<00:03:22.890> like<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.190> moving<00:03:23.519> so<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:24.650> keep<00:03:25.650> it

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
but I don't like it moving so I keep it

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.660 
but I don't like it moving so I keep it
keep<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.810> hooked<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.290> up<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.800> so

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
keep it like that I hooked it up and so

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.750 
keep it like that I hooked it up and so
it<00:03:29.910> doesn't<00:03:30.300> keep<00:03:30.900> moving<00:03:31.260> around<00:03:31.610> put<00:03:32.610> that
