up<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:29.799> few<00:01:29.979> Orko<00:01:30.340> night<00:01:30.490> it's<00:01:30.609> just<00:01:30.759> like<00:01:30.909> a

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
up a few Orko night it's just like a

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.700 
up a few Orko night it's just like a
shelf<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.329> just<00:01:31.450> going<00:01:31.539> to<00:01:31.600> right-click<00:01:31.780> take

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
shelf you just going to right-click take

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.959 
shelf you just going to right-click take
the<00:01:32.829> stuff<00:01:33.009> off<00:01:33.219> I<00:01:33.399> think<00:01:33.579> it<00:01:33.670> looks<00:01:33.700> and

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
the stuff off I think it looks and

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.239 
the stuff off I think it looks and
really<00:01:34.179> makes<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.539> really<00:01:34.749> nice<00:01:34.929> effect<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:36.159> I

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249 
really makes a really nice effect and I

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:37.760 
really makes a really nice effect and I
think<00:01:36.310> it'd<00:01:36.520> be<00:01:36.549> really<00:01:36.640> good<00:01:36.969> for<00:01:37.179> um

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
think it'd be really good for um

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.200 
think it'd be really good for um
machinima<00:01:38.770> videos<00:01:39.100> like<00:01:39.490> stuff<00:01:40.030> like<00:01:40.060> that

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
and just really cool things I think you

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.160

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
could just like put arm on it get a

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.169 
could just like put arm on it get a
bunch<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:44.439> our<00:01:44.590> bar<00:01:44.859> like<00:01:45.549> all<00:01:45.759> your<00:01:45.880> weapons

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
bunch of our bar like all your weapons

stuff<00:01:48.549> at<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:48.850> I<00:01:49.060> think<00:01:49.539> we're<00:01:49.630> really<00:01:49.749> cool

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
stuff at that I think we're really cool

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.929 
stuff at that I think we're really cool
and<00:01:50.259> i'll<00:01:51.189> just<00:01:51.369> see<00:01:51.490> what<00:01:51.609> it<00:01:51.670> looks<00:01:51.789> like

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
and i'll just see what it looks like

and i'll just see what it looks like
with<00:01:52.090> all<00:01:52.210> all<00:01:52.659> of<00:01:52.929> them<00:01:52.990> stuff<00:01:53.319> on<00:01:53.469> it<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
with all all of them stuff on it it

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.129 
with all all of them stuff on it it
somewhat<00:01:55.509> on<00:01:55.630> this<00:01:55.810> one<00:01:56.249> school<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.689> put<00:01:59.020> some

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.139 
somewhat on this one school and put some

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.679 
somewhat on this one school and put some
leather<00:01:59.350> back<00:01:59.590> on<00:01:59.770> this<00:01:59.920> one<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:01.450> puts<00:02:01.600> a

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
leather back on this one just puts a

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.489 
leather back on this one just puts a
random<00:02:01.990> blocks<00:02:02.229> really<00:02:03.869> i<00:02:04.869> think<00:02:05.139> there's<00:02:05.439> a

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
random blocks really i think there's a

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.679 
random blocks really i think there's a
lot<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:05.649> uses<00:02:05.950> myself<00:02:06.639> because<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.329> can<00:02:07.479> i

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
lot of uses myself because you can i

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.809 
lot of uses myself because you can i
think<00:02:07.929> it<00:02:07.990> looks<00:02:08.110> really<00:02:08.140> nice<00:02:08.350> in<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.679> house<00:02:08.890> if

30 my case students another good thing
about<00:02:42.710> this<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.010> they<00:02:43.280> do<00:02:43.490> stack<00:02:43.910> as<00:02:44.120> well<00:02:44.270> as

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
about this is they do stack as well as

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.630 
about this is they do stack as well as
you<00:02:44.480> can<00:02:44.600> just<00:02:44.810> see<00:02:44.960> right<00:02:45.170> there<00:02:45.460> place<00:02:46.460> and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
you can just see right there place and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.580 
you can just see right there place and
all<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.210> those<00:02:47.810> also<00:02:48.320> another

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
all of that and those also another

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.050 
all of that and those also another
really<00:02:48.800> cool<00:02:49.070> thing<00:02:49.130> about<00:02:49.430> these<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.940> can

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
really cool thing about these you can

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.720 
really cool thing about these you can
actually<00:02:50.210> use<00:02:50.570> my<00:02:50.780> stairs<00:02:51.230> like<00:02:51.730> actually

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
actually use my stairs like actually

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.460 
actually use my stairs like actually
like<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:53.420> think<00:02:54.050> there<00:02:54.140> are<00:02:54.170> actually

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
like that I think there are actually

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.020 
like that I think there are actually
really<00:02:54.620> good<00:02:54.710> placement<00:02:55.340> for<00:02:55.490> the<00:02:55.550> stairs<00:02:55.850> at

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
really good placement for the stairs at

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.240 
really good placement for the stairs at
the<00:02:56.120> valence<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.570> game<00:02:56.800> some<00:02:57.800> automakers

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
the valence of the game some automakers

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.550 
the valence of the game some automakers
some<00:02:59.180> stairs<00:02:59.450> I'll<00:02:59.630> just<00:02:59.780> compare<00:03:00.200> them<00:03:00.380> I

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
some stairs I'll just compare them I

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.220 
some stairs I'll just compare them I
mean<00:03:00.920> stairs<00:03:01.280> take<00:03:01.520> up<00:03:01.670> more<00:03:01.880> bricks<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.690> you

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
mean stairs take up more bricks and you

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.590 
mean stairs take up more bricks and you
do<00:03:03.350> get<00:03:03.500> four<00:03:03.770> of<00:03:03.800> them<00:03:04.040> but<00:03:04.250> or<00:03:05.000> anything<00:03:05.360> come

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
do get four of them but or anything come

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.320 
do get four of them but or anything come
these<00:03:06.320> days<00:03:06.760> obviously<00:03:07.760> not<00:03:07.850> stairs<00:03:08.180> the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
these days obviously not stairs the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.700 
these days obviously not stairs the
shells<00:03:08.630> but<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:08.870> think<00:03:09.050> are<00:03:09.140> really<00:03:09.290> good<00:03:09.470> eater

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
shells but I think are really good eater

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.020 
shells but I think are really good eater
native's<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.480> actual<00:03:11.480> shells<00:03:11.750> in<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.080> game<00:03:12.290> co

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
native's to actual shells in the game co

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.300 
native's to actual shells in the game co
difference<00:03:14.030> now<00:03:14.590> there<00:03:15.590> are<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:16.040> lot<00:03:16.280> different

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
difference now there are a lot different

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.460 
difference now there are a lot different
you<00:03:16.790> can<00:03:16.940> see<00:03:17.150> whether<00:03:17.420> these<00:03:18.080> are<00:03:18.140> massive

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
you can see whether these are massive

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.080 
you can see whether these are massive
and<00:03:18.860> these<00:03:19.040> are<00:03:19.190> really<00:03:19.310> cool<00:03:19.520> really<00:03:19.790> good

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
and these are really cool really good

do<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.750> think<00:03:26.870> they<00:03:27.080> should<00:03:27.230> be<00:03:27.320> added<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.620> the

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
do I think they should be added to the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.890 
do I think they should be added to the
game<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:28.220> don't<00:03:28.400> pass<00:03:29.180> myself<00:03:29.720> just<00:03:30.140> because
