 more people and do I'll try is 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.580
 make people think a little bit like 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.780
 It really is that we have one is one. 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.610
 study is a strategy game that is 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.769
 you basically have to improve and not 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.090
 that you have to study hard you have 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.880
 to strive to evolve 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.560
 to get better at it there is 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.300
 certainty is not to be recognized by the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.030
 owner who the largest poker site 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.670
 of the world makes us just want to work 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.190
 increasingly it is to continue the work 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.500
 We 've already been doing this in the qg of teaching 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.430
 little for people is as told by 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.019
 Traffic 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.590
 We will have as games that people 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.750
 will the prizes be a coach will be 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.610
 video-lessons then the idea is to show by 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.049
 because it's a sport because 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.390
 because it is a game of intelligence and 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.769
 skill how does it work for the 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:33.070
 face to person and player to play the game is 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.410
 free're on the farm has a tab in 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.940
 software you go there have home games and 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.950
 How will you find out the number 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.840
 of our home games what is the password for 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.880
 entering each of them is getting 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.579
 Smart is still following the people in the networks. 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.269
 If you're at home you've never played as 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.680
 and that is 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.720
 I would like to have a 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.370
 experience that neither we have here to see 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.250
 how does a tournament of 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.530
 How do you play poker? 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.970
 pokerstars home game follows people 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.610
 on social networks that we will 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.709
 show you all this and if you give 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.140
 lucky they would get there at the end if 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.950
 give it all six still take rewards 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.360
 real 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.390
 so I'm already part of dakar and tim is going 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.530
 more than two years to then with so 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.690
 like the padilha 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.030
 I saw a lot of the team's growth . 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.680
 passed by many see together 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.120
 I think they all pms that we 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.420
 happened in the beginning we are starting 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.030
 to reap some good fruit now is this 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.460
 this pokerstars support has a lot to 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.410
 tell on yourself about these fruits 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.840
 even because we've always focused a lot 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.130
 and we have always focused on 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.190
 lead to knowledgeable people 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.920
 with poker lessons with cults 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.020
 so the ps supporting the owner there 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.970
 supporting is an acknowledgment of this area 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.380
 studies of the work that the 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.510

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.790

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.000

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.560
 It was when he was part of the team he crossed 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.450
 andré cara and that even was a 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.390
 a watershed in my career that 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.820
 before I took the game in a recreational way 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.560
 divide my time between work and 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.940
 poker and there was the great divider of 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.830
 waters in my career from there I 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.169
