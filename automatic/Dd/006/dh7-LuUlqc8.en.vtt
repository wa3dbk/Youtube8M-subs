00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.880
 hello i am safe and welcome to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.270
 Friday number 18 18 free for all 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.490
 Friday and this one will be especially nice 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.480
 I have a class that I myself 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.990
 could pick a challenge from the west 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.790
 cool 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.110
 He said I should charge two 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.960
 take along or shop 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.900
 charges in general and has these 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.430
 even if they throw charges shock 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.660
 and then they run to them 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.100
 pick toss back again go-out 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.690
 pick up and always score at these 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.750
 where I stand with this shock charge 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.449
 then I'm allowed to land and land 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.129
 I know somebody I can not do 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.629
 otherwise it's sort of a move 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.540
 it could read again 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.299

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.820

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.790
