 screaming at him the cries of cry of 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.320
 freedom I think we're already really 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.600
 doing is coming out as really what 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.180
 we plan with this beautiful 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.799
 January 3 inaugurating the season of the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.990

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.860
 expectations with very good frame 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.899
 public with very good weather and the best 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.420
 folk groups of our country 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.090
 just happened to pass tonolec in this 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.710
 moment we should ask for the rider and what 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.899
 which are also the choreographies 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.970
 representation about the history of 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.470
 artigas and the free peoples so 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.080
 So far everything is happening 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.440
 really with a barbarous success it's worth 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.820
 diamond country is doing the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.100
 representations of the entire history of 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.140
 general artigas and everything that was the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.570
 village of the cavalry to get to 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.130
 that the eastern congress living 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.960
 Colombia of the peoples with the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.869
 independence not only from Spain 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.229
 but of all foreign domination 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.569
 I think all the spectators are 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.009
 take a clear idea of â€‹â€‹that 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.130
 story I said because for the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.140
 entrerrianos 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:19.020
 and for those of us who were with the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.360
 peoples the moment of independence by 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.700
 this cry of freedom for tomorrow the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.090
 second night the stellar presence of 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.580
 Jorge Red one of the soloists more 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.800
 acclaimed from Argentina's folklore as well 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.810
 that we expect a lot of people and monday 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.060
 Tuesday and Wednesday until Wednesday 7 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.950
 that this forty-ninth lasts 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.530
 edition of the festival with very good 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.020
 billboard with many reservations in what 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.150
 It is plated with the best genetics in the country 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.100
 and with all the edge that this has 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.590
 festival as in craftsmanship the 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.510
 typical gastronomy there really is a lot 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.640
 to see each one that comes here this 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.770
 diamond festival has many 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.480
 things to see and do what it means 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.160
 for you as a quartermaster 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.760
 It has been reflected in the country through 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.299
 public television 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.909
 this was the quantitative leap 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.180
 because diamond has qualitatively 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:13.840
 a festival of the very first line but 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.750
 we always stayed with the people of the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.700
 region to all the locals and not 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.349
 We could get to the country 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.659
 I think that the public tv is not 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.819
 allowing this festival that 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.620
 there really is no simile anymore 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.359
 only as entrerrianos but as 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.720
 Argentineans can be seen in every corner 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:34.209
 from the country I'm really very 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.739
 grateful to the public tele to the 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.290
 efforts that have been made since the 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.209
 province so that diamond is at 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.720
 same level of any festival 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.720
 national

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.030
 for sale 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.130
 This on your leg is on your margins 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.130

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.830
