00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
there gosh is that all there is to it I

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.310 
there gosh is that all there is to it I
mean<00:03:36.040> is<00:03:36.220> there<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.459> we<00:03:37.120> have<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.450> let<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.690> sit<00:03:38.140> or

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
mean is there a we have to let it sit or

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.699 
mean is there a we have to let it sit or
refrigerate<00:03:39.040> or<00:03:39.070> anything<00:03:40.410> well<00:03:41.410> I'm

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
refrigerate or anything well I'm

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.650 
refrigerate or anything well I'm
imagining<00:03:42.070> it's<00:03:42.459> gonna<00:03:42.549> get<00:03:42.760> stronger<00:03:43.239> as

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
imagining it's gonna get stronger as

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.780 
imagining it's gonna get stronger as
it's<00:03:43.840> it's<00:03:44.110> because<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.680> garlic<00:03:45.100> will<00:03:45.280> infuse

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
it's it's because the garlic will infuse

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.530 
it's it's because the garlic will infuse
into<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.570> liquid<00:03:46.930> uh-huh<00:03:47.680> but<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:48.430> can<00:03:49.239> use<00:03:49.390> it

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
into the liquid uh-huh but it can use it

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.660 
into the liquid uh-huh but it can use it
right<00:03:49.660> away<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.200> if<00:03:51.100> I'm<00:03:51.190> using<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.519> right

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
right away and if I'm using it right

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.330 
right away and if I'm using it right
away<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.910> my<00:03:52.380> straining<00:03:53.380> it<00:03:53.500> or<00:03:53.650> or<00:03:54.040> are<00:03:54.250> we

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
away to my straining it or or are we
