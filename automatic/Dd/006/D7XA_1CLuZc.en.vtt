00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
so my experience with b12 goes back to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.150 
so my experience with b12 goes back to
2010<00:00:36.120> when<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.360> started<00:00:36.780> taking<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.469> had

food<00:00:40.710> diet<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:41.250> well<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.540> wasn't

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
food diet as well but it just wasn't

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
food diet as well but it just wasn't
budging<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.950> when<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> started<00:00:44.940> taking<00:00:45.180> the

seriously
I<00:00:48.450> decided<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.379> notice<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.920> difference<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.640> my

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
I decided to notice a difference in my

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.160 
I decided to notice a difference in my
cellulite<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:52.050> was<00:00:52.340> creaming<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.520> my<00:00:53.789> leg

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
cellulite it was creaming up my leg

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.830 
cellulite it was creaming up my leg
literally<00:00:55.170> from<00:00:55.469> down<00:00:55.739> my<00:00:55.980> leg<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.940> up<00:00:57.239> behind

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
literally from down my leg to up behind

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.410 
literally from down my leg to up behind
my<00:00:58.140> back<00:00:58.320> side<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.250> was<00:00:59.489> creeping<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.180> as

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
my back side so it was creeping up as

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.380 
my back side so it was creeping up as
the<00:01:01.379> months<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> then<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.670> years<00:01:02.969> went<00:01:03.300> by

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
the months and then the years went by

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.640 
the months and then the years went by
and<00:01:03.930> now<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.769> gone<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.390> can't<00:01:06.840> say<00:01:07.140> for

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
and now it's gone so I can't say for

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.399 
and now it's gone so I can't say for
sure<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> b12<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> b12

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
sure that it was a b12 just the b12

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.770 
sure that it was a b12 just the b12
because<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.549> always<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> group<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
because it's always like a group of

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.830 
because it's always like a group of
things<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:14.070> contribute<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.450> sort<00:01:15.750> of

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
things that contribute to this sort of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
things that contribute to this sort of
improvement<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.950> what<00:01:17.189> was<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.400> doing

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
improvement so what was I doing

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.320 
improvement so what was I doing
how<00:01:18.150> much<00:01:18.330> was<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.600> taking<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.140> was<00:01:19.439> taking

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
how much was a taking I was taking

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.039 
how much was a taking I was taking
hydroxocobalamin

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
hydroxocobalamin

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.440 
hydroxocobalamin
but<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.740> take<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.220> method<00:01:23.909> bell<00:01:24.180> wine

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
but you can take like method bell wine

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.440 
but you can take like method bell wine
or<00:01:24.780> cider<00:01:25.229> cabal<00:01:25.680> line<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.549> apparently<00:01:27.119> like

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
or cider cabal line but apparently like

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.740 
or cider cabal line but apparently like
hydroxo<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.770> methyl<00:01:29.759> cobalamin<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
hydroxo and methyl cobalamin are the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.469 
hydroxo and methyl cobalamin are the
best<00:01:31.159> just<00:01:32.159> get<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.729> get<00:01:33.000> because

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
best just get what you can get because

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.080 
best just get what you can get because
they've<00:01:34.079> all<00:01:34.200> got<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> pretty<00:01:34.560> good<00:01:34.740> rapport<00:01:35.340> so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
they've all got a pretty good rapport so

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.950 
they've all got a pretty good rapport so
I<00:01:36.119> was<00:01:36.659> taking<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.070> day<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.909> week<00:01:39.119> at<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
I was taking one a day for a week at the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.010 
I was taking one a day for a week at the
start<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.159> was<00:01:41.280> hating<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.450> week

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
start and then I was hating one a week

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.639 
start and then I was hating one a week
for<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> month<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.070> then<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.299> month<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.590> I

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
for a month and then one a month but I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.620 
for a month and then one a month but I
haven't<00:01:47.070> had<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.579> know<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.970> usually<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.600> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
haven't had you know like usually now I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.719 
haven't had you know like usually now I
would<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.290> probably<00:01:49.500> one<00:01:49.979> every<00:01:50.340> couple<00:01:50.670> of

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
would have probably one every couple of

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.090 
would have probably one every couple of
months<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.110> don't<00:01:52.350> need<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:52.710> much<00:01:52.860> because

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
months so I don't need as much because

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.819 
months so I don't need as much because
my<00:01:53.399> stores<00:01:53.850> are<00:01:54.060> topped<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.530> when<00:01:55.740> you

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
my stores are topped up so when you

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.870 
my stores are topped up so when you
don't<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.340> enough<00:01:56.790> b12<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.810> your<00:01:58.530> body<00:01:58.880> your

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
don't have enough b12 in your body your

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.249 
don't have enough b12 in your body your
body<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.540> out<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.689> balance

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
body is going to be out of balance

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:01.550 
body is going to be out of balance
it's

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
it's

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.410 
it's
you<00:02:01.829> an<00:02:01.920> efficient<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.460> anything<00:02:03.000> your<00:02:03.390> body

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
you an efficient and anything your body

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
you an efficient and anything your body
is<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:04.079> going<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.439> functioning<00:02:05.100> optimally

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
is not going to be functioning optimally

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.660 
is not going to be functioning optimally
so<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.390> want<00:02:06.720> your<00:02:07.009> levels<00:02:08.009> up<00:02:08.340> with

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so you want your levels up with

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.339 
so you want your levels up with
everything<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.239> want<00:02:09.390> them<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> healthy

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
everything you want them up to a healthy

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.309 
everything you want them up to a healthy
range<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.730> that's<00:02:11.940> why<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.750> know<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.900> had<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.260> do

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
range so that's why you know I had to do

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.199 
range so that's why you know I had to do
the<00:02:13.440> issue<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.980> obviously<00:02:14.340> wasn't<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
the issue I obviously wasn't in the

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.990 
the issue I obviously wasn't in the
healthy<00:02:15.540> range<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.230> now<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:16.739> am<00:02:17.040> I've<00:02:17.340> been<00:02:17.640> fat

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
healthy range and now I am I've been fat

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000 
healthy range and now I am I've been fat
more<00:02:18.269> efficiently<00:02:18.410> so<00:02:19.410> that's<00:02:19.560> what<00:02:19.709> happens

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
more efficiently so that's what happens

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.949 
more efficiently so that's what happens
if<00:02:20.130> you're<00:02:20.280> deficient<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.910> b12<00:02:21.090> your

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
if you're deficient in b12 your

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.220 
if you're deficient in b12 your
metabolism<00:02:22.709> can<00:02:22.920> be<00:02:23.099> load<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.330> may<00:02:25.050> not

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
metabolism can be load and you may not

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.740 
metabolism can be load and you may not
be<00:02:25.410> burning<00:02:25.890> fat<00:02:26.280> as<00:02:26.489> efficiently<00:02:27.180> or<00:02:27.569> you

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
be burning fat as efficiently or you

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.229 
be burning fat as efficiently or you
won't<00:02:27.959> be<00:02:28.140> burning<00:02:28.470> fat<00:02:28.800> as<00:02:29.010> efficiently<00:02:29.519> so

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
won't be burning fat as efficiently so

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.570 
won't be burning fat as efficiently so
if<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.200> say<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.620> know<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.860> doctors<00:02:32.190> any<00:02:32.370> good

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
if you say you know the doctors any good

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.970 
if you say you know the doctors any good
test<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.420> get<00:02:33.569> like<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.900> standard<00:02:34.319> serum<00:02:34.799> b12

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
test you get like the standard serum b12

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.180 
test you get like the standard serum b12

problems like myself you know like
Crohn's<00:03:26.370> or<00:03:26.670> colitis<00:03:27.239> or<00:03:27.810> something<00:03:28.260> like

Crohn's or colitis or something like

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.830 
Crohn's or colitis or something like
that<00:03:28.620> then<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.519> are<00:03:29.549> probably<00:03:29.970> not<00:03:30.389> going<00:03:30.630> to

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
that then you are probably not going to

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.620 
that then you are probably not going to
absorb<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.590> b12<00:03:31.769> so<00:03:32.700> if<00:03:32.819> you<00:03:32.910> like<00:03:33.060> heaves<00:03:33.359> and

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
absorb the b12 so if you like heaves and

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.150 
absorb the b12 so if you like heaves and
heaps<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.959> know<00:03:34.019> circulating<00:03:34.769> around<00:03:34.859> in

heaps you know circulating around in
your<00:03:35.280> body<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:36.120> doesn't<00:03:36.389> matter<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:37.049> know<00:03:37.139> if

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
your body it doesn't matter you know if

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.009 
your body it doesn't matter you know if
you<00:03:37.380> can't<00:03:37.650> absorb<00:03:38.069> it<00:03:38.280> then<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.720> are<00:03:39.870> not

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
you can't absorb it then you are not

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.509 
you can't absorb it then you are not
you're<00:03:40.170> going<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.319> be<00:03:40.380> b12<00:03:40.829> deficient<00:03:41.370> and

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
you're going to be b12 deficient and

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.620 
you're going to be b12 deficient and
it's<00:03:42.090> been<00:03:42.239> shown<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:43.130> think<00:03:44.130> it's<00:03:44.250> about

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
it's been shown that I think it's about

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.050 
it's been shown that I think it's about
50%<00:03:45.630> of<00:03:45.810> Americans<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.799> b12<00:03:47.220> deficient<00:03:47.880> and

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
50% of Americans a b12 deficient and

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.970 
50% of Americans a b12 deficient and
that's<00:03:48.600> only<00:03:48.900> other<00:03:49.350> people<00:03:49.620> who've<00:03:49.829> been

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
that's only other people who've been

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.259 
that's only other people who've been
tested<00:03:50.959> 50%<00:03:51.959> is<00:03:52.109> huge<00:03:52.680> okay<00:03:53.459> so<00:03:53.519> it's<00:03:53.819> likely

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
tested 50% is huge okay so it's likely

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.330 
tested 50% is huge okay so it's likely
you<00:03:54.480> probably<00:03:54.510> do<00:03:55.170> have<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.680> deficiency

above<00:05:00.970> all<00:05:01.270> other<00:05:01.570> methods<00:05:01.840> is<00:05:02.260> because<00:05:02.590> they

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
above all other methods is because they

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.060 
above all other methods is because they
bypass<00:05:03.640> the<00:05:03.970> digestive<00:05:04.720> system<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:05.740> go

bypass the digestive system and go

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.100 
bypass the digestive system and go
