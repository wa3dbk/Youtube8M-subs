00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
I'm just like how let's do again what

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:01.899 
I'm just like how let's do again what
made<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:00.979> feel<00:02:01.280> like<00:02:01.369> he<00:02:01.520> didn't<00:02:01.700> know<00:02:01.729> how<00:02:01.850> to

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
made you feel like he didn't know how to

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.090 
made you feel like he didn't know how to
fight<00:02:02.150> Zed<00:02:02.420> won't<00:02:02.600> be<00:02:02.689> one<00:02:02.840> oh<00:02:03.049> he's<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:03.740> scared

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
for some reason so I guess that means he

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.550 
for some reason so I guess that means he
doesn't<00:02:07.970> know<00:02:08.179> how<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.329> play<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.200> match<00:02:09.349> up
