before I started working I conditioned

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:34.650 
before I started working I conditioned
my<00:00:32.739> hands<00:00:33.190> with<00:00:33.399> our<00:00:33.670> product<00:00:34.120> called<00:00:34.300> slick

my hands with our product called slick

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.310 
my hands with our product called slick
so<00:00:34.929> that<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.199> clay<00:00:35.379> doesn't<00:00:35.589> stick

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
with off of the main ball and then I put

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.880 
with off of the main ball and then I put
the<00:00:46.180> rest<00:00:46.420> of<00:00:46.600> it<00:00:46.750> wrapped<00:00:47.230> up<00:00:47.440> in<00:00:47.680> plastic

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890

the rest of it wrapped up in plastic
wrap<00:00:48.430> and<00:00:48.610> then<00:00:48.790> I've<00:00:48.940> put<00:00:49.210> that<00:00:49.390> under<00:00:49.660> my

wrap and then I've put that under my

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.930 
wrap and then I've put that under my
sandbag<00:00:50.290> just<00:00:50.650> to<00:00:50.830> keep<00:00:51.250> it<00:00:51.400> closed

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
sandbag just to keep it closed

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
experience with pmc sterling I was

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.259 
experience with pmc sterling I was
anxious<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:57.949> see<00:00:58.309> how<00:00:58.550> this<00:00:58.699> was<00:00:58.910> different

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
anxious to see how this was different

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.150 
anxious to see how this was different
from<00:00:59.420> some<00:00:59.809> of<00:00:59.899> the<00:00:59.960> other<00:01:00.140> forms<00:01:00.589> and<00:01:00.800> it

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
from some of the other forms and it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.970 
from some of the other forms and it
really<00:01:01.430> does<00:01:01.670> have<00:01:02.000> its<00:01:02.360> own<00:01:02.899> feel<00:01:03.500> just<00:01:03.920> like

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
really does have its own feel just like

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.649 
really does have its own feel just like
each<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.549> other<00:01:04.729> plays<00:01:05.089> have<00:01:05.360> their<00:01:05.540> own

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659

each of the other plays have their own
feel<00:01:05.960> I<00:01:06.229> like<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.100> one<00:01:07.340> a<00:01:07.400> lot<00:01:07.670> it's<00:01:08.090> got<00:01:08.360> a

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
feel I like this one a lot it's got a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.440 
feel I like this one a lot it's got a
lot<00:01:08.869> of<00:01:08.900> good<00:01:09.200> properties<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.399> it<00:01:10.549> but<00:01:11.149> watch

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
lot of good properties to it but watch

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.450 
lot of good properties to it but watch
what<00:01:11.659> happens<00:01:12.080> here<00:01:12.170> what<00:01:12.470> I<00:01:12.500> did<00:01:12.619> was<00:01:13.159> I<00:01:13.430> made

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
what happens here what I did was I made

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.120 
what happens here what I did was I made
a<00:01:13.759> little<00:01:14.180> strip<00:01:14.540> I<00:01:14.869> rolled<00:01:15.440> it<00:01:15.530> down<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.920> five

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
a little strip I rolled it down to five

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.969 
a little strip I rolled it down to five
cards<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:16.940> then<00:01:17.659> now<00:01:17.899> I'm<00:01:18.080> going<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:18.470> texture

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
cards and then now I'm going to texture

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.779 
cards and then now I'm going to texture
it<00:01:19.009> with<00:01:19.250> one<00:01:19.549> card<00:01:19.909> of<00:01:20.149> texture<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.789> just

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
it with one card of texture and just

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.210 
it with one card of texture and just
like<00:01:22.940> always<00:01:23.180> I<00:01:23.390> sprayed<00:01:24.200> some<00:01:24.229> cool<00:01:24.740> slip<00:01:25.009> on

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
like always I sprayed some cool slip on

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.889 
like always I sprayed some cool slip on
the<00:01:25.310> texture<00:01:25.759> so<00:01:25.970> that<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.149> doesn't<00:01:26.539> stick<00:01:26.750> to

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
the texture so that it doesn't stick to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.410 
the texture so that it doesn't stick to
the<00:01:26.929> clay<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.429> cool<00:01:28.640> slip<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:28.970> actually

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
the clay and the cool slip is actually

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.930 
the clay and the cool slip is actually
still<00:01:29.720> wet<00:01:29.960> on<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.289> surface<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:31.069> was<00:01:31.640> really

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
still wet on the surface I was really

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.460 
still wet on the surface I was really
surprised<00:01:32.300> because<00:01:32.420> normally<00:01:32.960> metal<00:01:33.259> clays

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
surprised because normally metal clays

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.100 
surprised because normally metal clays
just<00:01:33.740> fall<00:01:33.979> right<00:01:34.250> off<00:01:34.280> of<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.789> texture<00:01:35.300> when<00:01:36.080> I

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
just fall right off of a texture when I

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.980 
just fall right off of a texture when I
put<00:01:36.440> cool<00:01:36.649> slip<00:01:36.890> on<00:01:37.069> it<00:01:37.280> but<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:37.909> pmc<00:01:38.479> sterling

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
put cool slip on it but the pmc sterling

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.410 
put cool slip on it but the pmc sterling
really<00:01:39.500> stuck<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:39.860> it<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.490> what<00:01:41.000> this<00:01:41.119> tells

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
really stuck to it and what this tells

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.480 
really stuck to it and what this tells
me<00:01:41.569> is<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:41.899> if<00:01:42.110> I<00:01:42.380> want<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.679> texture<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.250> clay

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
me is that if I want to texture the clay

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.310 
me is that if I want to texture the clay
I<00:01:43.729> need<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.090> condition<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.690> first

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.109 

the<00:01:48.320> way<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.530> condition<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.159> clay<00:01:49.430> is<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.970> make

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
the way to condition the clay is to make

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.960 
the way to condition the clay is to make
it<00:01:50.270> into<00:01:50.540> a<00:01:50.600> patty<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.260> then<00:01:51.890> rub<00:01:52.190> slick<00:01:52.760> on

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
it into a patty and then rub slick on

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.510 
it into a patty and then rub slick on
one<00:01:53.299> side<00:01:53.659> of<00:01:53.690> it<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.110> then<00:01:54.320> work<00:01:55.010> that<00:01:55.280> in

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
one side of it and then work that in

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:04.090

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.550

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.059

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
wants to hop right up so I'm going to do

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.690 
wants to hop right up so I'm going to do
this<00:02:21.379> one<00:02:21.620> more<00:02:21.650> time<00:02:21.860> that's<00:02:22.370> going<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:22.580> get

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
this one more time that's going to get

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.800 
this one more time that's going to get
that<00:02:22.849> slick<00:02:23.150> really<00:02:23.930> worked<00:02:24.260> in<00:02:24.530> there<00:02:25.720> put<00:02:26.720> it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810

that slick really worked in there put it
between<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.110> plastic<00:02:27.410> I'm<00:02:28.340> going<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.550> roll

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
between the plastic I'm going to roll

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:36.210 
between the plastic I'm going to roll
this<00:02:28.819> down<00:02:29.030> just<00:02:29.420> as<00:02:29.540> flat<00:02:29.810> as<00:02:29.989> I<00:02:30.080> can<00:02:30.260> get<00:02:30.410> it

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.970 

then<00:02:37.220> I'll<00:02:37.340> open<00:02:37.459> this<00:02:37.730> up<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.739> gather<00:02:39.739> the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
then I'll open this up and gather the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.949 
then I'll open this up and gather the
clay<00:02:40.190> up<00:02:40.340> into<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.700> ball

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.050 

any<00:02:47.470> bits<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:47.860> are<00:02:47.980> left<00:02:48.220> on<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.640> plastic

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
any bits that are left on the plastic

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.640 
any bits that are left on the plastic
can<00:02:49.209> be<00:02:49.299> picked<00:02:49.569> up<00:02:49.689> using<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.200> ball<00:02:50.349> of<00:02:50.379> clay

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
can be picked up using the ball of clay

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.080 
can be picked up using the ball of clay
and<00:02:52.260> now<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.470> clay<00:02:53.739> is<00:02:54.010> conditioned<00:02:54.849> and

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
and now this clay is conditioned and

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.479 
and now this clay is conditioned and
ready<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.510> work<00:02:55.900> now<00:02:56.650> one<00:02:56.860> thing<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.099> keep<00:02:57.340> in

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
ready to work now one thing to keep in

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.490 
ready to work now one thing to keep in
mind<00:02:57.549> is<00:02:57.849> that<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.150> only<00:02:58.420> condition<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.260> clay

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
mind is that you only condition the clay

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.830 
mind is that you only condition the clay
once<00:02:59.799> don't<00:03:00.549> condition<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.150> every<00:03:01.450> time<00:03:01.659> you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
once don't condition it every time you

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.369 
once don't condition it every time you
use<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.170> I'll<00:03:03.010> go<00:03:03.280> over<00:03:03.459> in<00:03:03.819> some<00:03:04.150> later<00:03:04.840> videos

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
use it I'll go over in some later videos

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.770 
use it I'll go over in some later videos
on<00:03:05.739> how<00:03:06.129> to<00:03:06.159> rehydrate<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.299> clay<00:03:07.510> if<00:03:07.629> it

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
on how to rehydrate the clay if it

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.199 
on how to rehydrate the clay if it
starts<00:03:08.109> getting<00:03:08.290> dry<00:03:08.799> but<00:03:09.670> just<00:03:09.879> keep<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.180> mind

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
starts getting dry but just keep in mind

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.330 
starts getting dry but just keep in mind
that<00:03:10.569> you<00:03:10.659> only<00:03:10.689> want<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.470> condition<00:03:11.859> at<00:03:12.129> one

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
that you only want to condition at one

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.149 
that you only want to condition at one
time<00:03:12.989> there<00:03:13.989> are<00:03:14.019> times<00:03:14.319> when<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.620> don't<00:03:14.920> need

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
time there are times when you don't need

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.670 
time there are times when you don't need
to<00:03:15.400> condition<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.150> clay<00:03:16.420> if<00:03:16.689> I'm<00:03:17.260> going<00:03:17.560> to

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
to condition the clay if I'm going to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.440 
to condition the clay if I'm going to
just<00:03:17.890> make<00:03:18.069> a<00:03:18.280> mold<00:03:18.549> out<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:18.849> it<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.239> push<00:03:19.420> it

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
just make a mold out of it it push it

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.110 
just make a mold out of it it push it
into<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:19.959> silicone<00:03:20.620> mold<00:03:20.859> I<00:03:21.190> don't<00:03:21.819> need<00:03:22.000> to

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
into a silicone mold I don't need to

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.640 
into a silicone mold I don't need to
condition<00:03:22.389> it<00:03:22.659> for<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:22.959> because<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.440> doesn't

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
condition it for that because it doesn't

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.910 
condition it for that because it doesn't
stick<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.190> silicone<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.260> rolled<00:03:26.530> my<00:03:26.590> slab

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
stick to silicone so I rolled my slab

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.460 
stick to silicone so I rolled my slab
down<00:03:27.159> to<00:03:27.340> five<00:03:27.579> cards<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.239> now<00:03:28.810> I'm<00:03:29.109> going<00:03:29.349> to

texture it I noticed that the clay

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.780 
texture it I noticed that the clay
wanted<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.170> stick<00:03:32.409> to<00:03:32.560> my<00:03:32.680> roller<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.639> I'm
