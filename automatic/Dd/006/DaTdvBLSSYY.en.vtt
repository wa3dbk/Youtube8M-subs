these wheels and when you let up when

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.630 
these wheels and when you let up when
you<00:02:03.600> release<00:02:04.070> you're<00:02:05.070> not<00:02:05.219> going<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> leave<00:02:05.579> a

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you release you're not going to leave a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.930 
you release you're not going to leave a
high<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.560> when<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.710> roll<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.610> wheel

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
high and so when you roll this wheel

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.570 
high and so when you roll this wheel
back<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.239> forth<00:02:09.660> in

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
back and forth in

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.330 
back and forth in
to<00:02:10.759> navigate<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.330> find<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.810> low<00:02:12.230> on<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.160> Dan

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
to navigate to find the low on the Dan

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.120 
to navigate to find the low on the Dan
you<00:02:14.240> can<00:02:14.420> read<00:02:14.750> where<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.380> tip<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.740> tool<00:02:15.920> is

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
you can read where the tip the tool is

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.970 
you can read where the tip the tool is
easier<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.850> that's<00:02:17.120> that's<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.990> big<00:02:18.290> thing<00:02:18.560> so

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
easier and that's that's a big thing so

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.400

but<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.640> misnomer<00:02:20.150> about<00:02:20.180> these<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:20.960> you

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
but the misnomer about these is that you

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.440 
but the misnomer about these is that you
really<00:02:21.740> don't<00:02:22.010> roll<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.640> Dan<00:02:22.820> out<00:02:23.030> with<00:02:23.300> these

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
tips okay what you do is you actually

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.840 
tips okay what you do is you actually
push<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.470> Dan<00:02:27.710> out<00:02:27.950> okay<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:28.460> you're

and it's it's it's it's also doubles as

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.590 
and it's it's it's it's also doubles as
a<00:03:15.560> case<00:03:15.830> so<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:16.519> whole<00:03:16.700> thing<00:03:16.730> will<00:03:17.120> fold<00:03:17.390> up

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
a case so this whole thing will fold up

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.990 
a case so this whole thing will fold up
into<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:18.050> case<00:03:18.410> all<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.400> parts<00:03:19.700> and<00:03:19.790> pieces

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
into a case all the parts and pieces

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.220 
into a case all the parts and pieces
will<00:03:20.330> actually<00:03:20.660> fit<00:03:20.959> inside<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.780> inside

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
will actually fit inside the the inside

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.390 
will actually fit inside the the inside
of<00:03:24.350> this<00:03:24.440> case<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.890> you<00:03:24.950> can<00:03:25.100> carry<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.370> around

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
of this case and you can carry it around

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.030 
of this case and you can carry it around
it<00:03:25.580> weighs<00:03:25.700> 40<00:03:26.090> pounds<00:03:26.380> that's<00:03:27.380> interesting<00:03:27.950> I
