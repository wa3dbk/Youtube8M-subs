chamber muffler and eventually comes out

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.549 
chamber muffler and eventually comes out
here<00:00:31.609> but<00:00:32.609> Porsche<00:00:32.969> did<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:34.079> give<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.410> little

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
here but Porsche did to give it a little

here but Porsche did to give it a little
dual<00:00:34.890> sound<00:00:35.250> as<00:00:35.489> they<00:00:35.670> switch<00:00:36.059> from<00:00:36.239> the

dual sound as they switch from the
dashboard<00:00:36.540> he<00:00:37.050> took<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> little<00:00:37.530> pipe<00:00:38.010> like

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
dashboard he took a little pipe like

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.459 
dashboard he took a little pipe like
this<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.790> they<00:00:38.850> connected<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.469> exhaust

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
this and they connected the exhaust

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.200 
this and they connected the exhaust
coming<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> exhaust<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:42.059> but

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
coming in to the exhaust going out but

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.420 
coming in to the exhaust going out but
it's<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> tiny<00:00:42.690> little<00:00:42.840> pinnacle<00:00:43.469> pipe<00:00:43.710> they

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it's a tiny little pinnacle pipe they

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670 
it's a tiny little pinnacle pipe they
call<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> Porsche<00:00:45.239> PSC<00:00:45.870> sporting<00:00:46.440> Swift

added<00:00:49.559> no<00:00:49.680> horsepower<00:00:50.250> torque<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:51.570> it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
added no horsepower torque but it

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.299 
added no horsepower torque but it
sounded<00:00:51.989> little<00:00:52.200> better<00:00:52.379> than<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.770> tiny<00:00:53.010> pipe

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
sounded little better than a tiny pipe

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.160 
sounded little better than a tiny pipe
obviously<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> tiny<00:00:54.149> pipe<00:00:54.390> can't<00:00:54.690> breathe<00:00:54.930> as

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
obviously the tiny pipe can't breathe as

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.880 
obviously the tiny pipe can't breathe as
well<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.940> fast<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.480> motorsport<00:00:58.050> looking<00:00:58.739> for
