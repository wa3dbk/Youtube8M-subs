00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 the previous video explains what 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.010
 were the words yes no 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.840
 and now in this video I want to explain 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.750
 the words anthony most normally 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.640
 these two concepts are explained at the same time 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.290
 but I wanted to make a video 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.570
 specific for each one of them for 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.450
 that the words are clearer to you 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.690
 anthony more are those that mean 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.269
 the opposite or the opposite 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.579
 for example if I say April the verb 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.649
 April what would be the opposite close 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.589
 open a door for the opposite of 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.180
 to open a door would be to close a door 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:51.170
 if I say for example with the adjective 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.489
 Of course, the opposite would be dark 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.129
 well, these two would also be 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.299
 anthony words more must be said that 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.299
 the words anthony more 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.620
 it does not look like anything in the way it is 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.150
 Open and close are two words 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.600
 totally different clear and dark 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.550
 also but there are times that they seem 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.910
 very much because they form only 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.900
 adding a prefix a prefix is 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.600
 they are a set of letters 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.510
 that are put in front of the word here 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.150
 we have written the prefixes that 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.800
 used sometimes does not work at all 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.320
 the words works not only in some 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.630
 to create more anthony words if they are 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.180
 these 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.860
 it's anti i and iii and I put them here for 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.630
 that you have them in mind then to the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.240
 exercises that we do already you will see that to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.909
 Sometimes they are used and sometimes not good 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.170
 to start I have already given you some example 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.670
 but let's see the examples that are 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.270
 on the blackboard that will surely help you 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.860
 understand them better to see you here we have 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.539
 different good pairs of words and 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.549
 they are all anthony more since 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.310
 have opposite meanings let's see 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.030
 the pri 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.030
 high 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.920
 Well, if it were the opposite, it would be 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.420
 under this would be the first example 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.910
 modern 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.870
 what is the opposite of modern old 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.030
 far example that that house was 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.310
 very far if it were otherwise 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.950
 this house is very close because far 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.290
 opposite up close 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.959
 hard something that is very hard because the 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.599
 otherwise it would be soft we go for these 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.970
 up something that is up if it is 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:35.819
 otherwise it will be down 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.920
 dirty clean white 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.579
 the white is a color that fits your 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.010
 opposite color is the black full example 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.290
 the straw was full of candy 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.359
 if it's the opposite of full it would be empty 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.010
 or be empty full with these are the 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.810
 examples that are written but there are 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.400
 many more 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.530
 and I propose to you to make a 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.140
 this exercise that you have here below 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.540
 I've put six words and I want you 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.349
 look for the antonym word for each one 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.700
 of them 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.230
 I leave you a few seconds so that 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.230
 think and correct it right away 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.630
 all right 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.489
 Y 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.570
 i 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.570
 all right 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.680
 you have already thought about it, let's see if 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.580
 you have done well 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.580
 big what would be the opposite of big 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.580
 small 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.390
 it may be that he has arranged for another 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.209
 word and that is correct that I want 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.040
 to say that there is not always one single 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.769
 word antonio ma for another there are cases 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.830
 yes but there are others that do not for example 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.650
 big something big if it's the opposite or 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.420
 be a synonym of small to one that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.610
 it is also big contrary could be 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.049
 tiny would also be an antonio like that 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.670
 that would be correct and if that has 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.200
 happened some other safer than 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.280
 It can also be good tee it 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.590
 I would have to check in the dictionary 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.890
 ask me what in the comments 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.300
 from a dotcom teacher's website 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.489
 place 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.430
 this is one of these words that he 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.010
 so that it looks like the antonym we need 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.850
 one of the prepositions us one 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.870
 of the prefixes that I have told you 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:32.689
 which do you think is 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:37.279
 in place to place misplaced 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:38.280
 placing just putting the prefix 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.170
 is 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.270
 we would do the word antonym so 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.430
 so much in this case it is in these cases that 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.170
 I told you that they are words that are almost 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.240
 same or are the two words have 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.060
 place but antonio to the contrary 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.820
 only the prefix of des follows 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.820
 noise noise silence 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.350
 Useful 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.350
 this also goes with useless prefix 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.689
 opposing war of war 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.949
 If two countries are at war, if that's what 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.879
 otherwise they are not at war how 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.879
 will be at peace 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.840
 and ordered also prefixed this 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.840
 it would be messy 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.690
 good and this I've done a few 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.370
 examples so you can better understand what 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.460
 are the words anthony more I hope that 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.660
 they have served you but if you want to continue 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.430
 practicing with these words in 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.680
 our website a dotcom teacher I have 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.140
 put a series of exercises with the 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.820
 that you will see many more examples and 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.260
 not only the ones that I have put here in the 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.890
 blackboard we have already dealt with in the election 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.150
 from today 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.890
 Well, I hope I served you 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.890
 this class and see you in the next
