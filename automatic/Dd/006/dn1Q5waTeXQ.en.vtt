in<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.800> they're<00:00:46.890> parallel<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.579> each

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
in here and they're parallel with each

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.580 
in here and they're parallel with each
other<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.329> what<00:00:48.660> they<00:00:48.780> are<00:00:48.989> they're<00:00:49.289> made<00:00:49.440> of

other and what they are they're made of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.970 
other and what they are they're made of
like<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.730> plastic<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.809> material<00:00:52.350> which<00:00:52.949> is

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
like like a plastic on material which is

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.529 
like like a plastic on material which is
strange<00:00:53.489> because<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.940> think<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.210> rubber

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
strange because you think that rubber

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.479 
strange because you think that rubber
braylon's<00:00:54.960> would<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.350> made<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.860> rubber

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
braylon's would be made of like rubber

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.119 
braylon's would be made of like rubber
so<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.000> stops<00:00:57.270> your<00:00:57.420> ipod<00:00:57.780> from<00:00:57.930> sliding<00:00:58.260> but

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
so it stops your ipod from sliding but

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.709 
snapped this part and he was trying to
put<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.060> into<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> USB<00:01:56.000> slot<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.479> this

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
put it into a USB slot just like this

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.929 
put it into a USB slot just like this
and<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.920> cracked<00:01:59.250> so

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and they put in it just cracked so

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.330 
and they put in it just cracked so
that's<00:02:00.869> another<00:02:01.140> issue<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:02.009> may<00:02:02.159> want

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
that's another issue that you may want

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.069 
that's another issue that you may want
to<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.490> wary<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.060> um<00:02:04.909> but<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.960> can

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
to be wary of um but as you can

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.109 
to be wary of um but as you can
obviously<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> two-piece<00:02:08.550> case<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
obviously this is a two-piece case and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.000 
obviously this is a two-piece case and
like<00:02:10.080> most<00:02:10.319> sliders<00:02:10.739> are

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
like most sliders are

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.500 
like most sliders are
I<00:02:12.069> think<00:02:12.549> all<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.700> them<00:02:12.819> are<00:02:12.939> actually<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.360> was

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
I think all of them are actually I was

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.569 
I think all of them are actually I was
gifted<00:02:13.870> but<00:02:15.269> let<00:02:16.269> me<00:02:16.329> go<00:02:16.510> over<00:02:16.750> like<00:02:16.959> the
