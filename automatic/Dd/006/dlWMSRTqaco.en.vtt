whole thing because you have this little

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.370 
whole thing because you have this little
clip<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.430> goes<00:01:20.759> inside<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.210> itself<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.810> this

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.390 

that<00:01:41.320> should<00:01:41.560> do<00:01:41.710> is<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.860> I've<00:01:44.950> taken<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.280> off

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
that should do is so I've taken it off

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.120 
that should do is so I've taken it off
at<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.610> bottom<00:01:45.790> first<00:01:46.380> done<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:47.590> might<00:01:47.979> make

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
at the bottom first done that might make

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.480 
at the bottom first done that might make
things<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.400> little<00:01:48.460> bit<00:01:48.610> easier<00:01:53.190> again<00:01:54.190> this<00:01:54.310> is

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
things a little bit easier again this is

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.820 
things a little bit easier again this is
all<00:01:54.640> trial<00:01:54.880> error<00:01:55.149> I'm<00:01:55.659> using<00:01:55.899> the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
all trial error I'm using the

all trial error I'm using the
screwdriver<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.460> pill<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:58.000> apart<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.780> to

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
screwdriver to pill it apart and to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.910 
screwdriver to pill it apart and to
start<00:02:00.310> separating<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.880> from<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.060> bottom<00:02:01.920> turn

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
start separating it from the bottom turn

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.830 
start separating it from the bottom turn
it<00:02:03.009> over<00:02:03.100> upside<00:02:03.310> down<00:02:03.670> but<00:02:04.420> again<00:02:04.540> these

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
it over upside down but again these

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.520 
starting to separate from the top and
bottom<00:02:36.660> give<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.870> little<00:02:37.989> more<00:02:38.170> slack

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
bottom give this a little more slack

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.740 
bottom give this a little more slack
when<00:02:38.800> I'm<00:02:38.890> going<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.069> bring<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.430> around<00:02:39.750> take

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
when I'm going to bring it around take

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:52.130 
when I'm going to bring it around take
it<00:02:40.870> apart<00:02:41.110> from<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.440> other<00:02:41.590> side<00:02:41.799> I<00:02:42.420> hope

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.399 

there<00:02:53.140> we<00:02:53.260> are<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.650> do<00:02:54.579> want<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.819> come<00:02:54.969> here<00:02:55.200> hi

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
there we are I do want to come here hi

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.500 
there we are I do want to come here hi
so<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.980> forget<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:57.879> point<00:02:58.120> there's<00:02:58.390> this

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
so I forget to this point there's this

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.589 
so I forget to this point there's this
hose<00:02:58.780> that's<00:02:59.109> down<00:02:59.319> here<00:02:59.590> inside<00:03:00.219> of<00:03:00.280> it

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
hose that's down here inside of it

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.550 
hose that's down here inside of it
that's<00:03:01.599> our<00:03:01.750> that's<00:03:01.780> attached<00:03:02.319> right<00:03:02.500> here

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
that's our that's attached right here

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.280 
that's our that's attached right here
you'll<00:03:03.040> just<00:03:03.129> take<00:03:03.430> this<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.909> lift<00:03:04.659> up<00:03:04.989> and

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
you'll just take this and lift up and

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.149 
you'll just take this and lift up and
then<00:03:06.159> this<00:03:06.459> will<00:03:06.849> come<00:03:06.909> off<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.920> side

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
then this will come off so to the side

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.539 
then this will come off so to the side
and<00:03:10.030> now<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.540> have<00:03:11.079> access<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.829> all<00:03:12.310> the

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
and now you have access to all the

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:20.849 
and now you have access to all the
different<00:03:12.879> working<00:03:13.150> pieces<00:03:13.359> in<00:03:13.689> here<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.989> if

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
different working pieces in here and if

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.559 
different working pieces in here and if
you're<00:03:21.040> having<00:03:21.340> water<00:03:21.760> leakage<00:03:22.209> from<00:03:22.239> the

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
you're having water leakage from the

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.110 
you're having water leakage from the
bottom<00:03:23.230> do<00:03:23.829> not<00:03:24.159> you're<00:03:24.790> not<00:03:24.819> really<00:03:24.909> sure

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
bottom do not you're not really sure

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.970 
bottom do not you're not really sure
where<00:03:25.329> it<00:03:25.629> came<00:03:25.780> from<00:03:25.840> if<00:03:26.290> you're<00:03:26.409> living<00:03:26.709> in<00:03:26.920> a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
where it came from if you're living in a

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.929 
where it came from if you're living in a
cold<00:03:27.250> area<00:03:28.019> chances<00:03:29.019> are<00:03:29.200> this<00:03:29.829> metal<00:03:30.340> froze

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
cold area chances are this metal froze

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.729 
cold area chances are this metal froze
and<00:03:31.329> it's<00:03:31.930> separated<00:03:32.799> from<00:03:33.639> this<00:03:34.540> top<00:03:34.959> cover

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
and it's separated from this top cover

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.559 
and it's separated from this top cover
right<00:03:36.040> here<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.459> because<00:03:37.180> since<00:03:37.419> it's

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
right here and because since it's

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.330 
right here and because since it's
separated<00:03:38.079> whenever<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.590> starts<00:03:38.829> to<00:03:38.950> bowl<00:03:39.189> and

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
separated whenever it starts to bowl and

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.690 
separated whenever it starts to bowl and
like<00:03:40.230> do<00:03:41.230> work<00:03:41.500> on<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.799> water<00:03:42.010> it'll

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
like do work on that water it'll

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.520 
like do work on that water it'll
actually<00:03:42.849> spill<00:03:43.359> out<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.569> here<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.049> it'll

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
actually spill out of here and it'll

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.979 
actually spill out of here and it'll
leak<00:03:44.739> from<00:03:45.129> the<00:03:45.220> bottom<00:03:45.579> and<00:03:46.359> all<00:03:46.450> those<00:03:46.629> areas

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
leak from the bottom and all those areas

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.129 
leak from the bottom and all those areas
so<00:03:47.470> there<00:03:47.980> you<00:03:48.099> have<00:03:48.159> it<00:03:48.400> there's<00:03:48.669> the

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
so there you have it there's the

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.440 
so there you have it there's the
disassembly<00:03:50.139> of<00:03:50.169> it<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.849> reassembly<00:03:51.849> again

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
disassembly of it and reassembly again

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.530 
disassembly of it and reassembly again
it's<00:03:52.659> just<00:03:52.980> like<00:03:53.980> putting<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.430> this<00:03:54.970> deck<00:03:55.269> over

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
it's just like putting it this deck over

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.619 
it's just like putting it this deck over
top<00:03:55.780> of<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:56.079> and<00:03:56.909> whenever<00:03:57.909> you<00:03:58.000> get<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.329> this

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
top of it and whenever you get to this

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.399 
top of it and whenever you get to this
point<00:03:59.010> you're<00:04:00.010> going<00:04:00.159> to<00:04:00.400> want<00:04:00.609> to<00:04:01.229> put<00:04:02.229> this

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
point you're going to want to put this

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.719 
point you're going to want to put this
back<00:04:02.739> down<00:04:02.769> in<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.430> set<00:04:04.389> this<00:04:04.510> on<00:04:04.690> top<00:04:04.720> of<00:04:04.959> it

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
back down in it set this on top of it

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:09.000 
back down in it set this on top of it
