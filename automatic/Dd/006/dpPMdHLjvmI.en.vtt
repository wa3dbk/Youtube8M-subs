non<00:02:19.390> semantic<00:02:20.110> acts<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:20.709> just<00:02:21.400> works<00:02:21.640> now

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390

let's<00:02:22.930> flip<00:02:23.290> back<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.920> our<00:02:24.040> code<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.720> see

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
let's flip back to our code and see

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.589 
let's flip back to our code and see
what's<00:02:26.200> going<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.590> here<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:27.069> used<00:02:27.730> pixels<00:02:28.390> as

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
what's going on here I used pixels as

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.690 
what's going on here I used pixels as
the<00:02:28.840> unit<00:02:29.080> for<00:02:29.260> my<00:02:29.349> value<00:02:29.739> but<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:30.190> about<00:02:30.310> any

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
the unit for my value but just about any

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.199 
the unit for my value but just about any
other<00:02:30.910> CSS<00:02:31.720> unit<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.500> ms<00:02:33.069> for<00:02:33.250> example<00:02:33.670> would

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
other CSS unit like ms for example would

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.990 
other CSS unit like ms for example would
work<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:34.510> fine<00:02:37.440> now<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:39.190> do<00:02:39.430> have<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.910> be

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
work just fine now you do have to be

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.530 
work just fine now you do have to be
careful<00:02:40.030> with<00:02:40.890> percentages<00:02:42.030> because<00:02:43.030> at<00:02:43.360> the

careful with percentages because at the

Firefox we need to repeat the code but
this<00:03:38.980> time<00:03:39.250> use<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.000> mozilla<00:03:40.810> prefix<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.709> we'll

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
this time use a mozilla prefix and we'll

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.620 
this time use a mozilla prefix and we'll
do<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:43.000> just<00:03:43.299> like<00:03:43.480> this<00:03:43.750> well<00:03:44.200> type<00:03:44.500> Moz

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
do that just like this well type Moz

do that just like this well type Moz
border<00:03:46.650> radius<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:47.980> we'll<00:03:48.970> give<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.329> same

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
border radius and we'll give it the same

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.510 
pixel value as well then if we switch
back<00:04:45.669> over<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.389> Google<00:04:46.810> Chrome<00:04:47.250> we<00:04:48.250> see<00:04:48.490> that

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
back over to Google Chrome we see that

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.760 
back over to Google Chrome we see that
it<00:04:48.789> creates<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.449> teardrop<00:04:50.139> effect<00:04:50.500> and<00:04:50.740> that

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
it creates a teardrop effect and that

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.670 
it creates a teardrop effect and that
the<00:04:51.250> upper<00:04:52.000> left<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.539> bottom<00:04:52.840> right<00:04:53.289> corners

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
the upper left and bottom right corners

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.370 
the upper left and bottom right corners
have<00:04:53.889> been<00:04:53.919> rounded<00:04:54.250> off<00:04:54.990> now<00:04:55.990> of<00:04:56.110> course<00:04:56.259> we

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
have been rounded off now of course we

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.800 
have been rounded off now of course we
can<00:04:56.650> do<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.889> same<00:04:57.100> thing<00:04:57.430> in<00:04:57.550> Firefox<00:04:58.240> but<00:04:58.660> the

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
can do the same thing in Firefox but the

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.260 
can do the same thing in Firefox but the
syntax<00:04:59.350> is<00:04:59.680> just<00:05:00.009> a<00:05:00.160> little<00:05:00.430> bit<00:05:00.669> different<00:05:01.090> so

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
syntax is just a little bit different so

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.150 
syntax is just a little bit different so
please<00:05:01.840> pay<00:05:02.080> attention<00:05:02.199> to<00:05:02.650> this<00:05:02.770> bit<00:05:02.979> very

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
please pay attention to this bit very

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.420 
please pay attention to this bit very

same pixel value and then we'll type Moz

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:32.460 
same pixel value and then we'll type Moz
border<00:05:25.229> radius<00:05:27.060> bottom<00:05:28.060> right<00:05:30.930> then<00:05:31.930> if<00:05:32.199> we

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
border radius bottom right then if we

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.129 
border radius bottom right then if we
switch<00:05:32.710> over<00:05:32.830> to<00:05:32.949> firefox<00:05:33.460> we<00:05:34.060> should<00:05:34.300> see<00:05:34.780> the

switch over to firefox we should see the
same<00:05:35.650> result<00:05:35.830> as<00:05:36.570> we<00:05:37.570> do<00:05:37.750> in<00:05:38.020> google<00:05:38.349> chrome

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
same result as we do in google chrome

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.120 
same result as we do in google chrome
pretty<00:05:39.789> cool
