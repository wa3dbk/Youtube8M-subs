actually using a very simple three head

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.710 
actually using a very simple three head
lighting<00:02:35.610> kit<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.060> don't<00:02:36.120> need<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.570> remote

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
lighting kit and I don't need the remote

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.660 
lighting kit and I don't need the remote
control<00:02:37.110> facility<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.370> great<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.640> know

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
control facility but it's great to know

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.869 
control facility but it's great to know
I<00:02:38.760> have<00:02:38.970> it

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.880 

so<00:02:45.450> let's<00:02:45.719> get<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:45.959> thing<00:02:46.049> started<00:02:46.409> today

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
so let's get this thing started today

00:02:46.890 --> 00:03:11.290 
so let's get this thing started today
can<00:02:47.099> you<00:02:47.159> give<00:02:47.280> me<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> hand<00:02:47.760> Thanks

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.339 

if<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.450> wouldn't<00:03:12.599> mind<00:03:12.690> just<00:03:12.840> moving<00:03:13.230> that

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
if you wouldn't mind just moving that

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.020 
if you wouldn't mind just moving that
last<00:03:13.560> light<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:14.040> bit<00:03:14.310> further<00:03:14.580> back<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.940> think

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
last light a bit further back I think

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.570 
last light a bit further back I think
we'll<00:03:15.239> be<00:03:15.330> ready<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.860> great<00:03:17.040> thing<00:03:17.250> about<00:03:17.280> the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
we'll be ready the great thing about the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.660 
we'll be ready the great thing about the
FMV<00:03:17.819> x300<00:03:18.750> LEDs<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.409> the<00:03:20.040> softness<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.519> the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
FMV x300 LEDs is the softness of the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.640 
FMV x300 LEDs is the softness of the
lights<00:03:20.879> and<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.330> color<00:03:21.540> temperature<00:03:21.780> they're

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
lights and the color temperature they're

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.800 
lights and the color temperature they're
also<00:03:22.890> got<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.069> really<00:03:23.340> nice<00:03:23.670> wide<00:03:24.299> spread<00:03:24.780> of

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
also got a really nice wide spread of

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.559 
also got a really nice wide spread of
the<00:03:25.019> beam<00:03:25.200> it's<00:03:25.650> about<00:03:25.799> 65<00:03:26.190> degrees<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:27.299> it's

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
the beam it's about 65 degrees so it's

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:37.199 
the beam it's about 65 degrees so it's
perfect<00:03:28.019> for<00:03:28.080> this<00:03:28.230> kind<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.590> lighting

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.000 

and<00:03:37.750> if<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.019> could<00:03:38.170> just<00:03:38.319> do<00:03:38.469> the<00:03:38.500> last<00:03:38.739> shot

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
and if you could just do the last shot

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.429 
and if you could just do the last shot
so<00:03:39.250> you're<00:03:39.879> doing<00:03:40.359> your<00:03:40.480> makeup<00:03:40.689> a<00:03:41.049> little<00:03:41.260> bit

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
so you're doing your makeup a little bit

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
can see the great thing about the x300

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.140 
can see the great thing about the x300
is<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.040> if<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.310> mood<00:04:50.520> takes<00:04:50.730> you<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.090> you
