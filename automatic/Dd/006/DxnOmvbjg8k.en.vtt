00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.020
 1 and you are through this video 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.580
 Although how to sport a lip or 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:20.250
 lip peeling makes me believe that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.350
 one or the other choice already why water 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.689
 is made if I believe the the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.210
 more had you just not yet and 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.970
 I would like to then share with you 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.890
 the things you need it but 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.430
 Everyone at home, I'm sure 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.730
 except an absolute honey not thanks 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.039
 Have fun with this video 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.980
 all you need is once 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:47.160
 a bowl then we need approx 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.280
 besides we need honey and still 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.640
 a teaspoon and that's it 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.300
 even the first you have to do is 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.269
 that moved into a bowl 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.149
 then we like a bit 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:07.740
 honey added, and until such time as it 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.940
 a solid mass results and touching 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.940
 with our phone 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:23.930
 this is what the final result looks like 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.820
 is a pretty solid crowd and me 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.549
 have already tried out more often 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.159
 and you really have the feeling that yours 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.759
 old main schools are removed and 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.079
 after that I would recommend yours 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.979
 lip care products on your lips too 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:43.189
 wear and then they would be very 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.750
 sleek other very well maintained minute 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.560
 as well as it did then 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.420
 easy in a lockable 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.149
 containers then you can do that more often 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.039
 but it needs it as fast as possible 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.289
 also not possible that somehow like it 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.909
 mold or something and what I still have 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.110
 thought if you have such small ones 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.929
 you probably could 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.840
 also buy in teddy or so then that is 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.060
 I would also be a nice gift 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.500
 Now say and you can see the packaging 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.450
 still to design as you want 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.319
 and I think that's a very good one 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.299
 idea that you can do more 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.280
 send funny pictures instagram like 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.450
 you have your pc on the lips or something 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.579
 for this 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.239
 I would be very happy about that and 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:25.940
 then I hope that the video you 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.709
 helped and if you still have 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.569
 want to see more do it yourself videos 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.459
 then there are in the thumb and up 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.459
 then see us again next time
