maybe just leave the gameplay behind

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.110 
maybe just leave the gameplay behind
because<00:00:43.219> once<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.370> get<00:00:44.520> kind<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> into<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
because once you get kind of into the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.360 
because once you get kind of into the
swing<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.360> things<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.809> basically<00:00:46.379> like

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
swing of things it's basically like

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
swing of things it's basically like
anything<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.600> buying<00:00:49.079> selling

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
anything it's just buying selling

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.139 
anything it's just buying selling
players<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.250> playing<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.579> returned<00:00:50.910> goal
