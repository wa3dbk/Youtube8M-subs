Biblical prophecy and how a lot of
Christians<00:00:18.480> try<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> use<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.170> justify

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
Christians try to use it to justify

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.370

their<00:00:20.010> beliefs<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.550> Jesus<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.990> basically

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
their beliefs in Jesus this is basically

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.890 
their beliefs in Jesus this is basically
circular<00:00:23.039> reasoning<00:00:23.310> using<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.240> Bible<00:00:24.630> to

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
circular reasoning using the Bible to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.080 
circular reasoning using the Bible to
prove<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> Bible<00:00:25.920> says<00:00:26.130> essentially

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
prove what the Bible says essentially

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.599 
prove what the Bible says essentially
this<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.449> like<00:00:27.630> saying<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.650> Bible<00:00:28.980> says<00:00:29.220> that

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
this is like saying the Bible says that

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.240 
this is like saying the Bible says that
Jesus<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.449> Son<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> God<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:31.679> know<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.130> is

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
Jesus is the Son of God we know this is

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.280 
Jesus is the Son of God we know this is
true<00:00:32.550> because<00:00:32.850> Jesus<00:00:33.570> fulfilled<00:00:34.050> many

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
true because Jesus fulfilled many

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.530 
true because Jesus fulfilled many
prophecies<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:35.579> know<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.149> true<00:00:36.360> because

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
prophecies we know this is true because

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.560 
prophecies we know this is true because
the<00:00:36.899> Bible<00:00:37.200> says<00:00:37.410> he<00:00:37.559> did<00:00:38.210> but<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.480> moment

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the Bible says he did but for a moment

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.180 
the Bible says he did but for a moment
let's<00:00:39.930> ignore<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> fact<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.010> is

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
let's ignore the fact that this is

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.760 
let's ignore the fact that this is
circular<00:00:41.579> reasoning<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.149> examine<00:00:43.079> some<00:00:43.680> of

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
circular reasoning and examine some of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.410 
circular reasoning and examine some of
the<00:00:43.829> prophecies<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.640> Jesus<00:00:44.700> allegedly

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the prophecies that Jesus allegedly

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.799 
the prophecies that Jesus allegedly
fulfilled<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> book<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.190> Matthew

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.389 
fulfilled here in the book of Matthew
now<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.110> open<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> book<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.920> Matthew<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
now if we open up the book of Matthew to

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.250 
now if we open up the book of Matthew to
chapter<00:00:50.820> 1<00:00:51.110> we<00:00:52.110> read<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.620> verse<00:00:52.680> 22<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.940> 23<00:00:54.260> now

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
chapter 1 we read in verse 22 and 23 now

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.350 
chapter 1 we read in verse 22 and 23 now
all<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.770> was<00:00:55.829> done<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.879> might<00:00:57.000> be

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
all this was done that it might be

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.420 
all this was done that it might be
fulfilled<00:00:57.539> which<00:00:58.020> was<00:00:58.469> spoken<00:00:58.680> by<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.250> Lord

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.510 
fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord
by<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.090> Prophet<00:01:00.390> saying<00:01:00.719> behold<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.980> virgin

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
forth a son and they shall call his name

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.550 
forth a son and they shall call his name
Emmanuel<00:01:08.670> which<00:01:09.299> being<00:01:09.360> interpreted<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:10.500> God

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
Emmanuel which being interpreted is God

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.289 
Emmanuel which being interpreted is God
with<00:01:11.189> us<00:01:12.409> this<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.770> first<00:01:14.610> assertion<00:01:15.270> that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
with us this is the first assertion that

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.830 
with us this is the first assertion that
Jesus<00:01:15.930> was<00:01:16.259> born<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.130> virgin<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:18.390> problem

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
Jesus was born of a virgin the problem

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.499 
Jesus was born of a virgin the problem
is<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.530> actually<00:01:19.920> read<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:21.000> verse<00:01:21.240> in

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
is if we actually read the verse in

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.649 
is if we actually read the verse in
Isaiah<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:22.290> he<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.979> referring<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:24.330> find

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
Isaiah that he is referring to we find

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.310 
Isaiah that he is referring to we find
that<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.229> Isaiah<00:01:25.619> chapter<00:01:25.920> 7<00:01:26.820> verse<00:01:27.390> 14<00:01:28.020> it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that in Isaiah chapter 7 verse 14 it

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.390 
that in Isaiah chapter 7 verse 14 it
says<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.970> behold<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:31.020> young<00:01:31.290> woman<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.040> with

the<00:01:33.600> word<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.079> Isaiah<00:01:34.560> actually<00:01:35.159> uses<00:01:35.700> is

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the word that Isaiah actually uses is

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.749 
the word that Isaiah actually uses is
Alma<00:01:36.540> which<00:01:36.960> means<00:01:37.229> young<00:01:37.530> woman<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.130> he<00:01:38.670> had

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
1 but the problem is that Hosea

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.040 
1 but the problem is that Hosea
specifically<00:02:45.210> says<00:02:45.480> something<00:02:46.020> very

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050

says when Egypt when Israel was a child
then<00:02:53.460> I<00:02:53.700> loved<00:02:54.090> him<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.570> called<00:02:55.260> my<00:02:55.530> son<00:02:55.590> out
