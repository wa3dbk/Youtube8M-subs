incidentally it's hard to imagine this

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.590 
incidentally it's hard to imagine this
is<00:00:54.449> inflatable<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.770> darn<00:00:56.309> stiff<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
is inflatable it is so darn stiff do you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.000 
is inflatable it is so darn stiff do you
give<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> much<00:00:58.050> performance<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.829> go<00:00:58.949> to

an<00:00:59.129> inflatable<00:00:59.460> no<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.359> don't<00:01:00.690> you'll

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
an inflatable no you don't you'll

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.229 
an inflatable no you don't you'll
probably<00:01:01.140> lose<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.440> little<00:01:01.769> bit<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.100> speed<00:01:02.430> but

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
probably lose a little bit in speed but

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
probably lose a little bit in speed but
for<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.930> make<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.530> all<00:01:04.620> to<00:01:04.800> do<00:01:04.920> all

maximum size person for the Bali or
pretty<00:01:55.320> much<00:01:55.470> anyone<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:56.220> know<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.730> rated<00:01:57.330> up

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
pretty much anyone you know we rated up

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.280 
pretty much anyone you know we rated up
to<00:01:57.600> around<00:01:57.900> 275<00:01:58.620> right<00:01:59.370> up<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.580> there<00:01:59.730> yeah

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
to around 275 right up in there yeah

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.560 
to around 275 right up in there yeah
so<00:02:00.920> I<00:02:00.950> would<00:02:01.280> just<00:02:01.520> barely<00:02:01.820> make<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.210> but<00:02:02.540> I

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
so I would just barely make it but I

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.180 
so I would just barely make it but I
think<00:02:02.660> I<00:02:02.930> could<00:02:03.080> still<00:02:03.290> use<00:02:03.320> it<00:02:03.440> how<00:02:03.830> much<00:02:04.010> does

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
think I could still use it how much does

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.280 
think I could still use it how much does
it<00:02:04.250> weigh<00:02:04.630> total<00:02:05.630> weight<00:02:05.750> on<00:02:05.870> this<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.170> about

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
it weigh total weight on this is about

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.460
