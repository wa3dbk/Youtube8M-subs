happy for him but I fear it's impacted
his<00:01:46.770> combat<00:01:47.220> skills<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.299> didn't<00:01:48.570> know

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
his combat skills if I didn't know

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.749 
his combat skills if I didn't know
better<00:01:48.720> I'd<00:01:49.409> say<00:01:49.680> he's<00:01:49.829> completely<00:01:50.340> forgotten

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
better I'd say he's completely forgotten

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.550 
better I'd say he's completely forgotten
how<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.060> reload<00:01:51.450> his<00:01:51.509> weapon<00:01:51.990> quickly<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
how to reload his weapon quickly and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.109 
how to reload his weapon quickly and
he's<00:01:52.920> been<00:01:53.070> forgetting<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.670> reset<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
he's been forgetting to reset the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.719 
he's been forgetting to reset the
grenade<00:01:54.390> timer<00:01:54.659> before<00:01:55.110> throwing<00:01:55.320> them<00:01:55.560> back

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
grenade timer before throwing them back

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.370 
grenade timer before throwing them back
also<00:01:56.729> he's<00:01:57.210> now<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.630> into<00:01:57.930> combat<00:01:58.140> with

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
also he's now going into combat with

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.289 
also he's now going into combat with
inaccurate<00:01:58.890> pea<00:01:59.310> shooters<00:01:59.670> instead<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
inaccurate pea shooters instead of the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.910 
inaccurate pea shooters instead of the
fully<00:02:00.540> automatic<00:02:01.079> guns<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.500> he<00:02:01.590> used<00:02:01.740> so

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
fully automatic guns that he used so

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.800 
fully automatic guns that he used so
effectively<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.969> earn<00:02:03.149> his<00:02:03.360> prestigious

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
effectively to earn his prestigious

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.990 
effectively to earn his prestigious
medals<00:02:04.259> I'm<00:02:05.040> considering<00:02:05.610> filing<00:02:05.820> for

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
medals I'm considering filing for

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.180 
medals I'm considering filing for
section<00:02:06.630> 8<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.899> his<00:02:07.020> behalf<00:02:07.320> he's<00:02:07.829> simply<00:02:08.099> not

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
section 8 on his behalf he's simply not

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.040 
section 8 on his behalf he's simply not
the<00:02:08.459> soldier<00:02:08.759> he<00:02:08.849> used<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> be<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.780> fear<00:02:09.959> he

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the soldier he used to be and I fear he

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.600 
the soldier he used to be and I fear he
won't<00:02:10.229> last<00:02:10.379> long<00:02:10.679> if<00:02:10.890> he<00:02:10.979> doesn't<00:02:11.250> regain<00:02:11.340> his

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
won't last long if he doesn't regain his

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.820 
won't last long if he doesn't regain his
abilities<00:02:12.080> yours<00:02:13.080> forever

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
abilities yours forever

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.700 
abilities yours forever
