00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
it was released so really cool and I

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.670 
it was released so really cool and I
think<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.060> very<00:00:21.330> awesome<00:00:21.689> set<00:00:22.199> but

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
think this is a very awesome set but

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.529 
think this is a very awesome set but
before<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.130> review<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.490> let's<00:00:23.939> go<00:00:24.090> ahead<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
before we review it let's go ahead and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:58.110 
before we review it let's go ahead and
rebuild<00:00:25.109> it

set<00:01:01.489> is<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:02.420> classic<00:01:02.960> Lego<00:01:03.230> Batman<00:01:03.590> penguin

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
show you a little bit more detail on it

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.060 
show you a little bit more detail on it
it<00:01:41.360> does<00:01:41.570> have<00:01:41.750> stickers<00:01:42.200> on<00:01:42.380> here<00:01:42.619> just<00:01:42.830> the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
it does have stickers on here just the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.670 
it does have stickers on here just the
two<00:01:43.280> Robin<00:01:43.910> symbols<00:01:44.360> are<00:01:44.509> stickers<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.440> you

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
two Robin symbols are stickers and you

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.350 
two Robin symbols are stickers and you
can<00:01:45.830> see<00:01:45.979> how<00:01:46.100> Robin<00:01:46.340> does<00:01:46.670> fit<00:01:46.970> in<00:01:47.149> there

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.960 
can see how Robin does fit in there
although<00:01:48.050> I<00:01:48.080> did<00:01:48.500> take<00:01:48.830> his<00:01:49.009> cape<00:01:49.280> off<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.789> make

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
although I did take his cape off to make

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.779 
although I did take his cape off to make
him<00:01:50.300> fit<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.630> little<00:01:50.840> bit<00:01:50.990> easier<00:01:51.410> I<00:01:51.860> think<00:01:52.640> it

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
him fit a little bit easier I think it

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.219 
him fit a little bit easier I think it
actually<00:01:53.570> looks<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.840> little<00:01:53.869> bit<00:01:54.050> better

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
actually looks a little bit better

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.800 
actually looks a little bit better
without<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.770> cape<00:01:54.979> on<00:01:55.190> while<00:01:56.060> he's<00:01:56.210> inside

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
without the cape on while he's inside

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.370 
without the cape on while he's inside
there<00:01:57.310> there's<00:01:58.310> no<00:01:58.660> function<00:01:59.660> on<00:01:59.869> this<00:02:00.080> per<00:02:00.350> se

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
there there's no function on this per se

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.029 
there there's no function on this per se
although<00:02:01.390> that<00:02:02.390> does<00:02:02.660> spin<00:02:02.990> at<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.170> back<00:02:03.410> but

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
although that does spin at the back but

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.589 
although that does spin at the back but
there's<00:02:04.250> no<00:02:04.340> flick<00:02:04.610> fire<00:02:04.849> or<00:02:05.090> anything<00:02:05.300> like

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
there's no flick fire or anything like

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.830 
there's no flick fire or anything like
that<00:02:05.770> just<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.950> neat<00:02:07.399> little<00:02:07.580> scuba<00:02:08.360> jet<00:02:08.569> for

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.980 
that just a neat little scuba jet for
Robin<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:09.819> clearly<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.060> largest<00:02:11.510> part<00:02:11.870> of

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
Robin and clearly the largest part of

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.730 
Robin and clearly the largest part of
the<00:02:12.050> set<00:02:12.440> is<00:02:12.970> penguins<00:02:13.970> submarine<00:02:14.750> here<00:02:15.140> which

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
the set is penguins submarine here which

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.130 
the set is penguins submarine here which
i<00:02:15.860> think<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.250> designed<00:02:16.730> pretty<00:02:17.420> cool<00:02:17.780> actually

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
i think is designed pretty cool actually

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.830 
i think is designed pretty cool actually
it<00:02:18.830> does<00:02:19.130> have<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.370> few<00:02:19.610> more<00:02:19.760> stickers<00:02:20.240> than

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
it does have a few more stickers than

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.920 
it does have a few more stickers than
the<00:02:21.140> Robin<00:02:21.950> scuba<00:02:22.430> jet<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.940> think<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.569> one<00:02:23.750> has

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
the Robin scuba jet I think this one has

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.690 
the Robin scuba jet I think this one has
about<00:02:24.050> 6<00:02:24.590> stickers<00:02:25.010> if<00:02:25.220> I've<00:02:25.370> counted

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
about 6 stickers if I've counted

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.180 
about 6 stickers if I've counted
correctly<00:02:26.560> we're<00:02:27.560> going<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.800> go<00:02:27.890> ahead<00:02:27.980> and

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
correctly we're going to go ahead and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.890 
correctly we're going to go ahead and
show<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.400> some<00:02:28.940> some<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.300> details<00:02:29.690> on<00:02:29.870> it

sticker<00:02:32.090> at<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.360> front<00:02:32.630> here<00:02:32.900> which<00:02:33.590> i<00:02:33.770> think

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
sticker at the front here which i think

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.650 
sticker at the front here which i think
is<00:02:34.040> pretty<00:02:34.190> cool<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.640> like<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:35.060> say<00:02:35.180> put<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.540> on

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
is pretty cool I like to say put that on

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.490 
is pretty cool I like to say put that on
there<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:37.610> whole<00:02:37.880> top<00:02:38.209> part<00:02:38.660> lifts<00:02:39.260> off

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
there and this whole top part lifts off

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.479 
there and this whole top part lifts off
so<00:02:40.489> that<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.760> can<00:02:40.970> look<00:02:41.480> down<00:02:41.660> inside<00:02:42.489> the

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
so that you can look down inside the

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.089 
so that you can look down inside the
submarine<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.300> that's<00:02:44.959> where<00:02:45.230> penguin<00:02:45.890> can

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
submarine and that's where penguin can

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.490 
submarine and that's where penguin can
ride<00:02:46.370> at<00:02:46.610> start<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.510> little<00:02:47.750> control<00:02:48.110> panel

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500

ride at start a little control panel
down<00:02:48.650> there<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.750> that's<00:02:50.959> pretty<00:02:51.200> cool<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.800> guess
