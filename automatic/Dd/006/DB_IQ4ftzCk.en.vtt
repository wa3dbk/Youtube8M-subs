 asus so a co-production last 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.960
 endes and the beautiful is that not so 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.839
 only the software here on the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.049

 comparatively high resolution display

 with ips panel back the camera is missing 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.760
 however, there is this front here 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.130
 camera with 2 megapixels wlan is there 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.930
 for the variant is loud rumor mill 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.440
 but in doing because there is no 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.440
 concrete information 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.880
 the packaging is very handsome 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.880
 designed as are 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.320
 euro decrease my inner carton 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.590
 there is already the nexus 7 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.490
 the unusual thing is he im 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.250
 hochformat designed which then gets on 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.920
 plant is also on 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.760
 entire operating system in portrait format 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:21.480
 aligned there you have a first 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:25.080
 automatic rotation but activate that 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.360
 is no obstacle next to the tablet 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.120
 nations also use this little box 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:38.280
 equipment 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:43.130
 however, this is manageable one 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:50.420
 warranty card brief instructions and 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:52.650
 of course the USB data cable 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.050
 that can be so directly on the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.720
 computer will be connected there 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.489
 also charged when it is on the mains 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.940
 he wants to recharge then he gives it this 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:08.970
 We can also plug it on 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:14.910
 this USB cable to connect have a 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:21.080
 regular charging cable back to 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:25.610
 actual tablet front camera so 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:29.640
 tell if the page is housed here 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.630
 the plastic case has on the 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.750
 back then a rubber coating 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.670
 additionally with these you score here 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.230
 are punched a bit like that 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.970
 makes sure that the whole thing really 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.970
 comfortable and safe in the hand 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.980
 and although it gets a bit thicker 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.880
 turns out to be topical high end tablets 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.489
 that is all in the frame 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.400
 So by no means the connections 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.319
 here are quite limited there are only 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.469
 this micro usb connection 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:10.950
 and the headphone output controls 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:13.260
 I'm an off switch on this page 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.549
 volume rocker something hidden and 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:21.030
 not quite as good to use but that 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.259
 even fits on the opposite 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.190
 lying side then something 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:28.169
 unusual these four pins the team 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.240
 to connect a docking station 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.250
 however, it is not like that 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.280
 Transformer devices a keyboard dock 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.710
 but just one instead 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.789
 charging station at the same time the device 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.470
 holds when movies for example 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:45.330
 Watch mass adjust and recharge 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.840
 and also external speakers yet 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.840
 connect 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:56.820
 yes so much first to the nexus 7 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.009
 Of course we will become one more 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.139
 test to bring online and also one 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.139
