00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
today we'll be testing the speed

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.430 
today we'll be testing the speed
differences<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.840> differences<00:00:04.230> between

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
differences and the differences between

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.889 
differences and the differences between
these<00:00:04.770> three<00:00:05.040> phones<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.609> iphone<00:00:05.910> 4s<00:00:06.270> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
be testing the speed difference between

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.009 
be testing the speed difference between
the<00:00:10.980> iphone<00:00:11.250> 3gs<00:00:11.700> because<00:00:12.420> i<00:00:12.450> took<00:00:12.750> out<00:00:12.840> the

there both phones are black and this is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.810 
there both phones are black and this is
the<00:00:34.020> iphone<00:00:34.140> 3gs<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.250> see<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> box<00:00:35.670> is

the iphone 3gs as you can see the box is
a<00:00:35.850> lot<00:00:36.059> bulkier<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.170> mainly<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.770> pretty

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
a lot bulkier but mainly it's pretty

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.380 
a lot bulkier but mainly it's pretty
much<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.430> same<00:00:38.579> thing<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.059> has<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
much the same thing so it has a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.389 
much the same thing so it has a
different<00:00:39.809> design<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.379> other<00:00:40.860> differences

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
different design and other differences

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.510 
different design and other differences

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
there's an iCloud logo right there but

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.580 
there's an iCloud logo right there but
every<00:00:45.059> other<00:00:45.210> box<00:00:45.539> has<00:00:45.750> an<00:00:45.870> apple<00:00:46.170> logo<00:00:46.289> right

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
every other box has an apple logo right

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.779 
every other box has an apple logo right
there<00:00:46.620> now<00:00:47.039> let's<00:00:47.280> take<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> look<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
there now let's take a look at the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.610 
there now let's take a look at the
design<00:00:48.120> differences<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
design differences as you can see the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.160 
design differences as you can see the
iphone<00:00:50.010> 4<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.399> iphone<00:00:50.670> 4s<00:00:51.390> are<00:00:51.570> pretty<00:00:52.050> much

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
iphone 4 and iphone 4s are pretty much

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.310 
iphone 4 and iphone 4s are pretty much
identical<00:00:53.420> this<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.629> might<00:00:54.840> seem<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> little

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
identical this one might seem a little

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
identical this one might seem a little
thicker<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:55.739> that's<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.190> custom<00:00:56.640> back

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
thicker because that's a custom back

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.420 
thicker because that's a custom back
plate<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.719> they're<00:00:58.050> both<00:00:58.260> exactly<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.100> same

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
plate but they're both exactly the same

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
plate but they're both exactly the same
there's<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.760> little<00:01:00.210> differences<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:00.899> there

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
there's a little differences right there

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.070 
there's a little differences right there
as<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.590> top<00:01:02.120> but<00:01:03.120> mainly<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.809> is

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
as you can see on top but mainly this is

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.620 
as you can see on top but mainly this is
pretty<00:01:04.379> much<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.650> same<00:01:05.420> another<00:01:06.420> major

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
pretty much the same another major

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.420 
pretty much the same another major
differences<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.500> buttons<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> little

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
differences these buttons are a little

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.359 
differences these buttons are a little
bit<00:01:08.640> moved<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.750> iphone<00:01:10.080> 4s<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.530> mainly<00:01:10.770> kind

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
bit moved the iphone 4s is mainly kind

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.899 
bit moved the iphone 4s is mainly kind
of<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> verizon<00:01:12.540> iphone<00:01:12.689> 4<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.920> that's

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
of like the verizon iphone 4 so that's

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.130 
of like the verizon iphone 4 so that's
pretty<00:01:15.119> much<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.360> only<00:01:15.509> difference<00:01:16.020> right

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
pretty much the only difference right

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.719 
pretty much the only difference right
there<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.590> some<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.830> your<00:01:17.040> cases<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
there so some of your cases for the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.039 
there so some of your cases for the
iphone<00:01:17.909> 4<00:01:18.450> will<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:18.869> fit<00:01:19.110> your<00:01:19.409> iphone<00:01:19.920> 4s<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
iphone 4 will not fit your iphone 4s and

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.690 
iphone 4 will not fit your iphone 4s and
taking<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.110> look<00:01:22.140> at<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> iphone<00:01:22.560> 3gs<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.610> you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
taking a look at the iphone 3gs as you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.820 
taking a look at the iphone 3gs as you
can<00:01:23.850> see<00:01:23.970> how<00:01:24.090> much<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> phones<00:01:24.720> evolved<00:01:25.259> went

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
can see how much the phones evolved went

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.679 
can see how much the phones evolved went
from<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.130> round<00:01:26.369> shape<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.420> more<00:01:27.659> of

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
from a round shape like this to more of

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.710 
from a round shape like this to more of
a<00:01:28.020> sleek<00:01:28.829> design<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.850> let's<00:01:30.540> take<00:01:30.689> a

a sleek design like this let's take a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.060 
a sleek design like this let's take a
look<00:01:30.960> at<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.320> difference<00:01:31.650> between<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
look at the difference between the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
displays and apple did switch companies

displays and apple did switch companies
to<00:01:41.460> manufacture<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.030> displays<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:43.049> the

iphone 4s and both of these are a
100-percent<00:01:46.890> brightness<00:01:47.390> then<00:01:48.390> one<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
100-percent brightness then one of the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.179 
100-percent brightness then one of the
main<00:01:48.869> difference<00:01:49.229> you'll<00:01:49.470> notice<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> iphone

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
main difference you'll notice the iphone

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.450 
main difference you'll notice the iphone
4s<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.450> bit<00:01:51.750> brighter<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.860> i<00:01:53.070> don't<00:01:53.399> think

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
4s is a bit brighter but i don't think

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.789 
4s is a bit brighter but i don't think
the<00:01:53.700> colors<00:01:54.030> are<00:01:54.360> rich<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.170> black<00:01:55.500> stars

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the colors are rich in the black stars

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.899 
the colors are rich in the black stars
like<00:01:56.640> dark<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.570> rich<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.579> can<00:01:59.729> see<00:01:59.880> right

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
like dark and rich as you can see right

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.340 
like dark and rich as you can see right
here<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.390> example<00:02:00.540> take<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> look<00:02:01.140> at<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
here for example take a look at the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.200 
here for example take a look at the
weather<00:02:01.500> app<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.490> see<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.000> lot<00:02:03.180> more

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
weather app you can see it's a lot more

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.480 
weather app you can see it's a lot more
richer<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.469> color<00:02:04.710> than<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.460> right

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
richer here in color than it is right

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.280 
richer here in color than it is right
there<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.270> little<00:02:06.509> bright<00:02:06.719> there<00:02:07.079> it's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
there it's a little bright there it's

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.749 
there it's a little bright there it's
kind<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.530> maybe<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:08.069> bit<00:02:08.280> washed<00:02:08.489> out

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
kind of maybe a little bit washed out

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.880 
kind of maybe a little bit washed out
both<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.450> place<00:02:09.629> do<00:02:09.840> look<00:02:10.050> still<00:02:10.349> beautiful

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
both this place do look still beautiful

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.059 
both this place do look still beautiful
but<00:02:11.370> they<00:02:11.489> are

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
but they are

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.209 
but they are
differences<00:02:12.459> like<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:13.709> we<00:02:14.709> can<00:02:14.859> take<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.040> look

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:15.219 
differences like that we can take a look

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.550 
differences like that we can take a look
at<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.430> few<00:02:15.819> different<00:02:15.939> applications<00:02:16.719> for

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
at a few different applications for

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.470 
at a few different applications for
example<00:02:17.889> the<00:02:18.010> music<00:02:18.370> app<00:02:18.639> as<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.209> can<00:02:19.299> see

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
example the music app as you can see

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.119 
example the music app as you can see
it's<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.659> lot<00:02:19.810> more<00:02:19.840> richer<00:02:20.499> in<00:02:20.590> color<00:02:20.799> there

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
it's a lot more richer in color there

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.940 
it's a lot more richer in color there
than<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:22.239> is<00:02:22.389> in<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:23.769> iphone<00:02:24.189> 4s<00:02:25.319> us<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.530> open

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
than it is in the iphone 4s us to open

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.640 
than it is in the iphone 4s us to open
up<00:02:27.129> a<00:02:27.719> setting<00:02:28.719> for<00:02:28.900> example<00:02:29.409> you<00:02:31.379> can<00:02:32.379> see<00:02:32.530> the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
up a setting for example you can see the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.709 
up a setting for example you can see the
difference<00:02:32.980> in<00:02:33.099> colors<00:02:33.430> out<00:02:33.579> there<00:02:33.719> the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:34.719 
difference in colors out there the

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.830 
difference in colors out there the
iphone<00:02:35.400> 4s<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.579> a<00:02:36.609> bit<00:02:36.849> brighter<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.480> iphone

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
iphone 4s is a bit brighter the iphone

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.429 
iphone 4s is a bit brighter the iphone
4s<00:02:38.169> 4<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.189> a<00:02:39.219> little<00:02:39.609> darker<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.419> let's<00:02:41.260> take<00:02:41.379> a

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
4s 4 is a little darker and let's take a

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:47.129 
4s 4 is a little darker and let's take a
look<00:02:41.739> at<00:02:41.889> for<00:02:42.159> example<00:02:42.249> the<00:02:43.650> weather<00:02:44.650> app<00:02:46.139> you

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
look at for example the weather app you

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.479 
look at for example the weather app you
can<00:02:47.260> notice<00:02:47.469> the<00:02:47.650> difference<00:02:47.980> it's<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.310> lot

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
can notice the difference it's a lot

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.289 
can notice the difference it's a lot
darker<00:02:48.819> here<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.359> richer<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.980> iphone<00:02:51.639> 4s

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
darker here in richer and the iphone 4s

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.720 
darker here in richer and the iphone 4s
is<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.959> little<00:02:53.349> lighter<00:02:53.620> which<00:02:54.189> is<00:02:54.310> not<00:02:54.459> bad<00:02:54.489> I

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
is a little lighter which is not bad I

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.319 
is a little lighter which is not bad I
think<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.439> it<00:02:56.439> still<00:02:56.650> looks<00:02:56.829> good<00:02:57.069> but<00:02:57.430> the

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
think I it still looks good but the

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.330 
think I it still looks good but the
darks<00:02:58.900> are<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.079> lot<00:02:59.260> richer<00:02:59.469> on<00:02:59.859> this<00:03:00.099> phone

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
darks are a lot richer on this phone

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.869 
darks are a lot richer on this phone
right<00:03:00.519> there<00:03:00.579> and<00:03:02.129> you<00:03:03.129> can<00:03:03.250> t<00:03:03.400> just<00:03:03.459> crawling

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
right there and you can t just crawling

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.459 
right there and you can t just crawling
through<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.030> pages<00:03:04.329> you<00:03:04.719> can<00:03:05.019> notice<00:03:05.260> the

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:05.469 
through the pages you can notice the

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.979 
through the pages you can notice the
difference<00:03:05.799> in<00:03:05.949> the<00:03:06.040> backgrounds<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.810> one

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
difference in the backgrounds this one

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.629 
difference in the backgrounds this one
is<00:03:08.079> a<00:03:08.109> little<00:03:08.199> darker<00:03:08.859> this<00:03:09.189> one<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.549> little

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
is a little darker this one is a little

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.429 
is a little darker this one is a little
lighter<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.329> kind<00:03:10.719> of<00:03:10.780> like<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.049> background

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:11.439 
lighter I kind of like the background

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.009 
lighter I kind of like the background
here<00:03:11.500> better<00:03:11.889> just<00:03:12.219> because<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.969> don't<00:03:13.930> know<00:03:13.989> i

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
here better just because I don't know i

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.580 
here better just because I don't know i
can<00:03:14.349> see<00:03:14.500> more<00:03:14.650> detail<00:03:15.010> than<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.549> iphone<00:03:15.909> 4

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
can see more detail than the iphone 4

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.259 
can see more detail than the iphone 4
it's<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.680> little<00:03:17.799> dark<00:03:18.099> there<00:03:18.370> but<00:03:18.909> that's

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
it's a little dark there but that's

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.729 
it's a little dark there but that's
pretty<00:03:19.479> much<00:03:19.599> the<00:03:19.750> main<00:03:19.959> differences<00:03:20.500> in<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
pretty much the main differences in the

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.949 
pretty much the main differences in the
displaying<00:03:21.310> another<00:03:21.629> place<00:03:22.629> where<00:03:22.840> you

displaying another place where you
notice<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.379> difference<00:03:23.560> will<00:03:24.009> be<00:03:24.040> also<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.239> you

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
notice a difference will be also the you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.629 
notice a difference will be also the you

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
faster load on both phones this is

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.409 
faster load on both phones this is

faster on the iphone 4s think one of the

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.410 
faster on the iphone 4s think one of the
other<00:04:52.680> differences<00:04:53.220> they<00:04:53.400> will<00:04:53.670> notice<00:04:54.120> is

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
other differences they will notice is

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.020 
other differences they will notice is
the<00:04:55.080> performance<00:04:55.560> of<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:55.950> apps<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:57.000> apps

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
the performance of the apps the apps

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.620 
the performance of the apps the apps
will<00:04:57.630> lower<00:04:57.930> a<00:04:58.230> bit<00:04:58.560> faster<00:04:59.130> on<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.640> iphone<00:05:00.060> 4s

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
will lower a bit faster on the iphone 4s

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.630 
will lower a bit faster on the iphone 4s
and<00:05:01.320> took<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.650> look<00:05:01.740> at<00:05:01.890> angry<00:05:02.310> birds<00:05:02.490> for

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
and took a look at angry birds for

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.450 
and took a look at angry birds for
example<00:05:03.890> at<00:05:04.890> the<00:05:05.010> same<00:05:05.190> time<00:05:07.190> you<00:05:08.190> can<00:05:08.310> see

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
example at the same time you can see

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.940 
example at the same time you can see
iphone<00:05:08.850> 4s<00:05:09.300> is<00:05:09.570> already<00:05:09.930> loading<00:05:10.670> later<00:05:12.950> later

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
iphone 4s is already loading later later

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.250 
iphone 4s is already loading later later
and<00:05:14.340> as<00:05:15.030> you<00:05:15.120> can<00:05:15.240> see<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.450> iphone<00:05:15.720> 4s<00:05:16.020> was<00:05:16.230> a

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
and as you can see the iphone 4s was a

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:25.370 
and as you can see the iphone 4s was a
ready<00:05:19.010> to<00:05:20.010> play<00:05:22.850> and<00:05:23.850> you<00:05:24.270> were<00:05:24.630> already<00:05:24.810> ready

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
ready to play and you were already ready

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.140 
ready to play and you were already ready
to<00:05:25.470> play<00:05:25.710> on<00:05:25.920> the<00:05:26.040> iphone<00:05:26.430> 4s<00:05:26.820> so<00:05:26.970> it's<00:05:27.090> a

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
to play on the iphone 4s so it's a

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.000 
to play on the iphone 4s so it's a
little<00:05:27.300> faster<00:05:27.750> there<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.170> know<00:05:28.290> overall

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
little faster there you know overall

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.410 
little faster there you know overall
there's<00:05:29.250> not<00:05:29.400> too<00:05:29.580> much<00:05:29.730> difference<00:05:30.120> i<00:05:30.240> think

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
there's not too much difference i think

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.910 
there's not too much difference i think
one<00:05:30.750> of<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.900> biggest<00:05:31.290> difference<00:05:31.530> you<00:05:31.890> will

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
one of the biggest difference you will

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.740 
one of the biggest difference you will
notice<00:05:32.250> later<00:05:32.610> on<00:05:32.820> i<00:05:33.060> don't<00:05:33.390> think<00:05:33.630> there's

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
notice later on i don't think there's

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.980 
notice later on i don't think there's
games<00:05:34.020> like<00:05:34.920> that<00:05:34.950> that<00:05:35.310> you<00:05:35.540> can<00:05:36.540> try<00:05:36.750> it<00:05:36.810> on

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
games like that that you can try it on

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.740 
games like that that you can try it on
right<00:05:37.020> now<00:05:37.260> but<00:05:38.250> i<00:05:38.520> think<00:05:38.970> the<00:05:39.030> developers<00:05:39.570> in

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
right now but i think the developers in

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.490 
right now but i think the developers in
the<00:05:39.780> future<00:05:40.170> will<00:05:40.410> use<00:05:41.130> this<00:05:42.090> power<00:05:42.600> of<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:42.960> a5

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
the future will use this power of the a5

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.730 
the future will use this power of the a5
chip<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:44.100> the<00:05:44.190> graphics<00:05:44.750> of<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.990> iphone<00:05:46.320> 4s

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
chip and the graphics of the iphone 4s

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.310
