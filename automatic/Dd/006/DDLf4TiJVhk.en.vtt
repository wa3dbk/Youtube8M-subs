00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello everyone with you and now all 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.759
 show you how to manage it with 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.330
 console 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.130
 as well as various additions to start 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.099
 I will show you how to manage enpis with 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.240
 using the console, we write the command and the candles with 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.730
 1 further we enter command nps and to itself this 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.699
 the team is determined with which mpc we are 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.680
 We will work now we aim the sight 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.189
 the place where we want to send our them 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.810
 letters and write the command impossible 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.480
 as we see enpis fulfills our 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.850
 the team and to each time you 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.260
 didn't have to enter this command we her 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.610
 assign keys and here we see the result 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.000
 some may further help us 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.550
 tools supplement called enpis 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.520
 control and the very first tool is 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.860
 Enshi controller with it we can 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.320
 force anfis and move any 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.390
 side as well as attacking others to them 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.949
 songs 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.199
 first we give them pissing then 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.629
 click in the place where we want it 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.170
 or send it to a enpisi 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.229
 to instill 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.280
 let's make prepared well here 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.670
 we got it now for example we need 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.500
 to follow us to the bar not yes but 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.290
 as we see it behind us not by itself 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.509
 goes and for this we use enpis 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.890
 half-open now the bar won't be us 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.750
 accompany using the following 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.939
 tools we can ask health 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.720
 our mantissa can also be made 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:38.159
 immortal help tool on 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.750
 tardis we can disable perception 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.340
 but van pise on another roughly they 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.340
 will not notice each other 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.909
 the next tool allows us 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.110
 raise or lower 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.060
 skill that is professionalism 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:03.299
 any enpis 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:06.869
 even for example a combine that is, the higher 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:12.180
 his professionalism so he would rather us 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:14.849
 gets through with the following 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.400
 tool we can set the relation 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.799
 one indian to another but in this one 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.650
 case we set combines each on 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:28.049
 friend to do. where from 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.260
 We will appear pisi with their 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:37.010
 settings we take in his own crater and 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.010
 customize it to your taste 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.760
 so after setting up now we only 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:58.420
 left click in the place where we 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:03.010
 create this point but the principle can 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.150
 disable effects change weapons 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:11.069
 which will be given a prize full 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.069
 In general, there are many useful features 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.760
 now let's move on to more 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.780
 interesting moment with 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.970
 tool and we can lead to force 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.640
 them hurt and these actions for example jamie 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.560
 but we can set 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.500
 talk to us and we list 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.200
 select the file we need and 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.620
 on this file we have enpis perform 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.620
 actions 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.010
 even how glad I am you 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.920
 but usually in videos and we do not 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.620
 grabs we can use and blue 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.250
 tire tool with which to force 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.489
 enpis 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.909
 perform animations that support 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.150
 his skeleton but in order for our enpis 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:08.190
 obeyed we need to turn it on 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:13.069
 interaction and choose now animation 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.069
 from the list which he will perform 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:33.220
 now about the settings themselves here we can 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:35.560
 change dependency animation speed 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.450
 what speed is needed there faster or 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.450
 slower then there is more or less 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.039
 we can loop our animation when 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.039
 it ends it begins the word 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.139
 also we can make lose 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.289
 animation and duty for this we send 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.960
 the right mouse button t shirt and can not 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:08.159
 now it's ready for animation and exactly 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.159
 same as with npc 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.580
 by the way between the arches dol npc there is a big 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.220
 the difference is radula - the market can 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.930
 how is this corner ohh ntc we are very 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.930
 just broth 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.849
 but still the most useful tool i 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.869
 I consider anime 1 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:38.169
 I use it in my videos he 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:41.169
 gives us much more features and with 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:46.330
 The first detail about him skin is responsible for 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:48.519
 model of our hospital we win my 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.519
 you can also choose the animation 

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:53.649
 the list of rocks we have is responsible for the size 

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:57.849
 we can make our dollars 

00:05:53.649 --> 00:06:00.629
 gigantic or tiny sleeping is different 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.629
 animation speed 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:15.870
 This tool will help us to make 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:19.040
 animation for example shots all we can 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.040
 set the frame rate 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:33.720
 let's give him a gun and arms 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.720
 actually look what we did 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.850
 also we can set the parameters 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:53.540
 directions and bodies that is so that he 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:55.870
 looked at up down left right and so 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.870
 Further 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.319
 Well, the conclusion we give our physics 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.569
 they are my type of rox 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:10.460
 set the size of the cubes which will be 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:10.460
 concluded and ready 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:17.500
 now when it is a physical subject we 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:21.840
 we can let him in our coordinates with 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.840
 using the tools box about him later 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.509
 Thank you all for your attention. 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:27.509
 until
