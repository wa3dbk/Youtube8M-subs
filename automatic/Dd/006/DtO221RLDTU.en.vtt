00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.560
 farmer and hello friends hello 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.609
 welcome to the farm welcome to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.140
 although telly today I you 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.029
 present a mouse that is named the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.260
 neon that comes from ozone then 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.550
 mouse that is a little bit inflamed 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.710
 inflammed is a very big word well 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.539
 obviously this is the exaggeration side of 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.700
 the presentation a reassure you so 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.750
 who ignited the spirit the words of 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.370
 some readers because she has a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.399
 positioning that reminds others 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.899
 so for the moment it comes from 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.969
 at ozone and so we find a 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.340
 very bloody task presentation in a 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.230
 hexagonal box with the few 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.940
 repeated technical information in 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.710
 insets right and left and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.809
 as it became customary for ozone 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.690
 the guarantee of a super pgm who 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.180
 name choï in guillou which is part 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.100
 so of the professional team if he 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.309
 So please this mouse as you 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.019
 see him the net of arms and facts 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.610
 for here it was going to connect to 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.770
 the laptop so you 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.920
 present the backlight after and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.000
 so provided with a bundle that includes 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.140
 its biggest feature by 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.299
 report to another mouse I'm going to you 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.150
 present after the drivers cd 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.409
 the user manual to pull the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.850
 quintessence of the pilot and the 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.350
 traditional stickers to areas 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.920
 so the mouse I will introduce you 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.890
 at the same time that's the one that's me 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.030
 brought to change a little bit 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.040
 the test to the extent that I already 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.610
 tested in part by obviously 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.350
 completely 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.970
 why because I had the sensation 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.200
 that she was very very light and 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.030
 reality the same heavier than that 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.009
 so that we had a little bit 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.150
 the feeling that she was a chip but 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.259
 she is not more than a wiki 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.320
 yet offers a finish 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.790
 copy and you will see it 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.259
 I remove the area yes in fact it's like 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.460
 little thing because for the blow she 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.560
 is still covered with lifeguards 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.720
 in softouch politics of the most beautiful 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.460
 effect on the top of a soft touch a 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.439
 little darker on the bottom 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.939
 which is also of very good quality and 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.530
 finally look a little cheap 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.600
 simply comes from this little 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.000
 plastic age circle a little speed 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.069
 finally hacker that he 8d who the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.409
 dessert a little more than he adorns 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.730
 good ways simply because 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.109
 that beyond that in terms of finish 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.909
 there is not much to say is good 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.959
 finished 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.849
 the proof is no debate 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.629
 missed turn we're really on some 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.639
 equivalent thing 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.829
 it's just that 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:24.480
 this plastic presence a little bit 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.189
 lower that makes the mouse 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.510
 present almost less well but that's 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.989
 nice press because it's not in 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.260
 reality 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.150
 so I said a softouch soft bread 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.769
 quality with a hull that we know 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.219
 since it is neither more nor less than 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.120
 the fk so ambidextrous clicks that 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:43.079
 do not call for criticism 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.030
 a white rubber crowd wheel 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.829
 slightly notched scrolling 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.389
 is quite nice no 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.480
 rubbery sensation the screen are 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.919
 barely enough a button that 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.719
 could be programmed as you 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.010
 see the illuminated since there for 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.480
 the shot she's in glass on the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.310
 side parts nantes which offers 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.319
 just a central recess we find 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.329
 a button between two buttons forgiveness 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.010
 excuse me right two buttons to 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.329
 left so she will have exactly the same 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.019
 default that the yes that is to say that 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.969
 side push no worries on the index side 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.439
 this one very easy to use one 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.849
 a little bit more difficult 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.889
 because it will really impose 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.479
 fold the must now in terms of 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.430
 weight it's the turn of 120 g I do not have 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.799
 still weigh a mouse enough 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.389
 light but finally almost - and that 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.669
 this one which was weighed to a barely 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.259
 90 g so I'm not mistaken one in 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.930
 the other one is on mice all 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:32.340
 simple that works pretty well then 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.720
 below we will find the same 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.299
 principle that yes zone to know two 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.560
 big skates and a sensor this is the 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.639
 only unknown budget compared to 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.220
 sensors and in the information 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.639
 techniques besides a 6400 sensor 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.379
 dpi 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.150
 I do not know if it's a go down to 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.129
 prior to 6400 I would tend to say 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.049
 that no it may be the fault good 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.790
 in any case we will see in time what 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.169
 which is certain it slips everything 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.549
 only it works very well 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.810
 it's not more unpleasant a the wii 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.389
 so that there was a very good rating 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.129
 and it has software support since 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.870
 blow the buttons are programmable to 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.040
 contrario of the zoe which does not have 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.569
 program button so 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.840
 but I'm going to cut some light 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.870
 moments story you can see 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.090
 the decor and the softness of the wheel that 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.340
 lights up I turn on 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.509
 here you will excuse me for the flashes 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.870
 in the camera but I can not do 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.329
 other 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.560
 so something finally good 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.579
 place in my opinion because 44 euros 80 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.370
 it's cheaper than a noise zone for 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.720
 the same product with software support 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.820
 so something 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.889
 finally two rather competitive 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.500
 after obviously some will be able 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.780
 challenge the supremacy of the hull but 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.460
 a priori it is rather on that side 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.440
 that we will find the origin do not 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.370
 necessarily on the side of this style series to 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.490
 see now 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.770
 kind I remain convinced that this is 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.470
 rather a good product so here it is 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.410
 was the ozone year so 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.210
 an ambidextrous mouse very simple to 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.750
 the one that programmable buttons you 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.540
 to say other 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.220
 lebègue the 6400 dpi sensor and I 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.500
 forgot if the memory chip she 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.630
 ship for mackerel of 128 kg 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.700
 and I think that's pretty much everything he 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.400
 there is obviously pooling greta meeeerde 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.990
 this the besides the response time of 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.639
 Button is also customizable game 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.900
 forget it I take the box back to 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.690
 correct if I do not tell you to 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.610
 nonsense no I went around I you 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.889
 invite to come read the written test for 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.870
 the feelings of sliding on the 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.100
 different api that will appear very 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.300
 soon and I tell you in voice and 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.770
 I tell you a good one and I will 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.760
 wish to forgive decidedly a good 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.760
 see you soon
