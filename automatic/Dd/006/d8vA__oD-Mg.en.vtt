they don't get very icy when they're you
know<00:02:11.360> ripple<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.230> we're<00:02:12.410> going<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.950> cook

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
know ripple and we're going to cook

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.650 
know ripple and we're going to cook
these<00:02:13.459> until<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:14.030> rest<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.480> sugar

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
these until the rest of the sugar

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.360 
these until the rest of the sugar
dissolves<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.410> what<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.620> doesn't<00:02:15.920> burn<00:02:16.070> and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
dissolves and what you doesn't burn and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.729 
dissolves and what you doesn't burn and
secondly<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.269> juices<00:02:17.810> from<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.050> Rice's<00:02:18.530> has

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
secondly the juices from the Rice's has

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.920 
secondly the juices from the Rice's has
reduced<00:02:19.160> right<00:02:19.400> down<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:19.970> sort<00:02:20.239> of<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.420> few

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
reduced right down to it sort of a few

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.509 
reduced right down to it sort of a few
Shapiro's<00:02:21.380> don't<00:02:21.620> squash<00:02:21.890> them<00:02:22.100> up<00:02:22.220> too<00:02:22.400> much

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
Shapiro's don't squash them up too much

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.620 
Shapiro's don't squash them up too much
because<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:22.970> still<00:02:23.150> want<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.360> have<00:02:23.510> some

nozzles<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.330> just<00:02:26.450> moves<00:02:26.720> like<00:02:26.840> Jam<00:02:27.200> and

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
nozzles so it just moves like Jam and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.990 
nozzles so it just moves like Jam and
just<00:02:27.530> fold<00:02:27.739> it<00:02:27.890> through<00:02:28.100> your<00:02:28.250> ice<00:02:28.400> cream<00:02:28.730> and

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
just fold it through your ice cream and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.759 
just fold it through your ice cream and
as<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.300> starts<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.780> thought<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.380> juice<00:02:30.590> will

as it starts the thought the juice will

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.110 
as it starts the thought the juice will
come<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.130> those<00:02:31.310> are<00:02:31.459> our<00:02:31.550> three<00:02:31.580> and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
come and those are our three and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.060 
come and those are our three and
dissolve<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.600> sugar<00:02:32.930> just<00:02:33.260> keep<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.590> moving

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
dissolve that sugar just keep it moving

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.570 
dissolve that sugar just keep it moving
okay<00:02:34.459> after<00:02:34.730> eight<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.390> half<00:02:35.420> minutes<00:02:35.900> and

raspberry syrup has reduced right down
it's<00:02:39.830> by<00:02:40.130> no<00:02:40.160> means<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.850> jam<00:02:41.209> it's<00:02:41.540> not<00:02:41.750> going<00:02:42.019> to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
it's by no means a jam it's not going to

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.500 
it's by no means a jam it's not going to
sit<00:02:42.620> like<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.980> jam<00:02:43.340> but<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.730> has<00:02:43.880> reduced<00:02:44.330> some

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
sit like a jam but it has reduced some

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.059 
sit like a jam but it has reduced some
of<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:44.780> water<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.530> now<00:02:45.709> we're<00:02:45.860> going<00:02:46.010> to

of that water and now we're going to

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.280 
of that water and now we're going to
just<00:02:46.280> turn<00:02:46.550> that<00:02:46.580> off<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:47.269> can<00:02:47.690> see<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.019> fruit

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
just turn that off you can see the fruit

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.770 
just turn that off you can see the fruit
is<00:02:48.440> too<00:02:48.640> substantially<00:02:49.640> intact<00:02:50.090> this<00:02:50.390> quite

is too substantially intact this quite
large<00:02:51.079> chunks<00:02:51.590> of<00:02:51.680> raspberry<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.430> there<00:02:52.640> and

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
large chunks of raspberry in there and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.300 
large chunks of raspberry in there and
the<00:02:53.090> syrup<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.660> really<00:02:54.140> quite<00:02:54.500> thick<00:02:54.890> as<00:02:55.040> well

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
the syrup is really quite thick as well

the syrup is really quite thick as well
now<00:02:55.760> we're<00:02:55.910> just<00:02:56.000> going<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.299> chill<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.600> and

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
now we're just going to chill that and

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.170 
now we're just going to chill that and
it<00:02:57.440> will<00:02:57.620> be<00:02:57.739> folded<00:02:58.220> or<00:02:58.430> rippled<00:02:58.820> through<00:02:59.000> our
