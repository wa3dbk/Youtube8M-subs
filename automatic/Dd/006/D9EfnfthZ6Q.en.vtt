00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
the first example should be our cylinder

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.550 
the first example should be our cylinder
head<00:01:33.979> there<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:34.909> exhaust<00:01:35.509> manifold<00:01:36.049> is

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
head there the exhaust manifold is

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.819 
head there the exhaust manifold is
integrated<00:01:37.400> you<00:01:37.579> can<00:01:37.820> see<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.119> here<00:01:38.560> where<00:01:39.560> the

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
integrated you can see it here where the

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.130 
integrated you can see it here where the
big<00:01:40.520> soft<00:01:40.970> ports<00:01:41.689> of<00:01:41.840> individual<00:01:42.680> cylinders

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
big soft ports of individual cylinders

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.140 
big soft ports of individual cylinders
come<00:01:45.140> together<00:01:45.320> within<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.280> cylinder<00:01:46.970> head

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
come together within the cylinder head

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.139 
come together within the cylinder head
and<00:01:48.049> there<00:01:48.350> we<00:01:48.560> have<00:01:49.070> a<00:01:49.310> very<00:01:49.670> efficient

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
and there we have a very efficient

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.960 
and there we have a very efficient
cooling<00:01:50.390> of<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.810> exhaust<00:01:51.170> yes<00:01:51.439> and<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.430> we<00:01:52.670> can

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
cooling of the exhaust yes and so we can

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.620 
cooling of the exhaust yes and so we can
drive<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.200> engine<00:01:54.430> over<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.579> whole<00:01:55.759> full

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
drive the engine over the whole full

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.069 
drive the engine over the whole full
load<00:01:56.840> range<00:01:57.140> with<00:01:57.829> lambda1<00:01:58.780> that's<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.899> big

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
load range with lambda1 that's a big

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.580 
load range with lambda1 that's a big
