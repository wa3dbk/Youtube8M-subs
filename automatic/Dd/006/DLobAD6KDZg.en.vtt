00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.539 
doubt in the back of my mind after that
lecture<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.710> had<00:01:25.799> completely<00:01:26.310> disappeared

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
lecture it had completely disappeared

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.940 
lecture it had completely disappeared
now<00:01:27.210> how<00:01:27.390> does<00:01:27.450> University<00:01:28.259> work<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
now how does University work in the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.560 
now how does University work in the
Netherlands<00:01:29.430> universities<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
Netherlands universities and the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.060 
Netherlands universities and the
Netherlands<00:01:30.930> are<00:01:31.049> very<00:01:31.320> different<00:01:31.650> from

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
Netherlands are very different from

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.679 
Netherlands are very different from
universities<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.880> America<00:01:33.299> obviously<00:01:33.420> I

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
universities in America obviously I

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.170 
universities in America obviously I
can't<00:01:34.290> compare<00:01:34.829> every<00:01:35.220> single<00:01:35.700> system<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
can't compare every single system in the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.340 
can't compare every single system in the
world<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> only<00:01:36.630> other<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.140> I'm

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
world the only other one that I'm

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.109 
world the only other one that I'm
familiar<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.189> American<00:01:38.729> one<00:01:38.880> so

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
familiar with is the American one so

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.670 
familiar with is the American one so
that's<00:01:39.270> what<00:01:39.479> I'll<00:01:39.540> be<00:01:39.600> comparing<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.320> far<00:01:40.560> as

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that's what I'll be comparing as far as

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.350 
that's what I'll be comparing as far as
I<00:01:40.770> know<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.070> America<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.549> choose<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> major<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
I know in America you choose a major and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.330 
I know in America you choose a major and
then<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> lot<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.470> different<00:01:44.070> other

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
then you have a lot of different other

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.639 
then you have a lot of different other
classes<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.450> some<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.840> those<00:01:45.990> are<00:01:46.049> part<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
classes and some of those are part of

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.440 
classes and some of those are part of
general<00:01:46.710> education<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.030> means<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.299> even

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
general education so means that even

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.850 
general education so means that even
though<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.720> might<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:49.049> an<00:01:49.170> English<00:01:49.470> major<00:01:49.680> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
though you might be an English major you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.560 
though you might be an English major you
might<00:01:50.310> still<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.880> take<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.240> business

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
might still have to take a business

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.660 
might still have to take a business
class<00:01:51.899> or<00:01:52.290> an<00:01:52.470> algebra<00:01:52.920> class<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
class or an algebra class in the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.980 
class or an algebra class in the
Netherlands<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.149> get<00:01:54.329> all<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.659> general

it's<00:02:24.430> kind<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.610> difficult<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:25.000> explain<00:02:25.090> I

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
it's kind of difficult to explain I

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.940 
it's kind of difficult to explain I
might<00:02:25.600> make<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> separate<00:02:26.230> video<00:02:26.350> about<00:02:26.740> this

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
might make a separate video about this

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.780 
might make a separate video about this
at<00:02:27.130> some<00:02:27.280> point

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
at some point
