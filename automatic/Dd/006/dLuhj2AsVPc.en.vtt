team kilo 2 3 about how to do these and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.319 
team kilo 2 3 about how to do these and
basically<00:00:27.650> how<00:00:27.890> these<00:00:28.130> silencers<00:00:28.880> consists

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
basically how these silencers consists

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.010 
basically how these silencers consists
of<00:00:29.509> is<00:00:29.779> an<00:00:30.560> inner<00:00:30.740> foam<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:31.689> with<00:00:32.689> an<00:00:32.870> outer

core of either like a plastic PVC pipe

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.110 
core of either like a plastic PVC pipe
or<00:00:37.520> even<00:00:38.240> as<00:00:38.360> simple<00:00:38.810> as<00:00:39.050> a<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:40.190> know<00:00:40.310> paper

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
towel to um you can get the inner foam

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.070 
towel to um you can get the inner foam
at<00:00:44.930> home<00:00:45.110> depot<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:45.890> that's<00:00:46.880> the<00:00:47.150> stuff<00:00:47.390> i<00:00:47.720> use

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
at home depot and that's the stuff i use

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.470 
at home depot and that's the stuff i use
for<00:00:48.470> my<00:00:48.530> l96<00:00:49.400> was<00:00:49.640> i'll<00:00:49.760> show<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:50.000> in<00:00:50.090> a<00:00:50.180> second

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
for my l96 was i'll show you in a second

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.970 
for my l96 was i'll show you in a second
it's<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.410> three-quarter<00:00:53.050> copper<00:00:54.050> or<00:00:54.530> Massell

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
it's the three-quarter copper or Massell

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.250 
it's the three-quarter copper or Massell
stuff<00:00:55.310> and<00:00:55.550> then<00:00:56.150> what<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:56.630> can<00:00:56.660> do<00:00:56.930> is<00:00:57.050> put

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
stuff and then what you can do is put

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.230 
stuff and then what you can do is put
some<00:00:57.440> duct<00:00:57.650> tapes<00:00:57.890> on<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.280> end<00:00:58.430> of<00:00:58.670> it<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.210> that

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
some duct tapes on the end of it so that

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.870 
some duct tapes on the end of it so that
it<00:00:59.750> will<00:00:59.870> hold<00:01:00.170> inside<00:01:00.650> of<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.190> plastic<00:01:01.400> tubes

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
it will hold inside of the plastic tubes

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.350 
it will hold inside of the plastic tubes
better<00:01:02.380> so<00:01:03.380> this<00:01:03.890> is<00:01:03.920> one<00:01:04.400> type<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:04.699> it<00:01:05.000> right

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
better so this is one type of it right

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.249 
better so this is one type of it right
here<00:01:05.439> where<00:01:06.439> you<00:01:06.830> have<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:07.070> plastic<00:01:07.960> abs<00:01:08.960> not

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
here where you have a plastic abs not

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.239 
here where you have a plastic abs not
PVC<00:01:09.770> i<00:01:09.799> take<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:10.100> back<00:01:10.280> pipe<00:01:11.179> with<00:01:11.719> the<00:01:11.929> inner

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249 
PVC i take that back pipe with the inner

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:15.279 
PVC i take that back pipe with the inner
foam<00:01:13.249> right<00:01:13.490> here<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.060> basically<00:01:14.600> how<00:01:15.049> these

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
foam right here and basically how these

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.739 
foam right here and basically how these
work<00:01:15.320> is<00:01:15.859> the<00:01:16.100> foam<00:01:16.340> is<00:01:16.369> a<00:01:16.609> little<00:01:16.969> bit<00:01:17.149> smaller

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
work is the foam is a little bit smaller

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:20.410 
work is the foam is a little bit smaller
than<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:18.109> barrel<00:01:18.549> so<00:01:19.549> when<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:19.789> take<00:01:19.999> it<00:01:20.149> over

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
than the barrel so when you take it over

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.130 
than the barrel so when you take it over
like<00:01:20.450> this<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:22.490> can<00:01:22.640> kind<00:01:22.819> of<00:01:22.969> fit<00:01:23.899> it<00:01:24.020> on

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
like this you can kind of fit it on

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.889 
like this you can kind of fit it on
there<00:01:24.460> like<00:01:25.460> that<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:26.149> becomes<00:01:26.359> snug<00:01:26.749> on

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
there like that and it becomes snug on

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.739 
there like that and it becomes snug on
your<00:01:26.960> barrel<00:01:27.380> now<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.369> have<00:01:28.549> a<00:01:28.579> silencer<00:01:29.299> for

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
your barrel now you have a silencer for

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:31.870 
your barrel now you have a silencer for
your<00:01:29.869> sniper<00:01:30.079> rifle<00:01:30.499> one<00:01:31.310> thing<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.579> can<00:01:31.759> do

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
your sniper rifle one thing you can do

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.580 
your sniper rifle one thing you can do
is<00:01:32.090> if<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:32.420> get<00:01:32.600> really<00:01:33.049> good<00:01:33.170> at<00:01:33.350> building

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
is if you get really good at building

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.660 
is if you get really good at building
these<00:01:33.859> please<00:01:34.789> you<00:01:34.939> can<00:01:35.090> actually<00:01:35.509> get<00:01:35.719> um

these please you can actually get um
some<00:01:38.020> let's<00:01:39.020> see<00:01:39.200> like<00:01:39.439> a<00:01:39.920> symbol<00:01:40.579> foam<00:01:40.819> i

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
some let's see like a symbol foam i

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.819 
some let's see like a symbol foam i
think<00:01:41.240> it<00:01:41.329> is<00:01:41.450> for<00:01:41.719> drum<00:01:42.079> sets<00:01:42.380> where<00:01:42.710> it's

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
think it is for drum sets where it's

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.270 
think it is for drum sets where it's
actually<00:01:43.009> sound<00:01:44.049> you<00:01:45.049> know<00:01:45.079> sound<00:01:45.469> acoustical

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
actually sound you know sound acoustical

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.849 
actually sound you know sound acoustical
foam<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.969> put<00:01:47.569> stuff<00:01:47.929> that<00:01:48.139> in<00:01:48.289> the<00:01:48.380> end<00:01:48.499> and

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
foam and put stuff that in the end and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.859 
foam and put stuff that in the end and
then<00:01:48.979> get<00:01:49.159> an<00:01:49.249> end<00:01:49.490> cap<00:01:49.850> to<00:01:50.209> put<00:01:50.389> on<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:50.539> like<00:01:50.840> a

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
then get an end cap to put on it like a

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.459 
then get an end cap to put on it like a
washer<00:01:51.409> or<00:01:51.439> something<00:01:52.869> so<00:01:53.869> you<00:01:53.929> don't<00:01:54.380> have

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
washer or something so you don't have

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.550 
washer or something so you don't have
that<00:01:54.619> big<00:01:54.829> end<00:01:55.039> and<00:01:55.249> that<00:01:55.369> will<00:01:55.520> actually<00:01:55.579> um

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
that big end and that will actually um

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.629 
that big end and that will actually um
it'll<00:01:57.560> actually<00:01:57.679> bring<00:01:58.039> down<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.310> sound<00:01:58.520> a
