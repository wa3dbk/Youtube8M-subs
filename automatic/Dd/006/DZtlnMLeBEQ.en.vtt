00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
have too much because it feels like my

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.020 
have too much because it feels like my
head<00:03:40.080> is<00:03:40.140> full<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.530> clips<00:03:40.830> I<00:03:41.130> like<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.820> so

head is full of clips I like it so
there's<00:03:42.270> just<00:03:42.510> enough<00:03:42.810> for<00:03:43.050> it<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.200> look<00:03:43.320> thick

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
there's just enough for it to look thick

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.250 
there's just enough for it to look thick
but<00:03:44.280> not<00:03:44.310> too<00:03:44.490> much<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.450> as<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.630> can<00:03:45.750> see<00:03:46.020> I

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
but not too much so as you can see I

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.380 
but not too much so as you can see I
measure<00:03:46.770> where<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.010> want<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.400> go<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:47.880> double

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
measure where I want it to go I double

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.510
