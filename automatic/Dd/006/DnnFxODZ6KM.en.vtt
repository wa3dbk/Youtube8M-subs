00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.660 
as well and I think Paul did a fantastic
job<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.670> creating<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.750> very<00:01:37.710> good<00:01:37.979> rendition<00:01:38.579> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
job of creating a very good rendition of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.359 
job of creating a very good rendition of
what<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> actual<00:01:39.390> model<00:01:39.750> looks<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.369> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
what the actual model looks like the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.249 
what the actual model looks like the
next<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> Lamborghini

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
next one I have here is a Lamborghini

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.190 
next one I have here is a Lamborghini
Gallardo<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:44.340> built<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.790> red<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.840> review<00:01:46.170> I

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
Gallardo it's built in red the review I

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.350 
Gallardo it's built in red the review I
have<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.560> my<00:01:46.680> channel<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.280> built<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.700> yellow<00:01:48.090> but

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
have on my channel I built in yellow but

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.469 
have on my channel I built in yellow but
this<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:49.110> has<00:01:49.350> since<00:01:50.040> been<00:01:50.280> rebuilt<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.180> red

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
this one has since been rebuilt in red

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.569 
this one has since been rebuilt in red
the<00:01:52.049> yellow<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> little<00:01:53.189> bit<00:01:53.310> difficult

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
the yellow is a little bit difficult

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.190 
the yellow is a little bit difficult
because<00:01:54.000> not<00:01:54.299> all<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> parts<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:55.079> available

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
because not all the parts are available

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.490 
because not all the parts are available
in<00:01:55.710> yellow<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> wanted<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.960> rebuild<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.290> back

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
in yellow so I wanted to rebuild it back

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.780 
in yellow so I wanted to rebuild it back
in<00:01:58.680> red<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.070> make<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.399> little<00:01:59.549> bit<00:01:59.670> more

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
in red and make it a little bit more

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.310 
in red and make it a little bit more
correct<00:02:00.180> as<00:02:00.329> far<00:02:00.540> as<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> parts<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.259> do

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
correct as far as the parts but I do

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.410 
correct as far as the parts but I do
have<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> review<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.310> model<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:02.969> my

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
one that he released in early 2014 this

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.250

is called the muscle car the American
muscle<00:02:13.620> car<00:02:13.830> I've<00:02:14.280> built<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.730> here<00:02:14.879> in<00:02:14.970> black

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
muscle car I've built it here in black

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.180 
muscle car I've built it here in black
and<00:02:15.540> probably<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.379> most<00:02:16.590> unique<00:02:16.920> feature

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
and probably the most unique feature

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.460 
and probably the most unique feature
about<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.760> one<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.209> couple<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.080> things<00:02:19.230> one

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
the way the hood lifts up and it's one

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.260 
the way the hood lifts up and it's one
of<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.050> very<00:02:22.080> few<00:02:22.819> supercars<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:23.940> Paul<00:02:24.239> is

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
of the very few supercars that Paul is

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880 
of the very few supercars that Paul is
designed<00:02:24.780> where<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.020> engine<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.410> actually<00:02:25.560> in

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
designed where the engine is actually in

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.260 
designed where the engine is actually in
the<00:02:26.010> front<00:02:26.310> there's<00:02:26.489> not<00:02:26.640> very<00:02:26.670> many<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.120> them

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
that I've built of his where the engine

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.650 
that I've built of his where the engine
is<00:02:28.800> in<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.010> front<00:02:29.069> but<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:29.879> one<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.269> very

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
believe the instructions for these are

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.649 
believe the instructions for these are
now<00:03:08.099> free<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.459> his<00:03:08.730> website<00:03:08.940> I'm<00:03:09.269> not<00:03:09.420> exactly

now free on his website I'm not exactly

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.360 
now free on his website I'm not exactly
sure<00:03:09.959> but<00:03:10.170> we're<00:03:10.379> checking<00:03:10.620> out<00:03:10.800> crow<00:03:11.069> killers

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370
