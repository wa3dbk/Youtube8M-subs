00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
think we had a lot of great quality

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.650 
think we had a lot of great quality
chances<00:03:12.890> after<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.490> first<00:03:13.730> period<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.300> the

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
chances after the first period and the

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.660 
chances after the first period and the

quality chances we did we did have I

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.210 
quality chances we did we did have I
thought<00:03:16.850> we<00:03:16.970> shot<00:03:17.180> wide<00:03:17.420> or<00:03:18.080> we<00:03:18.260> didn't<00:03:18.530> where

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.320 
thought we shot wide or we didn't where
we<00:03:19.310> didn't<00:03:19.550> shoot<00:03:19.700> at<00:03:19.820> all<00:03:19.970> we<00:03:20.180> had<00:03:20.300> a

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
we didn't shoot at all we had a

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.090 
we didn't shoot at all we had a
two-on-one<00:03:21.050> late<00:03:21.440> in<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.620> third<00:03:21.890> way<00:03:22.040> to

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
two-on-one late in the third way to

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.010 
two-on-one late in the third way to
three<00:03:22.430> on<00:03:22.520> one<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.850> over<00:03:23.060> time<00:03:23.240> and<00:03:23.450> neither

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
three on one and over time and neither

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.860 
three on one and over time and neither
one<00:03:24.260> we<00:03:24.410> got<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.590> shot<00:03:24.860> off<00:03:24.890> so<00:03:25.850> I<00:03:25.880> mean<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.270> lock

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
one we got a shot off so I mean a lock

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.570 
one we got a shot off so I mean a lock
played<00:03:27.170> good<00:03:27.410> but<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.650> don't<00:03:27.710> think<00:03:28.010> he<00:03:28.130> did

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
played good but I don't think he did

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.850 
played good but I don't think he did
anything<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:29.330> we<00:03:29.480> didn't<00:03:29.810> think<00:03:30.560> he<00:03:30.770> was

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
anything that we didn't think he was

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.360 
anything that we didn't think he was
capable<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:31.490> doing<00:03:32.140> Bruce<00:03:33.140> at<00:03:33.620> what<00:03:33.860> point<00:03:34.100> and

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
capable of doing Bruce at what point and

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.370 
capable of doing Bruce at what point and
why<00:03:34.520> do<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:34.790> think<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.150> momentum<00:03:35.390> shifted<00:03:36.290> it

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
why do you think the momentum shifted it

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.840 
why do you think the momentum shifted it
was<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.530> pre<00:03:36.710> clearly<00:03:37.070> tilted<00:03:37.430> towards<00:03:37.760> you

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
was a pre clearly tilted towards you

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.150 
was a pre clearly tilted towards you
guys<00:03:37.910> in<00:03:38.210> the<00:03:38.300> first<00:03:38.570> it<00:03:39.170> started<00:03:39.590> midway

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
guys in the first it started midway

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.770 
guys in the first it started midway
through<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.430> second<00:03:40.850> half<00:03:40.940> how<00:03:41.510> do<00:03:41.570> you<00:03:41.660> think

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
through the second half how do you think

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.860 
through the second half how do you think
that<00:03:41.930> happened<00:03:42.140> or<00:03:42.410> what<00:03:42.580> well<00:03:43.580> because<00:03:44.540> it

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
that happened or what well because it

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.960 
that happened or what well because it
happens<00:03:45.200> in<00:03:45.410> sports<00:03:45.740> you<00:03:46.040> know<00:03:46.700> you<00:03:46.760> out

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
happens in sports you know you out

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.030 
happens in sports you know you out
shooter<00:03:47.300> team<00:03:47.480> 19<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:48.020> seven<00:03:48.200> in<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.560> first

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
shooter team 19 to seven in the first

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.950 
shooter team 19 to seven in the first
period<00:03:49.310> it's<00:03:50.030> not<00:03:50.240> going<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.510> end<00:03:50.540> up<00:03:50.710> 5721<00:03:51.710> and

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
period it's not going to end up 5721 and

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.990 
period it's not going to end up 5721 and
I<00:03:53.960> was<00:03:54.740> a<00:03:54.770> little<00:03:55.070> worried<00:03:55.310> after<00:03:55.490> the<00:03:55.730> first

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
I was a little worried after the first

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.180 
I was a little worried after the first
that<00:03:56.210> you<00:03:56.420> know<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:56.930> have<00:03:57.140> a<00:03:57.170> one<00:03:57.440> it's<00:03:57.740> a<00:03:57.860> 1-1

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
that you know you have a one it's a 1-1

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.750 
that you know you have a one it's a 1-1
tie<00:03:58.460> and<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:59.750> think<00:04:00.230> we<00:04:00.380> we<00:04:01.190> have<00:04:01.310> played<00:04:01.580> them

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
tie and I think we we have played them

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.700 
tie and I think we we have played them
pretty<00:04:02.000> badly<00:04:02.240> in<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.570> first<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:03.140> usually

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
pretty badly in the first and usually

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.650 
pretty badly in the first and usually
when<00:04:03.830> you<00:04:03.950> do<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:04.310> if<00:04:04.460> you<00:04:04.490> don't<00:04:04.580> you<00:04:05.540> know

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
when you do that if you don't you know

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.440 
when you do that if you don't you know
if<00:04:05.750> you<00:04:06.140> don't<00:04:06.320> get<00:04:06.680> your<00:04:06.820> get<00:04:07.820> your<00:04:07.850> 3<00:04:08.180> 2<00:04:08.300> 1

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
other way and it did and then I saw it

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.230 
other way and it did and then I saw it

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
the most part and we played a lot of

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.550 
the most part and we played a lot of
teams<00:04:56.270> coming<00:04:56.660> down<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.930> stretch<00:04:57.229> that

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
teams coming down the stretch that

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.309 
teams coming down the stretch that
needed<00:04:57.919> to<00:04:58.069> win<00:04:58.280> and<00:04:58.610> played<00:04:59.270> as<00:04:59.720> hard<00:04:59.960> as<00:05:00.139> they

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319 
needed to win and played as hard as they

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.180 
needed to win and played as hard as they
had<00:05:00.590> to<00:05:01.449> you<00:05:02.449> know<00:05:02.569> I<00:05:02.599> just<00:05:02.900> I<00:05:03.380> just<00:05:03.680> think<00:05:04.069> it

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
had to you know I just I just think it

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.189 
had to you know I just I just think it
was<00:05:04.280> it<00:05:04.490> was<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.610> good<00:05:05.180> game<00:05:05.389> we<00:05:05.599> made<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.810> mistake

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
was it was a good game we made a mistake

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.960 
was it was a good game we made a mistake
in<00:05:06.229> overtime<00:05:06.740> and<00:05:06.979> it<00:05:07.069> cost<00:05:07.280> us<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.669> mean<00:05:07.819> there

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
in overtime and it cost us I mean there

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.790 
in overtime and it cost us I mean there
they<00:05:10.970> might<00:05:11.150> not<00:05:11.360> have<00:05:11.479> played<00:05:11.630> very<00:05:12.020> well<00:05:12.229> the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
they might not have played very well the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.909 
they might not have played very well the
last<00:05:12.979> 11<00:05:13.520> games<00:05:13.599> but<00:05:14.599> they<00:05:14.630> sure<00:05:15.380> ramped<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:15.800> up

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
last 11 games but they sure ramped it up

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.320 
last 11 games but they sure ramped it up
I<00:05:16.130> thought<00:05:16.340> today<00:05:16.550> they<00:05:16.849> played<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.120> pretty

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
I thought today they played a pretty

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.559 
I thought today they played a pretty
solid<00:05:17.599> game<00:05:18.520> over<00:05:19.520> simplify<00:05:20.030> things<00:05:20.090> but<00:05:20.389> is

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:20.569 
solid game over simplify things but is

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:21.820 
solid game over simplify things but is
it<00:05:20.690> fair<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:20.870> say<00:05:21.020> that<00:05:21.110> you<00:05:21.289> just<00:05:21.560> need<00:05:21.710> your

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
it fair to say that you just need your

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.189 
it fair to say that you just need your
star<00:05:22.069> players<00:05:22.400> to<00:05:22.639> play<00:05:23.030> better<00:05:23.300> next<00:05:23.509> game<00:05:23.930> to

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
star players to play better next game to

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.529 
star players to play better next game to
that<00:05:24.440> would<00:05:24.590> be<00:05:24.620> that<00:05:24.949> would<00:05:25.099> be<00:05:25.400> a<00:05:25.849> good

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
that would be that would be a good

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.379 
that would be that would be a good
assessment<00:05:26.840> I<00:05:27.259> think<00:05:27.789> our<00:05:28.789> best<00:05:29.120> players

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
assessment I think our best players

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:30.879 
assessment I think our best players
weren't<00:05:29.630> our<00:05:29.780> best<00:05:30.020> players<00:05:30.289> tonight<00:05:30.620> and

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
weren't our best players tonight and

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.129 
weren't our best players tonight and
their<00:05:31.370> best<00:05:31.639> players<00:05:31.880> were<00:05:32.180> I<00:05:32.449> mean<00:05:32.780> our<00:05:32.930> role

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
their best players were I mean our role

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.999 
their best players were I mean our role
players<00:05:33.440> I<00:05:33.590> thought<00:05:33.770> played<00:05:33.979> really<00:05:34.219> good<00:05:34.340> I

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.110 

mean<00:05:40.009> I<00:05:40.099> thought<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.460> first<00:05:40.729> period<00:05:40.909> they

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
mean I thought the first period they

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.399 
mean I thought the first period they
were<00:05:41.210> really<00:05:41.419> good<00:05:41.659> they<00:05:41.810> scored<00:05:42.110> a<00:05:42.169> goal<00:05:42.349> I

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
were really good they scored a goal I

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.279 
were really good they scored a goal I
thought<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:43.270> couple<00:05:44.270> shifts<00:05:44.570> in<00:05:44.810> the<00:05:44.900> second

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
thought the couple shifts in the second

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.499 
thought the couple shifts in the second
period<00:05:45.440> they<00:05:45.680> got<00:05:45.860> caught<00:05:46.130> too<00:05:46.940> long<00:05:47.180> on<00:05:47.419> the

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
period they got caught too long on the

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.560 
period they got caught too long on the
ice<00:05:47.659> and<00:05:47.960> and<00:05:48.610> they<00:05:49.610> got<00:05:49.789> Hamed<00:05:50.030> in<00:05:50.210> a<00:05:50.270> little

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
ice and and they got Hamed in a little

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.469 
ice and and they got Hamed in a little
bit<00:05:50.719> but<00:05:51.020> I<00:05:51.199> mean<00:05:51.919> I<00:05:52.190> thought<00:05:52.969> they<00:05:53.150> were<00:05:53.210> as

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
bit but I mean I thought they were as

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.200 
bit but I mean I thought they were as
good<00:05:53.630> as<00:05:53.919> Montreal's<00:05:54.919> third<00:05:55.250> line<00:05:55.490> and<00:05:55.759> you

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
good as Montreal's third line and you

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.899 
good as Montreal's third line and you
know<00:05:56.330> I<00:05:56.360> think<00:05:56.979> boulanger<00:05:57.979> was<00:05:58.159> 18<00:05:58.520> and<00:05:58.669> three

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
know I think boulanger was 18 and three

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:01.870 
know I think boulanger was 18 and three
on<00:05:59.000> the<00:05:59.120> faceoffs<00:05:59.630> and<00:05:59.930> which<00:06:00.590> was<00:06:00.860> is<00:06:01.159> quite

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
on the faceoffs and which was is quite

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.300 
on the faceoffs and which was is quite
impressive<00:06:02.150> and<00:06:02.680> one<00:06:03.680> of<00:06:03.770> the<00:06:03.860> reasons<00:06:03.889> you

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
impressive and one of the reasons you

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.890 
impressive and one of the reasons you
usually<00:06:04.460> end<00:06:04.639> up<00:06:04.849> with<00:06:05.060> a<00:06:05.090> lot<00:06:05.330> of<00:06:05.360> control<00:06:05.750> of

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
usually end up with a lot of control of

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.139 
usually end up with a lot of control of
the<00:06:05.990> puck
