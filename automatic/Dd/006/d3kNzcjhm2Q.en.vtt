00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
store ID which it's of course a fake ID

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.199 
store ID which it's of course a fake ID
because<00:02:41.709> like<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.549> said<00:02:42.819> this<00:02:42.939> is<00:02:43.060> for

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
because like I said this is for

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.960 
because like I said this is for
demonstrational<00:02:43.930> purposes<00:02:43.959> only<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.970> it's

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
demonstrational purposes only and it's

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.259 
demonstrational purposes only and it's
not<00:02:46.090> actually<00:02:46.659> usable<00:02:47.669> but<00:02:48.669> you<00:02:48.730> can<00:02:48.909> put<00:02:49.239> a

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
not actually usable but you can put a

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.289 
not actually usable but you can put a
fake<00:02:49.599> barcode<00:02:50.260> number<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:51.370> rewards<00:02:52.030> card

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
fake barcode number a rewards card

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.270 
fake barcode number a rewards card
number<00:02:52.689> and<00:02:52.959> then<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.379> can<00:02:53.530> put<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.709> fake<00:02:54.010> name

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
number and then you can put a fake name

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.789 
number and then you can put a fake name
to<00:02:54.609> be<00:02:54.849> displayed<00:02:55.239> on<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.419> card<00:02:55.719> so<00:02:55.900> currently

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
to be displayed on the card so currently

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
fun so there you go you could change the

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.879 
fun so there you go you could change the
details<00:03:14.919> like<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:16.139> then<00:03:17.139> when<00:03:17.560> you're<00:03:17.680> done

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
you hit create and you'll see this it'll

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.649 
you hit create and you'll see this it'll
jump<00:03:22.989> up<00:03:23.169> here<00:03:23.500> at<00:03:24.120> asking<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.239> if<00:03:25.359> you'd<00:03:25.510> like

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
to add this path to passbook as you can

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.740 
to add this path to passbook as you can
see<00:03:28.510> Bob<00:03:28.870> Hope<00:03:29.139> is<00:03:29.409> on<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.889> name<00:03:30.569> then<00:03:31.569> we<00:03:31.659> have

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
see Bob Hope is on the name then we have

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.240 
see Bob Hope is on the name then we have
the<00:03:31.840> barcode<00:03:32.260> number<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:32.829> everything<00:03:32.979> like

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
the barcode number and everything like

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.280 
the barcode number and everything like
that<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:33.489> if<00:03:33.909> you<00:03:34.030> want<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:34.359> add<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.750> past<00:03:34.989> to

that so if you want to add the past to

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.240 
that so if you want to add the past to
passbook<00:03:35.889> go<00:03:36.579> ahead<00:03:36.849> up<00:03:37.180> here<00:03:37.629> hit<00:03:37.930> add<00:03:38.169> and<00:03:38.530> it

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
passbook go ahead up here hit add and it

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.559 
passbook go ahead up here hit add and it
will<00:03:39.340> jump<00:03:39.579> it<00:03:39.669> right<00:03:39.849> down<00:03:40.060> into<00:03:40.389> your

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
will jump it right down into your

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.679 
will jump it right down into your
passbook<00:03:41.049> section<00:03:41.949> and<00:03:42.299> then<00:03:43.299> that's

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
passbook section and then that's

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.869 
passbook section and then that's
basically<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:44.470> you've<00:03:44.739> basically<00:03:45.040> added<00:03:45.669> a

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
basically it you've basically added a

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.800 
basically it you've basically added a
fake<00:03:46.659> pass<00:03:47.560> or<00:03:47.949> card<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.849> your<00:03:49.090> passbook<00:03:49.599> app

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
fake pass or card to your passbook app

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.319 
fake pass or card to your passbook app
so<00:03:50.169> now<00:03:50.439> let's<00:03:51.129> go<00:03:51.250> ahead<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.579> jump<00:03:51.759> out<00:03:51.939> to

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
so now let's go ahead and jump out to

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.080 
so now let's go ahead and jump out to
the<00:03:53.340> application<00:03:54.340> so<00:03:54.609> let's<00:03:54.639> go<00:03:54.849> into

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
the application so let's go into

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.649 
the application so let's go into
passbook<00:03:55.569> as<00:03:55.829> you<00:03:56.829> can<00:03:56.979> see<00:03:57.129> there<00:03:57.509> all<00:03:58.509> right

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
passbook as you can see there all right

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.509 
passbook as you can see there all right
you<00:03:58.840> got<00:03:59.079> your<00:03:59.459> pass<00:04:00.459> that<00:04:01.299> you<00:04:01.329> just<00:04:01.780> added<00:04:02.519> so

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
you got your pass that you just added so

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.580 
you got your pass that you just added so
then<00:04:03.669> you<00:04:03.759> can<00:04:03.909> just<00:04:04.150> adjust<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:05.019> and<00:04:05.229> do<00:04:05.349> some

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
then you can just adjust it and do some

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.530 
then you can just adjust it and do some
fun<00:04:05.799> stuff<00:04:05.859> whether<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.400> could<00:04:06.549> send<00:04:07.359> it<00:04:07.479> via

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
fun stuff whether you could send it via
