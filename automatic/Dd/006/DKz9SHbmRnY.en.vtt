00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
wind up removing that they would then

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.650 
wind up removing that they would then
have<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.850> take<00:02:05.640> three<00:02:06.640> groups<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.120> two<00:02:07.390> you

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
have to take three groups of two you

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.840 
have to take three groups of two you
can't<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.320> this<00:02:08.590> case<00:02:08.890> this<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.520> an<00:02:09.610> example

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
can't in this case this is an example

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.330 
can't in this case this is an example
where<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.180> could<00:02:10.390> not<00:02:10.600> have<00:02:10.930> Nina<00:02:11.560> take<00:02:11.920> three

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
where you could not have Nina take three

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.090 
where you could not have Nina take three
and<00:02:12.580> Leo<00:02:13.000> take<00:02:13.360> three<00:02:13.600> each<00:02:13.870> hit<00:02:14.380> has<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:14.980> be

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
and Leo take three each hit has to be

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.810 
and Leo take three each hit has to be
handled<00:02:15.490> in<00:02:15.730> its<00:02:15.940> entirety<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:17.110> we<00:02:17.380> have<00:02:17.820> Nina

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
handled in its entirety so we have Nina

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.710 
handled in its entirety so we have Nina
go<00:02:19.120> down<00:02:19.330> for<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.260> Leo<00:02:21.070> move<00:02:21.430> down<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.970> because

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
go down for and Leo move down to because

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.290 
go down for and Leo move down to because
they're<00:02:22.930> entrapped<00:02:23.550> they<00:02:24.550> can't<00:02:24.880> leave<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
they're entrapped they can't leave the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.300 
they're entrapped they can't leave the
room<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.080> feared<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.920> actually

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
room this is a feared I that actually

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.940 
room this is a feared I that actually
would<00:02:27.430> cause<00:02:28.200> one<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.320> heroes<00:02:29.590> to

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
would cause one of the heroes to

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.920 
would cause one of the heroes to
actually<00:02:30.520> leave<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.180> room<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.780> maybe

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
actually leave the room and maybe

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.580 
actually leave the room and maybe
actually<00:02:32.590> trigger<00:02:33.180> another<00:02:34.200> action<00:02:35.200> from

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
actually trigger another action from

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.210 
actually trigger another action from
nearby<00:02:35.830> zombies<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:36.730> also<00:02:37.000> then<00:02:37.900> when<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
nearby zombies it also then when the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.640 
nearby zombies it also then when the
board<00:02:39.760> resets<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.930> reflect<00:02:41.320> where<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
board resets to reflect where the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.460 
board resets to reflect where the
different<00:02:42.040> party<00:02:42.760> members<00:02:43.150> are<00:02:43.360> your<00:02:44.020> party

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
different party members are your party

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.190 
different party members are your party
could<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.740> been<00:02:44.920> broken<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:46.180> fear<00:02:46.810> role

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
could have been broken so the fear role

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.320 
could have been broken so the fear role
can<00:02:47.590> actually<00:02:48.070> create<00:02:48.250> some<00:02:48.700> issues<00:02:49.000> as<00:02:49.180> well

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
can actually create some issues as well

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.990 
can actually create some issues as well
so<00:02:49.630> there<00:02:49.780> are<00:02:49.959> scenarios<00:02:50.500> where<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.640> may<00:02:51.850> in

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
so there are scenarios where you may in

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.870 
so there are scenarios where you may in
fact<00:02:52.440> would<00:02:53.440> want<00:02:53.740> to<00:02:53.830> cancel<00:02:54.040> out<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.610> ones

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
fact would want to cancel out that ones

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.220 
fact would want to cancel out that ones
then<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.810> that's<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.590> creature<00:02:56.890> attack
