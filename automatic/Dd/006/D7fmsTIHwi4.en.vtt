player review we haven't done these in

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.980 
player review we haven't done these in
ages<00:00:04.500> which<00:00:05.009> is<00:00:05.210> surprising<00:00:06.210> considering<00:00:06.660> the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
ages which is surprising considering the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.150 
ages which is surprising considering the
team<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.410> weeks<00:00:07.560> that<00:00:07.649> have<00:00:07.859> been<00:00:08.010> coming

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
team of the weeks that have been coming

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.009 
team of the weeks that have been coming
out<00:00:08.400> even<00:00:09.000> though<00:00:09.120> they<00:00:09.240> have<00:00:09.360> been<00:00:09.599> too<00:00:09.780> great

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
out even though they have been too great

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.959 
out even though they have been too great
but<00:00:10.349> we<00:00:10.800> could<00:00:10.950> have<00:00:11.070> selected<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.639> couple<00:00:11.910> of

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
but we could have selected a couple of

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.910 
but we could have selected a couple of
plays<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.179> made<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> review<00:00:12.900> on<00:00:13.080> them<00:00:13.290> but<00:00:13.769> I've

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
plays and made a review on them but I've

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.680 
plays and made a review on them but I've
seen<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.400> many<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.730> them<00:00:14.880> have<00:00:15.089> Tim<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.420> season

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
seen so many of them have Tim the season

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.019 
seen so many of them have Tim the season
cause<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.350> kind<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.980> pointless<00:00:17.160> but

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
cause so it's kind of pointless but

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.240 
cause so it's kind of pointless but
second<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:18.990> form<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.260> bama<00:00:19.470> Hank<00:00:19.710> has<00:00:19.949> moved

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
leagues so this means that there might

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.599 
leagues so this means that there might
be<00:00:22.109> useful<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.890> review<00:00:23.220> might<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.460> useful

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
he is in the right midfield position why

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.420 
he is in the right midfield position why
do<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.480> say<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.079> even<00:00:49.320> though<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:50.219> may<00:00:50.399> I

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
do I say like that even though it may I

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.130 
do I say like that even though it may I
made<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.940> sound<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.449> dramatic<00:00:51.960> but

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
made it sound like so dramatic but

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.810 
made it sound like so dramatic but
anyway<00:00:52.469> he's<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> right<00:00:53.460> midfield

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
anyway he's in the right midfield

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.750 
anyway he's in the right midfield
position<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.530> he's<00:00:55.530> normally<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> strike<00:00:56.520> or

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
position and he's normally a strike or

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.420 
position and he's normally a strike or
so<00:00:57.120> how<00:00:57.629> does<00:00:57.690> he<00:00:58.109> play<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.590> he<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.949> he<00:00:59.010> more

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so how does he play is he is he more

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.639 
so how does he play is he is he more

fast even though his agility is around
81<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.689> think<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.140> saw<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.590> his<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.950> game<00:01:14.100> stats

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
81 I think I saw it in his in game stats

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.820 
81 I think I saw it in his in game stats
he<00:01:14.850> still<00:01:15.119> seems<00:01:15.150> pretty<00:01:15.509> fast<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.619> not

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
he still seems pretty fast I'm not

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.120 
he still seems pretty fast I'm not
exactly<00:01:17.520> living<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.810> 94<00:01:19.530> paste<00:01:19.860> I

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
exactly living up to that 94 paste I

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.219 
exactly living up to that 94 paste I
think<00:01:20.400> he<00:01:20.549> does<00:01:20.790> feel<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.330> bit<00:01:21.540> slower<00:01:22.080> than

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
think he does feel a bit slower than

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.990 
think he does feel a bit slower than
that<00:01:22.439> because<00:01:22.680> he<00:01:23.070> does<00:01:23.220> seem<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.700> tired

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
that because he does seem to get tired

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.969 
that because he does seem to get tired
during<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> second<00:01:24.810> half<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.439> during<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
during the second half but during the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.160 
during the second half but during the
slow<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.360> star<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> match<00:01:27.930> he

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
slow of the the star of the match he

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.620 
slow of the the star of the match he
seems<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.590> very<00:01:29.100> fast<00:01:29.369> he<00:01:29.850> has<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.420> good

free<00:01:37.439> kick<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.159> put<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> replay<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.180> there

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.000 
do that then it shouldn't be too much of
a<00:03:12.630> problem<00:03:12.810> but<00:03:13.230> I'm<00:03:13.290> just<00:03:13.530> pointing<00:03:13.680> out<00:03:13.950> that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
a problem but I'm just pointing out that

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.430 
a problem but I'm just pointing out that
I<00:03:14.250> has<00:03:14.580> freestyle<00:03:15.060> weak<00:03:15.209> foot<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.630> just<00:03:16.260> fell

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
I has freestyle weak foot I just fell

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.470 
I has freestyle weak foot I just fell
he's<00:03:16.620> much<00:03:16.920> been<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.190> central<00:03:17.760> role<00:03:17.940> than<00:03:18.390> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
he's much been a central role than the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.880 
he's much been a central role than the
right<00:03:18.660> winger<00:03:18.959> role<00:03:19.140> just<00:03:19.320> like<00:03:19.530> man<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.829> the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
right winger role just like man of the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.310 
right winger role just like man of the
match<00:03:20.010> Emenike<00:03:20.670> he<00:03:21.209> just<00:03:21.420> seems<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.840> be<00:03:21.870> wasted

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
match Emenike he just seems to be wasted

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.440 
match Emenike he just seems to be wasted
but<00:03:22.890> then<00:03:23.160> again<00:03:23.280> he<00:03:23.610> does<00:03:23.790> seem<00:03:24.000> very

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
but then again he does seem very

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.120 
but then again he does seem very
effective<00:03:25.019> when<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.350> know<00:03:25.530> you're<00:03:25.980> just

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
effective when you know you're just

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.490 
effective when you know you're just
trying<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.459> pace<00:03:26.670> abuse<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.180> wink<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.989> it

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
trying to pace abuse on the wink so it

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.319 
trying to pace abuse on the wink so it
can<00:03:28.860> be<00:03:29.010> good<00:03:29.220> for<00:03:29.430> some<00:03:29.610> people<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:29.970> can<00:03:30.209> be

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
can be good for some people and can be

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.449 
can be good for some people and can be
bad<00:03:30.540> for<00:03:30.570> others<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.829> really<00:03:32.040> depends<00:03:32.400> on

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
bad for others so it really depends on

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.220 
bad for others so it really depends on
your<00:03:32.549> play<00:03:32.760> style<00:03:32.970> but<00:03:33.540> do<00:03:33.660> i<00:03:33.750> recommend<00:03:34.200> the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
190 k well that really depends because

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.979 
190 k well that really depends because
there's<00:03:37.620> not<00:03:37.769> exactly<00:03:38.220> too<00:03:38.940> many<00:03:39.269> more<00:03:39.840> there

is a couple but it really depends on
