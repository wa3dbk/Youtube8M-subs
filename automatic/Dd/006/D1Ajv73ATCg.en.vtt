this<00:00:07.529> second<00:00:08.010> trailer<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.970> bit<00:00:09.179> strange

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
this second trailer is a bit strange

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.320 
this second trailer is a bit strange
because<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.960> doesn't<00:00:10.320> actually<00:00:10.410> work<00:00:11.120> it<00:00:12.120> was

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
because it doesn't actually work it was

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.670 
because it doesn't actually work it was
supposed<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.809> be<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:14.009> more<00:00:14.490> complicated

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
supposed to be a more complicated

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.160 
supposed to be a more complicated
advanced<00:00:16.680> trailer<00:00:17.490> which<00:00:17.940> works<00:00:18.840> just<00:00:18.930> like

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
advanced trailer which works just like

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.800 
advanced trailer which works just like
it<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.710> simple<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.420> when<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.510> come<00:00:21.689> in

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
it the simple one that when you come in

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.480 
it the simple one that when you come in
with<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.080> truck<00:00:22.350> pulling<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.100> going<00:00:23.220> for

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
with the truck pulling in and going for

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.880 
with the truck pulling in and going for
the<00:00:23.760> next<00:00:24.090> go<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.350> co-op<00:00:25.560> get

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the next go up in the do co-op get

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.210 
the next go up in the do co-op get
Olympics<00:00:26.460> then<00:00:27.390> when<00:00:27.570> you're<00:00:27.779> reversing<00:00:28.220> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
Olympics then when you're reversing the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.339 
Olympics then when you're reversing the
legs<00:00:29.400> are<00:00:29.670> supposed<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> go<00:00:30.150> down<00:00:30.330> which<00:00:30.929> makes

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
legs are supposed to go down which makes

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.799 
legs are supposed to go down which makes
it<00:00:31.529> easy<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.910> be<00:00:32.910> attached<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.420> truck<00:00:33.660> and

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
it easy to be attached to the truck and

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.819 
it easy to be attached to the truck and
drive<00:00:34.140> off<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.640> trust<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.059> trader

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
drive off we have to trust in the trader

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.530 
drive off we have to trust in the trader
and<00:00:39.500> continue<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.559> tap<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.920> order<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.540> drive

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and continue on tap in order to drive

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.500 
and continue on tap in order to drive
around<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.079> container<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:47.270> I'm<00:00:48.270> going

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
around with the container so I'm going

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.299 
around with the container so I'm going
to<00:00:48.629> present<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.379> mechanism<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
to present the mechanism and then you

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.910 
to present the mechanism and then you
can<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:50.610> why<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.879> actually<00:00:51.120> doesn't<00:00:51.570> work<00:00:51.989> so

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
can see why it actually doesn't work so

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.060 
can see why it actually doesn't work so
the<00:00:53.550> mechanism<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.989> like<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.710> simple

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the mechanism is just like the simple

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.660 
the mechanism is just like the simple
one<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> front<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.320> an<00:00:58.670> elastic

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
one in the front you have an elastic

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.180 
one in the front you have an elastic
band<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.420> white<00:01:00.600> one<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:00.899> beside<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.980> pull

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
band the white one here beside that pull

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.420 
band the white one here beside that pull
the<00:01:02.340> legs<00:01:02.520> down<00:01:02.760> or<00:01:03.090> up<00:01:03.739> then<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> back<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
the legs down or up then in the back you

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.830 
the legs down or up then in the back you
have<00:01:05.670> some<00:01:06.600> gears<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.710> from<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.310> bills<00:01:08.840> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
have some gears going from the bills to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.950 
have some gears going from the bills to
this<00:01:10.020> clip<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.680> then<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.689> here<00:01:12.689> here

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this clip and then to this here here

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.760 
this clip and then to this here here
which<00:01:13.200> turns<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:16.110> legs<00:01:16.320> down<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:18.560> first<00:01:19.560> like

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
which turns the legs down so first like

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.080 
which turns the legs down so first like
this<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.900> forward<00:01:22.350> index<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:23.090> nothing

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
this you can forward index up nothing

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.560 
this you can forward index up nothing
happens<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.530> soon<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.009> reversed

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
happens but then as soon as you reversed

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.359 
happens but then as soon as you reversed
then<00:01:27.570> making<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.869> music<00:01:28.020> engaged<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
then making this music engaged and the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.420 
then making this music engaged and the
legs<00:01:29.579> go<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.710> forward<00:01:32.159> again

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
legs go down so you can forward again

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.899 
legs go down so you can forward again
makes<00:01:33.090> happen<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.900> fun<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.700> problem<00:01:35.700> is

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
makes happen is so fun the problem is

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.990 
makes happen is so fun the problem is
this<00:01:36.600> clicker<00:01:37.110> right<00:01:37.320> here<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:40.369> just<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.670> tiny

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this clicker right here is just a tiny

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.219 
this clicker right here is just a tiny
bit<00:01:42.270> too<00:01:42.750> heavy

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
bit too heavy

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.139 
bit too heavy
which<00:01:43.530> makes<00:01:44.130> Oh<00:01:46.310> gives<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> problem<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.909> if

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
which makes Oh gives the problem that if

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.090 
which makes Oh gives the problem that if
the<00:01:48.420> decks<00:01:48.630> are<00:01:48.750> down<00:01:50.240> then<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:52.439> mechanism<00:01:52.649> is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the decks are down then the mechanism is

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.359 
the decks are down then the mechanism is
actually<00:01:53.549> still<00:01:53.939> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.899> turn<00:01:55.259> even<00:01:56.250> though

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
actually still going to turn even though

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.120 
actually still going to turn even though
you<00:01:56.490> come<00:01:56.640> forward<00:01:57.380> let's<00:01:58.380> see<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:58.979> make

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
you come forward let's see if I can make

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.609 
you come forward let's see if I can make
it<00:01:59.250> turn<00:01:59.460> again<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.509> goes<00:02:00.719> back<00:02:01.409> much

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
it turn again so it goes back much

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.679 
it turn again so it goes back much
further<00:02:01.680> than<00:02:02.399> go<00:02:03.210> forwards<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.990> also<00:02:04.439> process

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
further than go forwards it also process

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.730 
further than go forwards it also process
and<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:06.840> there's<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.140> problem<00:02:07.350> because<00:02:07.590> that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
and then there's a problem because that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.469 
and then there's a problem because that
means

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
means

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.839 
means
if<00:02:08.990> you<00:02:09.140> just<00:02:09.380> tell<00:02:09.649> me<00:02:09.800> talkin<00:02:10.369> back<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.640> little

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
if you just tell me talkin back a little

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.699 
if you just tell me talkin back a little
bit<00:02:11.120> let's<00:02:11.450> go<00:02:11.630> down<00:02:11.810> then<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.500> this

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
bit let's go down then and this

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.960 
bit let's go down then and this
mechanism<00:02:13.010> can<00:02:13.550> become<00:02:14.090> stuck<00:02:14.800> but<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:15.980> huge

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
mechanism can become stuck but this huge

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.660 
mechanism can become stuck but this huge
problem<00:02:17.390> when<00:02:17.660> you're<00:02:17.840> going<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.550> turn<00:02:19.550> around

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
problem when you're going to turn around

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.720 
problem when you're going to turn around
on<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.150> trade<00:02:20.480> off<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:22.069> first<00:02:22.280> attempt

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
on this trade off so the first attempt

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.729 
on this trade off so the first attempt
which<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.390> have<00:02:23.630> building<00:02:24.020> instruction<00:02:24.530> for

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
which I have building instruction for
