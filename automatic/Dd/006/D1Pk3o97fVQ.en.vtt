you both and not just even with it like
we<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.330> now<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.900> imogen<00:01:28.320> has<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.009> be

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
we are now it's on imogen has to be

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.789 
we are now it's on imogen has to be
