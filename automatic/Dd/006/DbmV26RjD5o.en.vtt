the<00:00:34.530> front<00:00:34.800> now<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.399> point<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the front now at this point this is a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.430 
the front now at this point this is a
little<00:00:36.300> loose<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.510> what<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.290> is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
little loose so what we have to do is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.250 
little loose so what we have to do is
carefully<00:00:37.710> take<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.070> battery<00:00:38.460> box<00:00:39.260> are

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
carefully take the battery box are

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
carefully take the battery box are
actually<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> go<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.950> take<00:00:41.070> this

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
actually going to go and take this

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.869 
actually going to go and take this
little<00:00:41.640> ribbon<00:00:41.940> cable<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.879> black

so<00:00:58.150> once<00:00:58.300> that's<00:00:58.720> in<00:00:58.870> there<00:00:59.020> basically<00:00:59.350> are

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
so once that's in there basically are

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.150 
so once that's in there basically are
gonna<00:00:59.620> go<00:00:59.740> try<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.040> very<00:01:00.430> lightly<00:01:01.060> scoot<00:01:01.510> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
gonna go try and very lightly scoot the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.860 
gonna go try and very lightly scoot the
ports<00:01:03.160> back<00:01:04.030> into<00:01:04.270> their<00:01:04.390> spot

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
ports back into their spot

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.320 
ports back into their spot
okay<00:01:05.530> clips<00:01:05.830> in<00:01:05.950> there<00:01:06.070> now<00:01:06.460> very<00:01:07.150> carefully

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
okay clips in there now very carefully

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.620 
okay clips in there now very carefully
you're<00:01:07.660> gonna<00:01:07.780> go<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.050> take<00:01:08.200> this<00:01:09.570> rotate<00:01:10.570> it

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
you're gonna go and take this rotate it

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.950 
you're gonna go and take this rotate it
like<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.740> go<00:01:11.800> take<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.280> original<00:01:12.960> four

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
like so and go take the original four

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.130 
like so and go take the original four
Phillips<00:01:14.560> screws<00:01:14.650> and<00:01:15.190> a<00:01:15.910> triple<00:01:16.840> zero

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
Phillips screws and a triple zero

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.390 
Phillips screws and a triple zero
Phillips<00:01:17.710> screwdriver<00:01:19.770> tie<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:20.920> toss<00:01:21.040> it<00:01:21.280> in

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
Phillips screwdriver tie and toss it in

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.780 
Phillips screwdriver tie and toss it in
there<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.770> now<00:01:23.860> this<00:01:24.010> whole<00:01:24.190> process<00:01:24.640> will

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
there so now this whole process will

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.990 
there so now this whole process will
take<00:01:24.820> right<00:01:25.240> around<00:01:25.860> an<00:01:26.860> hour<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.460> half<00:01:27.610> two

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
take right around an hour and a half two

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.810 
take right around an hour and a half two
hours<00:01:28.800> we're<00:01:29.800> usually<00:01:29.920> able<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.280> go<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.610> get

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
hours we're usually able to go and get

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.870 
hours we're usually able to go and get
you<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.030> camera<00:01:31.600> back<00:01:31.780> within<00:01:32.190> 48<00:01:33.190> hours<00:01:33.220> from

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
you a camera back within 48 hours from

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.050 
you a camera back within 48 hours from
when<00:01:34.810> we<00:01:34.900> start<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.229> process<00:01:35.940> one<00:01:36.940> of<00:01:36.970> the

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
when we start the process one of the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.100 
when we start the process one of the
things<00:01:37.150> of<00:01:37.390> course<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:37.630> want<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.810> check<00:01:37.930> is

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
things of course you want to check is

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.790 
things of course you want to check is
that<00:01:38.140> your<00:01:38.610> your<00:01:39.610> buttons<00:01:39.910> work<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:40.650> press<00:01:41.650> and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
that your your buttons work so press and

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.280 
that your your buttons work so press and
hold<00:01:41.950> one<00:01:42.790> of<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.300> issues<00:01:43.720> that<00:01:43.750> we've<00:01:44.050> run

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
hold one of the issues that we've run

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.810 
hold one of the issues that we've run
into<00:01:44.410> a<00:01:44.560> couple<00:01:44.740> times<00:01:45.040> when<00:01:45.220> we<00:01:45.369> were<00:01:45.460> working

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
into a couple times when we were working

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.340 
into a couple times when we were working
on<00:01:45.910> these<00:01:46.030> is<00:01:46.240> that<00:01:46.450> this<00:01:46.720> mode<00:01:46.990> button<00:01:47.259> won't

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
on these is that this mode button won't

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.719 
on these is that this mode button won't
work<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:47.560> really<00:01:47.979> make<00:01:48.130> sure<00:01:48.160> that<00:01:48.280> as<00:01:48.580> you

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
work so really make sure that as you

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.430 
work so really make sure that as you
press<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.150> button<00:01:49.330> you're<00:01:50.020> able<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.259> cycle

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
press this button you're able to cycle

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.749 
press this button you're able to cycle
through<00:01:50.560> stuff<00:01:50.920> when<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.400> works

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
through stuff when that works

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.010 
through stuff when that works
you're<00:01:51.970> pretty<00:01:52.479> much<00:01:52.509> golden<00:01:52.840> that

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
you're pretty much golden that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.370 
you're pretty much golden that
everything<00:01:53.500> will<00:01:53.590> work

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
everything will work

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.749 
everything will work
besides<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.650> probably<00:01:56.890> want<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.250> go<00:01:57.369> and
