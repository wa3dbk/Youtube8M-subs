00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
painted that way but I believe painting

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.690 
painted that way but I believe painting
it<00:06:08.840> to<00:06:08.960> look<00:06:09.050> like<00:06:09.110> a<00:06:09.290> face<00:06:09.650> actually<00:06:10.250> seems<00:06:10.490> a

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
it to look like a face actually seems a

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.760 
it to look like a face actually seems a
lot<00:06:10.940> more<00:06:10.970> effective<00:06:11.720> than<00:06:11.930> what<00:06:12.590> was

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
lot more effective than what was

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.890 
lot more effective than what was
actually<00:06:12.979> displayed<00:06:13.760> on<00:06:13.970> the<00:06:14.090> box<00:06:14.360> another

variation<00:06:15.290> is<00:06:15.770> the<00:06:15.919> back<00:06:16.130> sword<00:06:16.550> part<00:06:16.850> was

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
variation is the back sword part was

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.930 
variation is the back sword part was
meant<00:06:17.419> to<00:06:17.510> be<00:06:17.540> yellow<00:06:17.930> but<00:06:18.320> I<00:06:18.590> also<00:06:19.310> believe<00:06:19.520> it

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
meant to be yellow but I also believe it

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.300 
meant to be yellow but I also believe it
looks<00:06:20.120> a<00:06:20.240> lot<00:06:20.360> better<00:06:20.600> black<00:06:21.310> nothing

interesting<00:06:22.790> under<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.150> feet<00:06:23.419> but<00:06:24.320> yet<00:06:24.620> I

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
interesting under the feet but yet I

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.950 
interesting under the feet but yet I
tried<00:06:25.370> to<00:06:25.490> keep<00:06:25.669> it<00:06:25.729> as<00:06:25.910> close<00:06:26.210> as<00:06:26.450> possible<00:06:26.479> to

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
tried to keep it as close as possible to

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.360 
tried to keep it as close as possible to
the<00:06:27.080> box<00:06:27.350> out<00:06:27.560> which<00:06:27.800> you<00:06:27.950> have<00:06:28.130> seen<00:06:28.310> in<00:06:28.490> me
