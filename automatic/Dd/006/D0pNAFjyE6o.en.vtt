discuss<00:00:00.870> the<00:00:01.050> changes<00:00:01.469> in<00:00:01.589> nature<00:00:01.949> from<00:00:02.129> ionic

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
discuss the changes in nature from ionic

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.269 
discuss the changes in nature from ionic
to<00:00:02.700> covalent<00:00:03.270> blah<00:00:03.570> blah<00:00:03.810> blah<00:00:04.080> alright<00:00:05.040> then

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
to covalent blah blah blah alright then

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.530 
to covalent blah blah blah alright then
so<00:00:05.490> this<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.819> Period<00:00:06.180> three

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
so this is Period three

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.440 
so this is Period three
that's<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.500> third<00:00:07.859> row<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.120> periodic

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
that's the third row in the periodic

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.049 
that's the third row in the periodic
table<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.190> let<00:00:11.190> me<00:00:11.280> remind<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.639> ionic

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
table and let me remind you that ionic

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.580 
table and let me remind you that ionic
bonding<00:00:12.450> well<00:00:12.570> that's<00:00:12.719> normally<00:00:13.080> between<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
bonding well that's normally between a

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.760 
bonding well that's normally between a
metal<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.219> nonmetal<00:00:14.870> metals<00:00:15.870> tend<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.500> lose

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
metal and a nonmetal metals tend to lose

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.769 
metal and a nonmetal metals tend to lose
their<00:00:17.190> valence<00:00:17.640> electrons<00:00:18.150> they're<00:00:18.449> electro

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
their valence electrons they're electro

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.630 
their valence electrons they're electro
phobic<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.260> give<00:00:20.070> them<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
phobic and give them to the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.310 
phobic and give them to the
electrophilic<00:00:21.330> nonmetals

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
electrophilic nonmetals

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.200 
electrophilic nonmetals
so<00:00:22.560> that's<00:00:22.710> ionic<00:00:23.130> if<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> remember<00:00:23.730> electron

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
so that's ionic if you remember electron

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.679 
so that's ionic if you remember electron
transfer<00:00:24.960> now<00:00:25.680> since<00:00:25.920> oxygen<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.029> non-metal

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
transfer now since oxygen is a non-metal

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.650 
transfer now since oxygen is a non-metal
and<00:00:27.840> those<00:00:28.650> three<00:00:29.070> elements<00:00:29.519> are<00:00:29.609> metals<00:00:29.730> that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
and those three elements are metals that

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
and those three elements are metals that
must<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:30.960> ionic<00:00:31.489> so<00:00:32.489> let<00:00:32.610> me<00:00:32.700> try<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:32.969> get<00:00:33.030> you

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
must be ionic so let me try and get you

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.930 
must be ionic so let me try and get you
the<00:00:33.270> formula<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> oxides<00:00:34.350> I'll<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.760> put

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the formula of the oxides I'll just put

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.229 
the formula of the oxides I'll just put
the<00:00:36.030> symbol<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.570> oxygen<00:00:37.550> now<00:00:38.550> underneath<00:00:38.910> are

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the symbol and oxygen now underneath are

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.610 
the symbol and oxygen now underneath are
the<00:00:39.300> oxidation<00:00:39.989> numbers<00:00:42.260> if<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.379> don't<00:00:43.559> know

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the oxidation numbers if you don't know

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.209 
the oxidation numbers if you don't know
what<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.770> is

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
what that is

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.520 
what that is
you've<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:44.610> done<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.850> chapter<00:00:45.360> yet<00:00:45.539> but

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
you've not done that chapter yet but

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.299 
you've not done that chapter yet but
allow<00:00:46.739> me<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.219> pencil<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:49.710> formula<00:00:50.190> of

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
allow me to now pencil in the formula of

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.220 
allow me to now pencil in the formula of
the<00:00:50.399> oxides<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.149> Period<00:00:51.480> three<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.050> first

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the oxides of Period three the first

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.490 
the oxides of Period three the first
three<00:00:52.410> anyway<00:00:56.420> all<00:00:57.420> right<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.109> those<00:00:58.230> are<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
three anyway all right so those are the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.490 
three anyway all right so those are the
three<00:00:58.829> ionic<00:00:59.280> ones<00:00:59.600> let's<00:01:00.600> look<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:00.899> covalent

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
three ionic ones let's look at covalent

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.830 
three ionic ones let's look at covalent
now<00:01:01.620> Koh<00:01:01.949> means<00:01:02.190> together<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.879> valent<00:01:03.600> means

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
now Koh means together and valent means

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.789 
now Koh means together and valent means
valence<00:01:04.519> select<00:01:05.519> together<00:01:05.939> valence<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> these

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
valence select together valence so these

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.380 
valence select together valence so these
are<00:01:07.979> nonmetals<00:01:08.750> sharing<00:01:09.750> electrons<00:01:11.119> both<00:01:12.119> of

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
are nonmetals sharing electrons both of

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.450 
are nonmetals sharing electrons both of
both<00:01:12.750> nonmetals<00:01:13.409> love<00:01:13.740> electrons<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:14.400> are

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
both nonmetals love electrons there are

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.859 
both nonmetals love electrons there are
electro<00:01:14.760> philic<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.360> they're<00:01:15.509> probably<00:01:15.689> going

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
electro philic so they're probably going

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
electro philic so they're probably going
to<00:01:15.930> share<00:01:16.290> them<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:18.799> phosphorus<00:01:19.799> sulfur<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
to share them so phosphorus sulfur and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.060 
to share them so phosphorus sulfur and
chlorine<00:01:21.060> are<00:01:21.630> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.320> covalent<00:01:22.979> with

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
chlorine are going to be covalent with

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.070 
chlorine are going to be covalent with
oxygen<00:01:23.520> argon<00:01:24.180> well<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.509> doesn't<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.930> any

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
oxygen argon well that doesn't do any

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.539 
oxygen argon well that doesn't do any
chemistry<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.740> noble<00:01:26.009> gas<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:29.070> formula

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
chemistry it's a noble gas the formula

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.969 
chemistry it's a noble gas the formula
of<00:01:29.700> those<00:01:29.909> oxides<00:01:30.450> aren't<00:01:31.049> obvious<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.890> you

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
of those oxides aren't obvious so you

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.249 
of those oxides aren't obvious so you
just<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.400> learn<00:01:32.549> them<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.079> sulfur<00:01:34.079> can

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
just have to learn them and sulfur can

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.140 
just have to learn them and sulfur can
actually<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.770> more<00:01:35.189> than<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.490> sulfur

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
actually have more than one sulfur

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.780 
actually have more than one sulfur
dioxide<00:01:36.600> sulfur<00:01:36.930> trioxide<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.579> others

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
dioxide sulfur trioxide and the others

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.399 
dioxide sulfur trioxide and the others
are<00:01:38.909> arguable<00:01:39.329> too<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:39.750> that's<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> minimum

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
are arguable too but that's the minimum

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.310 
are arguable too but that's the minimum
you<00:01:40.500> need<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.770> know<00:01:41.570> silicon<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.720> semi<00:01:42.930> methyl

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you need to know silicon to semi methyl

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.889 
you need to know silicon to semi methyl
so<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.640> going<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.850> donate<00:01:45.180> electrons<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
so is it going to donate electrons to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.380 
so is it going to donate electrons to
oxygen<00:01:45.960> or<00:01:46.500> share<00:01:47.009> them<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.460> could<00:01:48.090> check<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
oxygen or share them you could check the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.149 
oxygen or share them you could check the
difference<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.810> electronegativity<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.920> find

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
difference in electronegativity to find

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.420 
difference in electronegativity to find
out<00:01:50.600> but<00:01:51.600> I'll<00:01:51.750> tell<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.799> actually<00:01:53.130> shares

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
out but I'll tell you it actually shares

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.780 
out but I'll tell you it actually shares
them<00:01:54.649> so<00:01:55.649> silicon<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> share

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
them so silicon is going to share

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.310 
them so silicon is going to share
electrons<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.329> oxygen<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:57.990> not<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
electrons with oxygen it's not going to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.700 
electrons with oxygen it's not going to
donate<00:01:58.590> them<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.729> that's<00:01:59.880> also<00:02:00.060> covalent<00:02:00.990> sio2

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
donate them so that's also covalent sio2

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.289 
donate them so that's also covalent sio2
is<00:02:01.950> sand<00:02:04.369> how<00:02:05.369> do<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.520> remember<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.909> pattern

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
is sand how do you remember the pattern

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.749 
is sand how do you remember the pattern
well<00:02:06.540> sulfur<00:02:07.079> trioxide<00:02:07.200> comes<00:02:08.039> from<00:02:08.399> power

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
well sulfur trioxide comes from power

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.190 
well sulfur trioxide comes from power
stations<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:11.250> burning<00:02:11.730> coal<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.780> sulfur

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.860 

so<00:02:37.490> that<00:02:37.640> allows<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.120> remember<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.570> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
so that allows you to remember that the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.410 
so that allows you to remember that the
covalent<00:02:39.380> or<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.920> non<00:02:40.130> metal<00:02:40.490> oxides<00:02:40.880> are

covalent or the non metal oxides are

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.330 
covalent or the non metal oxides are
acidic<00:02:42.080> when<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:42.500> put<00:02:42.650> them<00:02:42.740> in<00:02:42.830> water

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
acidic when you put them in water

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.280 
acidic when you put them in water
because<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.120> sulfur<00:02:44.300> one<00:02:44.570> makes<00:02:44.750> acid<00:02:45.080> rain

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
because the sulfur one makes acid rain

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.010 
because the sulfur one makes acid rain
and<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:46.070> ionic<00:02:46.490> ones<00:02:46.700> conversely<00:02:47.330> our<00:02:47.510> basic

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
their alkali oxides in water so the one

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.780 
their alkali oxides in water so the one
in<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.650> middle<00:02:54.980> there<00:02:55.160> in<00:02:55.370> terms<00:02:55.640> of

in the middle there in terms of

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.370 
in the middle there in terms of
properties<00:02:56.210> is<00:02:56.420> an<00:02:56.600> iminium<00:02:56.930> oxide<00:02:57.260> and

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
properties is an iminium oxide and

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.070 
properties is an iminium oxide and
that's<00:02:57.500> ANFO<00:02:57.920> Tarek<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.670> can<00:02:58.880> behave<00:02:59.020> in<00:03:00.020> a

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
that's ANFO Tarek it can behave in a

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.350 
that's ANFO Tarek it can behave in a
basic<00:03:00.500> or<00:03:00.650> an<00:03:00.770> acidic<00:03:01.100> manner<00:03:01.370> depending<00:03:02.210> on

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
basic or an acidic manner depending on

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.960 
basic or an acidic manner depending on
the<00:03:02.510> conditions<00:03:03.130> so<00:03:04.130> amphoteric<00:03:04.520> means<00:03:04.820> it's

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
the conditions so amphoteric means it's

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.990 
the conditions so amphoteric means it's
acidic<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:05.480> basic<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.260> oxide<00:03:06.620> together<00:03:07.000> so

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
acidic and basic the oxide together so

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.180 
acidic and basic the oxide together so
the<00:03:08.120> pattern<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.570> is<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.200> get<00:03:09.320> more<00:03:09.350> acidic<00:03:10.010> as

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
the pattern is is you get more acidic as

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.060 
the pattern is is you get more acidic as
you<00:03:10.400> cross<00:03:10.700> period<00:03:11.480> three<00:03:13.810> but<00:03:14.810> our<00:03:15.350> gum<00:03:15.770> that

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
you cross period three but our gum that

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.820 
you cross period three but our gum that
bucks<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.610> trend<00:03:17.140> because<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.260> doesn't<00:03:18.710> make

you could argue that phosphoric acid is
a<00:04:07.880> strong<00:04:08.060> or<00:04:08.450> a<00:04:08.480> medium<00:04:08.900> acid<00:04:09.230> either<00:04:09.980> of

a strong or a medium acid either of
those<00:04:10.310> is<00:04:10.490> acceptable<00:04:10.940> but<00:04:11.390> sulfuric<00:04:11.930> acid<00:04:12.260> is

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
those is acceptable but sulfuric acid is

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.820 
those is acceptable but sulfuric acid is
one<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.770> strong<00:04:12.980> acids<00:04:13.340> you<00:04:13.430> need<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:13.700> know

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
one of the strong acids you need to know

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.950 
one of the strong acids you need to know
so<00:04:15.830> where<00:04:16.160> is<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.910> best<00:04:17.090> place<00:04:17.299> for<00:04:17.330> acid<00:04:17.810> rain

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:17.960 
so where is the best place for acid rain

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.700 
so where is the best place for acid rain
to<00:04:18.109> fall<00:04:18.290> in<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:19.430> chimney<00:04:20.440> then<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:21.560> can

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
to fall in the chimney then you can

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.650 
to fall in the chimney then you can
dissolve<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.100> in<00:04:22.160> water<00:04:22.190> make<00:04:22.820> sulfuric<00:04:23.330> acid

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
dissolve it in water make sulfuric acid

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.590
