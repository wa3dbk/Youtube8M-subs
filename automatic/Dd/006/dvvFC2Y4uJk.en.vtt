to<00:01:22.650> open<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> nipple<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> caliper<00:01:24.049> turn

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to open the nipple on the caliper turn

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.550 
to open the nipple on the caliper turn
the<00:01:25.200> nipple<00:01:25.500> counterclockwise<00:01:26.750> now<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.409> can

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the nipple counterclockwise now you can

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.109 
the nipple counterclockwise now you can
insert<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> tube<00:01:29.250> at<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> end<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> nipple

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
insert a tube at the end of the nipple

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.510 
insert a tube at the end of the nipple
to<00:01:30.390> avoid<00:01:30.689> getting<00:01:31.380> brake<00:01:31.890> fluid<00:01:32.250> everywhere

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
to avoid getting brake fluid everywhere

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.789 
to avoid getting brake fluid everywhere
if<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> brake<00:01:33.780> line<00:01:34.049> bleeding<00:01:34.590> tool

if you have a brake line bleeding tool

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.640 
if you have a brake line bleeding tool
you<00:01:35.610> can<00:01:35.729> also<00:01:35.790> place<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.630> vacuum<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> line

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
you can also place a vacuum on the line

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.429 
you can also place a vacuum on the line
this<00:01:38.400> will<00:01:38.670> insure<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.299> fluid<00:01:39.689> will<00:01:40.229> be

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
this will insure the fluid will be

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.929 
this will insure the fluid will be
leaving<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.860> caliper<00:01:41.280> instead<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.700> going

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
leaving the caliper instead of going

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.960 
leaving the caliper instead of going

clockwise<00:01:47.990> closing<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.079> off<00:01:49.549> now<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:51.030> will

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
clockwise closing it off now you will

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.389 
clockwise closing it off now you will
