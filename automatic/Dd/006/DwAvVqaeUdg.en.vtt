00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:05.480
 in this third video of the new pedalboard 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.510
 york or fernando will show the relationship of 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.000
 cyclist with the city but it works 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:23.630
 there is respect for how this relationship 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:24.650
 we will follow us continue for 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.269
 here in new york 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.369
 You will see some more difficulties. 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.989
 which cyclists also face 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.849
 I enjoyed to continue the interview 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.710
 online and he talked about things 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.990
 about the structure has 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.610
 engine to meet demand is well 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.610
 interesting and I followed 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:54.500
 it's all very chaotic hellish traffic 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.600
 We can see that I'm just debating. 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.980
 facing traffic is a good situation 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.300
 similar to ours and taxi bus people 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:09.100
 truck is messy 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:15.490
 It's fucking stupid people. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.490
 It's a lot of cars as bad as São Paulo. 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:27.260
 a lot of people do not respect the same taxi 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:30.680
 It is on track has been discharge 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.760
 painting I entered had ciclofaixa 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.850
 but this time truck stopped on top and 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.090
 makes a little difficult 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.650
 It's complicated, this is cultural. 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.650
 whole world nobody respects 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.380
 So the people started the interview. 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.049
 asking how you do not understand the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.600
 bikes scattered around the city of xexéu 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.119
 will i am oled spirit first point is 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.729
 the use of technology created the system 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.770
 also monitoring is entering the 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.810
 city and analyze everything is there 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.820
 operators' work 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.459
 they monitor losing where they have low 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.040
 with long, which then has little neighborhood 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.140
 sends a team to do this 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.730
 planning to change that takes the other 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.530
 is the most interesting part is that they 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.720
 encourage users to have 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.940
 participated in this work is through 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.280
 a concept they created and rolled over 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.769
 complaint in the middle of a certain later is a 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.049
 user who already knows where this drought is 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.000
 even the cell phone identifies this 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.450
 sure it's out of the fence 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.519
 a fee is charged within the fence 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.799
 virtual he accumulates credit 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.340
 so it helps to redistribute the 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.019
 parties in a more collaborative way 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.690
 a very common thing and see in here 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.660
 new york are these blue backs 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.570
 here we already have the stations to 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.070
 be shared by bike you go 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.680
 station passes the card there. 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.769
 credit leads for half an hour 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.989
 For half an hour you pay 1 x only I 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.549
 I tried to use my card and the next one rolled 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.590
 I do not know what happened 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.730
 my card works just fine 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.640
 station did not roll in the room arrived to be 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.319
 bizarre this is working 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.959
 I do not know because I tried there he worked with two 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.480
 cards and three cards I have and 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.560
 not working and this should happen 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.050
 with a lot of people, right? 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.140
 I saw a lot of users of this type of bike 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:32.010
 trying to get out there and get down 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.750
 curls up in support to exit through life 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.340
 person arrived tried to use failed 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.860
 neither of the two parts here are 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.430
 on here 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:48.200
 I leave the place, I do not know how 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.200
 A woman as I was angry 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:56.480
 and left without a good scheme now 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:57.109
 then another fifty kind of bike 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.019
 huh 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.939
 this is a very good reinforcement of the 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.530
 I know it's much more practical but without 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.959
 having to use the credit card on the ceiling 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.489
 another kind of thing there in time for 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.030
 releasing the bike is only the first by 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.069
 cell phone where you even have the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.889
 growth prospects to smile 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.509
 since it's every day, more people leave the 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.729
 cars in the house to have a better life 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:23.389
 healthy pedaling until work is done 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.520
 sun or they launched the first system 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.090
 they put on the floor same December of 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.360
 2012 beginning of 2013 and have not in 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.860
 four projects change only 150 bikes 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.539
 a project within colleges 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.599
 expanded rapidly is to close some 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:46.539
 contracts in cities like tampa orlando 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:49.729
 in florida it is not old or they are old 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.250
 in 2014 he expects some text 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.330
 thousands of parents in the streets in their eyes will 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.680
 since the chestnut 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.680
 the criticism is no different 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.830
 in a general summary you bring to us 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.010
 about this bikes experience 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.400
 shared new york is was very 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.979
 interesting because we know one 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.199
 different system is something completely 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.449
 different from what we see around without 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.820
 the seasons the practicality I found a lot 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.460
 cool I had a hard time with a 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.550
 another system there on those blue bikes 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.400
 I saw and was traumatizing to 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.479
 thing and is under did not know very easy I 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.610
 I think it's a model that can 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.250
 here in Brazil is a system 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:38.030
 from registration to withdrawal 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.229
 use of the bike was good for 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.229
 the right congratulations 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:06:05.080
 the artisan the bay came and we are 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:11.610
 ready to see touch will not cause 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:15.779
 it will take to get cold almost to take 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.779
 strip me of the water
