00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
previous years and there's relief as the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.369 
previous years and there's relief as the

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
that will hopefully never have to be

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.819 
that will hopefully never have to be
used<00:02:53.879> here<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:54.930> are<00:02:55.049> ready<00:02:55.260> for<00:02:55.470> something

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
used here we are ready for something

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.770 
used here we are ready for something
like<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.250> we've<00:02:56.459> drilled<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.299> this<00:02:57.510> type<00:02:57.750> of

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
like this we've drilled on this type of

like this we've drilled on this type of
scenario<00:02:58.110> for<00:02:58.920> many<00:02:59.190> years<00:02:59.430> now<00:02:59.549> and<00:02:59.760> we're

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
scenario for many years now and we're

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.989 
scenario for many years now and we're
well<00:03:00.269> practiced<00:03:00.720> at<00:03:00.870> it
