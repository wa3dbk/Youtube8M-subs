00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.259
 that's it they arrived you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.420
 discover on 01net tvc smartphone as 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.769
 expected probably smartphones and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.650
 most expected of this year 2015 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.719
 the new samsung galaxy ace 6 and the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.160
 galaxy sii edge with its curved screens 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.560
 on the sides we are in the heart of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.600
 the samsung event here in barcelona en 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.310
 opening of the mobile world congress on 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:30.119
 tell you all right away about these two 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.260
 new flagship products and we start 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.079
 by screen of course because that's it 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.719
 who catches a 5.1 inch screen 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.329
 with a very beautiful definition of 2560 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.160
 among four hundred and forty pixels this is 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.800
 in fact the equivalent of the screen of the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.940
 galaxy no 4 of lg g3 so you have to 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.620
 understand that actually there are two 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.510
 smartphones but that are pretty much 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.090
 identical are two twin brothers 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.129
 only difference this curved screen on 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.199
 the sides for the galaxy ace 6 edge 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.879
 so what is it going to serve this screen 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.379
 curves and well for example the posted 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.469
 notifications as it was already the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.090
 case on ours edge and then display 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.080
 shortcuts also contacts 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.939
 favorite etc 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.000
 but it's especially at the design level that 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.110
 this galaxy sii this hedge is doing its little 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.850
 show because it's true that he's very 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.010
 very beautiful huh this curved screen like that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.750
 on each side well it throws like 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.520
 we say is very clearly samsung has 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.530
 obviously decided to start from scratch in 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.990
 regarding the design we had it 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.280
 already a little bit of vinea before 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.590
 presentation thanks to all the rumors 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.420
 who was falling on the web there is a small 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.400
 air iphone is in any case we go to 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.259
 metal and we pass a very luxurious design 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.970
 actually with materials 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.350
 much more noble from gorilla glass to 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.360
 both in the front to protect the screen 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.100
 but also in the back because 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.380
 the back is a window also in fact 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.390
 the metal is only on the periphery of the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.710
 phone that there is very light when 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.020
 we take it badly it's true very rich and 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.119
 very nice 130 grams pretty much on 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.409
 the back a 16-megapixel camera with 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.880
 an opening to 1.9 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.490
 it allows what it allows photos 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.110
 even brighter in bass 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.939
 brightness know what that is what 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.329
 fishing we play today a smartphone 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.890
 samsung had fun making fun 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.549
 of the iphone 6 during the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.229
 presentation 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.090
 good even though this kind of demonstration 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.680
 comparative one must always be wary 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.710
 a little bit here we will do our little 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.930
 demo to us and our comparison 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.250
 beauce 01net when we still have a 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.200
 word about the francois photo a 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.510
 extremely fast device that gets 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.190
 trigger we are told in 07 seconds 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.350
 so much to say that you can not anymore 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.270
 missed a single photo here 5 megapixels 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.860
 for selphy it's not bad too with 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.080
 always this opening to a pro 9 who 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.820
 would allow to have 60% more 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.560
 brightness compared to previous 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.030
 smartphones to check again 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.370
 good then obviously there are plenty of 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.010
 nick shows that you can 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.510
 discover in detail on 01net.com this 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.590
 that must also be remembered among the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.850
 ads is well one ad of a 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.370
 payment system it's going to be called 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.750
 samsung pay it will be available for 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.400
 the moment only in the united states but 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.740
 we feel that it is very important and that 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.230
 clearly sounds like a response to the 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.730
 pulp and dance recently by the brand to 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.710
 the apple another thing to remember 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.700
 that's what's missing from these galaxies and if 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.730
 it was me who had before 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.440
 no longer including this galaxy this is 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.080
 more waterproof while the galaxy s 5 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.670
 remember the summer more sd port that's 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.440
 to say that when you go to buy 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.880
 32 64 and 128 go 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.770
 you will not be able to increase the 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.940
 memory capacity of your phone and 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.950
 we can no longer remove the battery no 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.410
 more ah yes that's obviously part of it 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.210
 concessions 1 that must be done to 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.400
 a more luxurious design 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.110
 unusual and in terms of design of 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.360
 colors also quite spectacular with 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.850
 an amazing drink we've never seen 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.890
 before a blue to it's really very 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.990
 successful and he also loved 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.090
 this reminds me of something here 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.470
 and then last thing the accessory that 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.330
 had cardboard for the Galaxy Note 4 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.880
 will be available also for this galaxy ace 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.850
 6 and galaxy sii edge this is the ten 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.410
 backhand is marx that reality 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.420
 virtual which was manufactured in 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.760
 collaboration with us rift it will be 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.350
 now compatible with the galaxy sii 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.420
 this then it happens when his two 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.460
 new smartphones and well on April 10 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.950
 next and the prices they are not 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.620
 still official but it should turn 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.410
 around 700 euros for the s6 in 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.290
 32 gigas and 850 euros for the s6 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.090
 edge in 32 gigas so 150 euros apart 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.860
 between the two models and you add 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.810
 100 euros each time to have more 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.300
 of memory and we go up we find ourselves 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.880
 well up to more than 1000 euros 1050 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.070
 euros probably for the galaxy sii yields 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.930
 128 giga is still not given 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.150
 sacred bet for samsung is what 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.460
 samsung will succeed this bet of the smartphone 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.770
 very upscale 1 to compete 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.190
 obviously apple 1 it is not necessary to veil 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.540
 the face 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.640
 exactly but in any case it's very 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.100
 astute and unusual to go out two 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.540
 almost identical devices that have 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.670
 still each one their particularities 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.410
 so which one will you choose 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.000
 it will be necessary to go to discover the 10 of April 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.800
 here and then we will come back very 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.570
 long on this galaxy sii on his 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.420
 galaxy sii this mobile world congress to 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.160
 follow on 01net tv with lives on monday 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.060
 and Tuesday at 1 pm count on you 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.060
 hello to all and very quickly
