fought him you know that kind of stuff

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.849 
fought him you know that kind of stuff
that's<00:01:34.700> how<00:01:34.819> I<00:01:34.850> think<00:01:35.119> he<00:01:35.240> is<00:01:35.390> 23<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.289> 0<00:01:36.350> 16

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
that's how I think he is 23 and 0 16

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.389 
that's how I think he is 23 and 0 16
knockouts<00:01:37.039> 71<00:01:37.789> person<00:01:38.030> knockout<00:01:38.390> ratio<00:01:39.399> he's

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
knockouts 71 person knockout ratio he's

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.789 
knockouts 71 person knockout ratio he's
6<00:01:40.610> foot<00:01:40.729> 2<00:01:40.909> 75<00:01:41.509> inch<00:01:41.689> reach<00:01:41.899> so<00:01:42.170> he<00:01:42.289> is<00:01:42.409> small

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
6 foot 2 75 inch reach so he is small

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.080 
6 foot 2 75 inch reach so he is small
for<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:43.100> heavyweight<00:01:43.310> but<00:01:43.640> he's<00:01:43.759> going<00:01:43.969> to<00:01:44.030> be

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
for a heavyweight but he's going to be

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.209 
for a heavyweight but he's going to be
the<00:01:44.270> bigger<00:01:44.420> fighter<00:01:44.539> in<00:01:45.049> this<00:01:45.590> fight<00:01:45.799> Marco

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
the bigger fighter in this fight Marco

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.270 
the bigger fighter in this fight Marco
Huck's<00:01:46.429> only<00:01:46.729> 61<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.209> a<00:01:47.270> half<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:48.280> finally

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
Huck's only 61 and a half so finally

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.139 
Huck's only 61 and a half so finally
he's<00:01:49.549> going<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.759> be<00:01:49.819> the<00:01:49.909> bigger<00:01:50.060> fighter

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
he's going to be the bigger fighter

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.910 
he's going to be the bigger fighter
which<00:01:50.509> means<00:01:50.719> he's<00:01:50.869> probably<00:01:50.899> be<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.409> bit<00:01:51.890> of

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
which means he's probably be the bit of

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.980 
which means he's probably be the bit of
a<00:01:52.069> slope<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.609> slower<00:01:52.819> fighter<00:01:53.119> fast<00:01:53.750> for<00:01:53.959> a

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
a slope the slower fighter fast for a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.199 
a slope the slower fighter fast for a
heavy<00:01:54.140> weight<00:01:54.319> though<00:01:54.500> he<00:01:55.459> has<00:01:55.579> cumulative

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
heavy weight though he has cumulative

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.749 
heavy weight though he has cumulative
power<00:01:56.450> does<00:01:57.170> not<00:01:57.200> have<00:01:58.069> the<00:01:58.189> power<00:01:58.340> for<00:01:58.729> the

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
power does not have the power for the

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.499 
power does not have the power for the
bigger<00:01:58.970> guys<00:01:59.469> he's<00:02:00.469> he's<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.340> don't<00:02:02.270> think<00:02:02.420> he

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
bigger guys he's he's I don't think he

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.870 
bigger guys he's he's I don't think he
has<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.689> power<00:02:02.989> to<00:02:03.349> really<00:02:04.069> hurt<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.729> bigger

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
has the power to really hurt the bigger

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.089 
has the power to really hurt the bigger
guys<00:02:05.090> or<00:02:05.420> even<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.719> cumulative<00:02:06.200> power<00:02:06.380> for

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
guys or even the cumulative power for

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.479 
guys or even the cumulative power for
the<00:02:07.189> bigger<00:02:07.369> guys<00:02:08.739> he<00:02:09.739> throws<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.979> jab<00:02:10.250> but<00:02:10.429> he

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
the bigger guys he throws a jab but he

got<00:04:08.620> a<00:04:08.650> decent<00:04:08.860> defense<00:04:09.430> but<00:04:10.030> I<00:04:10.060> tend<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.420> think

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
got a decent defense but I tend to think

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.289 
got a decent defense but I tend to think
he<00:04:10.780> gets<00:04:11.019> hit<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.470> bit<00:04:11.799> too<00:04:12.040> much<00:04:12.250> for<00:04:12.610> the

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
he gets hit a bit too much for the

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.059 
he gets hit a bit too much for the
heavyweight<00:04:13.720> division<00:04:13.799> because<00:04:14.799> what<00:04:15.010> he

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
heavyweight division because what he

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.539 
heavyweight division because what he
does<00:04:15.250> is<00:04:16.109> when<00:04:17.109> he<00:04:17.199> covers<00:04:17.410> up<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.979> d<00:04:18.160> is<00:04:18.190> good

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
does is when he covers up that d is good

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.849 
does is when he covers up that d is good
it's<00:04:18.729> here<00:04:19.000> but<00:04:19.600> he<00:04:19.660> takes<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:20.019> lot<00:04:20.139> of<00:04:20.199> shots<00:04:20.530> to

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
it's here but he takes a lot of shots to

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.670 
it's here but he takes a lot of shots to
the<00:04:20.889> body<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.720> as<00:04:22.720> I<00:04:22.990> said<00:04:23.050> his<00:04:23.289> hands<00:04:23.530> are

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
the body and as I said his hands are

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.440 
the body and as I said his hands are
here<00:04:23.889> so<00:04:24.250> he's<00:04:24.370> open<00:04:24.669> for<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:24.880> shots<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.300> come

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
here so he's open for the shots to come

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.110 
here so he's open for the shots to come
in<00:04:25.570> on<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.780> side<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.169> head<00:04:26.289> and<00:04:27.030> against<00:04:28.030> a

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
in on the side of the head and against a

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.629 
in on the side of the head and against a
heavyweight<00:04:28.539> I<00:04:28.889> mean<00:04:29.889> it's<00:04:30.010> just<00:04:30.070> more<00:04:30.400> weight

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
heavyweight I mean it's just more weight

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.779 
heavyweight I mean it's just more weight
hitting<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.889> they<00:04:32.889> don't<00:04:33.070> necessarily<00:04:33.220> have

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
hitting you they don't necessarily have

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.240 
hitting you they don't necessarily have
to<00:04:33.849> be<00:04:34.000> power<00:04:34.479> punchers<00:04:35.050> it's<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.889> fact<00:04:36.099> that

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
to be power punchers it's the fact that

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.490 
to be power punchers it's the fact that
they're<00:04:36.490> hitting<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:36.849> with<00:04:36.970> 225<00:04:37.930> pounds<00:04:38.410> as

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
they're hitting you with 225 pounds as

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.830 
they're hitting you with 225 pounds as
opposed<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.430> 200<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.450> see<00:04:40.599> what<00:04:40.720> I'm<00:04:40.810> saying

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
opposed to 200 you see what I'm saying

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.120 
opposed to 200 you see what I'm saying
so<00:04:41.800> that<00:04:42.280> that<00:04:42.639> takes<00:04:43.419> its<00:04:43.690> effect<00:04:44.110> he<00:04:44.770> drops

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
so that that takes its effect he drops

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.300 
so that that takes its effect he drops
his<00:04:45.340> right<00:04:45.520> hand<00:04:45.729> when<00:04:45.880> he<00:04:45.910> jabs<00:04:46.270> he<00:04:47.130> he<00:04:48.130> does

his right hand when he jabs he he does
pump<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.610> jab<00:04:48.820> out<00:04:48.970> throws<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.300> lot<00:04:49.419> of<00:04:49.570> ones

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
pump the jab out throws a lot of ones
