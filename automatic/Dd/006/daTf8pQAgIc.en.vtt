00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.790
 minute 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.799
 I hope this video lasts more or 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.310
 one minute less than how to change the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.390
 resolution of your device 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:24.269
 many know as the pi pp 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.260
 well you guys will need the multisport 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.939
 how much good opening roth explorer 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.399
 you will look for a folder called 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.180
 system system insist that they insist 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.320
 You will find your own point bill 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:46.829
 Leave it pressed and open with and here. 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.180
 select text editor by selecting 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.960
 text editor 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:59.960
 you will look for a related line 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:06.840
 to density the name of the line of that ro 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:11.970
 point s f lcd density equal to 320 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.509
 here we are going to download to 280 later 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:21.000
 that lowered to 280 people was completed 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.380
 and will to save save changes 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.380
 changes 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.210
 It seems that it was not because of the bild. 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.540
 own bike point that I had already done 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.320
 the correct process 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.979
 Ok let's try to open again with 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.979
 text editor 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:54.180
 text editor and download the city well 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:58.890
 to 280 save changes now was good 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.259
 now just restart the device after 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.509
 that the density was lowered 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.729
 Do you realize that the screen is more 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.360
 spacious 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.130
 I would say more or less that they are a 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.550
 aspect of nexus 6 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.080
 6 one aspect link quite 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.870
 interesting for those who like 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.630
 take advantage of screen size 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.360
 really the interpass and kind of 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.730
 decreases and looks like 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.350
 fable you say so 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.080
 good people this was a tip about 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.290
 the beginning of my videos from a 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.110
 minute but will last well over a name 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.170
 a bit rough but at least it 's something I'm 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.320
 trying to make sense of the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.500
 channel there if the tip helped you 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.550
 something the league that is written and 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.120
 that's right 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.120
 See you
