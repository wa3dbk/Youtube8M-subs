this<00:00:14.900> was<00:00:15.140> a<00:00:15.170> male<00:00:15.590> elephant<00:00:15.980> and<00:00:16.810> the<00:00:17.810> carcass

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230

this was a male elephant and the carcass
was<00:00:18.350> still<00:00:18.590> fairly<00:00:18.860> intact

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.910 

we<00:00:33.800> remained<00:00:34.160> a<00:00:34.280> distance<00:00:34.700> away<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:35.920> observed

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
we remained a distance away and observed

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.920 
we remained a distance away and observed
that<00:00:37.070> they<00:00:37.280> were<00:00:37.340> leopard<00:00:38.120> faced<00:00:38.360> vultures

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
that they were leopard faced vultures

00:00:38.930 --> 00:01:00.650 
that they were leopard faced vultures
and<00:00:39.200> white<00:00:39.860> back<00:00:40.160> vultures

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.940 

the<00:01:01.660> voters<00:01:01.989> were<00:01:02.140> waiting<00:01:02.560> for<00:01:02.590> some

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
the voters were waiting for some

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.469 
the voters were waiting for some
scavengers<00:01:03.520> to<00:01:03.550> actually<00:01:03.880> open<00:01:04.030> up<00:01:04.300> the

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
scavengers to actually open up the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.330 
scavengers to actually open up the
corpus<00:01:04.960> so<00:01:05.170> they<00:01:05.290> could<00:01:05.470> start<00:01:05.680> devouring<00:01:06.220> the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
corpus so they could start devouring the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:24.830 
corpus so they could start devouring the
contents

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.929 

The<00:01:25.350> Jackal<00:01:25.619> were<00:01:25.799> tugging<00:01:26.040> at<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.369> trunk<00:01:26.729> in

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
The Jackal were tugging at the trunk in

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.149 
The Jackal were tugging at the trunk in
the<00:01:26.970> rear<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.509> animal<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.799> noticed

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the rear of the animal and I noticed

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.859 
the rear of the animal and I noticed
that<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.520> carcass<00:01:29.850> was<00:01:29.970> still<00:01:30.180> fairly<00:01:30.479> intact

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
that the carcass was still fairly intact

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.230 
that the carcass was still fairly intact
so<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.500> must<00:01:31.799> have<00:01:31.920> been<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> recent<00:01:32.430> death<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so it must have been a recent death and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.359 
so it must have been a recent death and
I<00:01:33.570> surmised<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.500> was<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> last<00:01:35.159> day

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
I surmised that it was in the last day

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.410 
I surmised that it was in the last day
or<00:01:35.399> two<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.090> elephant<00:01:36.360> had<00:01:36.659> died

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.789 

through<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> he<00:01:42.659> tears<00:01:42.929> and<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.229> dust<00:01:43.500> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
through the he tears and the dust I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.630 
through the he tears and the dust I
could<00:01:44.520> make<00:01:44.729> out<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.970> shapes<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.600> spring<00:01:46.289> buck

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
could make out the shapes of spring buck

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.080 
could make out the shapes of spring buck
zebra<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.049> warthog<00:01:49.579> they<00:01:50.579> seem<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.970> be

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
zebra and warthog they seem to be

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.779 
zebra and warthog they seem to be
unaware<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.929> this<00:01:52.710> large<00:01:53.009> shape<00:01:53.429> that<00:01:53.640> was

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
unaware of this large shape that was

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:01.130 
unaware of this large shape that was
lying<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.149> its<00:01:54.329> side<00:01:54.390> nearby<00:01:59.840> we<00:02:00.840> approached

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
lying on its side nearby we approached

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.039 
lying on its side nearby we approached
the<00:02:01.590> carcass<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.700> standing<00:02:03.240> close<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.899> I

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the carcass and standing close to it I

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.889 
the carcass and standing close to it I
realized<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.610> almost<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.390> tall<00:02:06.840> as

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
realized that it was almost as tall as

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.139 
realized that it was almost as tall as
what<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.590> as<00:02:07.830> it<00:02:08.130> was<00:02:08.280> lying<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.789> its<00:02:08.940> side

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
what I was as it was lying on its side

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.660 
what I was as it was lying on its side
and<00:02:09.179> I'm<00:02:09.479> about<00:02:09.720> 6<00:02:09.989> foot<00:02:10.140> tall<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.340> huge

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and I'm about 6 foot tall this is a huge

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:26.820 
and I'm about 6 foot tall this is a huge
animal

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.740 

it<00:02:27.310> was<00:02:27.520> quite<00:02:27.730> eerie<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:28.540> vast

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
it was quite eerie in this vast

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.070 
it was quite eerie in this vast
landscape<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.620> see<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:30.070> shape<00:02:31.080> dominating

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
landscape to see this shape dominating
the<00:02:32.470> skyline<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:40.530> wondered<00:02:41.530> how<00:02:41.860> many

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
the skyline I wondered how many

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.280 
the skyline I wondered how many
kilometers<00:02:42.910> at<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:43.300> animal<00:02:43.780> walked<00:02:44.050> and
