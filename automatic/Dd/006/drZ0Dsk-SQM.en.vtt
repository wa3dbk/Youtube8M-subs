00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
to keep your rocket in the air for as

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.009 
to keep your rocket in the air for as
long<00:00:23.099> as<00:00:23.189> possible<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:24.449> glitter<00:00:24.689> makes<00:00:24.929> you

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
long as possible the glitter makes you

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:42.680 
long as possible the glitter makes you
go<00:00:25.140> fast<00:00:33.260> missiles<00:00:34.260> right<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.620> bottom<00:00:41.690> but

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
go fast missiles right on the bottom but

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.410 
go fast missiles right on the bottom but
it's<00:00:43.289> a<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.649> water<00:00:44.520> bottle<00:00:44.789> rocket

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it's a one water bottle rocket

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.180 
it's a one water bottle rocket
competition<00:00:50.180> program<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:52.620> we're<00:00:52.949> part<00:00:53.160> of

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
competition program and we're part of

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.400 
competition program and we're part of
the<00:00:53.309> horticulture<00:00:54.059> program<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.780> we're<00:00:55.379> just

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the horticulture program so we're just

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:28.490 
the horticulture program so we're just
taking<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.829> stab<00:00:56.070> at<00:00:56.309> it<00:01:26.659> we<00:01:27.659> are<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:28.259> fill<00:01:28.470> up

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
taking a stab at it we are we fill up

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.410 
taking a stab at it we are we fill up
the<00:01:28.799> rocket<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.579> liter<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.939> water<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the rocket with one liter of water and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.060 
the rocket with one liter of water and
then<00:01:30.810> put<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.409> onto<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> launcher<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
then put it onto the launcher and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.929 
then put it onto the launcher and
pressurize<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> 80<00:01:33.150> psi<00:01:33.840> each<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:35.189> we

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
pressurize it to 80 psi each and then we

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.760 
pressurize it to 80 psi each and then we
give<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.240> string<00:01:36.479> over<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.229> contestant

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
give this string over to the contestant

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:56.100 
give this string over to the contestant
for<00:01:37.950> them<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.159> pull<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.390 

originally<00:01:57.110> registered<00:01:57.290> we<00:01:57.590> had<00:01:57.680> 30<00:01:58.040> we<00:01:58.250> got

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
originally registered we had 30 we got

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.440 
originally registered we had 30 we got
an<00:01:58.490> extra<00:01:58.930> five<00:01:59.930> or<00:01:59.960> six<00:02:00.320> now<00:02:00.910> we<00:02:01.910> may<00:02:02.060> even<00:02:02.330> get

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
an extra five or six now we may even get

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.420 
an extra five or six now we may even get
more<00:02:02.660> so<00:02:02.960> I'm<00:02:03.080> thinking<00:02:03.470> uh<00:02:03.590> probably<00:02:04.280> a

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
more so I'm thinking uh probably a

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.100 
more so I'm thinking uh probably a
somewhere<00:02:04.910> between<00:02:05.060> somewhere<00:02:06.020> around

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
somewhere between somewhere around

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.449 
somewhere between somewhere around
thirty<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.650> guess<00:02:06.890> by<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.190> end<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.490> day

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
thirty I guess by the end of the day

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.680 
thirty I guess by the end of the day
last<00:02:10.459> time<00:02:10.670> they<00:02:10.820> were<00:02:10.880> in<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.090> competition

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
last time they were in this competition

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.900 
last time they were in this competition
they<00:02:11.810> had<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:11.959> they<00:02:12.590> had<00:02:12.740> eleven<00:02:13.130> teams<00:02:13.340> and

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
they had a they had eleven teams and

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.910 
they had a they had eleven teams and
they<00:02:13.970> competed<00:02:14.390> for<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.510> $50<00:02:14.959> prize<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.500> we're

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
they competed for a $50 prize so we're

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.060 
they competed for a $50 prize so we're
giving<00:02:16.190> away<00:02:16.239> $250<00:02:17.239> today<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.510> as<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> top<00:02:18.830> prize
