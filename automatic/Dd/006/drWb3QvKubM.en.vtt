00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.460
 But thanks 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:13.680
 In 2 this time 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:16.049
 Let's create an environment for creating an iphone app 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.820
 First of all 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.820
 iphone app 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.260
 I can not make it without a Mac 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.780
 Even in the feces soil whirlpool 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.700
 Can make 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:38.190
 When you build a glue building information to search for it is the google that 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:45.860
 There are times when hot water is put, but basically it is copyright Yan 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:49.620
 There is a problem with the license etc. The iphone app can not be created unless it is a Mac 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.700
 By the way, it was cormorant android app 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.170
 It is possible to create with windows 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:00.680
 I think totally, iphone app and android app 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.890
 If you want to make your tea both Ya Mac 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:08.000
 I think the most optimal Kana 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.420
 Well then, from now on 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.330
 How to install xcode 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.620
 I think that I would like to introduce you 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.040
 How Tsu each 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:24.020
 Yes in it 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:30.260
 Let's create an environment for making the iphone app 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:32.220
 First of all install the software xcode 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.960
 Of each item 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.500
 Say at this screen 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.500
 left 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.760
 It is from the item first 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.760
 Choose applestore 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.140
 When you choose Apple Store 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:56.510
 I think it will be like this screen, but here's the process Olympics 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.130
 Select 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.470
 Then basically towards the upper part 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.010
 Development 2 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.700
 The thing of xcode 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.410
 Select here that will be displayed 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.480
 Without 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.520
 Upper right 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.790
 Search from xcode and 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.170
 Please enter and search 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.170
 Select this 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.150
 Yes 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:35.540
 Then I think that the list will come out again 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.540
 Select this xcode 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.569
 I think it will be such a screen then 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.719
 this 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:51.489
 Choose you stole installation 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:54.280
 Currently xcode is already installed on my computer 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.319
 It has been installed 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.680
 If you are new to 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.680
 Please install from this item 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.340
 I will go to the installation screen 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.890
 Sign in 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:15.670
 Appell id etc. I think you can be asked for an account 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.670
 Here is that 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.740
 Please enter and login before installing 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.990
 that's all 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.990
 How was it included 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.200
 It is this time 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.890
 The explanation 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.530
 Honestly 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.990
 If you search by google etc. 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.360
 A lot of information comes out 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.750
 That's why you have to install xcode 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.420
 The 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.910
 Today's video 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:53.440
 I thought the Na or description will not be, but cormorants 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:59.830
 As a private aspect, as a first step 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:01.370
 I dare to make this video is a mini iphone app 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.610
 But 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.480
 after installing xcode 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.920
 a is it 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:14.170
 ios developer the same 6 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.799
 iphone I feel like I was such a name 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:23.060
 I will register there 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.060
 This will take 8400 yen a year 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:32.150
 What can we do if we start at 8400 yen ? 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.320
 I have my own 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:42.790
 You can drop the apps you created for iphone 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.790
 And it will be able to provide the app to the Apple Store 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.729
 The sound comes in 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.780
 I agree 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:56.360
 So full scale application development 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:58.729
 Challenge the fishing cell is ios developer Subscribe 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.180
 It is registration of Veropa program 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.380
 This one 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.260
 Go and do 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.130
