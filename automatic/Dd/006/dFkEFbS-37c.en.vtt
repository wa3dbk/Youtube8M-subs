00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
very similar and a lot of qualities the

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.380 
very similar and a lot of qualities the
infrared<00:00:45.070> that<00:00:45.250> is<00:00:45.400> the<00:00:45.550> infrared<00:00:45.970> is<00:00:46.090> not<00:00:46.270> the

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
infrared that is the infrared is not the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.740 
infrared that is the infrared is not the
velocity<00:00:46.840> read<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:48.250> box<00:00:48.460> you<00:00:48.730> see<00:00:48.940> behind<00:00:49.180> all

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
velocity read the box you see behind all

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.580 
velocity read the box you see behind all
the<00:00:49.960> shoes<00:00:50.230> is<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:51.040> infrared<00:00:51.940> to<00:00:52.180> pack<00:00:52.480> box<00:00:52.870> so

and<00:00:57.820> you<00:00:58.239> can<00:00:58.390> pretty<00:00:58.540> much<00:00:58.630> see<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.470> red<00:00:59.710> on

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and you can pretty much see the red on

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.569 
and you can pretty much see the red on
the<00:01:01.660> infrared<00:01:02.020> and<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.680> Olympic<00:01:03.100> six<00:01:03.370> the

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
the infrared and the Olympic six the

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.719 
the infrared and the Olympic six the
differences<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.890> if<00:01:06.070> you<00:01:06.190> look<00:01:06.280> at<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.520> toe

differences so if you look at the toe

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.410 
differences so if you look at the toe
boxes<00:01:07.240> on<00:01:07.450> all<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.290> them<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.490> quality<00:01:10.000> between

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
boxes on all of them the quality between

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.600 
boxes on all of them the quality between
you<00:01:11.350> know<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.500> don't<00:01:11.590> want<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:11.979> make<00:01:12.130> this<00:01:12.280> just

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
you know I don't want to make this just

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.480 
you know I don't want to make this just
a<00:01:12.700> quality<00:01:13.150> video<00:01:13.390> but<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:14.350> quality<00:01:14.620> like<00:01:15.370> I

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
a quality video but the quality like I

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.370 
a quality video but the quality like I
said<00:01:15.550> on<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:15.940> motorsport<00:01:16.479> 6<00:01:16.750> in<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.020> Olympic

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
said on the motorsport 6 in the Olympic

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.550 
said on the motorsport 6 in the Olympic
6<00:01:17.620> is<00:01:17.830> very<00:01:18.280> similar<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.659> infrared<00:01:20.080> pack<00:01:20.350> it

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
6 is very similar the infrared pack it

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.610 
6 is very similar the infrared pack it
was<00:01:20.710> yeah<00:01:20.979> you<00:01:21.729> know<00:01:21.880> it<00:01:22.570> is<00:01:22.930> what<00:01:23.110> it<00:01:23.170> is<00:01:23.380> and
