00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.969
 So I hope you can all of us 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.280
 a bit higher brown county we 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:45.489
 here at the fibo wbo champion 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.629
 arthur abraham marco how do you not feel 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.620
 do it well 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:55.449
 I 'm glad that so many fans 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.100
 may stand in the wii makes fun like that 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.490
 many autographs to write the nice ones 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.110
 to meet people 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.210
 what were we so many athletic 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.870
 meeting people is really 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.030
 ingenious 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.680
 yes you can see the snake very big so 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.350
 you are definitely in demand here 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.030
 But you are also in the boxing ring 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.130
 there you will be soon 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.680
 probably meet again against robert 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.240
 Stieglitz compulsory challenger was said 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.060
 So what's your day in robert 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.710
 Stieglitz is my next fight 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.910
 against roger stilz i am ready me 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.520
 I have no problem at all 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.970
 already with a rule I know one 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.830
 athletic with a fighter and for me 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.290
 No matter how much I box I go in 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.090
 the rule is not used to not win 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.130
 So I'm ready to lose 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.050
 yes the right attitude is up 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.780
 in any case you already have parma against 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.490
 another fought 2 1 stands for you now 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.380
 my question should be you again 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.760
 win and then it would be 3 to 1 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.580
 Stieglitz is then for you 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.619
 I do not care about it afterwards 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.210
 'm not that kind of says is 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.600
 more interesting is uninteresting 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.420
 I am a fighter 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.040
 if someone beat us we operate 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.250
 because hit again then I hit 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.140
 I want that I have no problem 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.270
 optimistic as you can hear now I have to 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.580
 but of course also ask what if 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.440
 it is then available at the end of perhaps 22 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.420
 between you will eventually 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.160
 fifth fight again interesting because 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.030
 You know if you climb into the ring 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.120
 the people 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.959
 that does not win 2 1 win 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.340
 I am convinced that we leave that way 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.810
 stand you will stand for it first time 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.040
 I have to succeed a lot now 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.590
 of course also ask 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.450
 felix storm for example, too 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.300
 repeatedly called what do you admit 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.269
 which is actually completely silent on the subject 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.280
 an under topic 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.360
 I think this campus come about 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.040
 because German fans are all waiting 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.590
 this fight of anne want this came 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.030
 you from my side I already have 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.100
 given my years 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.880
 the management is ready too 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.700
 have not indicated 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.630
 offer he has not yet made 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.000
 answered 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.580
 So I'm ready to fight him 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.900
 i can not handle it at all 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.480
 I can not say 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.070
 that sounds very good i think box 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.550
 Germany are looking forward to great 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.320
 fights 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.430
 but now I do not just want it 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.230
 on Germany alps but one 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.030
 you could expand a bit 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.430
 introduce internationally strong 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.930
 then have opponents to fight if you can 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.670
 then you have to leave world champion 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.290
 s do not exist internationally 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.840
 national or left behind 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.110
 That is only important and the country 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.610
 box and in america or other countries 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.170
 world champions me this time already 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.940
 they all come to us as I have 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.280
 not to say that great statement 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.050
 thanks for that then actually stays 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.350
 only to ask if it is the 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.060
 feigenbutz has recently contacted 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.190
 has called you among other things as well 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.170
 meant as a young slapper fighter 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.810
 Maybe you all flatten us like that 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.360
 to speak in Low German what is yours 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.900
 opinion on it 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.600
 I have no opinion 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.930
 guttenberg I respect nothing that 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.310
 we 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.560

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.070
