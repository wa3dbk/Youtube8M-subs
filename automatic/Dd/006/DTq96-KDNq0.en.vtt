00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.670
 his friends and today we will play in 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.830
 game for forest already in new alpha version 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.929
 004 b actually no matter how 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.670
 no change but I will tell you that 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.580
 it has changed in this version so 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.180
 this ax chick here I came up here 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.630
 here and clicked on e as i showed you 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.900
 and immediately took this little thing 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.270
 cool added in this version if 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.000
 run here from these rocks where we find 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:42.059
 this golden ax to the left here in this 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.450
 side run run and that's what you can 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.950
 see here 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:51.800
 see you know what it is 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.489
 and this board is the same as you can take 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.100
 near the plane 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.640
 here we have them immediately 3 shows 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.850
 see, let's scroll down right away 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.659
 such parsley 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.250
 oh no then i already forgot how it is done 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.659
 coins 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:16.320
 so here so here it is done exactly here 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.880
 three components before we have them 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.750
 taku 2 lay and now they are already showing 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.479
 like this one on skazt at intersections 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.759
 I know that somewhere else on the beach there are 1 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.970
 here somewhere near 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.220
 in that part of the beach here we are now with 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.860
 let's go there by you and 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.820
 and we will see who it lies there steel 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:50.220
 in another place now once again we look 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:52.470
 where can be bunny runs funny 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.899
 happy with the view and the rain 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.320
 usually when you this game all everything 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.939
 great weather cool then you can expect 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.520
 that you will soon be rain 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.170
 as scheduled almost every 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.340
 day in this game 3 days shield rain then 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.360
 rainbow appears 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.560
 so look we have teeth 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.319
 still nothing we can 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.410
 do as the battery itself can not 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.739
 nothing to do with a flashlight so we 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:29.310
 let's go hungry 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:34.129
 trample and we are just like 25 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.540
 times here are 5 leather skins and look i'm already five 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.910
 sheep killed but we are shown that 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.180
 so much meat from one is exactly the same with 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.790
 rabbit that is how much you did not catch here 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.269
 See if you catch up to an hour 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.340
 caught anyway the bunny will be one in 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.860
 inventory 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.430
 I don't know, it's not really cool 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.879
 of course therefore recommend if you 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.170
 going somewhere far away 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:07.140
 from your house it is certainly better 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.410
 stock up and fish can catch fish 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.620
 with the help of such a shelf 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.819
 always here and here in theory 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:27.540
 there must be a chip too but one 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:31.709
 we don't see it now 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.430
 I will say so do not sit down pathetic covered 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:38.459
 we had one rabbit anyway 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.380
 shows one rabbit you see then 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.290
 you can eat too much and not try them 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.169
 packs to kill unless it is possible for 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:51.000
 ravens peel because of them and because of them 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:55.919
 pelts for armor so sorry no okay 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.269
 let's go to another place where else 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.269
 maybe this chip 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:08.660
 and we have it on the other side of the island 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.660
 somewhere there 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:18.320
 Yacht unfortunately also do not have as far as I 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:23.870
 known she randomly respawn in 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:26.630
 two places here somewhere here and there not 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.550
 and where we are in the previous series with you 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:34.540
 and and found than in the alpha version 003 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.850
 here it is unfortunately not now 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.130
 when we return we will see now 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.950
 look at the yacht and at the same time check not 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:49.000
 a fee where you can find another board 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:52.640
 the sun is already setting for the bomb 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.680
 so you will need to do the tent 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:05:00.140
 and the most important thing is probably the developers 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.080
 why did this update added 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.380
 the letter would be 004 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.210
 this is what we can have now 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.960
 such a building that had not previously 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:17.540
 worked 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:21.310
 specifically, this is a house on the river on the water 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:24.350
 here it is possible to put it so and press the shop 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.360
 come up that's what appeared how many 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.850
 resources press the c key typing 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.900
 click and remove this building then 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:35.720
 there is wonderful they came up here and 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.630
 until dark need to drive check 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.580
 if the microcircuit here it is here near here 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.280
 these here 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:50.980
 the rocks is supposed to be 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:56.860
 immediately take a flashlight chip 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.860

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:07.180

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:19.839
 all a bunch of stars 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.689
 still small pebbles they decided that I 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:24.339

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:26.319

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:38.139
