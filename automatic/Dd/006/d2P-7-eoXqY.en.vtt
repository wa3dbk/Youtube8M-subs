00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.270 
the board now you see here that i
already<00:01:32.600> skimmed<00:01:33.079> this<00:01:33.350> one<00:01:33.649> it's<00:01:33.889> pretty

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
already skimmed this one it's pretty

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.010 
already skimmed this one it's pretty
much<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.429> same<00:01:34.729> as<00:01:34.939> when<00:01:35.119> we<00:01:35.240> did<00:01:35.420> be<00:01:35.630> chicken

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
much the same as when we did be chicken

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.959 
much the same as when we did be chicken
breast<00:01:36.259> where<00:01:36.649> you<00:01:37.189> just<00:01:37.340> kind<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.609> use<00:01:37.819> the

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
breast where you just kind of use the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.029 
breast where you just kind of use the
knife<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.179> ease<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.749> skin<00:01:39.079> off<00:01:39.289> i<00:01:39.499> got<00:01:39.679> most<00:01:39.920> of

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
knife to ease the skin off i got most of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.529 
knife to ease the skin off i got most of
it<00:01:40.130> there's<00:01:40.340> still<00:01:40.609> a<00:01:40.639> little<00:01:40.850> trace<00:01:41.149> amounts

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
it there's still a little trace amounts

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.410 
it there's still a little trace amounts
of fat<00:01:41.810> here<00:01:42.109> so<00:01:42.590> that's<00:01:42.799> okay<00:01:43.179> gives<00:01:44.179> it<00:01:44.359> a

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
of fat here so that's okay gives it a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.719 
of fat here so that's okay gives it a
little<00:01:44.749> bit<00:01:45.020> more<00:01:45.350> moistness<00:01:45.889> when<00:01:46.249> i<00:01:46.280> cook<00:01:46.549> it

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
little bit more moistness when i cook it

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.919 
little bit more moistness when i cook it
now<00:01:47.289> you<00:01:48.289> may<00:01:48.469> notice<00:01:48.499> that<00:01:49.159> around<00:01:49.789> here<00:01:50.539> knew

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
now you may notice that around here knew

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.719 
now you may notice that around here knew
where<00:01:51.139> the<00:01:51.289> spot<00:01:51.649> will<00:01:51.920> yeah<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:52.520> would<00:01:52.639> be

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
where the spot will yeah that would be

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.580 
where the spot will yeah that would be
where<00:01:52.819> the<00:01:52.939> spine<00:01:53.179> is<00:01:53.389> you'll<00:01:54.020> see<00:01:54.289> that<00:01:54.439> there

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
where the spine is you'll see that there

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.160 
where the spine is you'll see that there
might<00:01:54.740> be<00:01:54.799> a<00:01:55.009> little<00:01:55.310> bit<00:01:55.579> of<00:01:55.729> stuff<00:01:56.509> left<00:01:56.899> over

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
might be a little bit of stuff left over

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.620 
might be a little bit of stuff left over
as<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:58.069> were<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.429> that's<00:01:58.759> just<00:01:59.029> some<00:01:59.209> internal

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
as it were and that's just some internal

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.719 
as it were and that's just some internal
organs<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.350> if<00:02:00.469> it<00:02:00.619> really<00:02:00.799> bothers<00:02:00.889> you<00:02:01.609> can

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
organs and if it really bothers you can

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.309 
organs and if it really bothers you can
dig<00:02:01.969> it<00:02:01.999> out<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.509> put<00:02:02.689> it<00:02:02.779> into<00:02:02.899> your<00:02:03.020> trash

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
dig it out and put it into your trash

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.410 
dig it out and put it into your trash
bowl<00:02:03.649> but<00:02:03.889> I<00:02:04.100> generally<00:02:04.819> just<00:02:04.880> ignore<00:02:05.389> it

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
bowl but I generally just ignore it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.940 
bowl but I generally just ignore it
because<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.749> don't<00:02:05.929> really<00:02:06.109> flip<00:02:06.499> over<00:02:06.859> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
because I don't really flip over the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.499 
because I don't really flip over the
meat<00:02:07.189> to<00:02:07.399> eat<00:02:07.429> from<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.850> bottom<00:02:08.209> all<00:02:08.330> that

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
meat to eat from the bottom all that

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.430 
meat to eat from the bottom all that
often<00:02:08.690> if<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.200> do<00:02:09.259> I<00:02:09.410> just<00:02:09.709> don't<00:02:10.099> eat<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.250> part

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
often if I do I just don't eat that part

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.230 
often if I do I just don't eat that part
but<00:02:11.890> if<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.070> bothers<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.430> like<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.790> said<00:02:13.030> take

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
but if it bothers you like I said take

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.140 
but if it bothers you like I said take
it<00:02:13.420> off<00:02:13.590> now<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.980> can<00:02:15.100> see<00:02:15.340> right<00:02:15.370> here<00:02:16.000> is

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
it off now you can see right here is

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.580 
it off now you can see right here is
where<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:16.390> have<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.870> joint<00:02:17.200> between<00:02:17.380> the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
where we have the joint between the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.120 
where we have the joint between the
thigh<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.910> actual<00:02:19.810> chicken<00:02:20.140> leg<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.980> can

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
thigh and the actual chicken leg you can

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.800 
thigh and the actual chicken leg you can
do<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.340> one<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:21.610> two<00:02:21.730> ways<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.120> can<00:02:22.330> break

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
do this one of two ways you can break

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.520 
do this one of two ways you can break
the<00:02:23.020> joint<00:02:23.350> which<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.730> would<00:02:24.880> just<00:02:25.090> do<00:02:25.530> by

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
the joint which you would just do by

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.890 
the joint which you would just do by
just<00:02:26.590> applying<00:02:27.130> firm<00:02:27.640> pressure<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.420> if<00:02:28.780> I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
just applying firm pressure and if I

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.150 
just applying firm pressure and if I
wasn't<00:02:29.110> holding<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.530> camera<00:02:29.830> i<00:02:30.010> would

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
wasn't holding the camera i would

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.890 
wasn't holding the camera i would
actually<00:02:30.250> grab<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.030> break<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.570> show

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
actually grab it and break it to show

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.470 
actually grab it and break it to show
you<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:33.130> then<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.580> can<00:02:33.760> cut<00:02:34.030> which<00:02:34.270> will<00:02:34.390> make

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
you and then you can cut which will make

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.000 
you and then you can cut which will make
it<00:02:34.600> easy<00:02:34.840> or<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.260> could<00:02:35.410> just<00:02:35.440> take<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.980> knife

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
it easy or you could just take the knife

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.970 
it easy or you could just take the knife
and<00:02:36.520> just<00:02:37.000> cut<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.600> right<00:02:37.630> at<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:38.470> joint<00:02:38.860> here

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
and just cut it right at this joint here

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.280 
and just cut it right at this joint here
and<00:02:39.730> once<00:02:39.910> you<00:02:40.060> do<00:02:40.240> you'll<00:02:40.420> have<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.840> separate

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
and once you do you'll have the separate

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.100 
and once you do you'll have the separate
like<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.520> separate<00:02:42.910> fly<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.930> can

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
like and the separate fly that you can

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.320 
like and the separate fly that you can
do<00:02:44.230> whatever<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.620> like<00:02:44.650> with<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.940> can<00:02:46.120> see

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
do whatever you like with you can see

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.810 
do whatever you like with you can see

here and my thighs here well what I
would<00:02:55.030> normally<00:02:55.210> do<00:02:55.750> would<00:02:55.990> be<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.170> take<00:02:56.470> these

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
would normally do would be to take these

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.070
