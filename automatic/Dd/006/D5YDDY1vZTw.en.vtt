00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.020 
have this is blue but the top he's here
around<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.500> camera<00:02:01.920> that's<00:02:02.280> actually<00:02:02.550> black

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
around the camera that's actually black

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.940 
around the camera that's actually black
so<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.360> throws<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.720> off<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.870> little<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.320> that's

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
so it throws it off a little bit that's

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.590 
so it throws it off a little bit that's
one<00:02:05.160> thing<00:02:05.190> i<00:02:05.400> actually<00:02:05.790> didn't<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.180> so

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
one thing i actually didn't like so

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.859 
one thing i actually didn't like so
let's<00:02:06.990> go<00:02:07.110> ahead<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.290> get<00:02:07.410> into<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> case

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
let's go ahead and get into the case

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.369 
let's go ahead and get into the case
first<00:02:09.869> off<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.349> box<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:10.920> case<00:02:12.379> out

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
first off in the box you get case out

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.770 
first off in the box you get case out
there

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
there

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.500 
there
and<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.920> gives<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.819> reversible

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
and this gives you the reversible

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.130 
and this gives you the reversible
scanned<00:02:16.900> as<00:02:17.230> well<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.819> try<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.630> get<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:19.959> out

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
scanned as well so I try to get that out

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.660 
scanned as well so I try to get that out
for<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.610> unless<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.910> just<00:02:22.060> pop<00:02:22.420> out<00:02:25.170> okay

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
for you unless you just pop out okay

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.980 
for you unless you just pop out okay
let's<00:02:27.670> see<00:02:27.850> here<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.480> stand<00:02:28.840> you

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
let's see here this is the stand you

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.130 
let's see here this is the stand you
just<00:02:29.200> lay<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.530> case<00:02:29.740> in<00:02:29.980> there<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:31.810> and

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
just lay the case in there like so and

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.460 
just lay the case in there like so and
it<00:02:33.040> will<00:02:33.250> hold<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.000> phone<00:02:34.209> up<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.569> watching

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
it will hold the phone up to watching

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.620 
it will hold the phone up to watching
movies<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.980> whatnot<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.819> I<00:02:37.150> believe<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:37.569> is

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
movies and whatnot and I believe this is

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.809 
movies and whatnot and I believe this is
these<00:02:37.959> are<00:02:38.020> different<00:02:38.260> angles<00:02:38.709> as<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.700> can

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
these are different angles as you can

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.770 
these are different angles as you can
see<00:02:40.030> here<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:41.440> goes<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.950> way<00:02:42.100> more<00:02:42.780> this

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
see here this goes that way more this

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.340 
see here this goes that way more this
one<00:02:43.959> goes<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.170> little<00:02:44.440> bit<00:02:44.620> more<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.220> slope<00:02:45.520> so

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
one goes a little bit more on a slope so

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.960 
one goes a little bit more on a slope so
that's<00:02:47.350> what's<00:02:47.530> in<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.739> box<00:02:47.950> um<00:02:48.250> gets<00:02:48.760> little

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
that's what's in the box um gets little

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.340 
that's what's in the box um gets little
plan<00:02:49.180> flight<00:02:49.480> here<00:02:49.690> says<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.200> we<00:02:50.320> are

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
plan flight here says that we are

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.470 
plan flight here says that we are
committed<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.980> protecting<00:02:51.300> technology<00:02:52.300> then

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
committed to protecting technology then

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.500 
committed to protecting technology then

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
go ahead and get into the case and see

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.430 
go ahead and get into the case and see
how<00:02:57.040> well<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.280> fits<00:02:57.450> now<00:02:58.450> if<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:58.780> have<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.050> if

how well it fits now if you have a if

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.140 
how well it fits now if you have a if

you have a screen protector on you like
i<00:03:01.330> do<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:01.750> have<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.620> front<00:03:02.950> screen<00:03:03.370> protector

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
i do I have the front screen protector

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.080 
i do I have the front screen protector
as<00:03:04.000> well<00:03:04.180> as<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.450> back<00:03:04.600> now<00:03:05.410> this<00:03:06.400> case<00:03:06.700> here

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
as well as the back now this case here

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.360 
as well as the back now this case here
you're<00:03:07.989> going<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.170> go<00:03:08.290> ahead<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:08.470> fit<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:09.069> will

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
you're going to go ahead and fit it will

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.160 
you're going to go ahead and fit it will
show<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:09.670> guys<00:03:09.819> exactly<00:03:10.060> why<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.750> don't<00:03:11.110> like

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
this case you can put the phone in there

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.530 
this case you can put the phone in there
like<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:14.680> it<00:03:14.920> actually<00:03:15.340> goes<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:15.910> pretty<00:03:16.330> well

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
like so it actually goes in pretty well

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.100 
like so it actually goes in pretty well
right<00:03:17.230> now<00:03:18.090> once<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.239> get<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.480> case<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:19.959> it

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
right now once you get the case on it

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.610 
right now once you get the case on it
after<00:03:20.799> a<00:03:21.040> while<00:03:21.130> I've<00:03:21.579> noticed<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:23.290> you

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
after a while I've noticed this that you

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.170 
after a while I've noticed this that you
know<00:03:23.709> on<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.010> bottom<00:03:24.340> here<00:03:24.549> once<00:03:24.820> you<00:03:24.970> slide

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
know on the bottom here once you slide

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.340 
know on the bottom here once you slide
it<00:03:25.480> in<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:28.090> have<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.450> try<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.690> wiggle<00:03:28.959> your<00:03:29.230> way

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
it in you have to try to wiggle your way

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.560 
it in you have to try to wiggle your way
in<00:03:29.620> there<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:30.070> once<00:03:30.610> you<00:03:30.760> get<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.180> there<00:03:31.360> it

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
in there and once you get it in there it

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.080 
in there and once you get it in there it
fits<00:03:31.989> really<00:03:32.380> well<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.220> like<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.760> design

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
fits really well and I like the design

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.120 
fits really well and I like the design
factor<00:03:34.570> of<00:03:34.630> this<00:03:34.780> case<00:03:35.019> but<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.769> only<00:03:35.980> thing

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
factor of this case but the only thing

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.759 
factor of this case but the only thing
that<00:03:36.489> I<00:03:36.519> do<00:03:36.579> not<00:03:37.000> like<00:03:37.209> this<00:03:38.079> I<00:03:38.230> can<00:03:38.380> get<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:38.680> in

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
that I do not like this I can get you in

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.430 
that I do not like this I can get you in
there<00:03:38.920> no<00:03:39.190> if<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.370> can<00:03:39.519> see<00:03:39.820> it<00:03:40.170> see<00:03:41.170> if<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.290> can

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
there no if you can see it see if I can

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.000 
there no if you can see it see if I can
zoom<00:03:41.650> in<00:03:42.269> as<00:03:43.269> you<00:03:43.660> can<00:03:43.840> see<00:03:44.079> there<00:03:44.350> let<00:03:44.769> me<00:03:44.859> see

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
zoom in as you can see there let me see

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.090 
zoom in as you can see there let me see
if<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.190> can<00:03:45.340> focus<00:03:45.549> for<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.230> if<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.769> do<00:03:47.920> have<00:03:48.070> a

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
if I can focus for you if you do have a

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.770 
if I can focus for you if you do have a
screen<00:03:48.459> protector<00:03:48.609> that<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.329> can<00:03:49.510> see<00:03:49.750> that

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
screen protector that you can see that

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.229 
screen protector that you can see that
it<00:03:50.049> does<00:03:50.260> bubble<00:03:50.680> up<00:03:50.829> because<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.910> form

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
it does bubble up because of the form

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
bubbles forming from the case being so

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.400 
bubbles forming from the case being so
close<00:04:00.820> to<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:02.799> edge<00:04:03.359> so<00:04:04.359> once<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:04.930> slide<00:04:05.109> it

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
close to the edge so once you slide it

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.380 
close to the edge so once you slide it
in<00:04:05.560> if<00:04:05.799> you<00:04:05.920> have<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:06.130> thick<00:04:06.519> screen<00:04:06.910> protector

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
on it it will bubble it up on the sides

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.630 
on it it will bubble it up on the sides
now<00:04:10.840> he<00:04:10.900> has<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.230> view<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.769> case<00:04:12.190> from<00:04:12.459> the

here it's very touch sensitive so
whatever<00:05:19.599> I'll<00:05:19.780> just<00:05:19.810> put<00:05:20.139> in<00:05:20.259> whatever<00:05:20.409> code

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
whatever I'll just put in whatever code

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.469 
whatever I'll just put in whatever code
but<00:05:21.370> as<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:21.550> can<00:05:21.639> see<00:05:21.880> here<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.210> lightest

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
but as you can see here the lightest

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.249 
but as you can see here the lightest
touch<00:05:22.750> will<00:05:23.440> get<00:05:23.830> you<00:05:24.129> you<00:05:24.969> know<00:05:25.090> it<00:05:25.930> does<00:05:26.110> not

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
touch will get you you know it does not

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.740 
touch will get you you know it does not
interfere<00:05:26.440> with<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:26.889> thing<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:28.240> screen<00:05:28.539> or

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
interfere with the thing the screen or

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.550 
interfere with the thing the screen or
anything<00:05:29.250> but<00:05:30.479> this<00:05:31.479> does<00:05:31.719> have<00:05:31.960> that<00:05:32.110> lay<00:05:32.380> on

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
anything but this does have that lay on

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.469 
anything but this does have that lay on
the<00:05:32.680> table<00:05:32.710> design<00:05:33.370> you<00:05:33.699> can<00:05:33.849> see<00:05:34.030> that<00:05:34.210> that's

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
the table design you can see that that's

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.070 
the table design you can see that that's
like<00:05:34.569> a<00:05:34.690> lip<00:05:35.789> so<00:05:36.789> if<00:05:36.880> you<00:05:37.000> do<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:37.659> know<00:05:37.750> decide

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
like a lip so if you do you know decide

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.629 
like a lip so if you do you know decide
to<00:05:38.229> take<00:05:38.319> your<00:05:38.469> phone<00:05:38.620> and<00:05:38.650> put<00:05:38.889> it<00:05:39.009> down<00:05:39.190> it's

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
to take your phone and put it down it's

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:40.680 
to take your phone and put it down it's
not<00:05:39.789> going<00:05:39.940> to<00:05:40.030> hurt<00:05:40.180> or<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.389> scratch<00:05:40.630> the

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
not going to hurt or a scratch the

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.969 
not going to hurt or a scratch the
screen<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:42.419> that's<00:05:43.419> pretty<00:05:43.659> much<00:05:43.779> my<00:05:44.500> opinion

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
screen and that's pretty much my opinion

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:49.329 
a nice very nice and glossy so that's

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:50.819

pretty<00:06:49.569> much<00:06:49.659> the<00:06:49.779> only<00:06:49.929> qualms<00:06:50.289> i<00:06:50.439> have<00:06:50.589> about

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:50.829 
pretty much the only qualms i have about

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:53.639 
pretty much the only qualms i have about
it<00:06:51.009> if<00:06:51.699> that<00:06:52.209> didn't<00:06:52.539> do<00:06:52.689> that<00:06:52.899> with<00:06:53.349> if<00:06:53.529> it

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:53.649 
it if that didn't do that with if it

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:55.139 
it if that didn't do that with if it
just<00:06:53.799> left<00:06:54.009> a<00:06:54.129> little<00:06:54.399> bit<00:06:54.549> more<00:06:54.729> room<00:06:54.909> on<00:06:55.029> the

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:55.149 
just left a little bit more room on the

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:57.449 
just left a little bit more room on the
top<00:06:55.329> here<00:06:55.599> where<00:06:55.779> the<00:06:55.869> edges<00:06:56.019> are<00:06:56.289> to<00:06:56.859> go<00:06:57.009> over

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:57.459 
top here where the edges are to go over

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.459 
top here where the edges are to go over
but<00:06:57.909> this<00:06:58.029> is<00:06:58.179> a<00:06:58.209> very<00:06:58.359> form-fitting<00:06:58.959> case<00:06:59.169> so

00:06:59.459 --> 00:06:59.469 
but this is a very form-fitting case so

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:01.349 
but this is a very form-fitting case so
this<00:07:00.159> actually<00:07:00.369> works<00:07:00.759> well<00:07:00.969> the<00:07:01.119> only<00:07:01.239> thing

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:01.359 
this actually works well the only thing

00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:03.719 
this actually works well the only thing
I<00:07:01.569> have<00:07:01.809> a<00:07:02.109> problem<00:07:02.709> with<00:07:02.979> is<00:07:03.219> that<00:07:03.549> when<00:07:03.669> you

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729 
I have a problem with is that when you

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:04.919 
I have a problem with is that when you
have<00:07:03.849> a<00:07:03.879> screen<00:07:04.089> protector<00:07:04.209> on<00:07:04.569> here<00:07:04.809> it

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:04.929 
have a screen protector on here it

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:06.779 
have a screen protector on here it
actually<00:07:05.049> bubbles<00:07:05.559> up<00:07:05.679> on<00:07:05.799> the<00:07:05.889> side<00:07:06.099> that's

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:06.789 
actually bubbles up on the side that's

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:08.249 
actually bubbles up on the side that's
the<00:07:06.969> only<00:07:07.239> thing<00:07:07.389> that<00:07:07.539> stopped<00:07:07.779> me<00:07:07.959> from<00:07:08.049> rock

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.259
