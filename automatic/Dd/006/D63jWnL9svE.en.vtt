00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.050 
thing is we can just tap it to zoom out
to<00:01:50.560> an<00:01:50.799> overall<00:01:51.070> revenue<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:51.700> will<00:01:51.789> show<00:01:52.000> you

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
to an overall revenue that will show you

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.510 
to an overall revenue that will show you
exactly<00:01:52.840> what<00:01:53.080> that<00:01:53.200> traffic<00:01:53.560> means<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:54.399> in

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
exactly what that traffic means so in

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.570 
exactly what that traffic means so in
this<00:01:54.610> case<00:01:54.789> traffic's<00:01:55.659> pretty<00:01:55.750> freely<00:01:56.500> up<00:01:57.369> the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
this case traffic's pretty freely up the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.779 
this case traffic's pretty freely up the
101<00:01:57.939> but<00:01:58.780> around<00:01:58.929> San<00:01:59.170> Mateo<00:01:59.549> slow<00:02:00.549> down

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
101 but around San Mateo slow down

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.550 
101 but around San Mateo slow down
that's<00:02:01.149> all<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.360> way<00:02:01.420> that<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.259> then<00:02:02.380> if<00:02:02.470> you

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
that's all the way that and then if you

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.419 
that's all the way that and then if you
get<00:02:02.679> all<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:02.890> way<00:02:02.950> up<00:02:03.069> to<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.220> Bay<00:02:03.399> Bridge

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429
