00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
and just make sure you make it into the

curb this is where we start to get on
the<00:01:08.190> gas<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:09.090> I've<00:01:09.270> got<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> good<00:01:09.780> line<00:01:09.990> into

this corner if I turned in early then
I'm<00:01:12.690> often<00:01:12.840> waiting<00:01:13.350> quite<00:01:13.620> a<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.890> longer<00:01:14.130> so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
I'm often waiting quite a bit longer so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:28.780 
I'm often waiting quite a bit longer so
that<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.820> don't<00:01:14.880> run<00:01:15.120> off<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.510> track

the turn 3 my main focus is getting my

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.910 
the turn 3 my main focus is getting my

right hand tires as close to the grass
as<00:01:34.160> possible<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.760> then<00:01:35.600> I<00:01:35.690> turn<00:01:35.930> in<00:01:36.140> quite

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
as possible and then I turn in quite

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.550 
as possible and then I turn in quite
quickly<00:01:36.890> give<00:01:37.730> a<00:01:37.760> stab<00:01:38.330> of<00:01:38.480> the<00:01:38.540> brake<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:39.170> load

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
this is a bit more curb than I usually

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.060 
this is a bit more curb than I usually
take<00:01:47.210> but<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:47.600> really<00:01:48.050> can<00:01:48.290> be<00:01:48.320> aggressive<00:01:48.770> on

kerb on the exit here even a bit of
gravel<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:00.980> ok<00:02:01.370> you<00:02:01.820> don't<00:02:02.000> seem<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.270> get<00:02:02.360> a

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
gravel is ok you don't seem to get a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.440 
gravel is ok you don't seem to get a
safety<00:02:02.660> point<00:02:02.960> if<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.260> just<00:02:03.410> put<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.620> wheel<00:02:03.830> off

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.240 

once<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.380> get<00:02:10.500> comfortable<00:02:10.920> with<00:02:11.130> this

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
once you get comfortable with this

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.699 
once you get comfortable with this
corner<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.700> should<00:02:11.760> easily<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.390> flat<00:02:12.750> out<00:02:12.990> and

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
corner it should easily be flat out and

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.559 
corner it should easily be flat out and
make<00:02:13.860> sure<00:02:13.890> not<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.250> turn<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.670> too<00:02:14.940> early<00:02:15.000> and

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
make sure not to turn in too early and

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.750 
make sure not to turn in too early and
on<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.020> exit<00:02:16.349> try<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.680> stay<00:02:16.830> as<00:02:16.980> far<00:02:17.280> right<00:02:17.580> as

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
on the exit try and stay as far right as

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.120 
on the exit try and stay as far right as
you<00:02:17.880> can<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.510> lined<00:02:18.870> up<00:02:18.989> nicely<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.920> break

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
you can so you lined up nicely to break

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.800 
you can so you lined up nicely to break
into<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.489> next<00:02:20.730> ten

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
into the next ten

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.430 
into the next ten
I<00:02:24.270> like<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.420> make<00:02:25.569> sure<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.840> car<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.050> straight

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
I like to make sure the car is straight

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.170 
I like to make sure the car is straight
before<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:26.860> start<00:02:27.130> braking<00:02:27.520> for<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:27.819> one<00:02:28.030> and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
before I start braking for this one and

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.449 
before I start braking for this one and
I<00:02:28.690> usually<00:02:28.840> brake<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> little<00:02:29.410> earlier<00:02:30.190> than<00:02:30.340> I

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
I usually brake a little earlier than I

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.430 
I usually brake a little earlier than I
need<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.700> just<00:02:31.180> because<00:02:31.450> it's<00:02:31.690> really<00:02:31.959> easy<00:02:32.110> to

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
need to just because it's really easy to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.280 
need to just because it's really easy to
go<00:02:32.590> wide<00:02:32.800> here<00:02:33.099> or<00:02:33.819> if<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.270> lock<00:02:34.480> up<00:02:34.660> or<00:02:34.930> just

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
go wide here or if you lock up or just

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.430 
go wide here or if you lock up or just
brake<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.500> bit<00:02:35.590> too<00:02:35.860> late

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.010 

usually<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.430> train<00:02:40.760> not<00:02:40.970> hit<00:02:41.210> this<00:02:41.390> curb<00:02:41.630> but<00:02:41.990> I

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
usually a train not hit this curb but I

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.660 
usually a train not hit this curb but I
do<00:02:42.170> hit<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.680> once<00:02:42.830> or<00:02:42.980> twice<00:02:43.010> in<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.430> video

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
do hit it once or twice in the video

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.480 
do hit it once or twice in the video
it's<00:02:44.630> not<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.810> big<00:02:45.050> deal<00:02:45.290> just<00:02:45.740> don't<00:02:46.250> get<00:02:46.430> too

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
it's not a big deal just don't get too

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.000 
it's not a big deal just don't get too
hard<00:02:46.970> on<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.240> gas<00:02:47.420> while<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.440> inside<00:02:48.710> tires

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
hard on the gas while the inside tires

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.790 
hard on the gas while the inside tires

are up on the curb on the exit they like

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
to stay nice to the left to get a good

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.310 
to stay nice to the left to get a good
line<00:02:54.650> into<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.010> next<00:02:55.310> right-hander

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.780 

I'm<00:03:00.320> pretty<00:03:00.560> happy<00:03:00.860> with<00:03:00.920> my<00:03:00.980> line<00:03:01.340> into<00:03:01.640> this

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
I'm pretty happy with my line into this

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.690 
I'm pretty happy with my line into this
one<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.120> slap<00:03:02.360> I<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:03.440> left<00:03:03.770> as<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.160> turn<00:03:04.430> in

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
one the slap I just left as I turn in

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.030 
one the slap I just left as I turn in
and<00:03:04.940> then<00:03:05.360> I'm<00:03:05.540> waiting<00:03:05.930> on<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.110> front<00:03:06.410> end<00:03:06.680> as

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
and then I'm waiting on the front end as

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.400 
and then I'm waiting on the front end as
I<00:03:07.580> get<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.880> apex<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.720> they<00:03:08.990> start<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.290> pick

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
I get to the apex and they start to pick

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.530 
I get to the apex and they start to pick
up<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.680> bottle

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.480 

once<00:03:17.140> you're<00:03:17.320> on<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.530> gas<00:03:17.710> out<00:03:17.980> of<00:03:18.010> this<00:03:18.220> turn

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
once you're on the gas out of this turn

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.490 
once you're on the gas out of this turn
you<00:03:18.640> should<00:03:18.910> be<00:03:19.060> able<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.300> stay<00:03:19.540> full<00:03:19.900> throttle

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
you should be able to stay full throttle

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.680 
you should be able to stay full throttle
all<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.190> way<00:03:21.400> until<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.760> last<00:03:22.030> turn<00:03:22.330> if<00:03:22.630> you

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
all the way until the last turn if you

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.930 
all the way until the last turn if you
get<00:03:22.990> the<00:03:23.080> line<00:03:23.230> right<00:03:23.440> it<00:03:24.370> takes<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:24.760> while<00:03:24.880> to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
get the line right it takes a while to

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.550 
get the line right it takes a while to
find<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.480> line<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.960> the<00:03:26.050> rhythm<00:03:26.290> through

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
find the line and the rhythm through

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.370 
find the line and the rhythm through
here<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.390> haven't<00:03:28.600> got<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:28.930> right<00:03:29.140> it's

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
here if you haven't got it right it's

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.200 
here if you haven't got it right it's
just<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.680> lot<00:03:29.860> easier<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:30.370> lift<00:03:30.580> off<00:03:30.790> rather

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
just a lot easier to lift off rather

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.670 
just a lot easier to lift off rather
than<00:03:31.420> try<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.870> keep<00:03:32.020> your<00:03:32.200> foot<00:03:32.410> in<00:03:32.440> it

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
than try and keep your foot in it

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.620 
than try and keep your foot in it
because<00:03:33.670> your<00:03:33.820> line<00:03:33.940> will<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:34.270> get<00:03:34.390> worse

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
because your line will just get worse

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.240 
because your line will just get worse
and<00:03:34.870> you'll<00:03:35.020> keep<00:03:35.170> getting<00:03:35.320> later<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:36.220> just

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
and you'll keep getting later so just

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.240 
and you'll keep getting later so just
back<00:03:36.910> off<00:03:37.090> if<00:03:37.300> you<00:03:37.390> don't<00:03:37.570> have<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:38.100> once<00:03:39.100> you

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
back off if you don't have it once you

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.670 
back off if you don't have it once you
do<00:03:39.460> just<00:03:39.790> focus<00:03:40.180> on<00:03:40.360> minimum<00:03:41.140> steering

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
do just focus on minimum steering

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.220 
do just focus on minimum steering
possible<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.370> try<00:03:43.300> not<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.660> put<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.870> wheel<00:03:44.080> off

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
possible and try not to put a wheel off

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.230 
possible and try not to put a wheel off
onto<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.650> grass<00:03:44.860> or<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.340> curb<00:03:45.760> because<00:03:46.000> you

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
onto the grass or the curb because you

00:03:46.240 --> 00:04:06.590 
onto the grass or the curb because you
can<00:03:46.390> really<00:03:46.660> get<00:03:46.870> some<00:03:46.930> wheel<00:03:47.230> spin<00:03:47.260> here<00:03:47.710> too

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.390 

the<00:04:07.600> last<00:04:07.870> turn<00:04:08.200> is<00:04:08.440> probably<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:09.250> most

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
the last turn is probably the most

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.820 
the last turn is probably the most
difficult<00:04:09.700> on<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.060> track<00:04:10.270> for<00:04:10.480> me<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.840> find<00:04:11.740> it

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
difficult on the track for me I find it

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.740 
difficult on the track for me I find it
tough<00:04:12.040> because<00:04:12.250> is<00:04:12.790> really<00:04:12.850> hard<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.510> find<00:04:13.630> a

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
tough because is really hard to find a

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.790 
tough because is really hard to find a
turning<00:04:14.140> point

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
turning point

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.980 
turning point
you're<00:04:15.400> not<00:04:15.550> very<00:04:15.760> well<00:04:15.910> sited<00:04:16.390> on<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.570> corner

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:16.990 
you're not very well sited on the corner

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.470 
you're not very well sited on the corner
and<00:04:17.140> there<00:04:17.290> are<00:04:17.380> no<00:04:17.530> real<00:04:17.770> references<00:04:18.420> by<00:04:19.420> the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
and there are no real references by the

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.610 
and there are no real references by the
track<00:04:19.780> for<00:04:20.050> a<00:04:20.470> turning<00:04:20.890> point<00:04:22.230> it<00:04:23.230> just<00:04:23.440> takes

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
track for a turning point it just takes

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.040 
track for a turning point it just takes
a<00:04:23.680> lot<00:04:23.800> of<00:04:23.920> time<00:04:24.130> to<00:04:24.370> get<00:04:24.460> this<00:04:24.610> one<00:04:24.820> right<00:04:25.050> if

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
a lot of time to get this one right if

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.630 
a lot of time to get this one right if
you<00:04:26.170> turn<00:04:26.410> in<00:04:26.620> too<00:04:27.040> late

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
you turn in too late

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.640 
you turn in too late
obviously<00:04:28.090> you'll<00:04:28.300> miss<00:04:28.510> a<00:04:28.690> pax<00:04:29.020> if<00:04:29.320> you<00:04:29.440> turn

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
obviously you'll miss a pax if you turn

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.240 
obviously you'll miss a pax if you turn
in<00:04:29.800> early<00:04:30.190> it's<00:04:30.400> really<00:04:30.940> easy<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.390> run<00:04:31.840> wide<00:04:32.250> on

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
in early it's really easy to run wide on

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.090 
in early it's really easy to run wide on
the<00:04:33.310> exit<00:04:33.520> of<00:04:33.730> this<00:04:33.880> one<00:04:34.090> so<00:04:34.780> usually<00:04:35.680> if<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:35.920> hit

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
the exit of this one so usually if I hit

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.190 
the exit of this one so usually if I hit
the<00:04:36.250> apex<00:04:36.640> and<00:04:36.880> I'm<00:04:37.090> able<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.540> get<00:04:37.720> on<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:37.990> gas

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
the apex and I'm able to get on the gas

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.310 
the apex and I'm able to get on the gas
add<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.980> apex<00:04:39.400> without<00:04:39.700> running<00:04:40.030> wide<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.540> call

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
add the apex without running wide I call

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.220 
add the apex without running wide I call
that<00:04:41.410> a<00:04:41.470> success<00:04:41.920> I<00:04:42.700> stay<00:04:43.300> in<00:04:43.420> third<00:04:43.600> gear

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
that a success I stay in third gear

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.280 
that a success I stay in third gear
sorry<00:04:44.710> fourth<00:04:45.040> gear<00:04:45.310> you<00:04:46.090> can<00:04:46.120> try<00:04:46.570> third<00:04:46.870> but

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
sorry fourth gear you can try third but

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.350 
sorry fourth gear you can try third but
same<00:04:47.740> as<00:04:47.920> that<00:04:48.070> earlier<00:04:48.430> turn

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
same as that earlier turn

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.720 
same as that earlier turn
I<00:04:49.390> just<00:04:49.900> find<00:04:50.380> it<00:04:50.530> works<00:04:50.710> well<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:50.980> forth<00:04:51.370> and

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
I just find it works well and forth and

00:04:51.730 --> 00:05:11.189 
I just find it works well and forth and
you<00:04:51.880> soon<00:04:52.150> run<00:04:52.360> out<00:04:52.510> of<00:04:52.540> gear<00:04:52.870> in<00:04:53.020> third<00:04:53.260> anyway

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.719 

okay<00:05:12.199> so<00:05:12.260> let's<00:05:12.590> go<00:05:12.770> through<00:05:13.010> a<00:05:13.070> full<00:05:13.250> lap<00:05:13.460> here

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
okay so let's go through a full lap here

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.480 
okay so let's go through a full lap here
a<00:05:17.199> little<00:05:18.199> bit<00:05:18.410> shaking<00:05:18.949> on<00:05:19.010> the<00:05:19.040> way<00:05:19.250> into

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
a little bit shaking on the way into

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.219 
a little bit shaking on the way into
that<00:05:19.580> turn<00:05:19.850> you<00:05:20.240> can<00:05:20.419> see<00:05:20.600> I<00:05:20.630> get<00:05:20.810> wide<00:05:21.020> on<00:05:21.199> the

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
that turn you can see I get wide on the

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.850 
that turn you can see I get wide on the
exit<00:05:21.440> so<00:05:21.979> I<00:05:22.010> just<00:05:23.050> wait<00:05:24.050> to<00:05:24.260> get<00:05:24.410> on<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.680> gas<00:05:24.800> a

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
exit so I just wait to get on the gas a

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.860 
exit so I just wait to get on the gas a
little<00:05:25.100> bit<00:05:25.220> later<00:05:25.490> this<00:05:25.760> left

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.670 

from<00:05:29.350> the<00:05:29.440> stain<00:05:29.650> nicely<00:05:30.460> over<00:05:30.580> to<00:05:30.790> the<00:05:30.880> right

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.740 

I<00:05:34.710> just<00:05:35.340> flipped<00:05:35.639> the<00:05:35.820> curb<00:05:36.120> there<00:05:36.449> that's

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
I just flipped the curb there that's

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.719 
I just flipped the curb there that's
okay<00:05:37.110> I<00:05:37.380> would<00:05:37.710> like<00:05:37.919> to<00:05:38.070> have<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.220> bit<00:05:38.490> more<00:05:38.520> of

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
okay I would like to have a bit more of

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.280 
okay I would like to have a bit more of
it<00:05:38.970> but<00:05:39.210> that's<00:05:39.330> alright<00:05:41.540> again<00:05:42.540> focusing<00:05:43.199> on

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
it but that's alright again focusing on

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.989 
it but that's alright again focusing on
staying<00:05:43.620> right

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:44.999 
staying right

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.379 
staying right
on<00:05:45.179> the<00:05:45.329> exit<00:05:45.629> fear<00:05:46.819> breaking<00:05:47.819> straight<00:05:48.179> line

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
on the exit fear breaking straight line

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.629 
on the exit fear breaking straight line
I<00:05:48.689> usually<00:05:49.199> carry<00:05:49.409> a<00:05:49.559> bit<00:05:49.709> of<00:05:49.829> break<00:05:50.069> as<00:05:50.279> I<00:05:50.399> turn

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
I usually carry a bit of break as I turn

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.600 
I usually carry a bit of break as I turn
in<00:05:50.849> there

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.240 

try<00:05:56.210> and<00:05:56.330> avoid<00:05:56.510> that<00:05:56.570> curb<00:05:57.020> on<00:05:57.230> the<00:05:57.260> right<00:05:57.560> if

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
try and avoid that curb on the right if

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.560 
try and avoid that curb on the right if
you<00:05:58.400> can<00:05:58.520> get<00:05:58.640> as<00:05:58.760> close<00:05:59.030> to<00:05:59.090> it<00:05:59.300> as<00:05:59.420> you<00:05:59.480> can

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
you can get as close to it as you can

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.480 
you can get as close to it as you can
without<00:05:59.840> touching<00:06:00.290> it<00:06:00.560> there's<00:06:00.860> a<00:06:00.950> nice<00:06:01.250> bit

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
without touching it there's a nice bit

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.780 
without touching it there's a nice bit
of<00:06:01.520> camber<00:06:01.850> on<00:06:02.060> the<00:06:02.210> inside<00:06:02.950> that<00:06:03.950> really<00:06:03.980> digs

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
of camber on the inside that really digs

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.500 
of camber on the inside that really digs
the<00:06:05.030> inside<00:06:05.420> tire<00:06:05.660> zone<00:06:05.960> which<00:06:06.140> feels<00:06:06.380> great

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
the inside tire zone which feels great

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.910 
the inside tire zone which feels great
and<00:06:08.510> again<00:06:08.780> just<00:06:08.990> keeping<00:06:09.200> it<00:06:09.380> smooth<00:06:09.650> through

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
and again just keeping it smooth through

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.540 
and again just keeping it smooth through
this<00:06:10.040> section<00:06:10.310> and<00:06:11.140> then<00:06:12.140> just<00:06:12.190> trying<00:06:13.190> not<00:06:13.370> to

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
this section and then just trying not to

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.150 
this section and then just trying not to
brick<00:06:13.910> it<00:06:14.090> as<00:06:14.270> I<00:06:15.140> come<00:06:15.470> up<00:06:15.590> to<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.770> last<00:06:15.920> turn

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
brick it as I come up to the last turn

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.330 
brick it as I come up to the last turn
no<00:06:19.160> idea<00:06:19.460> what<00:06:19.550> I'm<00:06:19.640> doing<00:06:19.670> here<00:06:19.970> to<00:06:20.120> be<00:06:20.210> honest

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
no idea what I'm doing here to be honest

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.760 
no idea what I'm doing here to be honest
but<00:06:22.340> I<00:06:22.760> kinda<00:06:23.420> hit<00:06:23.510> an<00:06:23.600> apex<00:06:23.990> and<00:06:24.290> then<00:06:24.500> I<00:06:24.560> was

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
but I kinda hit an apex and then I was

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.650 
but I kinda hit an apex and then I was
on<00:06:24.860> the<00:06:24.980> gas<00:06:25.130> fairly<00:06:25.700> well<00:06:25.880> at<00:06:25.970> the<00:06:26.060> exit<00:06:26.420> so

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
on the gas fairly well at the exit so

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.370 
on the gas fairly well at the exit so
fairly<00:06:27.410> happy<00:06:27.800> with<00:06:27.920> that<00:06:28.160> one
