00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
at least and maybe we can have a trilogy

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.920 
at least and maybe we can have a trilogy
on<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.860> 3ds<00:00:55.190> or<00:00:55.700> better<00:00:56.059> yet<00:00:56.300> remake<00:00:56.719> all

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
thing is that spin-off came out after

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
it's not what people were expecting I'm

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.670 
it's not what people were expecting I'm
still<00:02:10.729> going<00:02:10.909> to<00:02:11.030> play<00:02:11.209> it<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.540> probably<00:02:12.200> have

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
still going to play it and probably have

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.649 
still going to play it and probably have
at<00:02:12.950> least<00:02:13.159> a<00:02:13.340> little<00:02:13.489> fun<00:02:13.730> with<00:02:13.879> it<00:02:13.939> but<00:02:14.389> it's

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
at least a little fun with it but it's

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.100 
at least a little fun with it but it's
not<00:02:14.989> what<00:02:15.349> I<00:02:15.379> wanted

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
not what I wanted

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.230 
not what I wanted
now<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.590> still<00:02:16.950> want<00:02:17.190> another<00:02:17.460> 2d<00:02:17.790> Metroid<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
now I still want another 2d Metroid and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.300 
now I still want another 2d Metroid and
possibly<00:02:18.960> Metroid<00:02:19.320> Prime<00:02:19.350> Ford<00:02:19.860> we're<00:02:20.190> just

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
possibly Metroid Prime Ford we're just

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.970 
possibly Metroid Prime Ford we're just
an<00:02:20.460> entirely<00:02:20.760> new<00:02:21.000> FBS<00:02:21.750> Metroid<00:02:22.290> altogether<00:02:22.770> I

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
an entirely new FBS Metroid altogether I

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.620 
an entirely new FBS Metroid altogether I
think<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.400> thing<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.640> bothers<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.210> lot<00:02:24.240> of

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
think the thing that bothers a lot of

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.750 
think the thing that bothers a lot of
people<00:02:24.780> about<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.590> fact<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:25.980> Samus

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
people about it is the fact that Samus

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.700 
people about it is the fact that Samus
isn't<00:02:27.120> even<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.480> game<00:02:27.720> making<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
isn't even in the game making it the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.370 
isn't even in the game making it the
first<00:02:28.950> metroid<00:02:29.430> title<00:02:29.790> we're<00:02:30.300> Santa's<00:02:30.960> isn't

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
first metroid title we're Santa's isn't

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.750 
first metroid title we're Santa's isn't
in<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.590> another<00:02:31.980> thing<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.220> was<00:02:32.400> announced

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
in it another thing that was announced

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.880 
in it another thing that was announced
was<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.090> legend<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.450> zelda<00:02:33.840> triforce<00:02:34.050> heroes

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
was the legend of zelda triforce heroes

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.920 
was the legend of zelda triforce heroes
which<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.340> sort<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.850> four<00:02:36.300> swords<00:02:36.720> type

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
which is sort of like a four swords type

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.800 
which is sort of like a four swords type
game<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.640> makes<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.000> lot<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.150> sense<00:02:39.300> with

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
game but it makes a lot of sense with

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.780 
game but it makes a lot of sense with
the<00:02:39.840> 3ds<00:02:40.410> since<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.980> has<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.340> wireless

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
the 3ds since it has the wireless

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.280 
the 3ds since it has the wireless
connection<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.300> everything<00:02:42.660> with<00:02:43.080> four

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
connection and everything with four

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.690 
connection and everything with four
swords<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.800> head<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.040> head<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.310> link<00:02:44.520> cable

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
swords you head to head the link cable

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.180 
swords you head to head the link cable
or<00:02:45.030> play<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.420> gamecube<00:02:45.780> version<00:02:46.020> i<00:02:46.650> guess<00:02:46.920> i'm

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
or play the gamecube version i guess i'm

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.440 
or play the gamecube version i guess i'm
not<00:02:47.459> sure<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.700> those<00:02:47.820> are<00:02:48.000> actually<00:02:48.270> different

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
not sure if those are actually different

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.420 
not sure if those are actually different
or<00:02:48.690> not<00:02:48.810> but<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.350> does<00:02:49.590> look<00:02:49.740> pretty<00:02:49.890> fun<00:02:50.190> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
or not but this does look pretty fun and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.220 
or not but this does look pretty fun and
it's<00:02:50.670> going<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.940> actually<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.480> online<00:02:51.750> co-op

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
it's going to actually have online co-op

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.170 
it's going to actually have online co-op
which<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.770> something<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.220> mario<00:02:53.610> games<00:02:53.880> has

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
which is something the mario games has

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.720 
which is something the mario games has
not<00:02:54.510> had<00:02:54.870> for<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> while<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.920> being<00:02:56.340> new<00:02:56.489> super

world why they don't have online co-op I
don't<00:03:00.360> know<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:00.840> suddenly<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.560> has<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.280> I

Crossing<00:03:24.450> amiibo<00:03:24.570> cards<00:03:25.320> which<00:03:25.650> i'm<00:03:25.860> guessing

Crossing amiibo cards which i'm guessing

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.729 
Crossing amiibo cards which i'm guessing
are<00:03:26.489> packaged<00:03:27.120> with<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.600> game<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.620> would

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
are packaged with the game so that would

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.890 
are packaged with the game so that would
make<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:29.070> lot<00:03:29.340> more<00:03:29.400> sense<00:03:29.940> as<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.360> why<00:03:30.600> they're

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
make a lot more sense as to why they're

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.330 
make a lot more sense as to why they're
required<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> game<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.010> don't<00:03:32.190> have

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
required for the game and you don't have

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.460 
required for the game and you don't have
to<00:03:32.459> buy<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.670> actual<00:03:33.150> physical<00:03:33.570> thing<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.350> can

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
to buy the actual physical thing you can

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.110 
to buy the actual physical thing you can
just<00:03:34.709> use<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.950> cards<00:03:35.370> still<00:03:35.670> what<00:03:35.880> kind<00:03:36.060> of

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
just use the cards still what kind of

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.240 
just use the cards still what kind of
sucks<00:03:36.330> that<00:03:36.450> those<00:03:36.959> are<00:03:37.110> required<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.830> other

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
sucks that those are required so other

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.560
