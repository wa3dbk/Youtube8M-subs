00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
eyebrow and like that and then I'll just

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.100 
eyebrow and like that and then I'll just
use<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.860> light<00:02:39.250> tapping<00:02:39.580> motion<00:02:40.090> like<00:02:40.269> this<00:02:40.300> and

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
use a light tapping motion like this and

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.990 
use a light tapping motion like this and
that's<00:02:41.260> going<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.680> get<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.400> blood<00:02:42.670> flowing

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
that's going to get the blood flowing

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.970 
that's going to get the blood flowing
right<00:02:43.390> there<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.900> circulation<00:02:44.410> increase

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
right there and the circulation increase

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.309 
right there and the circulation increase
because<00:02:45.459> when<00:02:46.269> you<00:02:46.360> have<00:02:46.510> puffiness<00:02:46.959> that

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
because when you have puffiness that

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.840 
because when you have puffiness that
means<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.680> circulation<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.430> very<00:02:48.610> slowed

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
means the circulation is very slowed

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.550 
means the circulation is very slowed
down<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.239> this<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:49.480> going<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.720> help<00:02:49.900> add<00:02:50.500> a

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
down so this is going to help add a

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.490 
down so this is going to help add a
little<00:02:51.040> bit<00:02:51.340> more<00:02:51.370> circulation<00:02:52.350> keep<00:02:53.350> it

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
little bit more circulation keep it

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.970 
little bit more circulation keep it
flowing<00:02:53.769> there<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:55.690> will<00:02:55.810> help<00:02:56.080> that

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
flowing there and it will help that

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.740 
flowing there and it will help that
decrease<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.549> little<00:02:57.790> bit<00:02:58.060> then<00:02:58.330> what<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.690> like

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
that that helps a lot but the next thing

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.950 
that that helps a lot but the next thing
we're<00:04:44.770> gonna<00:04:44.830> do<00:04:45.160> is<00:04:45.190> go<00:04:45.520> in<00:04:45.699> with<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.270> setting

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
we're gonna do is go in with a setting

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.300 
we're gonna do is go in with a setting
powder<00:04:46.990> so<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.560> one<00:04:47.680> that<00:04:47.770> I've<00:04:47.889> been<00:04:47.919> loving

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
powder so the one that I've been loving

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.540 
powder so the one that I've been loving
is<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.639> bare<00:04:48.940> minerals<00:04:49.479> well<00:04:49.780> rested<00:04:50.290> and

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
is the bare minerals well rested and

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.550 
is the bare minerals well rested and
this<00:04:51.550> one<00:04:51.729> actually<00:04:51.880> has<00:04:52.240> SPF<00:04:52.690> 20<00:04:53.110> in<00:04:53.229> it<00:04:53.350> and

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560

it's I right now well the powder looks
like<00:04:55.300> this<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:55.780> it's<00:04:55.900> really<00:04:56.050> good<00:04:56.320> idea<00:04:57.220> to

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
like this and it's really good idea to

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.420 
like this and it's really good idea to
set<00:04:58.419> your<00:04:59.050> concealer<00:04:59.260> especially<00:05:00.070> under<00:05:00.340> your

set your concealer especially under your

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.860 
set your concealer especially under your
eyes<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:00.760> that<00:05:00.789> doesn't<00:05:01.270> budge<00:05:01.449> all<00:05:01.630> day<00:05:01.750> and

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.560 

so<00:06:04.530> just<00:06:04.949> like<00:06:05.070> that<00:06:05.220> and<00:06:05.460> that<00:06:05.940> is<00:06:06.120> all<00:06:06.270> I<00:06:06.300> do

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
so just like that and that is all I do

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.090 
so just like that and that is all I do
for<00:06:06.810> my<00:06:06.900> eyes<00:06:07.050> now<00:06:07.260> I<00:06:07.290> also<00:06:07.530> forgot<00:06:07.889> to<00:06:07.949> mention

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
for my eyes now I also forgot to mention

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.350 
for my eyes now I also forgot to mention
that<00:06:08.910> before<00:06:09.150> you<00:06:10.080> do<00:06:10.580> this<00:06:11.580> whole<00:06:11.790> step<00:06:12.150> it's

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
that before you do this whole step it's

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.480 
that before you do this whole step it's
really<00:06:12.780> a<00:06:12.810> good<00:06:13.020> idea<00:06:13.229> to<00:06:13.590> use<00:06:14.130> a<00:06:14.160> moisturizer

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
really a good idea to use a moisturizer

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.240 
really a good idea to use a moisturizer
so<00:06:15.150> I<00:06:15.360> would<00:06:15.840> do<00:06:15.990> that<00:06:16.139> probably<00:06:16.500> before<00:06:16.710> I<00:06:16.949> put

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
so I would do that probably before I put

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.340 
so I would do that probably before I put
this<00:06:17.400> on<00:06:17.610> and<00:06:18.300> then<00:06:18.389> let<00:06:18.540> that<00:06:18.690> dry<00:06:18.990> before<00:06:19.050> you

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
this on and then let that dry before you

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.400 
this on and then let that dry before you
put<00:06:19.380> on<00:06:19.850> the<00:06:20.850> Ain<00:06:21.090> typify<00:06:21.510> roller<00:06:21.720> so<00:06:22.020> I<00:06:22.050> just

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
put on the Ain typify roller so I just

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.980 
put on the Ain typify roller so I just
like<00:06:22.530> the<00:06:22.650> Clinique<00:06:23.040> this<00:06:23.880> is<00:06:24.060> the<00:06:24.419> Moisture

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
like the Clinique this is the Moisture

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.280 
like the Clinique this is the Moisture
Surge<00:06:25.020> extended<00:06:26.010> thirst<00:06:26.250> relief<00:06:26.610> and<00:06:27.110> I<00:06:28.110> just

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
Surge extended thirst relief and I just

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.409 
Surge extended thirst relief and I just
take<00:06:28.470> a<00:06:28.500> little<00:06:28.710> bit<00:06:29.010> on<00:06:29.190> my<00:06:29.370> ring<00:06:29.610> finger<00:06:29.639> and

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
take a little bit on my ring finger and

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:32.450 
take a little bit on my ring finger and
apply<00:06:31.050> it<00:06:31.110> under<00:06:31.500> my<00:06:31.530> Iook<00:06:31.800> because<00:06:32.310> it's

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
apply it under my Iook because it's

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.800 
apply it under my Iook because it's
really<00:06:32.610> important<00:06:33.000> to<00:06:33.060> hydrate<00:06:33.240> that<00:06:33.570> area

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
really important to hydrate that area

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.719 
really important to hydrate that area
because<00:06:34.020> it's<00:06:34.169> so<00:06:34.350> thin<00:06:34.650> that<00:06:34.830> I<00:06:34.949> can<00:06:35.460> tell

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
because it's so thin that I can tell
