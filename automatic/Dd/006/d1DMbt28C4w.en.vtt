foot wide so let's pull it out a little
bit<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.320> see<00:01:07.470> what<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> looks<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:11.570> I'm<00:01:12.570> just

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
bit and see what it looks like I'm just

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.540 
bit and see what it looks like I'm just
gonna<00:01:12.840> lock<00:01:13.110> my<00:01:13.350> tape<00:01:13.619> measure<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.460> at

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
gonna lock my tape measure in here at

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.669 
gonna lock my tape measure in here at
about<00:01:14.640> six<00:01:15.119> feet<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.450> can

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
about six feet and see if I can

I<00:01:31.030> think<00:01:32.030> that's<00:01:32.210> a<00:01:32.360> little<00:01:32.570> too<00:01:32.960> low<00:01:42.520> that's

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
I think that's a little too low that's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.490 
I think that's a little too low that's
about<00:01:43.729> five<00:01:44.000> feet<00:01:44.300> I<00:01:44.360> think<00:01:44.660> I<00:01:44.750> like<00:01:44.930> five<00:01:45.229> feet

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
I'm gonna go ahead and cut these boards

00:01:46.820 --> 00:02:17.680 
I'm gonna go ahead and cut these boards
for<00:01:47.240> five<00:01:47.450> feet<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:49.090> give<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.270> a<00:01:50.300> go

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.940 

all<00:02:18.690> right<00:02:18.840> well<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.050> learned<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.530> lesson<00:02:19.770> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
all right well I learned that lesson the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.860 
all right well I learned that lesson the
hard<00:02:20.040> way<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.640> thought<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.240> was<00:02:21.330> gonna<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.690> more

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
hard way I thought it was gonna be more

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.050 
hard way I thought it was gonna be more
difficult<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.500> bend<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.100> cattle<00:02:23.490> panel<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.970> an

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
difficult to bend the cattle panel to an

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.350 
difficult to bend the cattle panel to an
existing<00:02:24.690> frame<00:02:25.050> than<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.190> build<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.270> way

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
existing frame than to build it the way

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.720 
existing frame than to build it the way
I<00:02:27.390> started<00:02:27.840> doing<00:02:28.110> here<00:02:28.350> but<00:02:28.560> now<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.340> trouble

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
cattle panel to bend at just the right

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.590 
cattle panel to bend at just the right
degree<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.250> match<00:02:35.580> up<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.060> square

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
degree so that I can match up and square

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.320 
degree so that I can match up and square
those<00:02:37.230> two<00:02:37.260> pieces<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.980> wood<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.700> get<00:02:39.180> it

it<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.650> front<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.610> my<00:03:06.030> hope<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.480> that

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
it to the front and my hope is that that

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.650 
it to the front and my hope is that that
will<00:03:06.870> help<00:03:07.050> hold<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.190> two<00:03:08.940> pieces<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.510> the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
will help hold the two pieces of the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.199 
will help hold the two pieces of the
walls<00:03:09.989> together<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.610> can<00:03:11.880> get<00:03:12.030> this

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
walls together so that I can get this

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.620 
walls together so that I can get this
back<00:03:12.420> corner<00:03:12.780> done<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.380> little<00:03:13.860> easier<00:03:14.630> well

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
back corner done a little easier well

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.500 
back corner done a little easier well
here<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.110> is<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.590> all<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.130> its<00:03:17.430> imperfection<00:03:18.300> I

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
here it is in all of its imperfection I

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.410 
here it is in all of its imperfection I
will<00:03:19.350> again<00:03:19.590> say<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:20.220> if<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.519> were<00:03:21.300> to

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
will again say that if I were to

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.509 
will again say that if I were to
construct<00:03:21.840> another<00:03:22.019> one<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.560> these<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:22.980> would

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
construct another one of these I would

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.729 
construct another one of these I would
build<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> frame<00:03:24.329> first<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:25.049> think<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.620> I'd

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
build the frame first I think that I'd

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.229 
build the frame first I think that I'd
be<00:03:25.769> more<00:03:26.100> willing<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.579> deal<00:03:26.760> with<00:03:26.940> trying<00:03:27.180> to

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
be more willing to deal with trying to

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.479 
be more willing to deal with trying to
figure<00:03:27.570> out<00:03:27.600> how<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.560> bend<00:03:28.980> everything

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
figure out how to bend everything

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.600 
figure out how to bend everything
correctly<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.840> have<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.230> figure<00:03:31.530> out<00:03:31.709> how<00:03:32.549> to

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
correctly then have to figure out how to

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.940 
correctly then have to figure out how to
get<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.750> two<00:03:33.930> pieces<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.380> wood<00:03:34.650> attached

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
get the two pieces of wood attached

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.130 
get the two pieces of wood attached
together<00:03:35.459> now<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.120> they're<00:03:36.510> attached<00:03:36.840> to

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
together now that they're attached to

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.310 
together now that they're attached to
the<00:03:37.230> flexible<00:03:37.829> wire<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:39.060> lesson<00:03:39.959> learned<00:03:40.110> on

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
the flexible wire so lesson learned on

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.920 
the flexible wire so lesson learned on
that<00:03:40.350> one<00:03:40.709> if<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.579> have<00:03:42.239> built<00:03:42.480> one<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.810> these

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
that one if you have built one of these

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.470 
that one if you have built one of these
before<00:03:43.350> then<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.489> would<00:03:44.730> admonish<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.450> to

before then I would admonish you to

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.560 
before then I would admonish you to

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
a blog post in several pictures about

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.150 
a blog post in several pictures about
your<00:03:51.180> process<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:51.840> building<00:03:52.200> one<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.590> tried

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
your process and building one I tried

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.190 
your process and building one I tried
researching<00:03:53.730> plans<00:03:54.030> for<00:03:54.390> one<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.690> these<00:03:54.840> and

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
researching plans for one of these and

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.460 
researching plans for one of these and
couldn't<00:03:56.160> come<00:03:56.340> across<00:03:56.670> any<00:03:56.989> either<00:03:57.989> because

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
couldn't come across any either because

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.440 
couldn't come across any either because
people<00:03:58.860> deem<00:03:59.370> that<00:03:59.400> it's<00:03:59.760> such<00:03:59.910> a<00:03:59.940> simple

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
people deem that it's such a simple

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.210 
people deem that it's such a simple
thing<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:01.019> everybody<00:04:01.590> would<00:04:01.709> just<00:04:01.769> know<00:04:02.040> how

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
thing that everybody would just know how

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.910 
thing that everybody would just know how
to<00:04:02.250> do<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.670> instinctively<00:04:03.450> or<00:04:04.410> because<00:04:04.769> not

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
to do it instinctively or because not

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.069 
to do it instinctively or because not
very<00:04:04.950> many<00:04:05.280> people<00:04:05.489> are<00:04:05.700> doing<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.420> if

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
very many people are doing it so if

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.350 
very many people are doing it so if
you've<00:04:07.320> done<00:04:07.620> one<00:04:07.829> put<00:04:08.670> it<00:04:08.760> out<00:04:08.880> there<00:04:09.150> because

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
you've done one put it out there because

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.000 
you've done one put it out there because
surely<00:04:09.810> you've<00:04:09.959> done<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.140> better<00:04:10.350> job<00:04:10.500> than<00:04:10.709> I

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
surely you've done a better job than I

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.640 
surely you've done a better job than I

the<00:04:15.959> property<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.650> it's<00:04:17.010> way<00:04:17.160> too<00:04:17.220> big<00:04:17.430> for

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
the property and it's way too big for

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.729 
the property and it's way too big for
this<00:04:18.000> configuration<00:04:18.239> I'm<00:04:19.109> gonna<00:04:19.260> have<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.590> get

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739

this configuration I'm gonna have to get
a<00:04:19.769> different<00:04:20.160> one<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.579> I'm<00:04:21.000> also<00:04:21.180> gonna<00:04:21.419> take

a different one and I'm also gonna take

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.870 
a different one and I'm also gonna take
it<00:04:21.840> down<00:04:22.019> because<00:04:22.229> let's<00:04:23.070> just<00:04:23.190> say<00:04:23.520> it<00:04:23.669> it's<00:04:23.789> a

big blue flag in the middle of a brown

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.770 
big blue flag in the middle of a brown
forest<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.550> it's<00:04:26.940> gonna<00:04:27.090> give<00:04:27.360> away<00:04:27.599> my

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
forest and it's gonna give away my

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.129 
forest and it's gonna give away my
wife's<00:04:28.020> birthday<00:04:28.530> present<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:29.390> here<00:04:30.390> it<00:04:30.510> is

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
wife's birthday present so here it is

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.040 
wife's birthday present so here it is
all<00:04:31.349> that<00:04:31.710> said<00:04:32.009> it<00:04:32.370> is<00:04:32.610> portable<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.449> can<00:04:33.840> pick

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
all that said it is portable I can pick

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.959 
all that said it is portable I can pick
it<00:04:34.080> up<00:04:34.289> in<00:04:34.469> the<00:04:34.590> back<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:34.830> drag<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.639> on<00:04:35.789> its

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:35.969 
it up in the back and drag it on its

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.959 
it up in the back and drag it on its
front<00:04:36.270> I<00:04:36.539> have<00:04:37.289> plenty<00:04:37.800> of<00:04:37.979> little<00:04:38.699> tiny

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:38.969 
front I have plenty of little tiny

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.469 
front I have plenty of little tiny
stumps<00:04:39.629> just<00:04:39.990> sticking<00:04:40.229> out<00:04:40.469> just<00:04:40.770> over<00:04:41.069> the

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
stumps just sticking out just over the

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.860 
stumps just sticking out just over the
surface<00:04:42.479> of<00:04:42.689> my<00:04:42.900> woods<00:04:43.740> here<00:04:44.189> and<00:04:44.689> did<00:04:45.689> not

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
surface of my woods here and did not

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.439 
surface of my woods here and did not
have<00:04:46.169> any<00:04:46.409> problems<00:04:46.949> easily<00:04:47.819> getting<00:04:48.060> over

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
have any problems easily getting over

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.769 
have any problems easily getting over
those<00:04:48.659> so<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.289> think<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:50.099> got<00:04:50.669> a<00:04:50.699> checkmark<00:04:51.330> in

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:51.779 
those so I think it got a checkmark in

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:54.379 
those so I think it got a checkmark in
the<00:04:52.080> positive<00:04:52.379> for<00:04:52.949> being<00:04:53.099> portable<00:04:53.849> which<00:04:54.360> is

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
the positive for being portable which is
