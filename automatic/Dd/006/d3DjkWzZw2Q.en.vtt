played well i think he was okay yeah I
lead<00:00:23.970> off<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.359> dugong<00:00:24.869> latios<00:00:25.740> and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
lead off with dugong latios and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.910 
lead off with dugong latios and
metagross<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.939> predict<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.920> rotation

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
metagross and I predict the rotation

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.800 
metagross and I predict the rotation
into<00:00:29.130> honestly<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:29.970> didn't<00:00:30.269> predict<00:00:30.539> anything

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
into honestly I didn't predict anything

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.620 
into honestly I didn't predict anything
i<00:00:31.050> went<00:00:31.230> from<00:00:31.320> light<00:00:31.590> screen<00:00:31.949> i'm<00:00:32.850> assuming

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
i went from light screen i'm assuming

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.660 
i went from light screen i'm assuming
his<00:00:34.050> team<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.500> trick<00:00:34.770> room<00:00:34.980> judging<00:00:35.489> by<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
his team is trick room judging by the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.970 
his team is trick room judging by the
clam<00:00:36.059> pearl<00:00:36.329> he<00:00:36.840> goes<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.200> megahorn<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
clam pearl he goes with megahorn and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.760 
clam pearl he goes with megahorn and
that<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:39.120> good<00:00:39.329> because<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.290> don't<00:00:40.649> have

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
that is not good because I don't have

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.220 
that is not good because I don't have
anything<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.370> take<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> megahorn<00:00:42.450> very

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
anything that can take a megahorn very

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.650 
anything that can take a megahorn very
well<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:43.920> team<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.910> team<00:00:45.180> was<00:00:45.329> mainly

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.850 
now and that's scared me because clamper
was<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> monster<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.290> actually<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.710> know

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
was a monster but that actually you know

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.170 
was a monster but that actually you know
anything<00:01:35.130> now<00:01:35.430> go<00:01:35.549> forth<00:01:35.579> under<00:01:35.939> bolt

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
anything now go forth under bolt

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.749 
anything now go forth under bolt
predicting<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.229> Clamperl<00:01:37.799> rotation<00:01:38.549> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
predicting that Clamperl rotation and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.700 
predicting that Clamperl rotation and
that<00:01:39.030> would<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.360> wonderful<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:40.259> now<00:01:40.680> I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that would be wonderful because now I

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.170 
that would be wonderful because now I
don't<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.250> worry<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.610> thing

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
don't have to worry about that thing

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.389 
don't have to worry about that thing
that<00:01:42.390> thing<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:43.079> beast<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:44.040> cannot

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that thing is beast you cannot

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.539 
that thing is beast you cannot
underestimate<00:01:44.850> clamp<00:01:45.600> roll<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:47.100> now<00:01:47.280> he's

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
underestimate clamp roll so now he's

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.819 
underestimate clamp roll so now he's

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
it doesn't really meant it does sort of

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.230 
it doesn't really meant it does sort of
matter<00:03:48.220> if<00:03:48.370> their<00:03:48.490> luck<00:03:48.640> Dover's<00:03:49.000> I<00:03:49.090> just

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
matter if their luck Dover's I just

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.560

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
realized so now I'm going to stay in um

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.860 
realized so now I'm going to stay in um
he's<00:03:52.570> gonna<00:03:52.780> set<00:03:53.140> up<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.650> nasty<00:03:54.610> plot<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:55.180> don't

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
he's gonna set up the nasty plot I don't

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.800 
he's gonna set up the nasty plot I don't
know<00:03:56.140> why<00:03:56.530> he<00:03:57.130> really<00:03:57.520> did<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:58.120> because<00:03:58.780> I

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
know why he really did that because I

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.530 
know why he really did that because I
could<00:03:59.140> probably<00:03:59.770> kill<00:04:00.310> him<00:04:00.340> with<00:04:00.760> my<00:04:00.790> latios

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
could probably kill him with my latios

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.280 
could probably kill him with my latios
and<00:04:01.570> my<00:04:02.260> shame<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:03.090> maybe<00:04:04.090> thought<00:04:04.960> that<00:04:05.260> I

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
and my shame and maybe thought that I

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.170 
and my shame and maybe thought that I
was<00:04:05.380> gonna<00:04:05.530> set<00:04:05.950> up<00:04:06.040> another<00:04:06.280> sub<00:04:06.700> but<00:04:06.910> even

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
was gonna set up another sub but even

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.840 
was gonna set up another sub but even
then<00:04:07.420> i<00:04:07.770> don't<00:04:08.770> know<00:04:08.890> i'm<00:04:09.100> not<00:04:09.280> sure<00:04:09.340> why<00:04:09.670> he

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
then i don't know i'm not sure why he

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.300 
then i don't know i'm not sure why he
nasty<00:04:10.090> pod<00:04:10.450> but<00:04:10.750> sticks<00:04:11.410> is<00:04:11.680> a<00:04:11.709> great<00:04:12.010> player

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
nasty pod but sticks is a great player

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.640 
nasty pod but sticks is a great player
so<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:13.150> don't<00:04:13.660> know<00:04:13.780> he<00:04:14.140> he<00:04:14.709> is<00:04:15.070> not<00:04:15.310> he

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
so I don't know he he is not he

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.180 
so I don't know he he is not he
he<00:04:17.220> had<00:04:17.430> his<00:04:17.609> reasons<00:04:17.639> most<00:04:18.329> likely<00:04:18.750> i<00:04:18.979> go<00:04:19.979> into

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190
