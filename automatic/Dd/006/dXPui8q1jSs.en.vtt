00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 when we fill a bladder she 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.059
 be loaded with a kind of power 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.639
 with energy and the release of energy 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.370
 so fast that we can only see 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.370
 with a special globe camera 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.410
 he arrives is nothing more than a lilac 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.780
 it is as if it were an elastic of a 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.300
 sling and all the classic on the hour in 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.030
 that we stretch and accumulate energy 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.640
 which is called elastic potential energy 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.280
 at the time when we let go of the rubber band 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.110
 releases energy in the form of motion to 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.430
 bladder when we fill it up 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.010
 also accumulates its potential energy 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.379
 elastic and at the time that we burst the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.260
 elastic back to its original position 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.360
 Only this back is so but so but so 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.989
 quickly that we had refrained from 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.239
 some kind of crap such as I 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.070
 I think it will come back much faster in 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.050
 time to burst than the talc will 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.030
 take time to spread 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.470
 it's hard to imagine take a look 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.470
 in this image slogan 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.490
 but I will not make an improvement on it 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.640
 just take a look now how the movement 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.700
 water is much slower than the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.910
 movement of the bladder laxative releasing 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.910
 this energy 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.990
 I know there's going to be a lot of people going to me. 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.540
 ask how useful a bladder is 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.940
 the bladder serves to make a mess online 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.660
 and you know that mess is one of the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.410
 great priorities in the world manual 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.570
 just take a look 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.570
 and every year 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.000
 Hi 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:29.739
 It was now aaa 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.879
 just so you know this quite hurt 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.150
 Bixiga in my face and I already said pro 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.549
 daniel going back and forth or at the time the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.470
 people watch these jokes pictures 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.359
 in purple we may have the impression 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.349
 that these cameras serve only to make 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.849
 these movie scenes these things mean 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.040
 playful but not quite like this 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.420
 if you have a machine for example in 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.299
 of anguish and this machine has 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.060
 several springs and if you want to know how the 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.340
 behavior of these balls but a way 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.289
 very slowly in order to analyze how it is 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.750
 that these pieces works, we can 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.300
 use a snow moncho camera and a 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.220
 The company that does this is links and 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.720
 Our slow-motion series, I'm going. 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.300
 leaving the language link 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.940
 here below leaving here two sides 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.639
 here too the video of soap bubbles 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.979
 River boat show that side of our video 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.490
 that explains how sound works in 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.490
 slow motion
