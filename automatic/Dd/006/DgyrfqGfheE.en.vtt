at you with another video from my

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.630 
at you with another video from my
fishroom<00:00:03.410> one<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.500> my<00:00:04.620> thirty<00:00:04.859> gallons<00:00:05.339> this

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
fishroom one of my thirty gallons this

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.190 
fishroom one of my thirty gallons this
is<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.879> brush<00:00:06.299> Rd<00:00:06.720> tank<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:08.660> this<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> tank

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
is a brush Rd tank and this is a tank

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.140 
is a brush Rd tank and this is a tank
that<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:11.780> just<00:00:12.780> started<00:00:13.460> for<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.549> fish

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
that I just just started for this fish

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.710 
that I just just started for this fish
about<00:00:15.599> three<00:00:16.320> days<00:00:16.470> ago<00:00:16.650> when<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.920> got<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.279> fish

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
about three days ago when I got the fish

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.330 
about three days ago when I got the fish
it's<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.869> tank<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.320> did<00:00:19.500> have<00:00:19.710> other<00:00:20.010> fish<00:00:20.310> in

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
it's a tank that did have other fish in

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.040 
it's a tank that did have other fish in
it<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.880> was<00:00:21.090> cycle<00:00:21.600> or<00:00:21.779> at<00:00:21.840> least<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
it so it was cycle or at least the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.929 
it so it was cycle or at least the
filter<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.560> because<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.039> removed<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.519> gravel

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
filter was because I removed the gravel

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.089 
filter was because I removed the gravel
with<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> pH<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.170> 6<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.519> fish<00:00:26.670> Rd<00:00:27.800> they<00:00:28.800> really

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
with a pH of 6 the fish Rd they really

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.189 
with a pH of 6 the fish Rd they really
wouldn't<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.490> well<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:30.150> such<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> low<00:00:30.539> pH<00:00:30.750> they

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
wouldn't do well with such a low pH they

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.610 
wouldn't do well with such a low pH they
are<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.529> Wake<00:00:32.099> Tech<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.430> Eagan<00:00:33.320> cichlid<00:00:34.320> that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
are and Wake Tech and Eagan cichlid that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.280 
are and Wake Tech and Eagan cichlid that
and<00:00:34.890> they<00:00:35.010> require<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> pH<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.510> somewhere

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
and they require a pH of somewhere

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.819 
and they require a pH of somewhere
around<00:00:37.350> 8<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.640> think<00:00:38.969> my<00:00:39.149> pH<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:40.550> 8.2<00:00:41.660> I

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
around 8 and I think my pH is 8.2 I

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.080 
around 8 and I think my pH is 8.2 I
added<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.239> aragonite<00:00:45.239> from<00:00:45.750> courtesy<00:00:46.320> and

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
added the aragonite from courtesy and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.670 
added the aragonite from courtesy and
that<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.390> did<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> good<00:00:48.989> job<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.530> bringing

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
that really did a good job of bringing

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.959 
that really did a good job of bringing
that<00:00:49.920> pH<00:00:50.309> up<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.930> also<00:00:51.930> added<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.489> bunch<00:00:53.850> of

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
that pH up I also added a bunch of

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.850 
that pH up I also added a bunch of
shells<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.600> bought<00:00:54.899> from<00:00:55.050> Michaels<00:00:55.590> which

which are nice and round

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.249 
which are nice and round
I<00:01:35.210> couldn't<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.630> because<00:01:36.960> obviously

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
I couldn't get at that because obviously

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.620 
I couldn't get at that because obviously
it's<00:01:37.619> wintertime<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.790> decided<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.509> this

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
it's wintertime so I decided to do this

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.109 
it's wintertime so I decided to do this
temporarily<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.680> give<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.070> fish<00:01:41.759> artis

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
temporarily just to give the fish artis

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.920 
temporarily just to give the fish artis
a<00:01:42.150> place<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.570> hide<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.890> know<00:01:44.009> hopefully

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
a place to hide and you know hopefully

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.180 
a place to hide and you know hopefully
get<00:01:45.930> them<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.770> agree

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
get them going here I agree

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.710 
get them going here I agree
like<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.580> breeding<00:01:47.850> colony<00:01:48.360> because

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
like to get a breeding colony because

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.180 
like to get a breeding colony because
I've<00:01:48.900> never<00:01:49.080> bred<00:01:49.410> them<00:01:49.560> before

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
I've never bred them before

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.580 
I've never bred them before
though<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:50.610> did<00:01:50.940> have<00:01:51.120> them<00:01:51.300> one<00:01:51.540> time<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.840> they

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
though I did have them one time and they

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.670 
though I did have them one time and they
didn't<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:52.980> well<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:53.400> 6.0<00:01:53.970> eh<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.930> I

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
didn't do well in a 6.0 eh I was like I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.380 
didn't do well in a 6.0 eh I was like I
figured<00:01:56.220> I'd<00:01:56.430> give<00:01:56.550> it<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> second<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.120> and<00:01:57.300> this

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
figured I'd give it a second go and this

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.100 
figured I'd give it a second go and this
time<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.690> do<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.960> right<00:01:59.450> you<00:02:00.450> know<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.720> tank<00:02:00.960> is

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
time I do it right you know this tank is

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.540 
time I do it right you know this tank is
being<00:02:01.230> filtered<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.010> knuckle<00:02:02.340> clear

use the curve or see aragonite work for

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.470 
use the curve or see aragonite work for
me<00:03:23.550> these<00:03:24.550> guys<00:03:24.790> are<00:03:24.970> doing<00:03:25.090> great
