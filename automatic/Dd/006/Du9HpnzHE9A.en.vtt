you<00:03:53.519> can<00:03:53.849> be<00:03:53.970> making<00:03:54.360> an<00:03:54.510> hour<00:03:54.660> with<00:03:55.500> this

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
you can be making an hour with this

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.540 
you can be making an hour with this
method<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.440> course<00:03:58.470> i<00:03:58.860> only<00:03:59.130> found<00:03:59.310> this

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
method so of course i only found this

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.330 
method so of course i only found this
for<00:03:59.849> half<00:04:00.090> an<00:04:00.269> hour<00:04:00.390> so<00:04:01.200> multiplying<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.280> by

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
for half an hour so multiplying that by

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.990 
for half an hour so multiplying that by
two<00:04:02.550> we<00:04:03.480> get<00:04:03.660> 1.3<00:04:04.410> k<00:04:04.680> which<00:04:05.280> actually<00:04:05.549> isn't

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
two we get 1.3 k which actually isn't

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.130 
two we get 1.3 k which actually isn't
too<00:04:06.239> bad<00:04:06.660> for<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.640> SAT<00:04:08.640> back<00:04:08.879> you<00:04:09.330> know<00:04:09.510> skit
