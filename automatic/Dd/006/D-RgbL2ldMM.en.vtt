00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
try to get into the smoke as quickly as

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.770 
try to get into the smoke as quickly as
you<00:03:40.930> possibly<00:03:40.960> can<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:42.580> see<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:42.940> get<00:03:43.180> really<00:03:43.450> up

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
you possibly can and see I get really up
