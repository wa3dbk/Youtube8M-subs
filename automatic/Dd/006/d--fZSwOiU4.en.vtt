00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:07.269
Do you have an image in your head of that
first Christmas 2000 years ago?

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:11.160
What kind of night it was.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.780
How the star looked that night.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.199
Was Jesus born in a cave? Or a barn? Or somewhere
else?

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.930
What's your image?

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.220
And perhaps even more important, what did
it sound like?

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.579
About that, the Bible is clear; it was quiet.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.890
Christmas morning was peaceful and still.
And those that visited the baby had an easy

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.930
time keeping their focus on the Christ child
because God's greatest gift was born outside

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.570
of town, away from the crowds.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.510
Quiet.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.010
Not so, for many of us. Christmas seems to
come in the middle.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.529
The middle of a long month. The middle of
the seemingly endless preparation, the middle

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:10.249
of the stress of it all.

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:12.659
Rarely peaceful and still.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.399
And just the other day I heard someone say, "I hate December. I feel like I don't have time to even think."

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.940
So this is what Christmas has become.

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:32.709
But this... is not Christmas.

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.060
It's just the middle.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.209
Christmas morning is coming. And that's when
it's easiest to recognize Jesus.

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:43.159
Hear Him... in the quiet.

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.959
Not in the malls or the shops. Not even in
our preparation.

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.520
Not in the middle.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.909
Jesus is born for us in spite of ourselves
and he's born in the quiet of our hearts where

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.950
faith grows best.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.950
He is present... in the middle. But he is
the beginning.

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.639
Merry Christmas from all of your friends at
Chuck Knows Church.
