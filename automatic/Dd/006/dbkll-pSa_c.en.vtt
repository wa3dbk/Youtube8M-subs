00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.110
 solar gains are only an energy 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.540
 natural and free of interest 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.420
 necessarily your customers take into account 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.460
 the imperatives of solar inputs for 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.449
 the site allows to make 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.449
 considerable savings 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.830
 let's see this together the contributions 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.170
 solar it's all of energy 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.939
 that brings us the sun as well 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.070
 by direct radiation only by 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.750
 indirect radiation it is 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.040
 essential to think about the contributions 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.410
 according to the season 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.329
 in winter you have to maximize your contributions 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.100
 solar that are free and which are 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.120
 so much energy not to be produced by 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.670
 the heating system 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.800
 for this the search for a surface 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.170
 glazed ceiling facing south east 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.690
 indispensable in new construction 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.800
 rt 2012 this is happening from conception 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.530
 architectural 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.239
 in addition in nine as in renovation 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.039
 the use of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.260
 joinery with a small proportion 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.730
 door frames and especially a glazing 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.280
 having the best coefficient of 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.400
 solar transmission this coefficient noted 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.010
 sw characterizes the glazing's ability to 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.570
 transmit solar energy was 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.640
 on the contrary solar gains 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.619
 should be minimized to avoid 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.810
 overheating there are many 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.960
 sun protection systems the blind 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.050
 integrated in the windows the blinds and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.590
 shutters the sun breezes and pergola 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.210
 or even the plant barriers 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.280
 all these systems more or less mobile 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.380
 is removable allow to guarantee a 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.480
 good level of summer comfort some 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.880
 domotized systems measures radiation 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.710
 solar and fits the degree of closure 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.920
 according to different data from 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.900
 temperatures from various probes 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.060
 in renovation even if the most complex 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.310
 to act at the location where 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.930
 opening dimensions the consideration 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.340
 solar gain is one of 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.170
 components to strengthen 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.740
 the energy efficiency of the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.740
 construction
