00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.480
 to say that it took quite a while to

 mount it but the instructions were clear 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.410
 very detailed, fortunately not 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.800
 it was a problem to mount it myself 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.480
 I was expecting a little bit bigger though 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.130
