 Hello everyone 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.990
 in this video I will show you how to move 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.979
 their repertoire 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:11.079
 documents 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.079
 in order to place them on a 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:16.560
 other than stage 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.589
 the operating system 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.829
 in addition I will see my 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.829
 a working track 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.929
 he just distributed or 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.080
 so the hand the disk was reserved for operating systems 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.329
 and the record can reserve it for the poorest 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.650
 8 here is to move the document directory 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.690
 and for them to make sure that they are no longer on him succeed on the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.250
 disk 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.280
 so for that she 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.230
 with the right mouse button 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.230

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.260
 woerth 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.750
 to move and documents 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.160
 if they moved 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.520
 the court believes keep a structure a little logical you can do a 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.280
 copy paste 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.750
 at the time of structure 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.360
 proposed by default 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.450
 I keep 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.760
 the documents I'm doing 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 so I select the most controversial 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.080
 then I click on displaced 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.050
 I would select it 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.700
 the hard drive 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.380
 on which I move the data 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.080
 it's missed 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.390
 megrahi behind the troop 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.930
 vehicle checks 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.580
 and she 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.580
 lyon - the default directory 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.130
 then the label I'm applied 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.730
 an elected 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.730
 monique the repertoire and would not be furniture created and destroyed 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.530

 in documents or Europeans by clicking yes he will move 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.580
 and you find the manipulation meal to make the audience laugh 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.329
 and conclude the operation carried out 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:14.849
 the blue disk 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.259
 find the directory 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.639
 and the document 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.239
 here it was placed at the same time 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.289
 the default interface of hillbilly music images 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.349
 so here it is for them 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.199
