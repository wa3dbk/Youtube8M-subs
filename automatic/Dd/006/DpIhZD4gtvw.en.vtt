come<00:02:20.160> out<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.490> let's<00:02:21.000> see<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:21.270> it's<00:02:21.390> doing

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
come out here let's see what it's doing

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:31.890 
come out here let's see what it's doing
on<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.870> racetrack

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.809 

the<00:02:32.319> Lamborghini<00:02:32.860> guy<00:02:33.040> Ono<00:02:33.310> has<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.550> lot<00:02:33.790> of

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
the Lamborghini guy Ono has a lot of

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.729 
the Lamborghini guy Ono has a lot of
low-end<00:02:34.360> torque<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:35.110> forces<00:02:35.379> you<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.620> be

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
low-end torque so it forces you to be

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.589 
low-end torque so it forces you to be
smooth<00:02:36.190> with<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.519> throttle<00:02:36.910> as<00:02:37.300> you're

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
smooth with the throttle as you're

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.589 
smooth with the throttle as you're
exiting<00:02:37.750> your<00:02:38.080> corner<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:39.160> way

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599
