00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 kill khedira with your head there you notice 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.490
 the moment he finishes when he finishes 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.490
 with the head 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.190
 Adriano can impact 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.570
 hits and the moment you reject and now 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.430
 that is khedira that is pulled said the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.910
 ball had not fixed and alvaro we have 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.910
 fixed many 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.010
 there is no repetition of this there is no no 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.019
 takes and could also apply what 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.790
 you have said that you said incumbent 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.770
 here you can also apply to see if 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.300
 may or may not be because you can not see 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.300
 practically nothing in the action 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.559
 in control it can not be expulsion 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.550
 also of the player of the second barÃ§a 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.550
 yellow from adriano 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:08.160
 it's okay to say answer 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.080
 but to see to see a frame for back and 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.350
 to see how we do to see demonstrating 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.860
 the TV back there is good 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.860
 very well 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.850
 if as it says that the ball is not 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.469
 portal of what he did in it but I face 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:35.479
 but I had not fixed this fixed play 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:37.740
 of for you is this something that either 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.560
 let's say not the good realization that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.909
 has improvised has slowed down and expanded 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.189
 the image in an instant in unequal to 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.189
 the comrades to me yes it seems to me penalty 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.590
 even though the player finishes off 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.600
 adriano head but loose leg 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.789
 in such a way that it knocks him down so he does not 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.520
 gives option to finish otherwise I 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.340
 I had not noticed the truth either 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.750
 the importance now that I 've seen it not 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.179
 I know that Adriano's right leg that 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.979
 he paints almost at the waist of the 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.130
 player who finishes juanje for you 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.420
 penalty 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.080
 clear penalty 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.080
 hear
