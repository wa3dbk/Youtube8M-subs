00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
experiment before if you would have

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.180 
experiment before if you would have
killed<00:02:38.810> them<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.440> would<00:02:39.590> not<00:02:39.709> have<00:02:39.830> been<00:02:40.010> able

to continue it due to the bug that bugs

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.750 
to continue it due to the bug that bugs
have<00:02:42.620> been<00:02:42.650> apparently<00:02:43.250> fixed<00:02:43.580> because<00:02:43.670> I

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
have been apparently fixed because I

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.570 
have been apparently fixed because I
tried<00:02:44.150> both<00:02:44.510> ways<00:02:44.840> now<00:02:45.470> let<00:02:45.980> me<00:02:46.100> show<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.340> what

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
tried both ways now let me show you what

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.400 
tried both ways now let me show you what
happens<00:02:46.970> when<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.209> kill<00:02:47.390> when<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.050> kill<00:02:48.260> the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
happens when you kill when you kill the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.890 
happens when you kill when you kill the
boss<00:02:48.590> instead<00:02:50.530> now<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.860> basically<00:02:52.760> saved<00:02:53.600> on

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
boss instead now I basically saved on

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.020 
boss instead now I basically saved on
