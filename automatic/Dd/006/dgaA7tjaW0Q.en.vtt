 Thank you very much for all of you 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.360
 your dear comments and e-mails the 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.220
 he sends me over facebook 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.830
 my e-mail account for a website 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.480
 or here the comments under youtube 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.430
 I am pleased about everyone 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.450
 and then I would like to join in 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.220
 Thank you that we the 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.510
 have already passed the thousand mark 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.340
 so I have so nice I have so 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.050
 really not expected and I'm glad 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.400
 Of course I'm crazy about that 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.559
 can you really imagine? 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.239
 so many thanks to her 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.980
 really gives me a lot of motivation 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.470
 that I turn the videos for you 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.239
 that's really fun so the videos too 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.729
 do so much for you if then 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.220
 positive feedback comes back then 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.350
 you know that I have a 25 kilo 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.360
 have concrete says once bought and I have 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.830
 still a little bit left over and 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.930
 I always wanted a peel 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.670
 make the dot pattern somehow 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.229
 then i have them in the shell 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.000
 to go looking for forward 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.620
 give me this point pattern in the 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.750
 conjure my concrete bowl 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.010
 but I have absolutely no puff cake 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.990
 Found so if you still have 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.270
 have found something then give me 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.920
 let me know where he got it 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.990
 I have now just a method 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.630
 I think about each individual 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.850
 can conjure patterns in my concrete bowl 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.010
 which is also very easy and what then 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.750
 Also, individually is for each 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.920
 shell extra there you can just do it 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.140
 what he likes 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.000
 and my cup looks like it now 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.070
 give them this dot pattern just like it does 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.600
 introduced me and how easy that is 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.070
 does that work i show you in 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.940
 this video I wish you ever 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.890
 very much fun 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.570
 we'll see you next time 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.570
 then let shield time 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.859
 I use for this project now 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.020
 here so that calls itself snow from the pen 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:09.080
 company you can also just from 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.660
 window color as a contour pencil next to 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.980
 it works the same way and that's what I mean 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.140
 now the pattern on mine 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.150
 plastic bowl i have so here now 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.959
 a very simple plastic bowls 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.959
 to load a euro 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:49.180
 the cheap and if I use the whole 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.650
 then had to paint on it and do it like that 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.470
 is how I would like to have it 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.820
 allow my bowl to dry 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.100
 of course I need two 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.780
 molds a larger a smaller one 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.600
 Here I have such a plastic bowl 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.840
 They found them as you can see 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.050
 I can for the grooved pattern has 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.970
 I once for a euro shop for sale 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.360
 bought just looked even have the 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.090
 quite often such beautiful bowls 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.070
 plastic so this disposable and 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.750
 then i have the peel here which i have 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.820
 already prepared as I have you 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.930
 already showed and that comes then 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.700
 purely inside 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.930
 Now all I have to do is stress 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.930
 stir and then it starts 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.320
 right 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.379
 sony 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:41.030
 is the profi and that that yes 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:44.180
 he donates with these 3d pencils 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.770
 stopped or remains the intro hang 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.630
 and you can just do it like that 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:53.290
 bit careful of pebbles heart 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.290
 just here 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.170
 that's like getting out 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.460
 and that's how the shell looks from the outside 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:14.939
 so that this fluted pattern and 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.939
 Inside 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.190
 i would like this dotted pattern 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.810
 I painted myself there is the edge 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.830
 of course it would be very very rough then 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:35.810
 I'll just come in again 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:40.070
 you wait until smooth 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:43.360
 It really is a couple of days so two 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.360
 three days hit by 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.639
 hmm
