00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
price goes up because we don't know how

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.130 
price goes up because we don't know how
far<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.239> go<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.780> don't<00:00:36.960> want

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
far this is going to go so we don't want

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.619 
far this is going to go so we don't want
to<00:00:37.200> get<00:00:37.290> out<00:00:37.469> all<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.800> once<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.300> take<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> lower

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
to get out all at once and take a lower

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.479 
to get out all at once and take a lower
price<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.170> reason<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.340> this

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
price the reason for it going up is this

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.520 
price the reason for it going up is this
favourites<00:00:42.030> being<00:00:42.270> very<00:00:42.570> heavily<00:00:42.960> backed<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
favourites being very heavily backed and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.459 
favourites being very heavily backed and
I'll<00:00:43.829> come<00:00:44.070> back<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.610> later<00:00:45.320> what<00:00:46.320> we've

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
I'll come back to that later what we've

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.740 
I'll come back to that later what we've
got<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.890> now<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.160> try<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.700> identify<00:00:47.789> where

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
got to do now is try and identify where

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.690 
got to do now is try and identify where
this<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.559> stop<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.489> watch

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
this is going to stop and we just watch

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.209 
this is going to stop and we just watch
that<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.600> favorite<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.860> second

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that the favorite and the second

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.889 
that the favorite and the second
favorite<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.730> starting<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.210> level<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.660> there

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
favorite is starting to level out there

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.600 
favorite is starting to level out there
so<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.199> appears<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:55.920> reached<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.370> top

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
so this appears to have reached the top

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.490 
so this appears to have reached the top
and<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.210> favorite<00:00:57.600> appears<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.289> reached

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and the favorite appears to have reached

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.110 
and the favorite appears to have reached
the<00:00:58.680> bottom<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> don't<00:00:59.550> think<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.000> going

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the bottom so I don't think it's going

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.580 
the bottom so I don't think it's going
to<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.359> any<00:01:00.570> higher<00:01:00.600> than<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.079> four<00:01:01.289> point

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
to go any higher than the four point

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.889 
to go any higher than the four point
