a finished copy so they probably put
page<00:06:07.940> numbers<00:06:08.270> in<00:06:08.680> but<00:06:09.680> that<00:06:09.830> just<00:06:09.860> bothers<00:06:10.219> me

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
page numbers in but that just bothers me

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.430 
page numbers in but that just bothers me
so<00:06:11.300> hopefully<00:06:11.479> I'll<00:06:11.719> get<00:06:11.840> to<00:06:11.900> that<00:06:11.990> one<00:06:12.229> and

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
so hopefully I'll get to that one and

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.890 
so hopefully I'll get to that one and
then<00:06:13.130> this<00:06:13.250> next<00:06:13.580> one<00:06:13.729> is<00:06:13.969> the<00:06:14.419> start<00:06:14.690> of<00:06:14.780> a

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900
