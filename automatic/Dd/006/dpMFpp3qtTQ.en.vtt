00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 there are two windows 7 also completely new 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.520
 window settings the recordings 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.670
 Show what that is exactly I have here 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.870
 two pages from the internet explorer as 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.520
 example taken 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.960
 that is, at the beginning i mean mine 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.590
 if I play two games here now 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.650
 have windows and then yes I can 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.010
 enlarge the window accordingly and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.960
 a functionality I but that itself 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.320
 that is, if I am here now 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.710
 get double fall and the top 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.250
 then pay attention to the edge of the screen 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.020
 then look down here then 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.110
 this will be automatically down to the bottom 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.800
 pulled down the entire screen 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.800
 height then the window is aligned 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.770
 the possibility that other windows if 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.090
 I put the window here in the left and 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.640
 afterwards also in the right area 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.400
 move then it takes a while but 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.220
 then I get it that way 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.880
 I over half of the screen that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.110
 window spread out get the same 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.490
 I can do this here with this one 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.189
 if I cover this 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.479
 then I have the corresponding with the 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.600
 made another window 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.740
 this is a very nice opportunity to 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.170
 compare programs 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.420
 compare files with each other 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.189
 from one application to the next 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.490
 copy that of course with interesting 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.710
 the widescreen monitors yes always 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.210
 have come further that one here the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.180
 attitude so that you have two 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.799
 applications can run in parallel 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.990
 next time I'm here again 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.350
 pull it down when I go up 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.570
 do if I window to the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.590
 so do not pull the upper edge 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.899
 to fall with the double 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.000
 I hold it on the title bar pressed 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.200
 then you can already see how it feels like that 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.490
 a frame over the complete 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.799
 screen opens 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.430
 and if I let go now I will 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.710
 in full screen and accordingly 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.640
 I then have the window in full screen 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.410
 displayed is the double click get 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.900
 I here the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.350
 a window is larger than one 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.730
 possibility is still one can still here 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.680
 open more programs if I have 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.550
 Now show how this window has 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.610
 then watch it already 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.660
 I opened many windows there 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.230
 maybe a bit of an overview 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.410
 lost 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.260
 then I can just go and 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.020
 this window would like to have 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.680
 So shake the title bar and then 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.180
 all windows are minimized except that 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.630
 Shaken and so I have one 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.460
 appropriate overview of my 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.910
 single window which I accordingly 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.180
 here's the whole race sure sheikh 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.110
 and can be used accordingly here 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.000
 one possibility is still europe 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.330
 and behind it hides the following 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.170
 here at the back of the taskbar I have 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.400
 Show this button desktop and me 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.700
 do not click but I just go 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.820
 only on this quite right falls here and 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.400
 then the desktop is displayed to me 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.709
 the advantage that with the view free 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.090
 on my gadgets about the 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.160
 performance more like to look at in 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.130
 my example or still on his 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.950
 hope and then you can do this here 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.480
 to be displayed for a short time 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.610
 when I go down from it again 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.130
 I get back to my application 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.370
 inside if i click this button behind 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.100
 then clique you up for the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.930
 desktop and can be here accordingly 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.930
 make applications
