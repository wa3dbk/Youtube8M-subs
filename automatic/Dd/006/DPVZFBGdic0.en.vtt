we did form a committee to work on the
uniform<00:01:24.470> guidance<00:01:24.770> stuff<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:26.150> when<00:01:26.390> we

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
uniform guidance stuff and when we

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.480 
uniform guidance stuff and when we
really<00:01:27.020> looked<00:01:27.350> at<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:27.650> whether<00:01:28.190> it<00:01:28.460> was

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
really looked at it whether it was

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.360 
really looked at it whether it was
supplies<00:01:29.180> or<00:01:29.810> whether<00:01:30.050> it<00:01:30.260> was<00:01:30.470> admin<00:01:31.070> time

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
supplies or whether it was admin time

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.740 
supplies or whether it was admin time
and<00:01:31.610> I've<00:01:31.670> gone<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.909> little<00:01:32.090> bit<00:01:32.270> out<00:01:32.420> of<00:01:32.450> order

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
and I've gone a little bit out of order

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.560 
and I've gone a little bit out of order
here<00:01:33.260> we<00:01:34.100> really<00:01:34.490> thought<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.270> bar

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
here we really thought that the bar

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.340 
here we really thought that the bar
though<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.990> set<00:01:36.229> on<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.530> uniform<00:01:37.100> I<00:01:37.400> mean

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
though the set on the uniform I mean

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.560 
though the set on the uniform I mean
University<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:38.920> Maryland<00:01:39.549> even<00:01:40.180> under<00:01:40.450> the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
University of Maryland even under the

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.080 
University of Maryland even under the
circulars<00:01:41.259> was<00:01:41.680> about<00:01:41.950> this<00:01:42.189> high<00:01:42.250> you<00:01:42.759> had<00:01:42.939> to

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
circulars was about this high you had to

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.390 
circulars was about this high you had to
show<00:01:43.360> that<00:01:43.720> it<00:01:43.900> was<00:01:44.020> necessary<00:01:44.619> reasonable

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
show that it was necessary reasonable

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.490 
show that it was necessary reasonable
and<00:01:45.790> all<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.299> stuff<00:01:46.509> so<00:01:46.720> really<00:01:47.049> when<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.320> came

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
and all the stuff so really when it came

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.789 
and all the stuff so really when it came
down<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:48.250> we<00:01:48.759> didn't<00:01:49.060> change<00:01:49.360> that<00:01:49.799> because

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
down to it we didn't change that because

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.289 
down to it we didn't change that because
we<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:52.030> interpret<00:01:52.659> it<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:53.020> same<00:01:53.290> way<00:01:53.590> look

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
we to interpret it the same way look

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.749 
we to interpret it the same way look
let's<00:01:55.299> be<00:01:55.390> honest<00:01:55.899> no<00:01:56.560> professor<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.369> cannot

have<00:01:58.000> an<00:01:58.119> air<00:01:58.360> Mac<00:01:58.780> because<00:01:59.289> it's<00:01:59.680> cool<00:02:00.869> but

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
have an air Mac because it's cool but

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.039

you<00:02:02.020> can't<00:02:02.320> have<00:02:02.590> any<00:02:02.710> air<00:02:02.979> Mac<00:02:03.330> if<00:02:04.330> you<00:02:04.630> need

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
you can't have any air Mac if you need

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.170 
you can't have any air Mac if you need
it<00:02:05.200> for<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.560> project<00:02:06.130> because<00:02:06.549> you<00:02:06.909> are

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
it for the project because you are

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.169 
it for the project because you are
slipping<00:02:07.750> through<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.229> cornfields<00:02:09.190> of<00:02:09.369> Idaho

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179

trying to read data from the skies okay
that's<00:02:15.040> what<00:02:15.430> it's<00:02:15.580> asking<00:02:15.819> us<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:16.330> prove<00:02:16.690> when

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
that's what it's asking us to prove when

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.140 
that's what it's asking us to prove when
is<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.780> thing<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:19.840> it's<00:02:20.560> cool<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.489> when<00:02:21.940> is

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
is it a thing that it's cool and when is

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.360 
is it a thing that it's cool and when is
it<00:02:22.180> because<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.780> really<00:02:23.290> needed<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.860> do<00:02:24.160> my

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
it because I really needed to do my

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.270 
it because I really needed to do my
research<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:26.500> threshold<00:02:26.800> for<00:02:27.220> us

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
research so that the threshold for us

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.120 
research so that the threshold for us
didn't<00:02:27.730> changed<00:02:28.300> but<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:28.900> will<00:02:29.200> tell<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:29.620> we

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
didn't changed but I will tell you we

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.039 
didn't changed but I will tell you we
have<00:02:30.160> activated<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:31.180> little<00:02:31.360> code<00:02:31.720> in<00:02:31.900> our

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
have activated a little code in our

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.340 
have activated a little code in our
system<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.890> say<00:02:33.760> hey<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.360> person's<00:02:35.080> allowed

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
system to say hey this person's allowed

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.620 
system to say hey this person's allowed
this<00:02:35.709> this<00:02:36.340> award<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.910> allowed<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.390> by<00:02:37.569> the

this this award is allowed this by the
person<00:02:38.200> because<00:02:39.100> later<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.549> we're<00:02:40.540> going<00:02:40.720> to

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
person because later on we're going to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.440 
person because later on we're going to
go<00:02:40.870> back<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.440> do<00:02:41.590> an<00:02:41.709> analysis<00:02:42.400> based<00:02:42.880> on<00:02:43.120> sub

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
go back to do an analysis based on sub

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.080 
go back to do an analysis based on sub
codes<00:02:43.780> if<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:44.739> code<00:02:44.980> needs<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.489> in<00:02:45.850> charge

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
codes if this code needs you in charge

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.940 
codes if this code needs you in charge
of<00:02:46.239> it<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.750> sub<00:02:47.019> code<00:02:47.230> has<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.500> greater

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
of it and this sub code has a greater

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.430 
of it and this sub code has a greater
than<00:02:48.040> zero<00:02:48.519> I<00:02:48.940> need<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.329> list<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.290> you

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
than zero I need a list of that so you

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.220 
than zero I need a list of that so you
can<00:02:50.590> start<00:02:50.799> asking<00:02:51.190> questions
