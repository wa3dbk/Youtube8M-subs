your<00:02:26.000> your<00:02:26.299> console<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.049> you'll<00:02:27.560> put<00:02:27.709> on<00:02:27.799> your

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
your your console and you'll put on your

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.080 
your your console and you'll put on your
movement<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.519> can<00:02:28.640> all<00:02:28.730> use<00:02:28.880> one

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
movement that you can all use one

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.479 
movement that you can all use one
movement<00:02:29.299> diaper<00:02:29.780> turn<00:02:30.049> so<00:02:30.890> for<00:02:31.070> example<00:02:31.100> if<00:02:31.400> i

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
movement diaper turn so for example if i

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.009 
movement diaper turn so for example if i
use<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:31.880> movement<00:02:32.090> down<00:02:32.390> here<00:02:32.630> i<00:02:32.660> can<00:02:32.930> move

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
use this movement down here i can move

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.080 
use this movement down here i can move
the<00:02:33.200> purple<00:02:33.530> my<00:02:33.829> purple<00:02:34.160> alien<00:02:34.430> twice<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.910> could

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
the purple my purple alien twice I could

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.729 
the purple my purple alien twice I could
use<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.420> green<00:02:35.600> and<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.930> orange<00:02:35.959> alien<00:02:36.350> once

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
use the green and the orange alien once

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.740 
use the green and the orange alien once
and<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:38.060> can<00:02:38.180> see<00:02:38.299> they<00:02:38.450> have<00:02:38.569> different

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
and you can see they have different

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.819 
and you can see they have different
movement<00:02:39.260> abilities<00:02:40.160> on<00:02:40.609> the<00:02:40.760> different<00:02:41.090> dice

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
movement abilities on the different dice

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.340 
movement abilities on the different dice
if<00:02:42.829> I<00:02:43.390> want<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.510> use<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> card<00:02:45.109> from<00:02:45.200> my<00:02:45.290> hand

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
if I want to use a card from my hand

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.020 
if I want to use a card from my hand
players<00:02:45.799> will<00:02:45.980> start<00:02:46.220> with<00:02:46.310> four<00:02:46.579> cards<00:02:46.910> in

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
players will start with four cards in

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.780 
players will start with four cards in
our<00:02:47.120> hand<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.600> use<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.230> card<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.799> need<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.489> use<00:02:49.760> a

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
our hand to use a card I need to use a

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.640 
our hand to use a card I need to use a
dye<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.120> is<00:02:50.510> equal<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:51.079> the<00:02:51.260> number<00:02:51.410> on<00:02:51.620> the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
dye that is equal to the number on the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.129 
dye that is equal to the number on the
card<00:02:51.739> or<00:02:52.160> higher<00:02:52.579> and<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.299> most<00:02:53.600> of<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.780> cards

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
card or higher and so most of the cards

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.410 
card or higher and so most of the cards
are<00:02:54.350> twos<00:02:55.160> threes<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.730> fours<00:02:55.940> but<00:02:56.150> there<00:02:56.299> are

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
are twos threes and fours but there are

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.530 
are twos threes and fours but there are
sixes<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.109> so<00:02:57.739> you<00:02:57.799> will<00:02:58.069> use<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.609> dye<00:02:59.209> and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
sixes and so you will use a dye and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.990 
sixes and so you will use a dye and
let's<00:03:00.380> say<00:03:00.470> for<00:03:00.650> example<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:01.220> use<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.670> purple

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
let's say for example I use the purple

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.059 
let's say for example I use the purple
dine<00:03:02.180> in<00:03:02.269> this<00:03:02.420> card<00:03:02.660> then<00:03:02.840> this<00:03:03.049> card<00:03:03.380> will

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
dine in this card then this card will

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.690 
dine in this card then this card will
work<00:03:04.150> with<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.390> particular<00:03:05.989> alien<00:03:06.500> now<00:03:07.310> aliens

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
work with a particular alien now aliens

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.900 
work with a particular alien now aliens
are<00:03:07.760> going<00:03:07.879> to<00:03:07.940> be<00:03:08.000> moving<00:03:08.150> around<00:03:08.510> on<00:03:08.690> the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
are going to be moving around on the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.800 
are going to be moving around on the
bored<00:03:09.090> like<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.420> said<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:11.420> when<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.450> moved

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
bored like I said and when I moved

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.290 
bored like I said and when I moved
through<00:03:12.990> different<00:03:13.320> doors<00:03:14.000> let's<00:03:15.000> say<00:03:15.120> the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
through different doors let's say the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.480 
through different doors let's say the
arm<00:03:15.480> Jillian<00:03:15.960> he<00:03:16.170> wants<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.530> all<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.130> aliens

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
arm Jillian he wants to all the aliens

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.640 
arm Jillian he wants to all the aliens
are<00:03:17.550> in<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:17.850> room<00:03:18.060> they<00:03:18.270> want<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.600> move<00:03:18.780> when

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
are in this room they want to move when

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.780 
are in this room they want to move when
no<00:03:19.830> one<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.040> move<00:03:20.310> through<00:03:20.490> this<00:03:20.580> door

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
no one can move through this door

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.950 
no one can move through this door
because<00:03:20.940> it's<00:03:21.150> red<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.420> none<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.840> these

because it's red and none of these

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.440 
because it's red and none of these
aliens<00:03:22.350> are<00:03:22.440> red<00:03:22.710> but<00:03:23.670> if<00:03:23.790> this<00:03:23.910> was<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.150> door

switch<00:04:01.890> spots<00:04:02.220> with<00:04:02.430> another<00:04:02.760> alien<00:04:03.270> you<00:04:03.930> can

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
switch spots with another alien you can

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.630 
switch spots with another alien you can
turn<00:04:04.200> them<00:04:04.350> 90<00:04:04.650> degrees<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.250> can<00:04:05.400> exchange

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
turn them 90 degrees you can exchange

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.060 
turn them 90 degrees you can exchange
two<00:04:06.120> tiles<00:04:06.420> this<00:04:07.140> just<00:04:07.440> lets<00:04:07.680> one<00:04:07.860> of<00:04:07.950> your

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
two tiles this just lets one of your

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.700 
two tiles this just lets one of your
aliens<00:04:08.430> move<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.060> as<00:04:09.780> your<00:04:10.020> aliens<00:04:10.410> move

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
aliens move and as your aliens move

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.850 
aliens move and as your aliens move
around<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.340> board<00:04:11.480> they<00:04:12.480> can<00:04:12.690> move<00:04:12.900> when<00:04:13.830> I

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
around the board they can move when I

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.650 
around the board they can move when I
spend<00:04:14.160> movement<00:04:14.490> points<00:04:14.640> they<00:04:14.880> can<00:04:15.030> also<00:04:15.180> step

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
spend movement points they can also step

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.810 
spend movement points they can also step
on<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.840> data<00:04:16.140> pad<00:04:16.440> which<00:04:17.100> is<00:04:17.280> on<00:04:17.400> most<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.700> the

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
on a data pad which is on most of the

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.670 
on a data pad which is on most of the
cars<00:04:18.000> when<00:04:18.209> they<00:04:18.270> step<00:04:18.450> on<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.630> data<00:04:18.870> pad<00:04:19.109> they

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
cars when they step on a data pad they

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.070 
cars when they step on a data pad they
will<00:04:19.950> draw<00:04:20.280> another<00:04:20.730> card<00:04:20.850> for<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.840> player

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
will draw another card for that player

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.409 
will draw another card for that player
so<00:04:22.920> basically<00:04:23.340> what<00:04:23.580> players<00:04:23.850> are<00:04:24.030> trying<00:04:24.300> to

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
so basically what players are trying to

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.760 
so basically what players are trying to
do<00:04:24.540> is<00:04:24.750> you're<00:04:24.840> trying<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.260> get<00:04:25.410> into<00:04:25.650> the

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
middle to go in and grab this now once a

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.270 
middle to go in and grab this now once a
player<00:04:29.340> grabs<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.419> Hat<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:30.960> power<00:04:31.680> or<00:04:32.220> the

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.780 
are then going to try to get back to
their<00:04:36.690> spaceship<00:04:37.260> now<00:04:37.890> they<00:04:38.100> are<00:04:38.220> able<00:04:38.430> to

the game that's to keep the game from
ending<00:05:06.150> in<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.300> long<00:05:06.800> tug-of-war<00:05:07.800> drawn-out

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
ending in a long tug-of-war drawn-out

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.300 
ending in a long tug-of-war drawn-out
battle<00:05:08.730> players<00:05:09.690> are<00:05:09.900> taking<00:05:10.080> it<00:05:10.500> away<00:05:10.890> from

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
battle players are taking it away from

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.430 
battle players are taking it away from
each<00:05:11.400> other<00:05:11.550> back<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:11.910> forth<00:05:12.180> so<00:05:13.020> basically

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
each other back and forth so basically

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.690 
each other back and forth so basically
the<00:05:13.560> game's<00:05:13.740> gonna<00:05:13.919> end<00:05:14.100> when<00:05:14.280> someone<00:05:14.550> gets

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
the game's gonna end when someone gets

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.120 
the game's gonna end when someone gets
the<00:05:15.000> gets<00:05:15.450> it<00:05:15.660> and<00:05:15.840> gets<00:05:16.290> back<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.710> ship<00:05:16.890> or

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
the gets it and gets back to the ship or

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.529 
the gets it and gets back to the ship or
when<00:05:17.370> they<00:05:17.490> get<00:05:17.640> it<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:17.880> steal<00:05:18.060> it<00:05:18.240> back<00:05:18.419> from

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
when they get it and steal it back from

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.719 
when they get it and steal it back from
each<00:05:18.690> other<00:05:18.870> two<00:05:19.169> times<00:05:19.470> and<00:05:19.770> that's<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.640> way

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
each other two times and that's the way

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.640 
each other two times and that's the way
the<00:05:20.850> game<00:05:20.880> works<00:05:21.210> so<00:05:21.450> each<00:05:21.660> turn<00:05:21.960> of<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.110> game

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
the game works so each turn of the game

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.550 
the game works so each turn of the game
you<00:05:23.610> can<00:05:23.850> reuse<00:05:24.030> one<00:05:24.330> move<00:05:24.540> die<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:25.080> then

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
you can reuse one move die and then

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.230 
you can reuse one move die and then
internal<00:05:25.919> then<00:05:26.070> you'll<00:05:26.190> use<00:05:26.370> you<00:05:26.850> can<00:05:26.970> use<00:05:27.030> up

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
internal then you'll use you can use up

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.990 
internal then you'll use you can use up
the<00:05:27.330> two<00:05:27.509> cards<00:05:27.960> with<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.889> dice<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.310> if<00:05:29.910> you

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
the two cards with the dice and if you

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.189 
the two cards with the dice and if you
don't<00:05:30.180> have<00:05:30.270> any<00:05:30.419> dice<00:05:30.570> you<00:05:30.690> can<00:05:30.810> use<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.110> can

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
don't have any dice you can use you can

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.450 
don't have any dice you can use you can
always<00:05:31.410> just<00:05:31.530> take<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.710> die<00:05:31.889> stick<00:05:32.190> it<00:05:32.310> there

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
always just take a die stick it there

the<00:05:55.830> game<00:05:56.130> works<00:05:56.610> although<00:05:57.000> I'll<00:05:57.270> tell<00:05:57.479> you

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
the game works although I'll tell you

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.980 
the game works although I'll tell you
it's<00:05:57.750> a<00:05:57.810> bit<00:05:58.020> of<00:05:58.229> a<00:05:59.030> bender<00:06:00.030> to<00:06:00.210> explain<00:06:00.750> some

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
it's a bit of a bender to explain some

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.560 
it's a bit of a bender to explain some
of<00:06:01.020> the<00:06:01.169> things<00:06:01.410> to<00:06:01.620> new<00:06:01.740> people<00:06:02.240> the<00:06:03.240> using

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
of the things to new people the using

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.260 
of the things to new people the using
the<00:06:03.660> dice<00:06:03.930> and<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:04.949> the<00:06:05.190> rules<00:06:05.520> probably

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
the dice and and the rules probably

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.790 
the dice and and the rules probably
could<00:06:06.449> have<00:06:06.479> been<00:06:06.660> laid<00:06:06.870> out<00:06:06.900> slightly<00:06:07.470> better

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
could have been laid out slightly better

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.400 
could have been laid out slightly better
buy<00:06:08.490> them<00:06:08.639> saying<00:06:08.970> you<00:06:09.180> can<00:06:09.449> only<00:06:09.720> do<00:06:10.139> this

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
buy them saying you can only do this

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.950 
buy them saying you can only do this
here<00:06:10.860> etc<00:06:10.979> but<00:06:11.669> the<00:06:12.330> concept<00:06:12.810> is<00:06:12.870> pretty

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
here etc but the concept is pretty

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.570 
here etc but the concept is pretty
simple<00:06:13.380> when<00:06:13.500> you<00:06:13.590> get<00:06:13.740> used<00:06:13.949> to<00:06:14.070> it<00:06:14.130> and<00:06:14.370> you

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
simple when you get used to it and you

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.339 
simple when you get used to it and you
can<00:06:14.789> do<00:06:14.970> some<00:06:15.000> pretty<00:06:15.300> quick<00:06:15.630> things<00:06:15.960> at<00:06:16.169> first

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
can do some pretty quick things at first

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.200 
can do some pretty quick things at first
like<00:06:16.530> la<00:06:16.740> I'm<00:06:17.280> gonna<00:06:17.580> be<00:06:17.669> moving<00:06:17.820> through<00:06:18.180> the
