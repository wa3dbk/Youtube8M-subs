00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.020
 the school according to the devil makes many 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.860
 years in some country of the world 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.800
 the devil made his appearance he brought a 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.280
 idea in the head and tried to convince 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.660
 to all the people his idea was to do 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:29.210
 a school but what would that school be like 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.939
 then it occurred to him to ask the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.570
 mothers of children how was it that their 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:39.030
 children behaved and they started to 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.559
 answer with great enthusiasm 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.559
 Children love nature 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:56.150
 then we will see closed advances 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:59.390
 it can not be that the tree is what 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.860
 I like they like to check that the 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.860
 activity is good for something 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.479
 I say the devil 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:22.240
 said another lady they like to move 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.240
 jump jumping running throwing a shit 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:39.940
 if they like to handle objects, use 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:44.320
 the hands commented one more or less 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:50.530
 they like to reason look for ways 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:53.229
 they like to talk about their food 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.250
 they like to investigate science said 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.870
 someone out there to actually care 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.210
 tripled 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.210
 but they also love to laugh 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.100
 and that's how the school of 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.800
 this way was like children 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.330
 they learned what they had never 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.880
 learned learned to cheat 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.120
 they learned to disguise they learned to 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.960
 lie you have to make sure that our 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.690
 tables have nothing to do with this but 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.010
 with a learning environment with 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.080
 bidirectional communication dyes 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.950
 shows of affection respect to the 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:50.950
 diversity reflection agreements and 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.950
 activity let's be the difference
