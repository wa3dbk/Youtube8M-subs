00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.300
 Hi, very good, this time I'm going to 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.180
 explain how to install 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.580
 the pro tractor and set it up so that 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.270
 work with audio card as 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.360
 such as audio 8 audio 4 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.640
 the facilities in both are 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.259
 exactly the same the only thing that changes 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.350
 the driver i have the cedec copied to 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.240
 a folder so you do not have to walk 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.400
 every time I have to install it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.400
 with zero over then let's say a 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.460
 my backup even the number 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.460
 Serial I copied it from the slip of paper 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.540
 it comes to you in the box I copied it in a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.020
 memo pad 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.780
 and someday if I get lost or any 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.290
 so I have it here as a copy of 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.890
 security 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:58.079
 then we copy all the data of the 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.360
 cde in a folder is optional 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.420
 and I say it's optional case 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:09.760
 and well we give the setup 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:14.200
 and the installation begins I recommend 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.870
 not have the usb of the card connected 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.240
 of audio since many times I tell myself 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:25.790
 many times they give error when having it 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.950
 previously hooked to the computer 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.740
 and once we start the installation it 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.630
 is blocked then I have already 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.420
 hustler and just remove it 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.300
 and this is a facility let's say it's going 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.450
 all right 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.080
 while you can put the rest of the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.070
 wiring to the dishes to the table we give 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.550
 to the next we accept we give next this 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.640
 we leave it as it is next 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:00.080
 Wherever you want I left it as it was 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.450
 comes next here good if you have the audio 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.670
 4 the audio 8 yo in this case I have the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.550
 8 audio so I'll choose this if 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.890
 you had the audio 4 you will have to choose 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.670
 this if you want to choose the 3 because 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.940
 you have a laptop and you go to a house or 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.470
 a kitten from a friend and he has 4 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.970
 and so as not to disconnect all the 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.550
 your sound card cables 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.800
 and you can install all three and so 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.990
 wherever you go, you are always going to have 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.960
 the driver installed if you would not have to 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.010
 take them with you in the drivers 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.350
 install them 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.330
 apart then well I in this case 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.920
 I'm going to install on 8 audio because 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.960
 It's the one that I have and I'm not going to move it 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.660
 from my site 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.330
 and well this is the new driver that 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.330
 He left a couple of years ago 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.350
 if you have it or if you want to have it 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.430
 install or if not also later more 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.829
 late can be installed quietly 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.829
 we give next and we give next 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.860
 now the same will install the tractor 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.950
 in this we have removed control to 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.230
 editor the audio 83 eto'o we do not have to 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.210
 give to these since it is this car 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.490
 installing everything 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.490
 it's like here it looks against the editor 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.439
 they are already adding 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.439
 on the desk 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.230
 It is recommended for a laptop 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.069
 I've tried on a lot of laptops 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.560
 very many in several laptops 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.499
 and people think that with many gigas of 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.840
 ram this program will go well but not 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:51.400
 it's like that for 4 gigas of ram that you have or 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.530
 for 8 gigs of boot has if you have 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.620
 a processor minimally 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.990
 it is case 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:04.680
 you will not do well for example 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:08.700
 with windows 7 with a processor to 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.220
 1300 which is not much but it is not very 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.040
 very little 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.460
 with 4 gigas of ram is not going well going to 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.460
 pulls 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.949
 If I had 2 GB, I think I would go 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.009
 exactly the same the only thing that needs 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.900
 speed not ram memory because the 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.819
 man consumes but when you're 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.810
 clicking you have everything turned off is also not 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:34.230
 have excess consumption 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.200
 well this is already 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.790
 then now we can connect the usb 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.790
 that I'm going to connect right now
