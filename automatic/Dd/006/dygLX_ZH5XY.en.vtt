00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hi I'm Charlie Lau jr. bat catch again

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.670 
hi I'm Charlie Lau jr. bat catch again
obviously<00:00:03.240> talking<00:00:03.870> about<00:00:04.080> hitting<00:00:04.259> but<00:00:04.500> this

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
obviously talking about hitting but this

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.490 
obviously talking about hitting but this
time<00:00:04.920> we<00:00:05.910> actually<00:00:06.089> have<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.390> girl<00:00:06.660> who<00:00:07.350> I've

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
time we actually have a girl who I've

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.600 
time we actually have a girl who I've
been<00:00:07.620> working<00:00:07.950> with<00:00:07.980> now<00:00:08.220> for<00:00:08.250> about<00:00:08.519> three

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
been working with now for about three

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.320 
been working with now for about three
weeks<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.500> it's<00:00:10.500> it's<00:00:11.429> kind<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.030> interesting

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
weeks and it's it's kind of interesting

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.029 
weeks and it's it's kind of interesting
because<00:00:13.790> many<00:00:14.790> softball<00:00:15.509> coaches<00:00:16.010> you<00:00:17.010> know

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
because many softball coaches you know

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.790 
because many softball coaches you know
right<00:00:17.910> now<00:00:18.119> girls<00:00:18.539> softball<00:00:18.810> maybe<00:00:19.289> even<00:00:19.560> you

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
right now girls softball maybe even you

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.500 
right now girls softball maybe even you
know<00:00:19.830> five<00:00:20.160> six<00:00:20.460> seven<00:00:20.699> years<00:00:20.820> ago<00:00:20.910> has<00:00:21.119> taken

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
know five six seven years ago has taken

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.429 
know five six seven years ago has taken
off<00:00:21.660> dramatically<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.970> you<00:00:23.970> know<00:00:24.439> basically

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
off dramatically and you know basically

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.580 
off dramatically and you know basically
the<00:00:26.340> coaches<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.420> I've<00:00:27.630> seen<00:00:27.960> or<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.439> I've

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the coaches that I've seen or that I've

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.919 
the coaches that I've seen or that I've
been<00:00:28.680> around<00:00:29.039> seem<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.060> think<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.630> swing

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
been around seem to think that the swing

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
been around seem to think that the swing
should<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.380> different<00:00:32.009> than<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> baseball

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
should be different than the baseball

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.889 
should be different than the baseball
swing<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.110> my<00:00:34.350> argument<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:35.780> you<00:00:36.780> know

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
swing and so my argument is you know

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.290 
swing and so my argument is you know
from<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.739> laws<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.219> physics<00:00:38.579> standpoint<00:00:38.790> as

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
from a laws of physics standpoint as

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.010 
from a laws of physics standpoint as
we're<00:00:39.510> generating<00:00:40.079> energy<00:00:40.950> into<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.730> swing<00:00:42.090> I

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
we're generating energy into the swing I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.900 
we're generating energy into the swing I
believe<00:00:43.920> strongly<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.520> should<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
believe strongly that it should be the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.900 
believe strongly that it should be the
same<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> baseball<00:00:45.660> swing<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.829> some<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
same as a baseball swing so some of the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.510 
same as a baseball swing so some of the
things<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.890> basically<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.070> Rachel

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
things that I see basically with Rachel

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.260 
things that I see basically with Rachel
when<00:00:51.090> she<00:00:51.300> showed<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.649> she<00:00:52.649> had<00:00:52.920> her<00:00:53.640> bat<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
when she showed up she had her bat a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.279 
when she showed up she had her bat a
little<00:00:54.690> too<00:00:54.989> far<00:00:55.320> forward<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:57.000> she<00:00:57.780> started

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
little too far forward so she started

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.229 
little too far forward so she started
here<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.250> too<00:00:59.489> far<00:00:59.730> away<00:00:59.820> from<00:01:00.149> her

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
here and a little too far away from her

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.270 
here and a little too far away from her
body<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.410> other<00:01:01.559> thing<00:01:01.800> she<00:01:01.829> had<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
body and the other thing she had was a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.609 
body and the other thing she had was a
vertical<00:01:02.879> bad<00:01:03.120> angle<00:01:03.510> which<00:01:03.780> makes<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.290> swing

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
vertical bad angle which makes the swing

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.490 
vertical bad angle which makes the swing
longer<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.729> she<00:01:06.510> would<00:01:06.659> start<00:01:06.930> from<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
longer so she would start from here and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.679 
longer so she would start from here and
then<00:01:07.760> automatically<00:01:08.760> take<00:01:08.970> her<00:01:09.090> hands<00:01:09.420> back

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
then automatically take her hands back

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.289 
then automatically take her hands back
to<00:01:09.930> here<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.250> reason<00:01:11.580> she<00:01:11.729> did<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.150> is

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
to here and the reason she did that is

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.210 
to here and the reason she did that is
because<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.900> feels<00:01:13.110> much<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.710> comfortable

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
because it feels much more comfortable

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.910 
because it feels much more comfortable
to<00:01:14.369> swing<00:01:14.580> from<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.720> that's<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:16.799> we

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
to swing from here so that's what we

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.710 
to swing from here so that's what we
want<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.520> don't<00:01:17.640> want<00:01:17.759> wasted<00:01:18.509> motion

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
want to do we don't want wasted motion

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.020 
want to do we don't want wasted motion
just<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.380> talked<00:01:19.680> before<00:01:19.820> till<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:20.939> were

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
just like we talked before till we were

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.140 
just like we talked before till we were
blue<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> face<00:01:21.659> about<00:01:22.400> you<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.520> wasting

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
blue in the face about you know wasting

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.539 
blue in the face about you know wasting
motion<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:24.780> don't<00:01:24.930> want<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.200> do<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.619> okay<00:01:25.890> so

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
motion we don't want to do that okay so

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.310 
motion we don't want to do that okay so
that<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> things<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.810> did<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that was one of the things we did the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.140 
that was one of the things we did the
other<00:01:28.500> thing<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.950> noticed<00:01:29.369> about<00:01:29.490> Rachel

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
other thing that I noticed about Rachel

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.280 
other thing that I noticed about Rachel
was<00:01:30.869> she<00:01:31.079> swung<00:01:31.409> really<00:01:32.070> too<00:01:32.790> hard<00:01:33.049> and<00:01:34.049> she

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
was she swung really too hard and she

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.980 
was she swung really too hard and she
couldn't<00:01:34.530> stay<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> ball<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:36.570> basically

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
couldn't stay on the ball so basically

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.200 
couldn't stay on the ball so basically
you<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:37.950> try<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.430> her<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.729> fluid

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
you know we try to get her more fluid

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.539 
you know we try to get her more fluid
and<00:01:39.869> I'll<00:01:40.590> show<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> little<00:01:41.310> while

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
and I'll show you in a little while

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.550 
and I'll show you in a little while
we'll<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:41.909> some<00:01:42.119> drills<00:01:42.420> with<00:01:42.600> her<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
we'll do some drills with her and the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.990 
we'll do some drills with her and the
other<00:01:43.680> thing<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.040> saw<00:01:44.280> which<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.729> very<00:01:45.710> common

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
other thing we saw which is very common

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.789 
other thing we saw which is very common
commonly<00:01:48.000> taught<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.320> girls<00:01:49.590> softball

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
commonly taught in the girls softball

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.670 
commonly taught in the girls softball
swing<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.520> they<00:01:51.450> basically<00:01:51.630> turn<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.560> their

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
swing is they basically turn on their

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.730 
swing is they basically turn on their
back<00:01:52.860> foot<00:01:53.159> which<00:01:53.820> causes<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.990> hips<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
back foot which causes the hips and the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.880 
back foot which causes the hips and the
shoulders<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.460> open<00:01:56.759> up<00:01:56.850> prematurely<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.259> that

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
shoulders to open up prematurely so that

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.190 
shoulders to open up prematurely so that
doesn't<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.549> that<00:02:00.090> basically<00:02:00.780> keeps<00:02:01.020> us

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
doesn't that that basically keeps us

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.069 
doesn't that that basically keeps us
from<00:02:01.380> from<00:02:01.680> staying<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.509> hitting<00:02:03.750> zone

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
from from staying in in the hitting zone

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.410 
from from staying in in the hitting zone
for<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> long<00:02:04.649> time<00:02:04.950> staying<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.969> ball<00:02:06.240> for

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
for a long time staying on the ball for

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.770 
for a long time staying on the ball for
a<00:02:06.509> long<00:02:06.630> time<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:08.220> don't<00:02:08.459> see<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.179> whole<00:02:09.509> lot

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
a long time and we don't see a whole lot

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.050 
a long time and we don't see a whole lot
of<00:02:10.140> backspin<00:02:10.649> with<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.950> ball<00:02:11.160> carrying<00:02:11.640> you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
of backspin with the ball carrying you

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.790 
of backspin with the ball carrying you
know<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.270> right<00:02:12.450> center<00:02:12.810> or<00:02:12.930> left<00:02:13.140> center

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
know the right center or left center

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.650 
know the right center or left center
simply<00:02:14.070> because<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.460> swing<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.940> rushed<00:02:15.330> and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
simply because the swing is rushed and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.470 
simply because the swing is rushed and
instead<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.620> starting<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.610> stride<00:02:17.910> earlier

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
instead of starting to stride earlier

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.080 
instead of starting to stride earlier
where<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:19.680> more<00:02:19.980> reaction<00:02:20.610> time<00:02:20.820> and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
where you have more reaction time and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.550 
where you have more reaction time and
you<00:02:21.570> don't<00:02:21.690> interrupt<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> natural

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
you don't interrupt the natural

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.160 
you don't interrupt the natural
sequences<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.580> swing<00:02:23.960> I've<00:02:24.960> heard

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
sequences of the swing I've heard

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.900 
sequences of the swing I've heard
coaches<00:02:25.380> say<00:02:25.680> swing<00:02:26.190> faster<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.240> that<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.990> me

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
coaches say swing faster and that to me

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.280 
coaches say swing faster and that to me
doesn't<00:02:29.910> make<00:02:30.150> any<00:02:30.360> sense<00:02:30.660> we<00:02:30.900> have<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.110> we

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
doesn't make any sense we have to we

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.720 
doesn't make any sense we have to we
have<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.440> have<00:02:31.590> time<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.040> take<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> good<00:02:32.400> swing

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
have to have time to take a good swing

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.900 
have to have time to take a good swing
so<00:02:33.420> now<00:02:33.870> we're<00:02:34.020> going<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.230> get<00:02:34.350> into<00:02:34.760> what<00:02:35.760> we

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
so now we're going to get into what we

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.280 
so now we're going to get into what we
did<00:02:36.120> for<00:02:36.300> Rachel<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.750> straighten<00:02:37.170> out<00:02:37.260> our

swing and and and we're going to take

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.250 
swing and and and we're going to take
