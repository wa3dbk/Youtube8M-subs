here<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.599> see<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:30.929> spinning<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.470> this

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
here you can see it's spinning and this

here you can see it's spinning and this
is<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> tropical<00:00:33.420> depression<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
decided to call it one yet but that will

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.040 
decided to call it one yet but that will
happen<00:00:38.309> pretty<00:00:38.730> soon<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.329> imagine<00:00:39.450> probably

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
happen pretty soon I imagine probably

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.520 
happen pretty soon I imagine probably
later<00:00:40.530> today<00:00:41.120> but<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.540> struggling

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
later today but this is struggling

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.310 
later today but this is struggling
already<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.460> said<00:00:45.450> yesterday<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.989> think<00:00:46.200> it

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
already I said yesterday that I think it

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.690 
already I said yesterday that I think it
will<00:00:46.410> organize<00:00:46.800> pretty<00:00:47.070> nicely<00:00:47.280> over<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
will organize pretty nicely over the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.860 
will organize pretty nicely over the
next<00:00:47.879> couple<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.210> days<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.510> then<00:00:48.629> when<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
next couple of days and then when it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.080 
next couple of days and then when it
gets<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.559> struggle<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.879> struggle

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
gets in here will struggle the struggle

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.819 
gets in here will struggle the struggle
seem<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.690> already<00:00:51.989> beginning<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.590> little

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
seem to be already beginning a little

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.650 
seem to be already beginning a little
bit<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.100> notice<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.360> said<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
bit you notice that as I said the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.959 
bit you notice that as I said the
convection<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.260> weaker<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.789> this

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
convection is weaker and do we have this

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.750 
convection is weaker and do we have this
burst<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.750> dry<00:00:58.020> tradewinds<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.949> burst<00:00:59.609> of

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
burst of dry tradewinds a burst of

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.430

atlantic<00:01:01.890> already<00:01:02.520> seems<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.969> be<00:01:03.120> messing

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
atlantic already seems to be messing

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.450 
atlantic already seems to be messing
with<00:01:03.600> these<00:01:04.170> thunderstorms<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.010> preventing

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
with these thunderstorms and preventing

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.539 
with these thunderstorms and preventing
them<00:01:05.610> from<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.479> strongly<00:01:07.040> now<00:01:08.040> one

interesting<00:01:08.700> feature<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.600> see<00:01:09.720> on

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
interesting feature that we can see on

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.070 
interesting feature that we can see on
satellite<00:01:10.290> analysis<00:01:10.799> today<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.600> see

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
satellite analysis today is that you see

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.990 
satellite analysis today is that you see
this<00:01:13.229> big<00:01:13.439> arcing<00:01:13.920> band<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.310> cloud<00:01:14.610> here<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
this big arcing band of cloud here and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.330 
this big arcing band of cloud here and
this<00:01:15.060> tells<00:01:15.299> us<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.630> lot<00:01:15.659> about<00:01:15.920> what<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> pros

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
this tells us a lot about what the pros

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.980 
this tells us a lot about what the pros
and<00:01:17.369> cons<00:01:17.790> are<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> environment<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and cons are for the environment of the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
and cons are for the environment of the
system<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.790> art<00:01:21.030> cloud<00:01:21.270> is

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
system right now and this art cloud is

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
system right now and this art cloud is
the<00:01:21.479> classic<00:01:21.990> signature<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> trade<00:01:22.979> wind

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the classic signature of a trade wind

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.789 
the classic signature of a trade wind
bursts<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.930> means<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> winds

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
bursts and that means that the winds

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.350 
bursts and that means that the winds
coming<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> eastern<00:01:26.820> side<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.060> this

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
coming in on the eastern side of this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.810 
coming in on the eastern side of this
arc<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.900> moving<00:01:28.590> faster<00:01:29.070> than<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.310> winds<00:01:29.670> on

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
arc are moving faster than the winds on

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.219 
arc are moving faster than the winds on
the<00:01:29.939> other<00:01:30.119> side<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:31.110> this

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the other side of it so you have this

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
the other side of it so you have this
burst<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.740> wind<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.579> piling<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
burst of wind that is piling up and

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.030 
burst of wind that is piling up and
causing<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.810> arcing<00:01:34.229> cloud<00:01:34.470> now<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.799> tells

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
causing this arcing cloud now this tells

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
approaching the Lesser Antilles and then

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.349

the Caribbean as it makes it into this

high<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.060> develop<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.690> loft<00:04:14.900> which<00:04:15.079> is<00:04:15.200> what<00:04:15.350> you

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
high to develop a loft which is what you

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.469 
high to develop a loft which is what you
want<00:04:15.680> over<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.010> system<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:16.669> we<00:04:17.269> have<00:04:17.359> this

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
want over a system and we have this

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.940 
want over a system and we have this

trough over the eastern United States
which<00:04:19.160> would<00:04:19.340> likely<00:04:19.519> caused<00:04:19.850> this<00:04:20.030> to

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
which would likely caused this to

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.000 
which would likely caused this to
recurve<00:04:20.600> but<00:04:20.840> it's<00:04:20.959> also<00:04:21.139> a<00:04:21.289> favorable

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
recurve but it's also a favorable

pattern for intensification because you

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.050 
pattern for intensification because you

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
can really get that upper-level outflow

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.800 
can really get that upper-level outflow
to<00:04:26.240> expand

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
to expand

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.810

stable<00:04:49.910> this<00:04:50.030> air<00:04:50.300> mass<00:04:50.540> even<00:04:51.260> north<00:04:51.440> of<00:04:51.560> the

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
stable this air mass even north of the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.960 
stable this air mass even north of the
Caribbean<00:04:51.950> where<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.160> waters<00:04:52.460> are<00:04:52.580> warm<00:04:52.820> we

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
Caribbean where the waters are warm we

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.670 
Caribbean where the waters are warm we
know<00:04:53.120> it's<00:04:53.300> stable<00:04:53.780> here<00:04:54.080> because<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.500> water

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
know it's stable here because the water

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.440 
know it's stable here because the water
is<00:04:54.800> cooler<00:04:55.130> than<00:04:55.400> normal<00:04:55.430> and<00:04:56.150> we<00:04:56.270> have<00:04:56.360> this

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
is cooler than normal and we have this

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.180 
is cooler than normal and we have this
dry<00:04:56.780> trade<00:04:57.139> wind<00:04:57.350> bursts<00:04:57.590> coming<00:04:57.950> across

dry trade wind bursts coming across

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.219 
dry trade wind bursts coming across
north<00:04:58.580> of<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:58.820> system<00:04:59.180> so<00:04:59.360> I<00:04:59.389> expect<00:04:59.870> it<00:05:00.020> to

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
north of the system so I expect it to

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.200 
north of the system so I expect it to
struggle<00:05:01.040> in<00:05:01.130> here<00:05:01.370> but<00:05:01.520> even<00:05:01.790> north<00:05:02.000> of<00:05:02.150> the

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
struggle in here but even north of the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.879 
struggle in here but even north of the
Caribbean<00:05:02.660> perhaps<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.229> atmosphere<00:05:03.710> will

but there are a few days to iron out the

tropical storm warnings will be

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.230 
tropical storm warnings will be
needed<00:06:40.289> for<00:06:40.469> those<00:06:40.590> folks<00:06:40.830> in<00:06:41.069> there<00:06:41.249> and<00:06:41.430> then

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
needed for those folks in there and then

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.959 
needed for those folks in there and then
by<00:06:42.419> the<00:06:42.449> time<00:06:42.569> it<00:06:42.810> gets<00:06:42.900> past<00:06:43.169> the<00:06:43.319> islands<00:06:43.710> and

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:43.969 
by the time it gets past the islands and

by the time it gets past the islands and
southwest<00:06:44.969> of<00:06:45.060> bermuda<00:06:45.120> northeast<00:06:45.780> of<00:06:45.870> the

southwest of bermuda northeast of the
bahamas<00:06:46.409> in<00:06:46.560> here<00:06:46.770> i<00:06:46.919> think<00:06:47.159> it<00:06:47.400> still<00:06:47.580> may

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
bahamas in here i think it still may

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.239 
bahamas in here i think it still may
have<00:06:47.909> a<00:06:47.939> chance<00:06:48.300> to<00:06:48.719> strengthen<00:06:49.229> further<00:06:49.529> but

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:50.249 
have a chance to strengthen further but

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:52.909 
have a chance to strengthen further but
there<00:06:50.639> are<00:06:50.669> some<00:06:51.120> reasons<00:06:51.539> to<00:06:52.139> doubt<00:06:52.349> it<00:06:52.409> the

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
there are some reasons to doubt it the

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:54.950 
there are some reasons to doubt it the
models<00:06:53.219> are<00:06:53.340> less<00:06:53.639> aggressive<00:06:54.240> today<00:06:54.449> so<00:06:54.629> we

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
models are less aggressive today so we

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.869 
models are less aggressive today so we
will<00:06:55.110> see<00:06:55.499> the<00:06:56.069> Atlantic<00:06:56.430> is<00:06:56.550> not<00:06:56.699> very

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 
will see the Atlantic is not very

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.149 
will see the Atlantic is not very
favorable<00:06:57.419> this<00:06:57.569> year<00:06:57.810> in<00:06:57.960> general<00:06:58.469> and<00:06:58.680> this

00:06:59.149 --> 00:06:59.159 
favorable this year in general and this

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:02.540 
favorable this year in general and this
storm<00:06:59.460> may<00:07:00.210> struggle<00:07:00.599> like<00:07:01.020> many<00:07:01.289> others<00:07:01.620> but

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
storm may struggle like many others but

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.950 
storm may struggle like many others but
we<00:07:02.580> shall<00:07:02.819> see<00:07:03.060> all<00:07:03.389> right<00:07:03.509> that's<00:07:03.629> it<00:07:03.779> for

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
we shall see all right that's it for

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.770 
we shall see all right that's it for
