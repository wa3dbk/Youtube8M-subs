00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.100
 it often happens that I am asked 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.020
 of the questions with respect to the changes of 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.210
 season and the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.810
 occasionally takes over in 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.550
 autumn or spring is almost normal 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.740
 a bit because there is the return maybe 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.410
 autumn from the holidays and then the body 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.119
 it is a little more difficult to get used to one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.070
 temperature that differs from a climate 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.320
 different to the days that are a little bit 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.820
 less long and therefore a little less light e 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.400
 even in spring, however, to go 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.930
 forward to summer then exit from 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.150
 this winter brings the organism to a 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.739
 more work so I often come 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.630
 asked how to best manage 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.880
 best deal at what level 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.980
 physical these moments that requires a 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.670
 greater energy commitment than ours 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.940
 body 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.120
 the advice I can give for both 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.600
 the seasons are more or less similar in 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.210
 actually the main thing is a first 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.100
 place drink so much water drink so much water 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.170
 right from the start just in the morning 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.330
 wake up I always recommend a little bit of 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.490
 warm lukewarm water maybe with one 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.590
 lemon juice lemon splash o 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.080
 than with half a lemon juice 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.090
 just to better reactivate all of them 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.100
 the functionality of our body e 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.140
 leave at the best of another day 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.810
 It is also important to make a beautiful one 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 breakfast though not the classic 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.770
 croissant and cappuccino bar breakfast 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.380
 because this way we are still struggling with 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.149
 more our our body than instead 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.800
 engaged in the daily work of 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.590
 clean-up cleaning to keep us 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.849
 it will become healthy and vital arches and therefore it is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.649
 important to do a coloring too 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.720
 that feeds us and changes of season 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.179
 even more important than that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.530
 we must somehow facilitate the 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.420
 our organism 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.970
 in being more active and alert 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.069
 possible at these times when 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.640
 instead it is more tired so we can 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.869
 best support with food 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.880
 as I said a lot of water 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.709
 because the water does 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.030
 fluidize energy flows into 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.090
 our body our body is composed 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.850
 75 percent 80 percent water per 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.600
 which flows energy in a different way if 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.640
 there is 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.480
 knows what our body is and 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.850
 support it with foods that can 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.709
 help him all his functions that give 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.420
 energy rather than taking it off because 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.400
 I often ate foods that I did 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.890
 reality weighs down rather than 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.470
 lighten up then eat a lot 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.480
 fruits and vegetables then also in the morning 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.250
 if we don't want it if we 're not hungry it 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.060
 we want to weigh ourselves down even eating 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.420
 of eating fruit eating honey 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.360
 and eating foodstuffs 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.700
 that give energy to the body stop then 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.030
 start supporting it give energy 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.519
 through food through 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.830
 live and raw foods I recommend 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.319
 washing as much as possible live foods e 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.880
 raw that give life energy 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.319
 from the food passes directly 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.910
 to the body of the person then 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.160
 always start lunch and dinner with one 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.019
 beautiful salad with a beauty born or 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.810
 entrepreneurial fruit vegetables in 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.790
 seasonal pinzimonio or even fruit e 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.280
 I always advise you to avoid fruit 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.560
 fine paschi so as not to weigh down yet 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.840
 more then start a meal so that 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.160
 we help the body manage better 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.739
 these changes in winter change 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.980
 of the autumn season council of 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.290
 eat more hot soups to help the 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.480
 fire of which our body in that 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.760
 moment needs while summer is 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.510
 spring the passage between true firsts 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.730
 instead you were seeing more raw foods seen 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.459
 prefer more raw like 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.040
 general indications can be helped 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.720
 there are also supplements 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.579
 of supplements that are actually 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.330
 natural that one finds of nature them 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.860
 we find 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.620
 what pollen may be 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.350
 royal jelly that only help us support 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.480
 of a food that one finds that one finds 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.430
 easily and that helps a lot 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.460
 our body because rich in rich 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.770
 of amino acid mineral salts and just there 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.840
 support give us strength 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.100
 then the advice I can give you 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.140
 part of the power supply maybe 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.000
 use both pollen here for 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.420
 real in these phases of passage of 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.420
 exchange
