00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:09.470
 and if you 're not bad, yes 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.470
 and it goes 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.990
 giving 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.990
 yes 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.079
 hello girls and guys welcome one day 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.699
 more in today's video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.860
 to do a hairstyle and how could you 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.350
 see in the title and in the photo of the video 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.719
 it is this braid that you see here this braid 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.030
 I saw it for interest and the truth is that in 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.890
 how much I saw her I fell in love so I thought 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.199
 I have to recreate it on my channel to 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.899
 you liked me not only because I 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.449
 it looks very pretty very romantic and I do not know 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.390
 different but also because it is also 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.370
 very very easy to make believe me that 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.890
 when I say very easy it is that it is very 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.500
 easy it's just about making a 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.509
 braid inside another braid so if 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.090
 You know how to make a three-strand braid 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.369
 classic braid of all life you know 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.750
 make this braid sure that's why I do not 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.550
 I'm going to roll more if you want to see the 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.890
 tutorial and learn how to make this braid 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.600
 you'll be fine let's start with the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.670
 tutorial for this hairstyle we are going to 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.490
 need very little things we are going to 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.409
 need a normal rubber of the color of 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.200
 our hair and also a gummy 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.969
 these little ones in the figures 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.890
 I look like I've put my hair 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.110
 hair extensions but in reality 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.520
 I just put a strip here not for 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.840
 give me length because in reality 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.369
 I already have very long hair but yes 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.750
 to give me a little bit of volume 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.729
 because I like this braid that is 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.829
 very fat and with volume I think there are 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.950
 the most beautiful extensions that I have 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.240
 they are beat and fashion and they are number 6 os 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.740
 I'm going to leave the data of these 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.819
 hair extensions in case 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.140
 interest here in the box 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.360
 information and what we are going to do 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.689
 it is simply to start unraveling the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.689
 hair 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.310
 you can choose which side you want the 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.899
 Braid me how I wear the line here 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.209
 I'm going to do it to my left side 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.390
 so we pull all the hair towards 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.640
 behind 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.200
 and we are going to take a lock of the part of 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.390
 down here that we only have hair 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.280
 longer is to say the longest layer of 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.280
 hair we will take a lock 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.040
 more or less like that it does not need to be 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.810
 too thick and we're going to start 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.390
 do it 30 years so it does not bother me 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.670
 I'm going to put the hair like that the other side 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.160
 let's divide the braid into three 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.160
 approximately equal sections 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.560
 and let's start making the braid 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.560
 classical 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.680
 when we come to the end we will hold 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.680
 the braid with the gomita of the girls 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.390
 already this braid although to me now I 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.040
 like you know how to release it a little bit 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.520
 by the thieves so there is a 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.870
 little bit wider 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.330
 it looks prettier 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.390
 it's not so tight and we're going to start 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.030
 to make the braid the big braid for 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.069
 we are simply going to divide the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.180
 remaining hair in two sections 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.170
 same 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.709
 1 and 2 are the same and let's start 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.709
 make the braid 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.629
 the classic when we come to the end 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:03.599
 let's take the three strands 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.599
 we put them together and put the rubber 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.400
 the braid would be there but again we go 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.350
 to drop a little strands for 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.710
 make it a little wider and with more 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.710
 pretty 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.500
 and it gives a different effect 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.220
 and the braid would already be just 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.580
 a small braid inside another braid 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.580
 big 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.020
