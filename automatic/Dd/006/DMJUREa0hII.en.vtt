WWE don't necessarily know either so
that's<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.979> scary<00:01:56.310> thing<00:01:56.670> regarding<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.329> so

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
that's a scary thing regarding this so

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.480 
that's a scary thing regarding this so
guys<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.409> think<00:01:58.649> happened<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> Layla

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
guys what do you think happened to Layla

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.580 
guys what do you think happened to Layla
is<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> injury<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.780> she<00:02:00.930> not<00:02:01.079> cleared

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
is it the injury is she not cleared

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.310 
is it the injury is she not cleared
that's<00:02:01.829> probably<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.610> best<00:02:02.790> bet<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.149> say<00:02:03.600> that

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
that's probably the best bet to say that

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.889 
that's probably the best bet to say that
Layla<00:02:04.619> has<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:05.159> been<00:02:05.369> cleared<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.790> return<00:02:06.390> to

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
Layla has not been cleared to return to

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.650 
Layla has not been cleared to return to
the<00:02:07.200> ring<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.910> hopefully<00:02:08.910> we<00:02:09.090> will<00:02:09.270> see<00:02:09.300> her

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
the ring and hopefully we will see her
