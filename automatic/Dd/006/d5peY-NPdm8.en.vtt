00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 Hmm 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.080
 the dragons magnificent creatures whose 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.900

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.450

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.850
 these creatures are very expensive today 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.570
 almost extinct but it was not always 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.690
 like this 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.040
 in ancient times dragons existed in 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.140
 abundance 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.809
 which was a big problem because everything 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.150
 that they wanted was to destroy eliminate 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.100

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.950
 it was during this time that the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.630
 first dragons hunters 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.420
 fearless warriors with experience of 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.480
 unimaginable combat that many times 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.149
 sought redemption or revenge in their 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.309
 search for insatiable dragons 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.969
 were the largest and best known 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.520
 Dragon Hunter Your Armor Made 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.350
 to withstand the strongest winds and 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.890
 his sword to pierce the most 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.259
 resistant the amount of scales 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.450
 dragons that had already exterminated it was 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.780
 scary no dragons hunter 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.880
 believed in what the people exalted 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.250
 because it was known to save hundreds 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.340
 of members of these creatures your pages 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.409
 in a certain kingdom they should hear of 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.320
 a legendary dragon so is an acquaintance 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.780
 as if to read here the people of that kingdom 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.659
 said that no one had ever used the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.180
 your wings could cover the 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.610
 whole kingdom and a simple breath of 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.770
 mouth melted stronger than armor 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.409
 in a fraction of a second 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.840
 seeing the challenge size the level does not 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.439
 he thought twice he went in search of this 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.500
 damn it 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.170
 months of searching without even seeing the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.150
 point of reading here on travel was 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.670
 beginning to think that all this is not 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.010
 passed from legends, but that was when he 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.160
 noticed huge footprints 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.560
 greater than himself without thinking of the danger 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.770
 who was running he followed those 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.320
 footprints to an obscure cave when 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.840
 see from afar if you read here the dragon the siam 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.600
 It was the first time that one might dave 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.560
 to feel fear but when he approached 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.510
 of the creature 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.600
 the knight could not believe the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.780
 who saw the dreaded dragon ossion was 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.660
 too frail old his wings were 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.480
 ragged his scales rotting 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.730
 its weakened fangs and its blow 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.970
 was no longer a threat or an 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.760
 simple act had or did not see the honor in 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.770
 show that dragon and decided to leave 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.830
 the opponent dies in peace 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:53.480
 but when the knight turned his back 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:55.370
 he a whisper invading his mind no 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.770
 only with his sword to give the act of 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.010
 mercy the old dragon but all 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.360
 happened too fast 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.060
 while he plunge his sword into the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.700

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.680
 his blood his slave the dragon so 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.440

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.320
 sending all his strength and his 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.830
 knowledge to the knight the death of 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.320
