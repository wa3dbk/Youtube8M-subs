question<00:00:02.610> 5<00:00:03.030> vectors<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.200> we've<00:00:04.680> got<00:00:04.890> a

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
question 5 vectors and we've got a

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.640 
question 5 vectors and we've got a
diagram<00:00:05.700> here<00:00:05.759> with<00:00:06.089> with<00:00:06.450> two<00:00:06.720> vectors<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.440> B

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
diagram here with with two vectors a B

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.200 
diagram here with with two vectors a B
and<00:00:10.650> we're<00:00:10.860> given<00:00:11.250> all<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.639> given<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.059> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
and we're given all the given is the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.470 
and we're given all the given is the
lengths<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.840> beef<00:00:14.120> we're<00:00:15.120> not<00:00:15.240> told

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
lengths of a beef we're not told

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.300 
lengths of a beef we're not told
anything<00:00:15.750> else<00:00:16.020> about<00:00:16.170> them<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.920> we're<00:00:17.100> told

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
anything else about them and we're told

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.010 
anything else about them and we're told
that<00:00:17.430> they're<00:00:17.670> scalar<00:00:18.090> products<00:00:18.570> notice

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
that they're scalar products notice

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.810 
that they're scalar products notice
they're<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.470> dot<00:00:20.130> B<00:00:20.400> equals<00:00:21.230> 6<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.640> this

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
they're a dot B equals 6 so this is this

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.870 
they're a dot B equals 6 so this is this
is<00:00:24.000> all<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> little<00:00:24.890> find<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.849> angle<00:00:27.269> AOB

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
is all the little find the angle AOB

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.999 
is all the little find the angle AOB
well<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.210> about<00:00:30.330> using<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.679> scalar

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
well this is about using that scalar

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.060 
well this is about using that scalar
product<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.770> a<00:00:35.239> dot<00:00:36.239> B<00:00:38.180> is

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
product and we know that a dot B is

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.430 
product and we know that a dot B is
magnitude<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.309> times<00:00:41.879> H<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.239> B<00:00:42.480> times<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
magnitude of a times H of B times the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.069 
magnitude of a times H of B times the
cosine<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.100> M<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.730> M<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.300> rearrange<00:00:45.600> that

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
cosine of M to M so if we rearrange that

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.560 
cosine of M to M so if we rearrange that
statement<00:00:47.210> cos<00:00:48.210> theta<00:00:49.879> is<00:00:50.879> egg<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.300> being

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
statement cos theta is egg of being

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.500 
statement cos theta is egg of being
divided<00:00:52.079> by<00:00:54.980> that<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.030> question<00:00:57.420> for

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
divided by that really this question for

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.000 
divided by that really this question for
these<00:00:57.660> two<00:00:57.840> months<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> asking<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.890> do

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
these two months is asking you to do

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.849 
these two months is asking you to do
very<00:00:59.640> little<00:00:59.969> other<00:01:00.210> than<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:01.320> recognize

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
very little other than just recognize

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.110 
very little other than just recognize
that<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.160> know<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.460> formula<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:03.059> can

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
that we know this formula we can

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.310 
that we know this formula we can
rearrange<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:05.360> dot<00:01:06.360> B<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.689> given<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.080> being

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
rearrange it a dot B is given as being

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.960 
rearrange it a dot B is given as being
so<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:11.430> magnitude<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.060> three<00:01:13.970> magnitude

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
so the magnitude of a is three magnitude

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.609 
so the magnitude of a is three magnitude
of<00:01:15.060> B<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.360> 4<00:01:17.509> 6/12<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.750> tricky<00:01:19.080> thing<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.439> work

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
of B is 4 6/12 a tricky thing to work

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.560 
of B is 4 6/12 a tricky thing to work
out<00:01:20.420> it's<00:01:21.420> often<00:01:21.750> equal<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.140> 1/2<00:01:22.229> e<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.420> we've

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
out it's often equal to 1/2 e so we've

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.999 
out it's often equal to 1/2 e so we've
got<00:01:25.130> welcome<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.909> another<00:01:27.350> house<00:01:28.350> pictorials

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
got welcome to another house pictorials

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.590 
got welcome to another house pictorials
1/2<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:31.680> didn't<00:01:32.220> specify<00:01:32.520> how<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:33.299> wanted

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
1/2 it didn't specify how they wanted

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.140 
1/2 it didn't specify how they wanted
the<00:01:33.780> angle<00:01:34.049> presented<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.820> give<00:01:36.030> it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the angle presented so we can give it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.719 
the angle presented so we can give it
into<00:01:36.630> dreams<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.229> radians<00:01:37.409> that's<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
into dreams or in radians that's a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.770 
into dreams or in radians that's a
inverse<00:01:39.570> Clause<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.619> 1/2<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.130> PI<00:01:41.579> by<00:01:41.610> 3<00:01:44.720> okay<00:01:45.720> so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
inverse Clause of 1/2 is PI by 3 okay so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.929 
inverse Clause of 1/2 is PI by 3 okay so
we<00:01:46.020> could<00:01:46.200> write<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.409> as<00:01:46.799> being<00:01:47.130> 60<00:01:47.640> degrees

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
we could write that as being 60 degrees

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.120 
we could write that as being 60 degrees
if<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.210> want<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.450> take<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.079> that's<00:01:49.590> two<00:01:49.890> miles

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
if we want to take and that's two miles

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.039 
if we want to take and that's two miles
for<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:51.350> now<00:01:52.350> now<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.920> wants<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
for that now now it wants to know the

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.109 
for that now now it wants to know the
length<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.500> minus<00:01:56.159> B<00:01:56.369> what<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.820> talked

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
length of a minus B what we just talked

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.209 
length of a minus B what we just talked
about<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> fact<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.799> go<00:01:58.920> back<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.189> our

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
about the fact that if we go back to our

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.209 
about the fact that if we go back to our
diagram<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.810> line<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.290> joins<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.860> ends<00:02:02.100> of

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
diagram the line that joins the ends of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.700 
diagram the line that joins the ends of
these<00:02:02.369> red<00:02:02.610> ones<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:05.130> line<00:02:05.399> there<00:02:06.140> well<00:02:07.140> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
these red ones that line there well to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.590 
these red ones that line there well to
get<00:02:07.920> from<00:02:08.399> B

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
get from B

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.200 
get from B
a<00:02:10.100> you<00:02:11.100> would<00:02:11.250> go<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.550> minus<00:02:11.940> B<00:02:12.180> plus<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.850> that

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
a you would go in minus B plus a so that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.890 
a you would go in minus B plus a so that
vector<00:02:15.570> there<00:02:16.460> from<00:02:17.460> B<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.570> vector<00:02:18.960> a

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
vector there from B to a is the vector a

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.190 
vector there from B to a is the vector a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
minus B it is matter which way we market

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.200 
minus B it is matter which way we market
there<00:02:25.710> because<00:02:26.250> actually<00:02:26.580> we're<00:02:26.730> interested

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
there because actually we're interested

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.240 
there because actually we're interested
in<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.480> length<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.530> we<00:02:28.770> know<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.130> the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
in the length of this we know that the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.290 
in the length of this we know that the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
to find the length of that side and we

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.350 
to find the length of that side and we
also<00:02:41.220> know<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.630> angle<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:44.000> PI<00:02:45.000> by<00:02:45.030> three

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
also know that that angle is PI by three

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.110 
also know that that angle is PI by three
it's<00:02:48.360> all<00:02:48.600> about<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.990> diagram<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.560> now<00:02:50.090> what

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
it's all about the diagram this now what

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.850 
it's all about the diagram this now what
what's<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.870> suggesting<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:53.010> us<00:02:53.040> yesterday

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
what's that suggesting to us yesterday

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.820 
what's that suggesting to us yesterday
this<00:02:55.860> piece<00:02:56.040> battle-seasoned<00:02:56.870> it's<00:02:57.870> too<00:02:58.170> easy

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
this piece battle-seasoned it's too easy

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.970 
this piece battle-seasoned it's too easy
okay<00:02:59.430> good<00:02:59.820> good<00:03:00.210> recovery<00:03:00.720> because<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:01.740> not

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
okay good good recovery because it's not

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.040 
okay good good recovery because it's not
suggesting<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.630> right<00:03:03.840> angle

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
suggesting that this is a right angle

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.380 
suggesting that this is a right angle
triangle<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.860> which<00:03:04.920> we<00:03:05.280> can<00:03:05.460> use<00:03:05.670> Pythagoras

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
triangle in which we can use Pythagoras

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.550 
triangle in which we can use Pythagoras
theorem<00:03:06.600> but<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.320> is<00:03:07.410> suggesting<00:03:07.980> if<00:03:08.820> we<00:03:09.090> know

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
theorem but it is suggesting if we know

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.070 
theorem but it is suggesting if we know
an<00:03:10.560> angle<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.880> two<00:03:12.060> sides<00:03:12.330> Jason<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.960> it

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
an angle and the two sides Jason to it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.100 
an angle and the two sides Jason to it
we<00:03:13.710> want<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> know<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.220> others<00:03:14.490> in<00:03:14.640> sight<00:03:15.110> then

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
we want to know the others in sight then

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.380 
we want to know the others in sight then
that's<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.440> cosine<00:03:16.620> law<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:18.120> about

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
that's the cosine law this is just about

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.070 
that's the cosine law this is just about
using<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.870> cosine<00:03:19.230> rules<00:03:19.740> and<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.840> length

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
using the cosine rules and so the length

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:34.270 
using the cosine rules and so the length
of<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.800> minus<00:03:23.730> B

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.600 

coming<00:03:36.500> can<00:03:37.500> we<00:03:37.560> go<00:03:37.680> straight<00:03:37.950> form<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.489> this

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
coming can we go straight form of this

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.850 
coming can we go straight form of this
if<00:03:38.790> we've<00:03:38.970> rearranged<00:03:39.450> or<00:03:40.319> it's<00:03:40.500> not<00:03:40.680> much<00:03:40.829> of

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
if we've rearranged or it's not much of

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.470 
if we've rearranged or it's not much of
a<00:03:41.010> rearrangement<00:03:41.310> if<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.790> coast<00:03:42.000> angle<00:03:42.359> would

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
a rearrangement if the coast angle would

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.190 
a rearrangement if the coast angle would
be<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.659> square<00:03:43.200> root<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:44.420> a<00:03:45.420> squared<00:03:45.840> plus<00:03:45.989> B

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
be the square root of a squared plus B

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.069 
be the square root of a squared plus B
squared<00:03:46.230> which<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.890> three<00:03:47.189> squared<00:03:48.079> the

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
squared which is three squared the

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.800 
squared which is three squared the

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
angle and it's quite interesting how

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.690 
angle and it's quite interesting how
left<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.079> calculating<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.799> little

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
left of this calculating you little

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.949 
left of this calculating you little
display<00:04:12.000> but<00:04:12.239> you<00:04:12.359> really<00:04:12.540> need<00:04:12.689> a<00:04:12.750> calculator

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
display but you really need a calculator

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.929 
display but you really need a calculator
for<00:04:13.290> isn't<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.739> does<00:04:14.250> this<00:04:14.400> again<00:04:14.700> we've<00:04:14.909> got

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
for isn't it does this again we've got

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:21.670 
for isn't it does this again we've got
three<00:04:15.359> squared<00:04:15.659> is<00:04:15.780> 4<00:04:15.989> squared<00:04:16.320> would<00:04:16.979> be<00:04:17.810> 25

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.920 

am<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.830> taking<00:04:23.070> away<00:04:23.280> 12<00:04:23.610> for<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.810> we've

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
am I taking away 12 for that so we've

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:38.240 
am I taking away 12 for that so we've
got<00:04:28.050> read<00:04:28.229> 15<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:30.000> that's<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:33.320> there<00:04:34.320> we<00:04:34.380> go

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.300 

and<00:04:38.789> that's<00:04:39.000> maths
