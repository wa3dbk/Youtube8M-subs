bit of a charmed charmed existence for
the<00:05:56.129> most<00:05:56.310> part<00:05:56.490> but<00:05:56.699> it<00:05:57.089> didn't<00:05:57.389> start<00:05:57.629> out

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
the most part but it didn't start out

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.929 
the most part but it didn't start out
that<00:05:57.810> way<00:05:58.099> certainly<00:05:59.099> many<00:05:59.490> years<00:05:59.759> where

00:05:59.929 --> 00:05:59.939 
that way certainly many years where

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.540 
that way certainly many years where
nobody<00:06:00.270> cared<00:06:00.479> about<00:06:00.569> me<00:06:01.009> except<00:06:02.009> for<00:06:02.159> me<00:06:02.250> and

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
nobody cared about me except for me and
