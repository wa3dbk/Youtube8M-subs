too is this product the Triton you know
people<00:01:05.460> ask<00:01:05.700> me<00:01:05.850> about<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> beautiful

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
people ask me about it it's a beautiful

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.500 
people ask me about it it's a beautiful
speaker<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.740> they<00:01:07.830> asked<00:01:08.130> me<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.939> styling

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
speaker and they asked me is the styling

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.020 
speaker and they asked me is the styling
there<00:01:10.080> because<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> looks<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.700> because<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
there because of looks or because of

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
there because of looks or because of
performance<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.290> really<00:01:13.680> there

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
performance and it's really there

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.850 
performance and it's really there
because<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.280> both<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.420> very<00:01:15.659> narrow<00:01:16.110> profile

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
because of both the very narrow profile

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.700 
because of both the very narrow profile
of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> Triton<00:01:17.759> helps<00:01:18.600> very<00:01:18.990> much<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.560> terms

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
of the Triton helps very much in terms

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
of the Triton helps very much in terms
of<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> imaging<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.450> most

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
of the imaging and one of the most

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.030 
of the imaging and one of the most
important<00:01:22.140> things<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.650> me<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
important things to me in the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.160 
important things to me in the
performance<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.670> any<00:01:23.820> speaker<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
performance of any speaker is that the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.870 
performance of any speaker is that the
speaker<00:01:25.560> should<00:01:25.710> disappear<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> should

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
speaker should disappear and you should

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.510 
speaker should disappear and you should
have<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.090> huge<00:01:27.630> giant<00:01:28.470> image<00:01:28.740> across<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.310> room

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
have a huge giant image across the room

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.450 
have a huge giant image across the room
that<00:01:30.150> goes<00:01:30.390> back<00:01:30.840> into<00:01:31.200> space<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.979> actually

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
that goes back into space that actually

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.210 
that goes back into space that actually
seems<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.030> bring<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.540> performance<00:01:34.200> into<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
seems to bring the performance into the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.850 
seems to bring the performance into the
room<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.869> Tritons<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.650> this

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
room with you and the Tritons do this

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.550 
room with you and the Tritons do this
incredibly<00:01:38.579> well<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.689> Tritons<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
incredibly well the Tritons have a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.950 
incredibly well the Tritons have a
built-in<00:01:41.100> powered<00:01:41.520> subwoofer<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.119> 1200<00:01:42.810> watt

built-in powered subwoofer in each
Triton<00:01:45.750> not<00:01:46.530> only<00:01:46.770> does<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> truck

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
Triton not only does that get the truck

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.660 
Triton not only does that get the truck
the<00:01:48.060> subwoofer<00:01:48.600> box<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> room<00:01:49.740> or<00:01:50.460> out

the subwoofer box out of the room or out

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.090 
the subwoofer box out of the room or out
of<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> wolf<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.509> floor<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.619> integrates

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
of the wolf the floor but it integrates

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.010 
of the wolf the floor but it integrates
much<00:01:53.340> better<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> speaker<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.329> what<00:01:54.899> we

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
much better with the speaker and what we

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.889 
much better with the speaker and what we
get<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.799> get<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> seamless<00:01:56.899> seamless

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
get is is we get a seamless seamless

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.840 
get is is we get a seamless seamless
coherence<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> speaker<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.549> when<00:01:59.700> you

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
coherence in the speaker so when you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.270 
coherence in the speaker so when you
listen<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.270> an<00:02:00.570> instrument<00:02:01.140> or<00:02:01.229> any<00:02:01.920> sonic

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
