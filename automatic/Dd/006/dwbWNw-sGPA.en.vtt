out of their goalie pads starting out
with<00:00:28.849> the<00:00:28.970> technology<00:00:29.539> on<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.720> inside<00:00:30.080> of<00:00:30.170> the

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
with the technology on the inside of the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.990 
with the technology on the inside of the
pad<00:00:30.439> they're<00:00:31.130> using<00:00:31.369> what<00:00:31.490> they<00:00:31.609> call<00:00:31.640> their

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
pad they're using what they call their

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.420 
pad they're using what they call their
Flex<00:00:32.300> pack<00:00:32.570> technology<00:00:33.230> in<00:00:33.320> there<00:00:33.530> basically

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
Flex pack technology in there basically

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.700 
Flex pack technology in there basically
what<00:00:34.880> they're<00:00:35.000> doing<00:00:35.030> with<00:00:35.450> that<00:00:35.630> is<00:00:35.840> stuffing

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
what they're doing with that is stuffing

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.230 
what they're doing with that is stuffing
the<00:00:36.800> pad<00:00:36.980> with<00:00:37.190> those<00:00:37.400> foams<00:00:37.730> that's<00:00:38.000> going<00:00:38.180> to

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.240 
the pad with those foams that's going to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.700 
the pad with those foams that's going to
allow<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:38.450> pad<00:00:38.720> to<00:00:38.870> give<00:00:38.990> you<00:00:39.110> a<00:00:39.200> lot<00:00:39.440> more

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
allow the pad to give you a lot more

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.700 
allow the pad to give you a lot more
flex<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:41.120> also<00:00:41.570> a<00:00:41.600> little<00:00:41.990> bit<00:00:42.080> more<00:00:42.170> rebound

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
flex and also a little bit more rebound

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.880 
flex and also a little bit more rebound
dampening<00:00:43.550> there<00:00:43.990> same<00:00:44.990> thing<00:00:45.260> again<00:00:45.680> with

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
dampening there same thing again with

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.740 
dampening there same thing again with
the<00:00:46.100> foams<00:00:46.520> that<00:00:46.910> are<00:00:47.030> gonna<00:00:47.120> be<00:00:47.270> stuffed<00:00:47.540> into

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
the foams that are gonna be stuffed into

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.150 
the foams that are gonna be stuffed into
the<00:00:47.900> front<00:00:48.230> of<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.410> pad<00:00:48.590> here<00:00:48.860> you're<00:00:49.040> gonna

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
the front of the pad here you're gonna

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.740 
the front of the pad here you're gonna
get<00:00:49.340> some<00:00:49.490> nice<00:00:49.640> soft<00:00:49.970> foams<00:00:50.270> it's<00:00:50.570> going<00:00:50.690> to

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
get some nice soft foams it's going to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.360 
get some nice soft foams it's going to
help<00:00:50.900> dampen<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.470> lot<00:00:51.590> of<00:00:51.710> those<00:00:51.800> rebounds<00:00:52.100> and

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
help dampen a lot of those rebounds and

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.500 
help dampen a lot of those rebounds and
the<00:00:52.460> same<00:00:52.670> thing<00:00:52.940> here<00:00:53.180> with<00:00:53.270> those

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
the same thing here with those

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.020 
the same thing here with those
traditional<00:00:54.110> knee<00:00:54.290> rolls<00:00:54.500> on<00:00:54.710> there<00:00:55.030> going

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
traditional knee rolls on there going

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.570 
traditional knee rolls on there going
out<00:00:56.210> onto<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.840> outer<00:00:57.110> roll<00:00:57.470> here<00:00:57.770> you<00:00:58.310> can<00:00:58.430> see

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
out onto the outer roll here you can see

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.250 
out onto the outer roll here you can see
they<00:00:58.700> have<00:00:58.880> that<00:00:59.060> break<00:00:59.330> point<00:00:59.360> above<00:01:00.020> and

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
they have that break point above and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.560 
they have that break point above and
then<00:01:00.380> below<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.040> knee<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.370> then<00:01:01.910> one<00:01:02.150> down<00:01:02.390> at

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
then below the knee and then one down at

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.850 
then below the knee and then one down at
the<00:01:02.690> boot<00:01:02.840> so<00:01:03.020> you're<00:01:03.140> gonna<00:01:03.230> get<00:01:03.410> a<00:01:03.470> lot<00:01:03.680> of

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
the boot so you're gonna get a lot of

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.550 
the boot so you're gonna get a lot of
flexibility<00:01:04.430> out<00:01:04.610> of<00:01:04.760> this<00:01:04.850> pad<00:01:05.380> and<00:01:06.380> then

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
flexibility out of this pad and then

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.340 
flexibility out of this pad and then
going<00:01:06.799> on<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.189> inner<00:01:07.399> roll<00:01:07.759> now<00:01:08.350> they're

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
going on to the inner roll now they're

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.080 
going on to the inner roll now they're
gonna<00:01:09.439> be<00:01:09.560> using<00:01:09.859> a<00:01:09.920> strip<00:01:10.219> of<00:01:10.369> HD<00:01:10.820> foam

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
gonna be using a strip of HD foam

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.270 
gonna be using a strip of HD foam
throughout<00:01:11.509> on<00:01:11.719> that<00:01:11.869> inner<00:01:12.079> side<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:13.159> can

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.969 
throughout on that inner side so you can
get<00:01:13.369> some<00:01:13.579> really<00:01:13.820> high<00:01:13.969> quality<00:01:14.740> foams<00:01:15.740> in

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
get some really high quality foams in

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.620 
get some really high quality foams in
there<00:01:16.159> this<00:01:16.640> is<00:01:16.789> just<00:01:16.909> gonna<00:01:17.030> help<00:01:17.119> keep<00:01:17.420> the

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
there this is just gonna help keep the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.330 
there this is just gonna help keep the
life<00:01:17.869> of<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:18.109> pad<00:01:18.289> going<00:01:19.009> a<00:01:19.070> little<00:01:19.159> bit

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
life of the pad going a little bit

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.340 
life of the pad going a little bit
longer<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.729> also<00:01:19.909> just<00:01:20.149> keep<00:01:20.390> help<00:01:21.020> keep<00:01:21.229> the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
longer and also just keep help keep the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.190 
longer and also just keep help keep the
shape<00:01:21.619> of<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.829> pad<00:01:22.009> as<00:01:22.189> well<00:01:22.749> now<00:01:23.749> going<00:01:23.990> on<00:01:24.109> to

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
shape of the pad as well now going on to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.980 
shape of the pad as well now going on to
the<00:01:24.320> inner<00:01:24.710> part<00:01:25.640> here<00:01:25.969> they're<00:01:26.539> using<00:01:26.570> their

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
the inner part here they're using their

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.719 
the inner part here they're using their
balance<00:01:27.409> stabilizer<00:01:27.950> on<00:01:28.100> there<00:01:28.429> basically

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
balance stabilizer on there basically

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.020 
balance stabilizer on there basically
does<00:01:29.270> exactly<00:01:29.600> what<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:30.049> says<00:01:30.880> keeps<00:01:31.880> you

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
does exactly what it says keeps you

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.669 
does exactly what it says keeps you
balanced<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:32.659> stabilized<00:01:33.259> when<00:01:33.530> you're

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
balanced and stabilized when you're

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.219 
balanced and stabilized when you're
going<00:01:34.219> down<00:01:34.490> into<00:01:34.729> that<00:01:34.969> position<00:01:35.149> and<00:01:35.810> it's

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
going down into that position and it's

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.389 
going down into that position and it's
also<00:01:36.350> going<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.619> help<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:36.950> seal<00:01:37.159> off<00:01:37.369> that

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
also going to help to seal off that
