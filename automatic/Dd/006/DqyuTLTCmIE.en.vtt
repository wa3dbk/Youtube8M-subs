 since 2010 he has been fulfilling the task 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.090
 from tertiary to vehicles that are sold in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.250
 latin america and the caribbean in this 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.920
 time was already carried out three stages 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.990
 whose results of the last one have just 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.270
 be published we are going to 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.490
 show in this program today the three 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.099
 first cars the car that we are 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.760
 watching is the new kinetic design party 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.130
 one of the best cars awarded by 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.930
 the latina ncap in total can be 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.390
 reward up to five stars for 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.000
 frontal shock as we are seeing is 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.489
 a sneaky clash where they intervene 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.740
 only a quarter of the French horn 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.440
 car 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.020
 ford fiesta kinetic design took four 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.330
 stars in frontal crash on a 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.700
 maximum of five and also the protection 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.250
 and child safety this party 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.120
 kinetic design brought out four stars 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.640
 over five possible 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.160
 now we see the honda city that also 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.280
 received four stars in the clashes 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.720
 frontals and also four stars in 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.720
 child safety 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.890
 this is phase 3 and here they are shown 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.780
 diverse results 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.210
 On the one hand they denote the interior to 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.180
 need for cars to incorporate the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.130
 less front airbag and abs on the brakes 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.119
 elements both that in Argentina 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.770
 will be mandatory only in 2014 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.020
 but on the other hand they leave in the open 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.539
 that you also need to have a 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.890
 structure capable of withstanding shocks to 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.890
 60 kilometers per hour 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.310
 the next car is the renault fluence 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.620
 which is made here in Argentina and it 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.450
 exports to different parts of the world in 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.780
 the frontal collisions also received 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.640
 like the other four stars but the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.400
 shocks where the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.390
 kids in child safety 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.390
 only two stars 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.810
 A) Yes 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.860
 much 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.569

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.659
