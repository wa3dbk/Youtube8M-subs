00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.330
 for this exercise two 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.750
 balls three goalkeepers and a coach 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.750
 goalkeepers 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.990
 there are beats on the part of the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.910
 coach goalkeepers and goalkeepers 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.680
 of support the main goalkeeper should 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.720
 make blocks and return the ball 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.550
 when he gets hit by the coach 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.350
 of goalkeepers returns to the same 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.239
 however when he receives a blow or from 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.650
 one of the goalkeepers must return the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.650
 ball to the other partner 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.230
 Goalkeeper training takes us on 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.730
 occasions to fall into the routine of the 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.510
 repetition no longer think about what 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.510
 we are doing 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.450
 this year despite being very 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.100
 simple requires us to be aware 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.539
 at all times of the intervention to 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.020
 know to whom you have to return the 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.020
 spherical 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.509
 we go 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.950
 and there is more 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.220
 and it's worth 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.320
 for the exercise we have two values 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.480
 one always has to go back to 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.080
 coach and another one that should rotate between 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.080
 the two goalkeepers 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.360
 as the swineherd gets used to the gesture 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.080
 we must increase the speed to 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.080
 that the difficulty 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.149
 Y
