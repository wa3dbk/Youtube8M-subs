00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
comes next

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.610 
comes next
make<00:03:20.690> sure<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.900> bag<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.320> inside<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:21.890> ice

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.770 

and<00:03:26.250> we're<00:03:26.370> shaking<00:03:26.760> until<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.390> mixture

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
and we're shaking until the mixture

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.420 
and we're shaking until the mixture
hardens<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.590> here<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:28.890> may<00:03:29.010> have<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.280> take

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
hardens in here so you may have to take

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.520 
hardens in here so you may have to take
it<00:03:29.610> out<00:03:29.700> every<00:03:29.730> once<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.209> while<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.450> check

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.070 

and<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.680> looks<00:03:35.890> like<00:03:36.010> it's<00:03:36.250> working<00:03:36.540> great<00:03:37.540> you

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
and it looks like it's working great you

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.400 
and it looks like it's working great you
can<00:03:38.230> see<00:03:38.470> that<00:03:39.190> it's<00:03:39.340> thickening<00:03:39.760> up<00:03:40.410> we're

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
can see that it's thickening up we're

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.540 
can see that it's thickening up we're
not<00:03:41.530> quite<00:03:41.710> there<00:03:41.770> yet<00:03:41.920> though<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.400> want

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
not quite there yet though so you want

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.570 
not quite there yet though so you want
