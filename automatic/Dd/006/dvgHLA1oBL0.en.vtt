00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
had a lot more experience than I did and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.250 
had a lot more experience than I did and
there<00:00:29.189> was<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> general<00:00:29.789> consensus<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.330> this

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
there was a general consensus that this

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.560 
there was a general consensus that this
was<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.650> best<00:00:31.830> powdered<00:00:32.279> milk<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.640> the

was the best powdered milk and the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.650 
was the best powdered milk and the
reason<00:00:33.899> why<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.670> over<00:00:35.670> period<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.000> time<00:00:36.180> it's

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
reason why is over period of time it's

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.470 
reason why is over period of time it's
it<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.530> consistent<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.280> didn't<00:00:38.550> change<00:00:38.579> its

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.139 
it was consistent it didn't change its
taste<00:00:39.840> or<00:00:40.230> color<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.640> thought<00:00:41.910> they<00:00:42.090> were

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
taste or color and I thought they were

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.790 
taste or color and I thought they were
crazy<00:00:42.390> powdered<00:00:42.960> milk<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.290> powdered<00:00:43.590> milk<00:00:43.680> I

would just buy whatever was the least
expensive<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.920> I<00:00:46.920> learned<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.539> were

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
protein it just it separates and it's

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.149 
protein it just it separates and it's
just<00:02:21.329> it's<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:21.989> as<00:02:22.230> good<00:02:22.379> there's<00:02:23.099> some

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
just it's not as good there's some

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.679 
just it's not as good there's some
