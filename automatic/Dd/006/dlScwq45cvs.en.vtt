00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.630
 good friends here will teach 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.450
 calculate your year with a flexo meter 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.150
 composed normal meter this same meter 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.170
 custom of three meters the only thing that 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.539
 let's do is extend the sixth subway 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.419
 until the year that we are for example 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.539
 now we are in 2013 what we are going to 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.060
 do is 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.600
 from the metro to 213 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.920
 for example 180 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.310
 here is 200 if you can see it 200 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:43.470
 we realize that 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.470
 what is 2013 since it is 2000 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.969
 as we are in 2013 we are 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.440
 exactly 213 210 202 and 213 what 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.180
 let's do is take it from the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.180
 initial here from number 1 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:04.860
 you have to have problems with little 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:07.870
 it's also 2013 ready we have the same 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.970
 2013 students if they see that I have two thousand 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.800
 three students we are going to calculate is for 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.300
 example so you are born in the year 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:22.580
 of 84 but we're going in 1984 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:25.750
 here is if you can see it 184 so you 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.710
 You are born in the year of 100 of the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:34.230
 1800 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.230
 1984 you have exactly 20 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.310
 29 years old if you see it 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:49.579
 we are in 2013 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.619
 the 2013 as tourÃ© was born in 84 if it is 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.580
 that I had was not born in 84 has 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.870
 evidently 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.870
 29 years old 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.180
 well that's not 29 years and for example 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.530
 we calculate another age if you want me to 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.759
 example I am born in the year of 94 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.880
 here is in the year 94 1994 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.170
 I am 19 years old 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:22.850
 and it's an easy way to calculate 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:26.560
 with a normal blood pressure monitor 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.560
 un and that's all guys ready
