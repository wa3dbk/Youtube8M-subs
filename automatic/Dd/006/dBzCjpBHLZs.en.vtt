00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
trailer so this is much more compact you

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.559 
trailer so this is much more compact you
know<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:38.900> cast<00:02:39.530> are<00:02:39.799> more<00:02:40.040> precise<00:02:40.579> yep<00:02:41.090> okay

know the cast are more precise yep okay
you<00:02:41.720> fish<00:02:41.900> faster<00:02:42.349> it's<00:02:42.859> kind<00:02:43.069> of<00:02:43.220> winch<00:02:43.730> yeah

of bread that's it open 17 something

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.640 
of bread that's it open 17 something
like<00:03:09.739> that<00:03:10.060> just<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.599> hold<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:12.049> lure<00:03:12.230> the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
like that just to to hold the lure the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.129 
like that just to to hold the lure the
right<00:03:12.829> way<00:03:13.069> so<00:03:13.340> what<00:03:14.030> we<00:03:14.180> can<00:03:14.299> I<00:03:14.359> come<00:03:14.629> on<00:03:14.780> is

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
right way so what we can I come on is

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.800 
right way so what we can I come on is
this<00:03:15.379> time<00:03:15.680> selling<00:03:16.069> bud<00:03:16.250> for<00:03:16.849> example<00:03:17.299> all

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
this time selling bud for example all

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.170 
this time selling bud for example all
right<00:03:18.109> okay<00:03:18.409> you<00:03:18.829> know<00:03:18.950> it's<00:03:19.129> a<00:03:19.220> 2<00:03:19.459> by<00:03:19.790> deadline

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
right okay you know it's a 2 by deadline

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.199 
right okay you know it's a 2 by deadline
so<00:03:20.599> it<00:03:20.870> floats<00:03:21.200> much<00:03:21.859> more<00:03:22.129> than<00:03:22.340> fire<00:03:22.549> line<00:03:22.849> it

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
so it floats much more than fire line it

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.330 
so it floats much more than fire line it
doesn't<00:03:23.599> cut<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.900> water<00:03:24.199> the<00:03:24.500> same<00:03:24.680> way<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:25.250> it

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
doesn't cut the water the same way so it

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.909 
doesn't cut the water the same way so it
will<00:03:25.519> hold<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.389> light<00:03:26.569> wheels<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.590> get<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.889> a

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
will hold the light wheels to get to a

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.039 
will hold the light wheels to get to a
good<00:03:28.280> presentation<00:03:28.760> okay<00:03:29.090> fine<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.810> in<00:03:29.930> this

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
good presentation okay fine and in this

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.099 
good presentation okay fine and in this
case<00:03:30.290> you've<00:03:30.560> used<00:03:30.739> 14<00:03:31.250> pound<00:03:31.609> sonic<00:03:32.540> bright<00:03:32.780> I

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
case you've used 14 pound sonic bright I

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.500 
case you've used 14 pound sonic bright I
matched<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.919> with<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.280> river<00:03:34.579> bike<00:03:35.239> as<00:03:35.480> well

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
matched it with this river bike as well

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:44.990 
matched it with this river bike as well
yes<00:03:36.250> yeah

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.350 

so<00:03:46.000> Silvan<00:03:46.390> just<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.720> conclude<00:03:46.930> on<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.530> braids

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
so Silvan just to conclude on the braids

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.360 
so Silvan just to conclude on the braids
you<00:03:49.360> would<00:03:49.480> recommend<00:03:49.780> using<00:03:50.170> fire<00:03:50.709> line<00:03:51.010> on<00:03:51.310> a

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
you would recommend using fire line on a

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.699 
you would recommend using fire line on a
spinning<00:03:51.970> wheel<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.450> in<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.050> case<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.500> use

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
spinning wheel and in this case you use

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.740 
spinning wheel and in this case you use
the<00:03:53.860> 10-pound<00:03:54.310> fire<00:03:54.550> line<00:03:54.790> yeah<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.420> with<00:03:55.720> a

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
the 10-pound fire line yeah and with a

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.280 
the 10-pound fire line yeah and with a
baitcaster<00:03:56.349> you'd<00:03:56.650> go<00:03:56.830> for<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.190> sonic<00:03:57.580> braid

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
baitcaster you'd go for the sonic braid

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.850 
baitcaster you'd go for the sonic braid
in<00:03:59.290> 14<00:03:59.739> pound<00:04:00.069> break<00:04:00.550> astray<00:04:00.940> exactly<00:04:01.540> so

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
in 14 pound break astray exactly so

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.380 
in 14 pound break astray exactly so
another<00:04:02.860> important<00:04:03.489> point<00:04:03.670> is<00:04:04.000> about<00:04:04.269> the

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
another important point is about the

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.620 
another important point is about the
color<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:05.380> if<00:04:05.890> you<00:04:06.069> fish<00:04:06.310> under<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:06.940> boat<00:04:07.120> you

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
color so if you fish under the boat you

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.240 
color so if you fish under the boat you
feel<00:04:07.840> everything<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.380> don't<00:04:08.890> need

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
feel everything you don't need

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.309 
feel everything you don't need
absolutely<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.390> see<00:04:10.599> your<00:04:10.810> line<00:04:10.959> so<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:11.200> can

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
absolutely to see your line so you can

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.520 
absolutely to see your line so you can
choose<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.739> gray<00:04:12.550> line<00:04:12.760> like<00:04:13.540> there's<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:14.019> the

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
choose a gray line like there's a the

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.460 
choose a gray line like there's a the
fire<00:04:14.680> liar<00:04:14.920> ok<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:15.790> Hugh's<00:04:16.359> line<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:17.139> get<00:04:17.290> the

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
fire liar ok so Hugh's line to get the

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.830 
fire liar ok so Hugh's line to get the
flow<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:17.889> gray<00:04:18.760> color<00:04:19.120> because<00:04:19.450> you<00:04:19.540> don't

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
flow and gray color because you don't

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.500 
flow and gray color because you don't
need<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.500> see<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.100> but<00:04:21.700> from<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.030> shells<00:04:22.300> is<00:04:22.479> a

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
need to see it but from the shells is a

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.360 
need to see it but from the shells is a
different<00:04:22.990> story<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.800> need<00:04:23.950> to<00:04:24.100> see<00:04:24.250> your

different story you need to see your

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.030 
different story you need to see your

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
line because sometimes you see some

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.920 
line because sometimes you see some
bites<00:04:27.250> in<00:04:27.460> your<00:04:27.669> line<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:28.330> you<00:04:28.360> don't<00:04:28.630> fit<00:04:28.840> in
