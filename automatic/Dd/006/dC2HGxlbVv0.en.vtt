00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.529
 how are you all welcome in this 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.080
 video I will explain my point of view 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.210
 about the new xbox one that up 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.120
 now it's the best-selling consoles of the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.410
 last hours without more cheap information 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.410
 let's continue in the video 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.559
 good the console xbox one for my point 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.020
 of view is a console that is to pass 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.090
 to the next level playable and ccoo because 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.340
 from now the eighth generation of 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.589
 video games is where the vast majority of 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.290
 companies decide to make a change 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.210
 console one thing that left me surprised 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.010
 was that in 24 hours 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.949
 Microsoft manages to sell a million 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.930
 xbox one drives most of the 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.629
 consoles I do not think they buy them 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.489
 people to play there are also people 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.060
 who bought those units for 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.000
 to sell 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.040
 Here in Colombia there is a problem and that is 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.470
 when a console comes out in said 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.390
 stores or shopping centers put them 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.030
 at an extremely impossible price 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.460
 buy good without exaggerating here in 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.640
 Mercadolibre can see the price of a 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.100
 xbox one supposedly new and sealed and 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.110
 is in BogotÃ¡ and several days 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.240
 before its launch was that 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.070
 product what I do not know is that if I 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.320
 I buy in pre-sale or nothing else is a 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.550
 image that by which he tries to cheat 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.950
 a person 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.080
 but no doubt the xbox one has had 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.960
 good releases as a shooter with 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.780
 forza motosport 5 and the video game with 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.000
 more advertising of the xbox one fifa 14 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.790
 by my point they are the best so far 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.740
 another point that leaves me surprised are 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.920
 the huge controls of the new xbox 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.020
 you can see that they are comfortable and can adapt 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.270
 at the hand of anyone and his great 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.580
 design that by which leaves more than one 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.560
 surprised another point is that you can 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.500
 record games to full hd quality 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.990
 I think so and the maximum time is 5 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.990
 minutes it seems good to me that microsoft 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.970
 have incorporated that to the new xbox to 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.250
 many will not like it to record to 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.320
 maximum of 5 minutes because they want 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.650
 record a game of almost 40 minutes 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.440
 that make you sleep to one are not all 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.230
 some I'm saying a negative point 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.240
 is that we do not wait for the console to 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.550
 like its predecessor that for which it was 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.240
 the worst damage to microsoft were the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.880
 red lights of the xbox 360 although it seems 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.860
 that that died a long time ago or 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.680
 maybe we will see some yellow lights or 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.560
 blue 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.700
 No factory problems 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.180
 remember that the first consoles 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.650
 of factories have small damages 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.829
 let's hope the new xbox goes well 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:52.599
 at the end of this 2013 and throughout 2014 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:54.909
 good guys I say goodbye I'm juanse 697 and 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:59.219
 in another video I will explain about my 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:02.639
 opinion about the ps4 that I think hahaha 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.639
 greetings guys
