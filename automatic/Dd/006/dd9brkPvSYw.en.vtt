that song rock star by Nickelback and I
was<00:00:24.039> just<00:00:24.189> thinking<00:00:24.570> what<00:00:25.570> would<00:00:25.750> my<00:00:25.960> makeup

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
was just thinking what would my makeup

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.829 
was just thinking what would my makeup
look<00:00:26.500> like<00:00:26.679> if<00:00:26.859> I<00:00:27.039> were<00:00:27.220> a<00:00:27.250> rock<00:00:27.490> star<00:00:27.820> so<00:00:28.509> this

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
look like if I were a rock star so this

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.390 
look like if I were a rock star so this
is<00:00:29.019> one<00:00:29.320> of<00:00:29.349> the<00:00:29.529> things<00:00:29.769> that<00:00:29.949> I<00:00:29.980> thought<00:00:30.339> of

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
is one of the things that I thought of

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.300 
is one of the things that I thought of
and<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:32.590> just<00:00:32.860> gonna<00:00:33.010> be<00:00:33.310> really<00:00:33.420> smudgy<00:00:34.420> and

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
and it's just gonna be really smudgy and

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.880 
and it's just gonna be really smudgy and
it'll<00:00:36.310> probably<00:00:36.490> crease<00:00:37.090> but<00:00:37.990> that's<00:00:38.650> the

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
it'll probably crease but that's the

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.250 
it'll probably crease but that's the

it's safe to use on your eyes to make

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.000 
it's safe to use on your eyes to make
them<00:03:36.500> glossy<00:03:37.269> so<00:03:38.269> maybe<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:38.720> have<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.170> and

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
I'm just going to apply it onto my lids

00:03:45.470 --> 00:04:01.180 
I'm just going to apply it onto my lids
to<00:03:46.099> make<00:03:46.310> them<00:03:46.639> look<00:03:47.019> shiny

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.760 

all<00:04:01.730> right<00:04:02.000> so<00:04:02.300> I<00:04:02.330> put<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.720> gloss<00:04:02.960> on<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.620> you

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
all right so I put the gloss on and you

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.820 
all right so I put the gloss on and you
can<00:04:03.980> see<00:04:04.190> it's<00:04:04.370> already<00:04:04.670> starting<00:04:05.350> to<00:04:06.350> crease

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
can see it's already starting to crease

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.070 
can see it's already starting to crease
and<00:04:07.280> that's<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.150> what<00:04:08.270> I'm<00:04:08.450> going<00:04:08.720> for

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
and that's the what I'm going for

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.980

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
so if you don't want to crease don't put

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.990 
so if you don't want to crease don't put
any<00:04:12.230> gloss<00:04:12.770> on<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.190> because<00:04:13.550> that's<00:04:13.670> what<00:04:13.850> it's
