ice passes were nice and I think was a

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.770 
ice passes were nice and I think was a
great<00:02:43.010> game<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.610> watch<00:02:43.730> were<00:02:44.239> you<00:02:44.360> surprised

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
that the intensity was as strong as it

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.370 
that the intensity was as strong as it
was<00:02:46.730> for<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.239> first<00:02:47.420> exhibition<00:02:48.019> game<00:02:48.230> for

was for the first exhibition game for
both<00:02:48.590> teams<00:02:48.790> no<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.820> think<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.690> lot<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.870> guys<00:02:51.230> are

trying<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.920> make<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.280> team<00:02:52.730> in<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.150> both<00:02:53.600> team

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
trying to make the team in the both team
