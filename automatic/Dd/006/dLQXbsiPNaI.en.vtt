concepts<00:00:16.410> we've<00:00:16.980> taken<00:00:17.279> both<00:00:17.550> offenses

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
concepts we've taken both offenses

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.029 
concepts we've taken both offenses
tweaked<00:00:18.750> them<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.320> little<00:00:19.350> bit<00:00:19.590> added

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
tweaked them just a little bit added

some<00:00:20.220> new<00:00:20.340> wrinkles<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.000> put<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.630> into<00:00:21.869> one

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
some new wrinkles and put it into one

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
some new wrinkles and put it into one
complete<00:00:22.800> offensive<00:00:23.430> system<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> think

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
complete offensive system that I think

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.599 
complete offensive system that I think
will<00:00:24.990> really<00:00:25.199> maximize<00:00:25.560> your<00:00:25.920> offensive

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
will really maximize your offensive

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.910 
will really maximize your offensive
scoring<00:00:26.910> potential<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.960> reason<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.470> came<00:00:28.769> up

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
scoring potential the reason I came up

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.439 
scoring potential the reason I came up
with<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.189> offense<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.849> really<00:00:30.119> felt<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
with this offense is I really felt the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.870 
with this offense is I really felt the
dribble<00:00:30.779> Drive<00:00:30.990> needed<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.619> bit<00:00:31.800> more<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.340> felt

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
dribble Drive needed a bit more I felt

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.069 
dribble Drive needed a bit more I felt
my<00:00:33.000> teams<00:00:33.239> were<00:00:33.360> relying<00:00:33.630> too<00:00:33.840> much<00:00:33.870> on

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
my teams were relying too much on

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.740 
my teams were relying too much on
dribble<00:00:34.739> penetration<00:00:35.120> we<00:00:36.120> needed<00:00:36.420> some<00:00:36.570> more

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
dribble penetration we needed some more

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.389 
dribble penetration we needed some more
cutting<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:37.290> more<00:00:37.440> screening<00:00:37.800> action

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
cutting some more screening action

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.459 
cutting some more screening action
involved<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.420> rather<00:00:39.629> than<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:39.930> stop<00:00:40.260> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
involved so rather than just stop and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.130 
involved so rather than just stop and
call<00:00:40.620> set<00:00:40.890> plays<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.489> think<00:00:42.000> adding<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> Flex

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
call set plays I think adding the Flex

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.830 
call set plays I think adding the Flex
continuity<00:00:44.040> offense<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.969> some<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
continuity offense to it and some of the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.180 
continuity offense to it and some of the
tweaks<00:00:46.079> I've<00:00:46.230> added<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> Flex<00:00:46.950> you're

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
tweaks I've added to the Flex you're

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.549 
tweaks I've added to the Flex you're
going<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> see<00:00:47.629> go<00:00:48.629> great<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.379> dribble

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
going to see go great with the dribble

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.770 
going to see go great with the dribble
Drive<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:50.730> taking<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.120> greatest

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
Drive and I think taking the greatest

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.209 
Drive and I think taking the greatest
hits<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.320> will<00:00:52.469> from<00:00:52.710> both<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> these

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
hits if you will from both of these

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.010 
hits if you will from both of these
offenses<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.969> putting<00:00:54.149> them<00:00:54.239> together<00:00:54.329> are

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
offenses and putting them together are

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.150 
offenses and putting them together are
you<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> make<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.590> very<00:00:55.890> very

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you going to make you very very

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.439 
you going to make you very very
dangerous<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> offensive<00:00:57.180> end<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
dangerous on the offensive end of the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.150 
dangerous on the offensive end of the
court<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.930> think<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.440> important<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.859> any

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
court I think it's important that any

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.250 
court I think it's important that any
good<00:00:59.460> offensive<00:00:59.850> system<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.899> make<00:01:01.230> sure

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
good offensive system that you make sure

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.709 
good offensive system that you make sure
your<00:01:01.980> players<00:01:02.309> are<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.059> position<00:01:03.239> where

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
your players are in a position where

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.600 
your players are in a position where
they<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.110> back<00:01:04.350> defensively<00:01:04.769> running

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
they can get back defensively running

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
they can get back defensively running
this<00:01:05.729> offense<00:01:05.939> through<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.780> side-to-side<00:01:07.260> will

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
this offense through a side-to-side will

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.160 
this offense through a side-to-side will
always<00:01:08.310> keep<00:01:08.549> players<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.240> great<00:01:09.540> defensive

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
always keep players in great defensive

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.780 
always keep players in great defensive
transition<00:01:10.320> should<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.010> missed<00:01:11.250> shot<00:01:11.310> or<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
transition should a missed shot or a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.670 
transition should a missed shot or a
turnover<00:01:12.090> happen<00:01:12.780> you're<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.619> able

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
turnover happen you're going to be able

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.620 
turnover happen you're going to be able
to<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:13.920> back<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.159> stop<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> basketball<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
to get back and stop the basketball the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.999 
to get back and stop the basketball the
reason<00:01:15.900> why<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.110> flex<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> dribble

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
reason why the flex and the dribble

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.490 
reason why the flex and the dribble
drive<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.430> me<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.880> such<00:01:18.180> great<00:01:18.780> combination

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
drive to me are such great combination

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
drive to me are such great combination
is<00:01:19.619> because<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> Flex<00:01:20.340> gives<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
is because the Flex gives you the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.510 
is because the Flex gives you the
opportunity<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.439> an<00:01:22.590> open<00:01:22.920> post<00:01:23.189> at<00:01:23.369> all

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
opportunity to have an open post at all

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.730 
opportunity to have an open post at all
times<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.210> means<00:01:24.600> from<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.439> perimeter

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
times and that means from a perimeter

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.350 
times and that means from a perimeter
standpoint<00:01:26.369> you're<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.850> lanes<00:01:27.119> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
standpoint you're going to have lanes to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
standpoint you're going to have lanes to
drive<00:01:27.630> once<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> drive<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.799> there<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.189> it's

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
drive once the drive is there if it's

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.100 
drive once the drive is there if it's
not<00:01:29.490> successful<00:01:29.970> you're<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.900> easily

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
not successful you're going to easily

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.719 
not successful you're going to easily
kick<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> ball<00:01:31.770> back<00:01:32.009> out<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.460> be<00:01:32.520> able<00:01:32.610> to
