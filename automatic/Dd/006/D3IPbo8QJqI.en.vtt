00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:09.360
 see here is a map of the world how is it 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.780
 imagined not babylon and map 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.179
 this 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.960
 studied read historians after two 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.320
 thousand six hundred years after its creation 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.119
 they represented the earth as a circle 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.029
 located in the ocean and surrounded 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.369
 the seven continents and islands they already 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.170
 knew about the existence of continents but 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.470
 apparently had no idea 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.680
 what people inhabit them they were better 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.640
 familiar with their neighbors in the north they 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.660
 answered the mountains are clearly visible Babylon himself and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.649
 river efrath here it is the way it flows 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.730
 very close 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:52.949
 see circles 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.199
 these are neighboring states and large 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:02.820
 cities famous babylon us harman 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:05.220
 take with lucky for today nobody 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.280
 knows what kind of strange they were 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.400
 residents but if the battle is kin place on 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.590
 modern map we will see here 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.380
 lived in ancient times ancestors 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.689
 Jews and Arabs 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:24.740
 It looks like on the map of Africa 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.360
 which means ancient Egypt is located here 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.640
 Assyria 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.439
 great syria this state was 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.960
 destroyed in the seventh century before our 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.579
 the era 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:41.840
 another northern neighbor where the mountains 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.399
 they called this country differently ararat 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.479
 arat 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.720
 Urartu and later Armenia 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.590
 how do you know all this 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.150
 see it written here on the back 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.730
 side of the card is that beech these signs 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.740
 extruded in raw clay special 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.760
 the wand that left it 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.520
 deep footprints 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.970
 similar to wedges for which they called 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.580
 such a letter in cuneiform 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.290
 then baked plates you che asserted 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.410
 and thanks to this many of them 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.940
 survived to many centuries 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.150
 used cuneiform 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.450
 nations between the rivers and left us thousands 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.300
 the most interesting records decode them 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.240
 scientist and so we learn about events 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.240
 occurred 3 even 5000 years ago
