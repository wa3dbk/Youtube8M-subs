00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.200
 and 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.200
 and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.610
 hello dear followers today in this 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.700
 video I'm going to be preparing some 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.340
 delicious mango lollipops 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.400
 I will be using 3 to 4 handles 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.760
 also the juice of half a lemon and I'm going to 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.790
 to be 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.890
 adding the milk cream if not 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.480
 they had milk cream they can use 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.720
 evaporated milk 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.640
 the amount of mango pulp depends 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.550
 the size of the mangoes that you 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.190
 how much do they want 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.160
 you do 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.260
 The first thing we are going to do is fight 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.480
 all the handles 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:10.560
 once we have removed the shell 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:14.270
 we are going to remove all the pulp and the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.270
 pulp we are going to chop it 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:22.210
 we are going to apply it so that if you 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.149
 he uses the device to make 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.420
 a mash of that fruit will make them more 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.420
 easy 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.950
 I have obtained approximately four 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.890
 mango pulp cups 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.009
 the mango is ripe but it is not very 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.530
 sweet so I 'm going to add 2 to 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.649
 3 tablespoons of sugar because like this 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.200
 is going to go to the freezer this I do not want that 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.229
 when they are frozen they feel it a 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.380
 little bland now we are going to add 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.869
 The juice of half a lemon 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.719
 what is going to be the lemon is going to be 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.060
 that the fruit does not turn dark and apart 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:07.409
 It will give you a good taste 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.110
 once we add the lemon juice 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.569
 we are going to use this gadget or if not 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.500
 have can you use a 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.209
 dad thinker or do it with the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.690
 fork with what you most 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.690
 accommodate 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.520
 since we have made mango pulp 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.210
 a puree now we are going to add more or 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.630
 less like three quarters of a cup and let's go 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.210
 to finish mixing once 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.500
 everything is well mixed that the mixture is 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:50.830
 it got really creamy let's look for a 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.620
 container that has a piquito 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.420
 to make it easier for us 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.580
 fill molds 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.860
 Look, you see how tremendous the 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.980
 preparation is for the milk that I am 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.980
 using 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.519
 now we just have to fill our 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.519
 molds 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.650
 and 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.159
 and 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.709
 and 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.709
 and 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.510
 already once we have filled all the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.069
 molds milestones 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.159
 if they did not have our molds 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.400
 can use the disposable cups 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:15.159
 with the wooden pallets or with the 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.889
 spoons or they can also fill us in 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.359
 sachets to make pacifiers the rest 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.699
 What's left I 'm going to put it 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.120
 in this tupper and they will see that it's going to 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:27.699
 leave a creamy ice cream once 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.460
 we have all this ready we are going to 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.310
 take to the refrigerator in the part 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.669
 of the freezer and we'll leave it there for 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.080
 about 23 45 hours and even can 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:43.060
 do the night before the other day and 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.780
 they are ready 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:51.370
 and to unmold we can make two 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:54.850
 things we can dip into the water in a 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.490
 container that has hot water or if 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.520
 They can not leave the room 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.940
 for a few minutes everything depends on how 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.280
 be the temperature in your kitchen 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.590
 you can also unmold it under jets 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.280
 of water you owe me how they look good 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.740
 creamy 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.639
 in my kitchen I was doing quite 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.220
 heat and I almost wanted to melt 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:28.250
 they see how creamy they are 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:31.190
