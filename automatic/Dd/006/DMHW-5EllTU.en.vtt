00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.359 
team to victory if you play well so
that's<00:01:46.560> where<00:01:46.740> I'm<00:01:46.799> getting<00:01:47.070> sort<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
that's where I'm getting sort of the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.950 
that's where I'm getting sort of the
commander<00:01:47.880> vibe<00:01:48.119> although<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> think<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.869> would

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
commander vibe although I think it would

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.690 
commander vibe although I think it would
be<00:01:49.020> cooler<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.860> was<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> kill<00:01:50.310> streak<00:01:50.430> I'd

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
be cooler if it was a kill streak I'd

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.429 
be cooler if it was a kill streak I'd
love<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> kill<00:01:51.420> streak<00:01:51.509> system<00:01:52.020> where

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
love to see a kill streak system where

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.490 
love to see a kill streak system where
you<00:01:52.619> know<00:01:52.710> five<00:01:53.070> kills<00:01:53.479> brings<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.229> a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
you know five kills brings in you know a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.039 
you know five kills brings in you know a
TIE<00:01:55.860> fighter<00:01:56.189> strike<00:01:56.610> 10<00:01:56.880> kills<00:01:57.210> brings<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.869> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
TIE fighter strike 10 kills brings in a

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.260 
TIE fighter strike 10 kills brings in a
Star<00:01:58.619> Destroyer<00:01:58.649> bombing<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.670> 15<00:01:59.969> kills

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
Star Destroyer bombing and 15 kills

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.330 
Star Destroyer bombing and 15 kills
allows<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.990> Darth<00:02:01.500> Vader<00:02:01.950> for<00:02:02.159> one

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
allows you to be Darth Vader for one

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.649 
allows you to be Darth Vader for one
life<00:02:02.579> or<00:02:02.820> something<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.360> think<00:02:03.450> it

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
life or something like that I think it

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.990 
life or something like that I think it
would<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:04.140> really<00:02:04.560> cool<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.579> there's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
would be really really cool so there's

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.399 
would be really really cool so there's
apparently<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.600> ability<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.990> toggle<00:02:07.170> between

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
apparently the ability to toggle between

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.499 
apparently the ability to toggle between
first<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.039> third<00:02:08.190> person<00:02:08.220> mode<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.300> old

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
first and third person mode the old

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.969 
first and third person mode the old
battlefront<00:02:10.020> games<00:02:10.200> focus<00:02:10.649> heavily<00:02:10.800> on

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
battlefront games focus heavily on

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.070 
battlefront games focus heavily on
third-person<00:02:11.640> modern<00:02:12.209> shooters<00:02:12.540> obviously

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
third-person modern shooters obviously

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.700 
third-person modern shooters obviously
are

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
are

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.410 
are
mainly<00:02:14.010> from<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.580> first-person

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
mainly from that first-person

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.210 
mainly from that first-person
perspective<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.680> ability<00:02:17.130> to

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
perspective so I like that ability to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.130 
perspective so I like that ability to
switch<00:02:17.490> back<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.730> forth<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.210> plan<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.780> play<00:02:19.020> the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
switch back and forth I plan to play the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.780 
switch back and forth I plan to play the
game<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.530> first-person<00:02:20.070> as<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.550> would<00:02:20.700> expect

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
game in first-person as I would expect

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.090 
game in first-person as I would expect
most<00:02:21.270> people<00:02:21.450> will<00:02:21.930> do<00:02:22.140> unless<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.680> controls

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
most people will do unless the controls

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.950 
most people will do unless the controls
are<00:02:23.310> odd<00:02:23.550> though<00:02:23.970> if<00:02:24.180> they're<00:02:24.570> like<00:02:24.720> Call<00:02:24.930> of

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
are odd though if they're like Call of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.780 
are odd though if they're like Call of
Duty<00:02:25.050> or<00:02:25.260> battlefield<00:02:25.700> first-person<00:02:26.700> would

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
Duty or battlefield first-person would

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.890 
Duty or battlefield first-person would
probably<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.390> way<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.510> go

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
probably be the way to go

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.390 
probably be the way to go
and<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.290> does<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.470> two-player<00:02:28.920> split-screen

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
and it does a two-player split-screen

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.270 
and it does a two-player split-screen
and<00:02:30.030> there<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.960> gonna<00:02:31.110> be<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.260> DLC<00:02:31.920> pack<00:02:32.130> that

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
and there is gonna be a DLC pack that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.400 
and there is gonna be a DLC pack that
comes<00:02:32.460> out<00:02:32.670> before<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.390> movie<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.200> gives

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
called again the battle of jakku and it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.350 
called again the battle of jakku and it
explores<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.130> moment<00:02:50.520> following<00:02:50.970> return<00:02:51.240> the

explores the moment following return the
Jedi<00:02:51.570> when<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.140> New<00:02:52.260> Republic<00:02:52.410> confronted

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
Jedi when the New Republic confronted

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.500 
Jedi when the New Republic confronted
Imperial<00:02:53.580> holdouts<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.090> previously

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
Imperial holdouts on the previously

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.170 
Imperial holdouts on the previously
unseen<00:02:55.020> Outer<00:02:55.290> Rim<00:02:55.650> Enclave<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.490> so<00:02:57.000> they're

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
unseen Outer Rim Enclave and so they're

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.460 
unseen Outer Rim Enclave and so they're
definitely<00:02:57.330> going<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.660> tie<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:57.870> into<00:02:58.320> the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
definitely going to tie this into the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.100 
definitely going to tie this into the
old<00:02:58.940> series<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.330> new<00:03:00.480> series<00:03:00.720> as<00:03:00.960> well

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
old series and the new series as well

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.780 
old series and the new series as well
and<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.380> seems<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.830> game<00:03:01.920> focus<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.460> more

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
and it seems like the game focus is more

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.870 
and it seems like the game focus is more
on<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.480> past<00:03:04.050> as<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:05.100> expansion<00:03:05.460> will<00:03:05.730> then

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
on the past as this expansion will then

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.130 
on the past as this expansion will then
lead<00:03:06.060> us<00:03:06.180> into<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.420> future<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.990> perhaps

lead us into the future and perhaps
future<00:03:07.590> DLC<00:03:08.130> packs<00:03:08.340> will<00:03:08.970> give<00:03:09.120> us<00:03:09.240> more<00:03:09.600> of

future DLC packs will give us more of
the<00:03:10.170> movie<00:03:10.560> stuff<00:03:10.860> because<00:03:11.190> it's<00:03:11.340> coming<00:03:11.490> out

the movie stuff because it's coming out

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.520 
the movie stuff because it's coming out
November<00:03:11.910> 17th<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.660> movie<00:03:12.990> releases<00:03:13.410> a

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
November 17th and the movie releases a

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.470 
November 17th and the movie releases a
month<00:03:14.010> later<00:03:14.280> they're<00:03:14.550> not<00:03:14.760> gonna<00:03:14.940> spoil<00:03:15.330> the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
month later they're not gonna spoil the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.180 
month later they're not gonna spoil the
storyline<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.170> locations<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.770> characters

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
storyline the locations the characters

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.830 
storyline the locations the characters
so<00:03:17.580> this<00:03:17.760> makes<00:03:18.030> sense<00:03:18.270> it<00:03:18.420> may<00:03:18.510> be<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.630> little

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
so this makes sense it may be a little

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.270 
so this makes sense it may be a little
disappointing<00:03:19.470> because<00:03:19.680> this<00:03:19.830> is<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.070> main

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
disappointing because this is the main

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.640 
disappointing because this is the main
game<00:03:20.520> tying<00:03:20.880> in<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.810> new<00:03:21.990> movie<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.560> the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
game tying in to the new movie and the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.070 
game tying in to the new movie and the
new<00:03:22.830> trilogy<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.030> think<00:03:24.570> that's<00:03:24.720> gonna<00:03:24.870> be

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
new trilogy but I think that's gonna be

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.190 
new trilogy but I think that's gonna be

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
right now it looks to be a very bowel

right now it looks to be a very bowel

gameplay which I do take issue with

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.340

sentiments supposedly they've seen a
seven<00:04:15.480> minute<00:04:15.570> demo<00:04:16.010> which<00:04:17.010> again<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.430> why

didn't we just get to see that would
have<00:04:18.900> been<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.140> cool

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830

but<00:04:20.130> another<00:04:20.489> interesting<00:04:20.910> point<00:04:21.450> about<00:04:21.690> this

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
but another interesting point about this

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.180 
but another interesting point about this
game<00:04:22.080> is<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.290> they<00:04:22.530> clearly<00:04:22.800> have<00:04:23.010> made

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
game is that they clearly have made

but<00:07:35.430> my<00:07:35.820> overall<00:07:36.000> take<00:07:36.420> is<00:07:36.540> that<00:07:36.660> I'm<00:07:36.750> super

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
but my overall take is that I'm super

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.810 
but my overall take is that I'm super
hyped<00:07:37.290> for<00:07:37.410> this<00:07:37.560> game<00:07:37.740> I'm<00:07:37.950> a<00:07:38.160> little<00:07:38.640> bit

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:38.820 
hyped for this game I'm a little bit

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.180 
hyped for this game I'm a little bit
concerned<00:07:39.080> based<00:07:40.080> on<00:07:40.290> its<00:07:40.440> super<00:07:40.770> close<00:07:40.980> ties

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:41.190 
concerned based on its super close ties

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.400 
concerned based on its super close ties
to<00:07:41.220> Battlefield<00:07:41.880> and<00:07:42.090> my<00:07:42.210> personal<00:07:42.780> distaste

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.410 
to Battlefield and my personal distaste

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.800 
to Battlefield and my personal distaste
for<00:07:43.620> that<00:07:43.950> franchise<00:07:44.760> but<00:07:45.120> we'll<00:07:45.600> wait<00:07:45.750> and

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:45.810 
for that franchise but we'll wait and

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.030 
for that franchise but we'll wait and
see<00:07:45.990> how<00:07:46.200> it<00:07:46.320> goes<00:07:46.350> I<00:07:46.620> wish<00:07:46.770> they<00:07:46.860> would've

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:47.040 
see how it goes I wish they would've

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.980 
see how it goes I wish they would've
