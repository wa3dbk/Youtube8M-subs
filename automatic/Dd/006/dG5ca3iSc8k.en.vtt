 I want this video in this guide 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.529
 explain briefly as with the small one 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.530
 funny swordsman from the master 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.790
 named belong to the find you can find around 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.620
 I will do this to you 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.330
 skills the championships the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.949
 rest his shoulders and his 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.050
 discuss this by playing if he does 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.240
 next time Michael played him 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.390
 So let's not lose time 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.170
 and directly with the skill states 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.210
 is the battle of the legend 9 seconds 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.309
 not in combat is regenerated in 0.5 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.930
 percent of its maximum HPG their 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.880
 second and that with yours 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.440
 Bearing time to get on your nerves 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.760
 rather in ski leaves him at his 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.710
 times lead next one salto from 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.510
 which reinforces his next blow 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.690
 is also bringing you a good one 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.820
 speed baff and 1 25 seconds stylus 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.200
 his ws a shield which you mean 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.070
 situation just fat times 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.320
 ass can save 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.420
 We now come to its ability to 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.430
 Ability is what makes the core 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.079
 namely spin to win 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.570
 in it sword swings around his own 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.239
 axle and will auto for this time 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.869
 shows not selectable 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.790
 Also, this in cribs and 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.159
 is incredibly good as marcel ability 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.680
 and media world to depart 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.320
 to grant ultimate sebastian justice 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.000
 This ability is an executed one 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.799
 is the less life has opponents 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.810
 and so more harm this skill 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.820
 You can calculate that approximately 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.950
 has energy to the others of his life 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.990
 and her ultimate open castings 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.970
 however, actually the institute such 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.670
 measure the darss ultimate pretty much the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.380
 biggest ksa ultima so try game 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.360
 your old mails on the go to the pillow 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.280
 to use it with the stereotypical 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.189
 of the normal gelsen player 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.380
 what are its capabilities 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.000
 against championships gerwens 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.890
 championships are on an adc 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.259
 that means I have one 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.270
 new 21 0 championships tree 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.600
 that is, I go here for the new 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.299
 left attack from around with sexy and 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.009
 to get armor 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.680
 in the defensive tree, you would do it all 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.380
 what armor magic resistance lives on 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.060
 and less harm offers that 's it 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.979
 So with the defensive championships 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.810
 wants to go over to his resting place 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.670
 Contrary to the championships use 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.590
 I have a very offensive fame 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.370
 I use the standard ones 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.930
 Armor deals around magic assistant clubs 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.720
 and in the market and queens I use 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.250
 flat ade this resting leaf offers me 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.989
 in combination with a shield what we 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.060
 percentage more armor money 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.520
 Resistance simply gives you one 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.410
 Giant heap of magicians is entrüst ag 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.130
 queens and marx harmonize great with 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.220
 my co 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.780
 which both escalate on ag with 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.489
 these defensive championships in 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.200
 this very offensive rum la twitter 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.670
 the messianic justice 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.150
 really nothing in the way 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.519
 well besides the charm in the picture and there is 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.650
 this god leike transition come to me 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.080
 we mostly in the picture I like to start with 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.430
 shoes and tripods shoes 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.130
 bring the combination to my cow 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.870
 just once at the beginning as much courage you 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.060
 speed that guarantees the first on the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.680
 label depending on how much money he returns 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.720
 comes back you get the first 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.790
 Three shoes and depending on the money we 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.500
 goes directly to a fake or stop the 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.269
 components of this field to solve 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.950
 on the top wayne always wades 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.600
 Helpful when the euro falls 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.549
 he writes about the frost hammer 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.260
 The frost always offers you but also 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.209
 in the first place live more which 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.160
 by means of passive incredibly good 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.340
 harmonizes when your post goes over 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.709
 to the box or the admin his error 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.019
 these three teams talk about the frosta was 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.030
 max and the admin recommender are 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.220
 essential for can and should therefore 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.690
 in any good picture like it 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.340
 if somebody thinks I have 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.340
 grammar problems can not the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.720
 I do not have peace if 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.820
 you also have a choir you go 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.980
 either over to the infiniti edge or to the 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.230
 my matthäus these are be found 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.269
 it's an offensive as he passes through 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.640
 her scribbles around it ag 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.280
 gets for a defensive style of play 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.959
 I recommend that times on times mortiers there 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.590
 this magician cad and a shield 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.790
 guaranteed the magical damage catches 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.609
 course items for the black at the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.530
 blood thirst and the sun panzer the 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.120
 situation on the part of yourself 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.350
 I would have to bring in, though 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.840
 say that for these three teams 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.209
 great on their work as her goodbye 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.310
 get life robbery and more armor 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.790
 you should have your own aging picture 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.370
 Find 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.290
 which touches your playing style 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.560
 I can give you tips as I like 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.600
 play games with them and thus also form them 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.190
 have also arrived for the style of play 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.050
 you have to say that imposes money 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.140
 that is he is intimate falls in the 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.580
 middle and his team weaves to victory in the 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.500
 early games should you care 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.450
 Focus with your cow ministers 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.080
 beware and let angela around 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.400
 then scare the enemy 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.900
 or to flee 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.120
 just be incredible now 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.920
 just hurt your share more 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.040
 can be super the media world 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.720
 clarify location and possibly also the 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.670
 lane push if you wanted to go back 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.640
 if you tried a site your 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.290
 constant in which you first him 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.460
 silence a shield activated around the 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.950
 to reduce damage 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.790
 euro in the face picture and if you 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.340
 then one third of his life 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.800
 Own your uli on it with it knock 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.870
 easy time off can you 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.370
 with money or intimate if 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.920
 you should be at the front 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.320
 because he lives more than your teamsprint on 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.180
 best a big amount into it 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.700
 you can deal potential damage 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.800
 but you can also absorb your adp 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.440
 this way to protect the kaarster 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.210
 in the endgame practically the same applies where 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.130
 We take care that there 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.900
 your uli preferably on the 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.820
 opposing cashier or carrie 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.700
 use it as fast as possible 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.390
 you go that's it for the first time 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.130
 from me 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.710
 I'm thankful for watching 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.780
 open to criticism and evaluation 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.030
 me about comments and i would say that 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.540
 until next time and I am now 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.540
 Out
