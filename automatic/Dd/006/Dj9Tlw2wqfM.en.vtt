00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:11.380
 [Music] 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.380
 hello to all guys a panic greeting 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.770
 and welcome back to this new south video 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.570
 east today Friday 12 to 10 am 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.250
 woke up and prepared for 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.020
 to be able to show you what is new 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.630
 set of purchases of the xoom vendor who 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.330
 arrives once a week in that 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.430
 tower then as you know from 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.489
 the release of this new dlc have been 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.570
 introduced new new dynamics 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.640
 in the purchase and enhancement of 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.440
 our exotic materials 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.350
 equipment or weapons 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.089
 let's start a little bit by bit like on 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.739
 this week is facing the 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.210
 manager remembered him and beside him 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.129
 Boulder quarter the crucible you can't 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.739
 make mistakes because here it is here 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.260
 let's immediately see then how well 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.879
 you know and if you don't know, I'll tell you 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.489
 I know you never saw my videos 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.530
 previous from the release of the dlc exor 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.110
 will sell equipment and weapons 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.850
 enhanced then stronger what 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.700
 it means that a single equipment 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.040
 will start from light and 30 for what concerns 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.530
 what the equipment means 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.390
 that if you decide to buy of 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.730
 replace your equipment 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.410
 exotic already existing with this one 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.080
 so what starts from light 30 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.830
 a maximum of light arrives 36 not there 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.450
 nothing will change on the level because the old ones 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.180
 exotic equipment reaches up to 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.860
 light 30 as maximum enhancement 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.690
 so this won't cause me any 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.400
 downgrade in your level 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.910
 character with regard to weapons 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.310
 instead sells as you see weapons that well 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.160
 start at 302 of attack come up 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.210
 a 331 here it will be so forever then 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.940
 henceforth the weapons that the nexus 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.610
 these values ​​will have this value of 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.650
 base attack always at the usual cost of 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.200
 17 strange coins and 13 for how much 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.580
 regards the equipment also came 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.010
 an exotic fragment what a is 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.810
 exotic fragment is that object which 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.390
 serves to maximize your skills 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.069
 here payments or exotic or exotic weapons 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.220
 I give you an example you see in the last one 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.810
 slot to enhance these this 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.209
 Class armor must have a 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.989
 exotic fragment and so also for the 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.739
 weapons 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.260
 as you see later we have the 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.330
 in grammelot ico 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.760
 the one that costs 23 light particles e 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.269
 which gives you the chance to find one 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.310
 class armor belonging to the 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.950
 your character is hoped otherwise 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.680
 you are unlucky to characters that you don't 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.959
 you own the most important part however it is 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.890
 this upgrade exotic armament 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:46.940
 this allows you to upgrade yours 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.829
 exotic objects that you already have 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.870
 for example on ros the death 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.069
 red the last word from the ass the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.870
 ice pick 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.609
 and so on for the equipment with 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.879
 which the particularity that they cost 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:03.980
 lumens and not strange coins and that 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.650
 they also need to have a 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.720
 exotic fragment to be able to buy it 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.230
 therefore the exotic fragments are 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.120
 very important whether you want to 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.250
 upgrade your armor or weapons either 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.319
 in case you would like to buy 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.180
 those upgraded so in short vi 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.989
 you have to study a whole strategy 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.500
 your 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.760
 to have equipment that does that 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.609
 meets all 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.660
 as much as possible your needs 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.099
 for example I am planning to 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.269
 definitely buy me the icebreaker 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:39.709
 and certainly also the spine because it is 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:41.959
 fundamental for a very strong weapon is 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.140
 fundamental for the new raid at the end 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.250
 of crotta because 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.680
 to abilities that make it 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.720
 very important to sell texture 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.760
 sells the usual things telemetrie for 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.760
 improve your skills faster 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.709
 things and so on and so on 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.200
 in short, and then sells this is not 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.270
 sacrifice that we will now buy there 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.650
 I say after a short while how short 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.380
 you see the dynamics are discreetly 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.390
 change then you will need to make a great one 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.760
 use of your exotic fragments of the 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.920
 your lumens of your strange coins 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.989
 I will publish a video tomorrow maybe 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.419
 let you see how to farm lumens then 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.950
 how to accumulate lumens in the shortest time 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.419
 possible those that are mine 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.610
 tips since lumens become 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.910
 very important from today after they were 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.530
 been a little bit let's say taken 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.120
 under-leg in the first part of destiny 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.620
 from today they become fundamental to be able to 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.940
 have a good stock to buy 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.200
 now exotic upgraded equipment 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.419
 it depends a little on your tastes 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.730
 I remember that the lumen limit is yes 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.560
 can own for 25,000 characters 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.630
 so also which dynamics will go one 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.280
 little bit in depth now let's talk 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.010
 of other things or this in the 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.140
 sacrifice which is the object you are 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.870
 will resolve the urn size 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.630
 of the sacrifice of eris purchase el 1 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.610
 sacrifice costs a strange coin e 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.729
 it should unlock other missions 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:08.380
 let's see now we buy 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:10.990
 for a strange coin and let's go to 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.280
 hand it over to see a 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.630
 little bit what we have here we are 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.060
 here it came from eris as you see 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.150
 you must deliver the urn probably 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.960
 we will unlock other sizes let's see 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.440
 collect their ashes we would have 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.030
 probably got new sizes 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.220
 in fact kill slaves with a rifle a 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.260
 melt with sun damage and collect 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.770
 their arms , death resets yours 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
 progress 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.060
 so we will probably have to go there 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.310
 a mission on the moon I already have in mind 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.280
 which I recommend you do the pri 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.490
 the first mission of the dlc the one on 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.919
 land where you will find us a lot of 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.110
 so that slaves resort to it 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.910
 a great way to do it but the point 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.740
 crucial of this video as I remind you 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.419
 they are also its enhancements 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.370
 let me know below what 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.960
 think of these new dynamics of 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.870
 destinies of the powerful power-ups 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.449
 of the purchase of materials 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.830
 exotic equipment and weapons do me 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.720
 know what your setup is 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.060
 character which you have what purchases 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.470
 programs in short, anything seen 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.819
 in mind we see each other 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.819
 video a panic greeting
