00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
just fired it up and I decided to do

some<00:00:52.350> sniping<00:00:52.739> first<00:00:53.160> time<00:00:53.340> I'd<00:00:53.460> done<00:00:53.640> some

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
some sniping first time I'd done some

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.299 
some sniping first time I'd done some
major<00:00:54.030> snapping<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.570> awhile<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.379> wasn't

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
major snapping in awhile and it wasn't

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.639 
major snapping in awhile and it wasn't
the<00:00:56.370> most<00:00:56.520> beast<00:00:56.820> round<00:00:57.120> ever<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the most beast round ever I was one of

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.470 
the most beast round ever I was one of
the<00:00:58.770> better<00:00:58.890> round<00:00:59.129> sniping<00:00:59.609> I've<00:00:59.730> ever<00:00:59.940> had<00:01:00.239> I

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the better round sniping I've ever had I

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.080 
the better round sniping I've ever had I
think<00:01:00.690> he<00:01:00.750> ended<00:01:00.899> up<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.289> 20<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.859> 9<00:01:02.100> which

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
think he ended up going 20 and 9 which

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.490 
think he ended up going 20 and 9 which
like<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.359> said<00:01:03.390> that's<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> best<00:01:04.170> round

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500

and<00:01:33.390> give<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.170> try<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.119> you<00:01:36.119> know<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
and give it a try and you know I have to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.010 
and give it a try and you know I have to
say<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.560> enjoying<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.100> new<00:01:38.220> maps<00:01:39.020> I

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
say I'm really enjoying the new maps I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.990 
say I'm really enjoying the new maps I
have<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.680> put<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> little<00:01:41.100> disclaimer<00:01:41.490> up<00:01:41.820> with

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
have to put a little disclaimer up with

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.649 
have to put a little disclaimer up with
that<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:44.220> whole<00:01:44.430> night<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.909> played<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.540> we

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that is the whole night we played and we

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.569 
that is the whole night we played and we
were<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:45.930> probably<00:01:46.229> good<00:01:46.680> three<00:01:47.100> hours<00:01:47.130> or

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
were on for probably good three hours or

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.450 
were on for probably good three hours or
so<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.540> only<00:01:48.899> maps<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.470> ever<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:50.189> got<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
so the only maps we ever really got to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.060 
so the only maps we ever really got to
play<00:01:50.670> was<00:01:51.000> drive-in<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.840> that's<00:01:52.500> pretty<00:01:52.950> much

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
play was drive-in and that's pretty much

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.830 
play was drive-in and that's pretty much
ninety-eight<00:01:53.670> percent<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.210> all<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> maps<00:01:54.659> we

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
ninety-eight percent of all the maps we

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.800 
ninety-eight percent of all the maps we
played<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.439> comes<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> new<00:01:56.040> ones<00:01:56.280> and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
played when it comes to the new ones and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.990 
played when it comes to the new ones and
and<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.229> wasn't<00:01:58.560> because<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.219> other<00:01:59.790> ones

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
and it wasn't because the other ones

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.520 
and it wasn't because the other ones
weren't<00:02:00.210> getting<00:02:00.570> voted<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.140> was<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> only

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
weren't getting voted that was the only

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770 
weren't getting voted that was the only
one<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.950> ever<00:02:01.979> came<00:02:02.399> up<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:03.240> was<00:02:03.299> always

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
one that ever came up it was always

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.119 
one that ever came up it was always
drive<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.219> then<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.700> older<00:02:05.969> maps

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
drive in and then one of the older maps

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.350 
drive in and then one of the older maps
occasionally<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> rare<00:02:08.700> instance<00:02:08.970> we

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
occasionally and on a rare instance we

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.260 
occasionally and on a rare instance we
would<00:02:09.509> get<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.869> play<00:02:10.200> hangar<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.670> think<00:02:12.180> we

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
would get to play hangar I think we

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.910 
would get to play hangar I think we
played<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.720> two<00:02:12.930> or<00:02:13.020> three<00:02:13.200> times

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
played that two or three times

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.070 
played that two or three times
and<00:02:14.040> then<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:14.790> played<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.209> one<00:02:15.660> time<00:02:15.900> this

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
and then we played this one time this

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.839 
and then we played this one time this
was<00:02:16.290> actually<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.680> very<00:02:16.860> last<00:02:17.160> match<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
was actually the very last match of the

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.479 
was actually the very last match of the
night<00:02:17.880> we<00:02:18.239> played<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:19.020> so<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.069> know<00:02:20.310> it

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
night we played and so you know it

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.240 
night we played and so you know it
actually<00:02:20.760> turned<00:02:20.970> out<00:02:21.060> being<00:02:21.270> pretty<00:02:21.450> good

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
actually turned out being pretty good

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.800 
actually turned out being pretty good
but<00:02:23.250> other<00:02:23.400> than<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.849> was<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.750> was

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
but other than that it was just it was

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.990 
but other than that it was just it was
driving<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.560> do<00:02:25.620> enjoy<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.190> map<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:26.670> you

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000

driving and I do enjoy the map but you
know<00:02:27.150> there<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.510> not<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> single<00:02:27.930> map<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.739> this

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
know there is not a single map on this

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.620 
know there is not a single map on this
game<00:02:29.190> nor<00:02:29.459> any<00:02:29.640> other<00:02:29.760> call<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.239> duty<00:02:30.450> game

that I want to play over and over and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.250 
that I want to play over and over and
over<00:02:32.459> again<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:33.420> why<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.569> personally<00:02:34.110> think

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.100 
know playing team deathmatch as I said
it's<00:02:56.130> just<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.610> game<00:02:56.790> mode<00:02:57.299> that<00:02:57.480> I'd<00:02:57.600> choose

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
it's just the game mode that I'd choose

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.990 
it's just the game mode that I'd choose
to<00:02:58.290> play<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.709> know<00:02:58.920> most<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.640> time<00:02:59.819> if

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
to play I know most of the time if

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.789 
to play I know most of the time if
you're<00:03:00.120> going<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.330> see<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> call<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.230> duty<00:03:01.260> video

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
you're going to see a call of duty video

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.150 
you're going to see a call of duty video
online<00:03:02.040> it's<00:03:02.700> not<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> team<00:03:03.959> deathmatch<00:03:04.410> for

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
online it's not a team deathmatch for

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.470 
online it's not a team deathmatch for
some<00:03:05.310> reason<00:03:05.580> people<00:03:05.760> kind<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.090> look<00:03:06.150> down<00:03:06.420> on

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
some reason people kind of look down on

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.990 
some reason people kind of look down on
the<00:03:06.780> mode<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.290> guess<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:07.709> because<00:03:08.000> it

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
the mode I guess it's just because it

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.970 
the mode I guess it's just because it
does<00:03:09.209> have<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.480> higher<00:03:09.780> tendency<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.560> campers

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
does have a higher tendency for campers

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.120 
does have a higher tendency for campers
