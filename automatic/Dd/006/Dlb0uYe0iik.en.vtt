00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 It's getting harder and harder to be funny 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.879
 I think yes today would be about it 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.950
 You can still why bring almost 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:14.519
 nothing more 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:16.710
 what to say about it loud and silly 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.539
 Rock'n roll but it is so why 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.490
 We also like people 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.689
 the thigh propose laugh 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.570
 right out of it 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.269
 we are all around here 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.010
 and make us look that way 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.529
 Something funny a field for the new 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.989
 program exception state exactly that 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.540
 hessian comedy duo mouth chair goes off 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.219
 october back on tour 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.510
 others have us and lars ever 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.000
 a taste for their new 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.410
 given program 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.340
 Speakers are both regions mobile 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.559
 are 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:55.050
 while Erich has radiators and all the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:01:00.440
 Of course, everyone is here through to 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.390
 example, a cocaine dispenser can 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.700
 Every item bought from a super 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.670
 you decide to make products 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.700
 she does not look so good at a big big one 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.870
 street therefore still offer one 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.700
 Strength 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.130
 here too the swarm of organic 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.770
 my fight also uses raw materials 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:32.380
 should be better at the organic swarm 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:36.940
 is that a few I have to think about 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:56.820
 appreciated float or optionally hunger 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:59.410
 I have his product in offer today 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:07.750
 costs together with the cocaine stalls 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:09.850
 with 409 and where do the two get 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.500
 the ideas for your gags and the comics 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.230
 are different characters ago 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.570
 many topics that the opponents on the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.250
 street lying around and some things 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.680
 You happen to be yourself too lately 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.959
 one drives into his often made golf 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.680
 so with me the street is pure one 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:36.230
 one way street 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.569
 a pace back against the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.120
 one-way street and I 'm straight 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.159
 from my profession store yes and there are 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.540
 also lend children money in the street 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.549
 had to stop sometime because 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.980
 Content of a counter came very great 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.840
 a little narrow streets and I think so 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.420
 knock the slice over and over them 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:01.000
 So first says one way street in one 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:10.400
 hundredth of a second what are you looking broken 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:12.079
 and with the disc about I believe that 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.549
 that will be a sketch but it still is 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.540
 many other things in the program we 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:34.310
 we did it anyway 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:37.180
 that it is so funny in the head 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.180
 has bitten 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:21.789
 what else is there so it will be 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.789
 In any case, super lady just so
