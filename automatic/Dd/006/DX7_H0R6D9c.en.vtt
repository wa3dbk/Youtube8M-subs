00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.390
 We are with Veronica Rioja, which is the 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.490
 director of the school choir 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.340
 Pablo Sixth tell us a little how 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.230
 the project of the escolanía arose 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.309
 good morning, because the escolanía del 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.410
 pablo school is this was an initiative 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.330
 of what was then director 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.330
 of the school in 2005 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.030
 and well, it occurred to her to do everything 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.270
 children who will sing a song 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.910
 more intensive way in that way then 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.130
 about 40 were selected 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.629
 elementary school children 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.430
 the dream is good because they have been growing 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.969
 and little by little they have been incorporated 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.470
 more and more voices to the choir up what 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.360
 which is today the choir of the coder 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.850
 sixth as children form it 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.070
 currently more are currently about 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.320
 eighty five that are divided into 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.180
 three levels primary secondary and the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.370
 local group that are two last years of 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.420
 high school the baccalaureate and university 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.420
 Celestial among college students 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.510
 there 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.140
 then a selection is made and 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.590
 fundamentally is of a test of 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.120
 life that once inside and as 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.250
 the sowings are sorting 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.350
 right now the children sing to their voices 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.200
 of our second most sopranos 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.200
 sopranos and contraltos there are more children 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.200
 that is more children forgive children 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.550
 Well, on the part of it is a 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.400
 activity that usually shows less 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.020
 but they also have 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.940
 in the handicap because when they reach 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.080
 secondary school changes their voice and being a 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.390
 chorus of white voices 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.300
 it's more complicated for them but good 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.630
 even so we do have four I think 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.150
 45 of the 80 and 54 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.610
 good you recorded an album tell me 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.610
 a little bit the idea of where it came from 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.640
 because the idea also came up for 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.590
 celebrate this anniversary that we have in 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.020
 the school has the 50th anniversary of 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.290
 pontificado of pablo sixth as a 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.940
 special activity and also for 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.920
 combine all the efforts of all these 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.319
 years in the choir we decided 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.280
 and record some of the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.280
 songs that we have 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:28.469
 what songs can we find in that 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.510
 cereal because there are songs from the 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.430
 first that the children sang the most 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.099
 small ones that now even the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.780
 university the most current songs 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.739
 the repertoire a bit of all the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.079
 religious and also profane directory 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:46.830
 tell me a little about the music selection 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:50.070
 that we have heard that we are going to listen 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.330
 the selection of music and consists a bit 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.310
 of all the repertoire that has gone 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.060
 collecting along all these 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.950
 years there is so much religious repertoire 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.660
 as profane repertoire or popular music 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.460
 throughout 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.320
 yesterday's concert can hear 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.350
 all the clues that we can nail in 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.400
 the record and set aside some music something 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.890
 more music that we are now putting together 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.680
 I do not know if with the escolanía I went to 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.480
 contests or you have come out to sing 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.819
 other sites that are not 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.530
 Ávila or the province 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.349
 well with courses unfortunately for 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.110
 these levels nationally just 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.540
 There is an idea that I do not know any 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.850
 but we did go out to give concerts to 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.660
 sing mass outside and well then we have 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.660
 been us 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.060
 for example in 2010 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.190
 let's see climate Cathedral 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.000
 of Santiago and the following year we went to 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.000
 sing mass 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.170
 in that line we have followed the years 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.970
 following we were in it 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.620
 of Fatima in Lisbon also in the 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.599
 function 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.769
 and this year we have also been with the 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.769
 group of elders there is nothing 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.290
 since moving the new enough 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.290
 and we 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.350
 I have untied you can point 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.120
 in principle they are children of whom 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.120
 this is clear 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.870
 and they are also now us 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.349
 what now they are no longer but that 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.349
 they contain 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.380
 I've seen 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.030
 knowing 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.280
 Well, what I see in the choir 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.790
 it would not be to continue apart from the music 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.950
 many visibility 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.590
 let's see them not only with the 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.610
 singer when we listen 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:55.130
 a lot to listen to later is a coexistence 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.130
 they get along very well 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.990
 be united the one who sings 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.720
 at the level he works two hours two weeks 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.720
 for home so we do some 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.890
 Sessions 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.890
 you can make songs true 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.970
 to make it more
