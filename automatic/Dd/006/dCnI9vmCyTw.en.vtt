00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 here is how to shoot here no 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.500
 no such stung cda 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.809
 but you can push your finger here knowing 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.590
 this little thing 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.990
 look so guys you know here 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.670
 fingers and a thumb I put pressure on 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.609
 unzip it and mount it right now I will show 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.910
 as she strengthened erase such uncomfortable 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.980
 the thing is how it is here for me 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.719
 I placed it here for me 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.160
 irony clung to these three 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.200
 it turns out notch gift with reverse 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.969
 sides three things three girls would have ice on 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.750
 this notch 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:52.190
 processor as taking here take again 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:55.199
 Now this zhelezyachku a little bit to the side and 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:03.059
 then up and a little bit back then 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:06.030
 upward we remove the processor please 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.390
 yes they are about 1 year of release 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.549
 it 's somewhere 2003 2002 year so here 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.979
 ca n't even get newer there by the way in 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.640
 little hippity 34 is written 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.990
 third to fourth year 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.939
 put back here 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.420
 difference how to become a cooling draw 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.869
 Attention 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.689
 see returns because she's here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.659
 gets here 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.090
 if you have this then you have 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.479
 This thing will interfere with the processor here 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.009
 so here with one percent someone thick 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:47.970
 turn on we have no need to latch 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:54.210
 there are three things here 3 here you 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:56.159
 latch why it happens but now where 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.460
 here we have the core of the thigh here here it is 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.740
 You see so little again 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.659
 apply thermal paste only on this 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.479
 part the whole process of ramazan on 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:13.910
 we have one before installing 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:17.390
 cooler back you should take a rag 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.459
 remove the old thermal grease from here and from here 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.290
 apply fresh thermal grease here and 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.959
 neatly smudge on the surface 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.150
 thin layer and then put cooling 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.370
 back someone doing 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.989
 and here and here but this is your business here I 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.860
 I can tell you nothing to advise 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:37.200
 this uka- uka will apply a lot of thermal paste 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.260
 bad of course will not be but the essence 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.519
 thermal grease what not to 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.610
 the processor was there more like an oil 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.670
 speaking up more there prepared for 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.500
 order to reduce the area that is 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.310
 increase the contact area between 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.250
 core and radiator i.e. small 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.980
 roughness that are on the core 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.450
 thermal grease fills these rough edges and 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.379
 CPU maximum tight to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.950
 the core of its entire surface if 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.870
 Thermal grease you have not fresh it with time 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.099
 starts to dry out losing its bandwidth 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.389
 heat transfer type deteriorates 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.919
 CPU temperature increases because 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:24.480
 that the radiator is not all warm with it 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:26.819
 takes that is, well, actually I personally 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.000
 I advise you so if your processor does not 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.980
 Heats you there not to climb and 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.049
 if the temperature rises starts 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.970
 overheat beeps warns of 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.630
 overheating the dao should be removed change 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.450
 thermal grease 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.730
 well, usually three times a year this is done if 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.989
 perros opened then you more often 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.650
 well be someone like here I have two years already but I 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.650
 I do not touch
