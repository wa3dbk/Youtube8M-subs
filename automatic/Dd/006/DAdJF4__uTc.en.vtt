00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 perfect &amp; lt 3 today I made a perfect support using this one 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.999
 pay method to pay pays off or. perfect photo hd anyway games 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.789
 and here is another fun art spot attack 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.409
 in fact I know a method 

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:35.960
 fantastic for making drawings that we have inside 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.880
 yes it is the day that you don't believe in the night then look after this 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.780
 this is the day it's real 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.820
 here is the night 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.370
 cute and and to do it 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.570
 we need only 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.960
 of a clasp like this edit2 round cards 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.060
 stand by 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.720
 rts 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.359
 take a dish drawn in the outline on a thick sheet of paper 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.359
 act of thin cardboard 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.010
 . ok 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.340
 now let me teach the center of the circle by measuring with a ruler or using 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.500
 a compass 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.500
 Toobe 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.939
 then very gently with a sharp pencil 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.450
 drill a hole in this central point 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.539
 using a plasticine ball to protect the underlying surface 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.480
 seats 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.650
 after that 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.650
 alitalia tel 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.830
 when I press, I cut this first circle 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.090
 we make another exactly the same and so we will have 2 macula 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.590
 let's put aside on the first draw a scene that takes place outdoors 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.290
 important thing to remember and draw the horizon line below 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.510
 above the hole you see here how 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.420
 as I told you above all, drawing the horizon but remember to do it 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.740
 always above the ground 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.610
 drawing a very simple outdoor dinner you could make a drawing 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.950
 set in campania maybe put some bush in it 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:17.219
 a small house 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.930
 in short, draw everything you want as long as the horizon is there 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.499
 above the central hole 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:27.509
 add other details and your country representation a small gate 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.509
 in wood and even wild flowers 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:36.489
 neither 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.219
 quick I make a daisy 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:43.779
 when the drawing completed in hotel color using felt-tip pens or pencils 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:46.779
 painting 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:50.979
 Milan 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.830
 Let's run all the design but remember 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.810
 not to touch the sky because when we finish it we should take this off 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.620
 part in order to have a design without sky but don't worry because 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.000
 we will draw the sky on the other circle or better our skies 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.870
 draw a line along the center of our second circle 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.870
 this time making it pass through the hole 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:18.209
 so need a sky by day in the upper half 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.209
 put the sun on 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.809
 a couple of little clouds 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.719
 and maybe even some little birds 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:34.129
 at this point to turn it around because you draw a night sky in the 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.549
 half remaining here put the moon there 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.549
 and even a few stars 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.319
 ii 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.499
 maps 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:49.449
 role 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.110
 when you are satisfied 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.110
 colored both signs 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:02.599
 and here is a beautiful morning sky the high sun maybe even hot there are 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.070
 two seagulls flying 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.310
 and what do you think of this starry moonlit night you think 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.310
 the stars and I made them shine using a silver marker now 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.360
 this design of the skies we have to superimpose the first drawing that 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.810
 of the farm then we take the clasp and let it pass 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.730
 through the two holes we practiced before we kill 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.360
 and we open it 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.150
 it's ready 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.530
 look at this is ours 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.720
 farm by day and attention with a platinum move night fell but 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.580
 of course we can make many different cremes for example of this 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.160
 city ​​also see here is a day full of sun and then I see 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.979
 we had because everyone goes to sleep 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.430
 but we can also simulate a climate change look here 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.990
 this jungle there is a rainbow the sun and then suddenly it comes and goes 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.460
 from mine use then guys try to make drawings where there is 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.500
 the day but also the night unfortunately for today the attacks of art are 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:05.419
 finished here see you in the next episode I'll wait eh hello
