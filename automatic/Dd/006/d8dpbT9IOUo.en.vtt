00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
arm is going to have an energy weapon

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.330 
arm is going to have an energy weapon
system<00:01:16.420> on<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:16.750> there<00:01:16.960> it's<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.350> more<00:01:17.740> weather

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
system on it there it's a more weather

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.820 

just<00:01:50.740> through<00:01:50.980> some<00:01:51.310> primer<00:01:52.440> here<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.650> there

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
just through some primer here and there

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.740 
just through some primer here and there
on<00:01:54.100> it<00:01:54.280> because<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.610> was<00:01:56.910> getting<00:01:57.910> a<00:01:57.970> tad<00:01:58.210> rusty

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
think I'm going to still go with the

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.460 
think I'm going to still go with the
paint<00:05:38.980> scheme<00:05:39.220> with<00:05:39.639> the<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:40.150> black<00:05:40.389> and<00:05:40.470> dark

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470

paint scheme with the the black and dark
flat<00:05:42.460> gray<00:05:42.820> in<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.240> end<00:05:43.389> and<00:05:43.570> then<00:05:43.660> maybe<00:05:43.840> some

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080
