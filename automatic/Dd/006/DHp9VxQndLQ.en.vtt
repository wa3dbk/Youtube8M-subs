00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
is the best way to do it there are two

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.740 
is the best way to do it there are two
steps<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.520> first<00:00:50.550> step<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.449> all

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
steps the first step is going to all

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.020 
steps the first step is going to all
your<00:00:51.899> views<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.590> set<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.039> status<00:00:53.340> bar<00:00:53.579> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
your views and set in the status bar to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.979 
your views and set in the status bar to
unspecified<00:00:55.219> that<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.489> will<00:00:56.579> make<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
unspecified that that will make the

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.680 
unspecified that that will make the
status<00:00:57.989> bar<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.890> disappear<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.609> top<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
status bar this disappear at the top and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.150 
status bar this disappear at the top and
then<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> second<00:01:01.350> step<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.590> need<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> go<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
then the second step you need to go to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.789 
then the second step you need to go to
your<00:01:02.309> pee<00:01:02.550> list<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.750> set<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
your pee list and then set it so the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.740 
your pee list and then set it so the
status<00:01:05.400> bar<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.790> hidden<00:01:06.180> throughout<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
status bar is hidden throughout the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.260 
status bar is hidden throughout the
whole<00:01:06.900> application<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.710> will<00:01:07.920> not<00:01:08.040> show<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.270> so

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
whole application so will not show up so

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.030 
whole application so will not show up so
we<00:01:09.390> start<00:01:09.570> by<00:01:09.750> step<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
we start by step one and it's going to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.160 
we start by step one and it's going to
our<00:01:11.250> view<00:01:11.520> control<00:01:11.909> I've<00:01:12.060> got<00:01:12.210> newb<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:13.110> you

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
our view control I've got newb now you

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.810 
our view control I've got newb now you
all<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.890> involved<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.640> each

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
all have to do this involved for each

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.030 
all have to do this involved for each
view<00:01:15.330> individually<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.590> 20

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
view individually so if you have 20

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.890 
view individually so if you have 20
views<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> happen<00:01:18.479> where<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
views it's going to happen where you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.630 
views it's going to happen where you
have<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.320> 20<00:01:19.650> times<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.189> each<00:01:20.310> one

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
have to do with 20 times for each one

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.120 
have to do with 20 times for each one
may<00:01:21.630> take<00:01:21.840> some<00:01:22.049> time<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> end<00:01:22.920> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
may take some time but in the end it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.120 
may take some time but in the end it
will<00:01:23.220> make<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:23.790> application<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.540> lot<00:01:24.810> better

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
will make your application a lot better

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.289 
will make your application a lot better
so<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.340> makes<00:01:26.490> leave<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.880> control<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
so if this makes leave you control to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.460 
so if this makes leave you control to
load<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:28.340> should<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.460> done<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:29.820> may<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.060> good

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
load up should be done there may be good

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.200 
load up should be done there may be good
now<00:01:31.470> at<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> moment<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.579> status<00:01:32.909> bar<00:01:32.970> is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
now at the moment here the status bar is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.020 
now at the moment here the status bar is
set<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.630> gray<00:01:34.009> do<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.070> simply<00:01:35.400> click<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
set to gray do you simply click that and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.030 
set to gray do you simply click that and
to<00:01:36.240> unspecified<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.590> should<00:01:37.799> hide<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
to unspecified and that should hide the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.219 
to unspecified and that should hide the
status<00:01:38.549> bar<00:01:38.579> there<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.479> that's<00:01:39.780> done<00:01:40.020> there

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
status bar there so that's done there

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.870 
status bar there so that's done there
for<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> view<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.100> all<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.460> needed

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
for the view and that's all it's needed

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.280 
for the view and that's all it's needed
so<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.600> seem<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> save<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.680> quick<00:01:45.290> so

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
so we seem to save that and quick so

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.319

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.160 
it's needed for hiding the status bar so
we<00:02:31.530> simply<00:02:31.920> build<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.460> run<00:02:32.930> there'll<00:02:33.930> be<00:02:33.960> no

we simply build and run there'll be no
problems<00:02:34.590> at<00:02:34.770> all<00:02:34.800> because<00:02:35.160> we<00:02:35.880> have<00:02:36.030> put<00:02:36.300> no
