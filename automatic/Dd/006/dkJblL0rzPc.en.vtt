00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
if you're going to do that I'd recommend

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.680 
if you're going to do that I'd recommend
going<00:02:37.989> 640<00:02:38.989> x<00:02:39.290> 360<00:02:40.130> i<00:02:40.220> believe<00:02:40.519> is<00:02:41.090> that's<00:02:41.450> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
going 640 x 360 i believe is that's the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.840 
going 640 x 360 i believe is that's the
biggest<00:02:41.989> space<00:02:42.380> for<00:02:42.620> HD<00:02:42.980> under<00:02:43.220> youtube<00:02:43.610> and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
biggest space for HD under youtube and

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.509 
biggest space for HD under youtube and
then<00:02:44.660> also<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:45.049> can<00:02:45.470> go<00:02:45.620> under<00:02:45.830> options<00:02:46.310> you

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
then also you can go under options you

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.850 
then also you can go under options you
can<00:02:46.610> go<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.790> cursor<00:02:47.239> options<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.989> this<00:02:48.200> way<00:02:48.410> um

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
can go to cursor options and this way um

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.590 
can go to cursor options and this way um
when<00:02:49.459> you're<00:02:49.610> actually<00:02:49.790> showing<00:02:50.120> your<00:02:50.269> cursor

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
when you're actually showing your cursor

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
and pointing out things you can

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.280 
and pointing out things you can
highlight<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:53.390> more<00:02:53.600> noticeable<00:02:54.140> and

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
highlight it so it's more noticeable and

options again and you can do enable auto
auto<00:03:01.610> pan<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.299> that<00:03:02.390> actually<00:03:02.570> makes<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.140> so

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
auto pan and that actually makes it so

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.009 
auto pan and that actually makes it so
as<00:03:04.459> you're<00:03:04.940> going<00:03:05.239> around<00:03:05.450> as<00:03:05.780> you're<00:03:05.930> moving

as you're going around as you're moving

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.259 
as you're going around as you're moving
along<00:03:06.350> your<00:03:06.560> screen<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.070> actually<00:03:07.280> follows

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
along your screen it actually follows

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.660 
along your screen it actually follows
your<00:03:08.540> mouse<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.500> actually<00:03:09.680> records<00:03:10.250> them

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
your mouse so it actually records them

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.940 
your mouse so it actually records them
wherever<00:03:11.269> you're<00:03:11.540> moving<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:12.260> with<00:03:12.799> that

wherever you're moving to and with that

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:13.930 
wherever you're moving to and with that
it's<00:03:13.220> not<00:03:13.340> going<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.580> make<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.730> difference

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
it's not going to make a difference

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.400 
it's not going to make a difference
under<00:03:14.209> your<00:03:14.420> full<00:03:14.750> screen<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.320> can
