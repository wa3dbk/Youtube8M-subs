00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.080
 moin moin dear people and sincerely 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.780
 Welcome to a new wwe champion 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.010
 spotlight and today we are looking at each other here 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.880
 yes so 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.170
 it is a new billion champion of 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.760
 for the top line or for jungle 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.010
 we can now we can 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.960
 short the jobs look from him and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.890
 things that I still fabricate here 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.010
 he thinks he looks pretty pretty 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.650
 pretty easy out of it or you his 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.040
 Fleet dierlamm play is like and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.540
 at yahoo so yes so yes so now 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480
 We have reason once when he is here 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.690
 106 he gets full here at one 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.030
 Attack by the champion or monster 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.890
 he gets a shield if he because 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.020
 pick up the passive we have once 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.149
 that he is charging and bonus script 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.379
 on the ku we have that he gets one 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.320
 if you look in the range times in 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.760
 a very small reach of the match 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.670
 so can distribute a sword prank 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.890
 is that on the w he warned you 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.719
 which can produce this welz intercept 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.790
 we have a run once on the e 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.470
 threshing and the multi is a run 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.210
 of which in connection with the kugl 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.229
 So we have to be able to take action 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.330
 Let's see that we quote the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.189
 You can get luxem once the way 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.439
 did you see the multi with it 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.119
 intercepted neither with abfahren 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.770
 can here once what its on 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.450
 it works only every seven 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.580
 seconds of culture and much 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.100
 is shorter so now we show once 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.110
 the multi in three seconds so that three times 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.970
 The kiss made by throw the air 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.450
 and then we have the period we would have 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.829
 they now have to attack what is now 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.170
 was interrupted by the stand in front 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.880
 But all that uses it anyway 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.079
 we can do it again soon 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.479
 delete it 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.180
 now provides still here today hurt 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:50.479
 make necessary more shoot the tower 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.479
 But even the glass broken as so wild 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.210
 the normal the base as well 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.890
 You have to say three times at the first one 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.259
 and second hit makes this bullets or 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.670
 match and the third time he hits 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.689
 then the opponent in the air 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.090
 I buy so I now have just 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.800
 life bought buy normal life with it 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.030
 we can show a little something here 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.690
 then not so much the human have 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.310
 That's why I do not have any 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.690
 reasonable old cooks we do not 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.300
 rectors and a bit here 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.040
 the effect form is dubbed 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.630
 Although the third time he will be the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.870
 opponent hit the air 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.400
 while you have to blow it up 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.870
 then press the multi and there you have 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.090
 yes really only one second then 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.319
 be for and important cage or 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.600
 Otherwise , you have to have something 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.430
 be pretty fast in itself 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.950
 that works pretty well 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.690
 just the bad luck that the luxury 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.299
 had now hit our shield 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.970
 in between or on occasion should now here 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.380
 we can jump on it at first 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.430
 we have the first good on it 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.900
 the second on the third and in the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.120
 time we can jump up then 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.739
 hit the opponent like floor and have 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.310
 in the del match have high 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.079
 thrown 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.190
 can they because of this for the 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.109
 next seven seconds it is 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.030
 behind the currently disabled because 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.640
 we can have marked the enemy there 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.290
 again throw high and can it 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.640
 So it's already done 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.290
 pretty cool this champion likes 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.060
 me also very good being natural 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.459
 in the champion here must pay attention 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.410
 you really have to come from the things 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.040
 can you see the cool educator 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.140
 Now almost everything is scrapped here 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.579
 2.8 seconds we have 24 seconds here 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.290
 but that's a pretty good sign 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.600
 we have just seen we have 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.579
 We can intercept their multi with it 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.230
 have zero comma a second so here 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.459
 you can already between the units 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.109
 Jump back and forth as you like 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.280
 can be here now 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.530
 then take that thing 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.359
 to demonstrate millions because you 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.799
 Really because you can use every unit though 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.630
 only once every seven seconds 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.250
 Jump in if you have a bunch of families 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.400
 Of course you can go through that 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.430
 Jump to the desired day and that 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.470
 I'm pretty pretty op 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.269
 what else is the mails come exactly that 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.640
 You can just give it a try 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.500
 we again our sign out 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.569
 have been able to leave the multi with it 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.280
 you will turn we can jump 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.870
 can jump at the looks yet 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.790
 jump on it so jump 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.910
 already pretty good so we have 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.200
 do our job again we have 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.110
 not quite hit were piece too far 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.100
 path 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.420
 start even more 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.220
 There you can do the multi again 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.100
 we throw it up and then we can 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.090
 in the period 1 404 I have to do 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.090
 now waste here 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.240
 in between if anything else 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.740
 she does not do it at the moment 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.150
 but it's really you have to me 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.980
 I know her with the champion show 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.780
 I find and lost that in 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.620
 our points to the end but thank you 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.240
 to watch me 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.130
 we have a short insight into the 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.720
 I get to find him pretty much 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.919

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.450
