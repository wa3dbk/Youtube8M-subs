00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:09.799
 Today we start with a kind of two 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.799
 knit right two left 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:20.789
 We start with the mismatch control 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:23.010
 on position five double bed the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.269
 position slider and push the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.560
 down here in the double bed apa 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:33.890
 Now we make the knit steps 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.890
 0 1 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:01:02.359
 now we push in the double bed 32 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.880
 mesh rather than 32 mesh and left 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:11.150
 in the b position 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:21.320
 we seal the seal and top 6 32 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:21.320
 32 left we take this needle slate 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:35.700
 with 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 and push the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.049
 third the sixth the ninth so theirs 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.049
 third needle in a 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.980
 with me are now animated needles 33 31 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:56.400
 on the left side to 29 30 more often 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:02:05.380
 right and create 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:09.160
 Let's start with the direct first 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.910
 that the first personal 32 in a 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:24.400
 is pushed so we start with 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:30.250
 31 30 and end with needle 7 20 and 28 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:32.800
 starts at the lower double bed two names 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.880
 earlier due to the main person's main 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:45.820
 bed is at the end 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:47.739
 on both sides now the second to her 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.200
 provide the offset control on 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:56.549
 Double bed down to the big lever 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:03:00.959
 turn on 4 with the grace now all 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:04.110
 so that they can not touch 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.090
 Now we pull on the lower nail bed 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.700
 a march namely exactly one needle 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.220
 the me as well as the nail between 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.660
 the main bed is so with me 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:20.350
 needle 30 1 1 33 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.709
 so a gap then let one after 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.709
 front 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:38.080
 So now we push idle 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:42.290
 over all needles are ready 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:49.100
 i take my stop thread or 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:53.300
 bathe and drink a drink once 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:04:02.150
 after I complain the drive as always 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:05.500
 with a clothespin and stop 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.500
 company as before 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:27.710
 I only use picking 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:36.830
 at 40 if it 340 so now with me 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.660
 because we both argued on Rundstrecken 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.060
 that is to say, the stride is strict 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.419
 sled is left so at the main 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.220
 tricks suffered the left button and the 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:51.900
 Double bed tricks the right party 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:05:07.080
 still we take now envious of 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:09.330
 mesh was far 3 on both sides that was 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.729
 the stroke could be we can now 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.770
 to adjust 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.659
 our mesh size we need it 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.009
 use a normal dry gear 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.500
 what do you do with me when hiking? 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.380
 I can shop in the shop myself 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.240
 have a red tone here and go 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.620
 I catch two at two right two 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:32.520
 join the left side 6 so constantly 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:37.860
 both argued at 6 1 and read a drink 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:40.229
 I set it up like this before now 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.669
 you have to do the last one 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:48.050
 Although around the linear and the needle we 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:50.099
 earlier on the double in addition to the 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:57.449
 have pushed position 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:06:04.320
 We are now hanging on the first one 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:08.270
 nail on the main path now make the 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.270
 Offset control on the double bed again 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.590
 Now you can see that the needle is more accurate 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:16.370
 wings are so where here the 1 1 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.370
 double flat 2 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.820
 and now you can go back and forth 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:38.160
 two right before left stretch I show 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:40.670
 that again with 2 1 1 counter to 0 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.670
 02
