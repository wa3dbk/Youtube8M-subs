all right so this is my John Deere 190
LT<00:00:07.379> 190<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:08.010> I'm<00:00:08.179> converting<00:00:09.179> the

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
LT 190 that I'm converting the

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.589 
LT 190 that I'm converting the
four-wheel<00:00:09.690> drive<00:00:10.759> just<00:00:11.759> got<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> 6-speed

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
four-wheel drive just got a 6-speed

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.350 
four-wheel drive just got a 6-speed
peerless<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> front<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.519> steering

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
peerless in the front in the steering

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.380 
peerless in the front in the steering
hubs<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:18.050> six-speed<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.320> back<00:00:19.520> and

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.670 

basically<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:25.019> way<00:00:25.109> I'm<00:00:25.199> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> drive<00:00:25.650> it

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
basically the way I'm going to drive it

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.800 
basically the way I'm going to drive it
I<00:00:26.070> want<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.519> make<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.670> double<00:00:27.029> pulley<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
I want to make a double pulley on the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.910 
I want to make a double pulley on the
back<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.410> make<00:00:29.099> its<00:00:29.250> own<00:00:29.400> clutch<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.560> that

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
back and make its own clutch so that

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.000 
back and make its own clutch so that
drives<00:00:32.219> off<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.969> back<00:00:33.120> pulley<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.170> they'll

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
drives off the back pulley so they'll

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.620 
drives off the back pulley so they'll
both<00:00:35.160> work<00:00:35.399> off<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.790> same<00:00:35.850> clutch<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
both work off of the same clutch on the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.690 
both work off of the same clutch on the
front<00:00:38.870> let<00:00:39.870> made<00:00:42.500> made<00:00:43.500> these<00:00:43.680> brackets<00:00:43.980> on

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
front let made made these brackets on

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.069 
front let made made these brackets on
the<00:00:44.760> front<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.239> bolt<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> frame

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the front the bolt right to the frame

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.720 
the front the bolt right to the frame
and<00:00:46.379> then<00:00:47.219> bolt<00:00:47.460> right<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.320> hubs

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.049 

for<00:00:54.329> shifters<00:00:54.780> I'm<00:00:55.489> just<00:00:56.489> gonna<00:00:56.670> run<00:00:57.140> cable

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
for shifters I'm just gonna run cable

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.119 
for shifters I'm just gonna run cable
basic<00:01:00.059> an<00:01:00.239> aircraft<00:01:00.659> cable<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.739> from<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
shifter out there and just connect it to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:14.930 
shifter out there and just connect it to
the<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:07.170> back<00:01:07.320> underneath<00:01:13.640> yeah

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
the one on the back underneath yeah

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.730 
the one on the back underneath yeah
track<00:01:15.630> has<00:01:15.810> got<00:01:16.020> uh<00:01:17.119> 18<00:01:18.119> horsepower<00:01:18.390> Kawasaki

she's gotten a sound here when she's

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.760 
she's gotten a sound here when she's
straight<00:01:24.450> piped<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.930> opened<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:27.679> and<00:01:28.679> then

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
straight piped and opened up and then

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.289 
straight piped and opened up and then
rid<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.789> steering<00:01:31.009> hi<00:01:32.009> Scott<00:01:32.369> lengthen<00:01:33.149> those

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
rid of steering hi Scott lengthen those

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.630 
rid of steering hi Scott lengthen those
bars<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:33.899> and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:36.979> change<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.429> hubs

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
bars out and then change the hubs

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.469 
bars out and then change the hubs
they're<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:40.110> change<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.409> hubs<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.520> gotta

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
they're not change the hubs but I gotta

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.249 
they're not change the hubs but I gotta
move<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.110> mounting<00:01:43.830> point<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.490> tie<00:01:44.670> rod

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
move the mounting point for the tie rod

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.080 
move the mounting point for the tie rod
and<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:46.830> too<00:01:47.039> much<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:50.490> hubs<00:01:50.700> they

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and that's not too much the hubs they

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.719 
and that's not too much the hubs they
got<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.420> bronze<00:01:51.659> bushings<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.380> them<00:01:52.729> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
got the bronze bushings in them and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:02.719 
got the bronze bushings in them and
greasable<00:01:54.600> u-joints<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:00.390> yeah<00:02:01.579> it's<00:02:02.579> my

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
greasable u-joints so yeah it's my

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.259 
greasable u-joints so yeah it's my
project<00:02:02.969> right<00:02:03.390> now<00:02:07.789> now<00:02:08.789> that's<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.149> she

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
project right now now that's what she

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.460 
project right now now that's what she
looks<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.539> with<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> tires<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.259> it

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
looks like with the tires on it

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.670 
looks like with the tires on it
it's<00:02:10.920> nice<00:02:11.160> wide<00:02:11.459> stance<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:13.320> they<00:02:13.410> got<00:02:15.680> three

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
it's nice wide stance and they got three

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.979 
it's nice wide stance and they got three
bolt<00:02:16.920> hub<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.700> tires<00:02:17.940> actually<00:02:18.390> bullet<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.780> so

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
bolt hub and tires actually bullet on so

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.240 
bolt hub and tires actually bullet on so
it'd<00:02:19.079> be<00:02:19.140> nice<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.470> easy<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.769> change<00:02:19.950> them<00:02:20.130> if

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
it'd be nice and easy to change them if

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:30.620 
it'd be nice and easy to change them if
I<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:22.579> yeah

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.760 

just<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.750> little<00:02:31.900> bit<00:02:32.110> whiter<00:02:32.290> than<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.620> back

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
just a little bit whiter than the back

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.940 
just a little bit whiter than the back
though<00:02:33.040> it's<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.430> only<00:02:33.550> problem
