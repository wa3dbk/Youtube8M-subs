bring our our charge 'uncle and the
outlet<00:01:50.250> adapter<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.750> doubles<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.470> not<00:01:53.100> only

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
outlet adapter this doubles is not only

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.569 
outlet adapter this doubles is not only
that<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.390> battery<00:01:54.780> backup<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.340> plug

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
that but a battery backup so we can plug

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.209 
that but a battery backup so we can plug
it<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.450> example<00:01:57.479> i've<00:01:58.200> got<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.649> an

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
it in so for example i've got a an

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.609 
it in so for example i've got a an
electric<00:01:59.969> cord<00:02:00.240> right<00:02:00.479> here<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.020> I'll<00:02:01.439> just

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
electric cord right here and I'll just

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.880 
electric cord right here and I'll just
plug<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.219> bolt<00:02:02.460> right<00:02:02.850> into<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.600> now<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
plug the bolt right into that and now it

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.059 
plug the bolt right into that and now it
is<00:02:04.950> charging<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.060> bolt<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.630> my<00:02:07.259> phone<00:02:07.649> at<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
is charging the bolt and my phone at the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.290 
is charging the bolt and my phone at the
same<00:02:08.280> time<00:02:08.580> now<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.720> will<00:02:09.929> go<00:02:10.080> ahead<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:11.300> and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
same time now it will go ahead and and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.550 
same time now it will go ahead and and
bypass<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.200> bat

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
bypass the bat

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.390 
bypass the bat
and<00:02:14.030> just<00:02:15.030> run<00:02:15.540> current<00:02:15.989> straight<00:02:16.349> from<00:02:16.680> your

and just run current straight from your

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.320 
and just run current straight from your
electrical<00:02:18.140> into<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.260> phone<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.700> charge<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
electrical into the phone and charge the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.510 
electrical into the phone and charge the
battery<00:02:21.630> at<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> same<00:02:22.020> time<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.800> when<00:02:23.370> it's

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
have to charge the device itself and

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.690 
have to charge the device itself and
then<00:03:07.140> carry<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.620> with<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.310> problem
