00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.149
 tosar you can operate the automated rosemary house 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.400
 vega 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.279
 guatemala was counting on the endorsement 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.589
 all the citizens 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.550
 for the day January 2 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.829
 each 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.439
 in majadahonda 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.839
 granma 9 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.380
 I do not know if he went out of the house and lined up he imitated him to carry or he is not 

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.340
 connected to alert my phone until then you can say is that my 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.789
 phone can do several things then call it the case of ana 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.890
 barbarian person were download the image of those who 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.920
 The oldest is one of my children who has forgotten the key to everything and the marseille 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.490
 with my phone because I can not control the door and not let them through 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.490
 nothing 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.660
 then computers of the future twitch the environment 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.210
 so that within ten years the computers or will be objects that 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.520
 We move from one place to another state of our glasses by launching images 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.520
 directly to our region hernÃ¡n 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.660
 also following an old tendency in the world of computers things 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.630
 they are getting smaller 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.760
 much smaller than this will happen to you is working on a computer 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.480
 molecular doctor are very full plan to use molecules instead of 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.010
 ones and electric zeros to operate a computer of course 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.060
 a switch is something that its essence 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.630
 I wanted to win so if you think about a wall of switches people talk 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.740
 of the mechanism of pushing a button that is called flip-flop computing postures 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.539
 the way in which molecules are modified is simply by 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.190
 form discharge are made when they have a way they are lit faith when 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.189
 they have another way they are off 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.100
 world an electric current could squeeze the mechanical switch 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.680
 turning it into the fundamental mechanism of digital computing 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.940
 but how does everything connect 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.850
 I like to see how we work hard in what is known 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.310
 in the scientific community as kits to assemble oneself and in others 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.220
 cd words we knew it would be too expensive and very very difficult to 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.730
 build on tiny streets the size of molecules using the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.649
 Standard techniques of lithography and engraving known in China will improve 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:24.239
 hood Dr. Williams and his associates developed molecular cables 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.159
 parallel each of the atoms recounted and eight atoms wide 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:35.429
 it turns out that they do not plan and write these cables we did not tell them where 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:37.360
 they had to get some more case 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.810
 essentially we deposit a small amount of evidence of a supposed 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.180
 acquisition we will tell it and there was a chemical reaction between 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.880
 two materials and the result of the chemical reaction was a series of 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.149
 boxes provide behind me 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.090
 I really do not know 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.620
 let's obviate prize build molecular computers by retaining 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.709
 individual molecules between the cable sets with this type of memory 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.470
 molecular we could build santana dies in anything the size of 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.599
 a nail we could easily store with the congress library in the 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.479
 last year 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:16.429
 other investigations are working on future computers that may 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.429
 use the bn today even game particles 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:25.449
 with massive storage and the true power of computing the 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.019
 next generation may be computers modeled after the brain 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:29.909
 human 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.019
 apart are the artificial intelligence of science and the art of manufacturing 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.159
 computers do things that we consider that requires the 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.419
 human intelligence or we are developing systems that can be 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.889
 even and even superior to the human mind within our domains 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.119
 if it was about playing chess diagnose a viral disease 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.789
 missiles cruising through nearby terrain we have a system that could 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:54.699
 remain at the human level within the framework of these defined tasks what we have 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.279
 still systems that can understand human language with the flexibility of 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.279
 humans despite arriving 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:05.779
 Alan Turing was an early computer architect who worked for 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.779
 dismantling the enigma code during World War II 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.079
 in 1950 he foresaw a time when computers could be able to 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.079
 think 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.850
 when the deep blue ibm supercomputer in summer to the world champion of 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.010
 chess gary kasparov some lost respect to the people 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:30.449
 but others acknowledged that exclude a sign that smart machines 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.219
 would arrive 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:33.849
 Saavedra 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.490
 Hahaha 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.190
 molecular electronics could even erase the line between man 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.539
 and the machine 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.930
 two thieves one or two very powerful forwards who can travel 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.400
 through our venous system try the size of the cells of 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.289
 blood and they will communicate wirelessly with our neurons I should just say 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.620
 that we will be able to band our ability to think speed of 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.630
 thought increase human memory and increase our skills 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.670
 cognitive and recognition models through corian food of the 37 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.930
 biological with these new forms of non-biological intelligence 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:12.630
 computers capable of positive thinking make some 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.550
 it does not scare me 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.080
 I see it as something derived from human intelligence in many cases were 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.110
 copies of human intelligence and embody our values 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.039
 maybe that's why we're worried because we know that human nature 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.550
 In herself 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.280
 the director we have a very creative part and also a very destructive 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.809
 and technology is multiplying that 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:36.809
 for current news 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.649
 technology is a double-edged sword is capable of producing so much destruction 

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:44.649
 massive as an unprecedented action 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.650
 but looking to the past 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.039
 society may know how to direct the computer of the future 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:59.649
 by sexes and foreigners in weight and effective power computers has been 

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:02.879
 increased by a factor of 100 million in just 50 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.150
 these orders as amazing as our studies in physics 

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:10.419
 fundamentally they tell us that it should be possible to further increase the power 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.969
 effective of computers by another factor of a billion more than what 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:14.770
 we are 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.179
 what that tells me is that the truth of the computer has not started
