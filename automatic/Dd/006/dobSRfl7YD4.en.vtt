00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the teams in one year then you would

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.650 
the teams in one year then you would
have<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.960> rotate<00:01:46.770> through<00:01:47.190> so<00:01:47.910> that<00:01:47.940> everybody

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
have to rotate through so that everybody

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.150 
have to rotate through so that everybody
in<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> conference<00:01:49.200> then<00:01:49.740> we'll<00:01:49.979> play

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
everybody in the conference and that the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.710 
everybody in the conference and that the
decisions<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:53.119> scheduling<00:01:54.119> would<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:54.540> be

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
decisions of scheduling would not be

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.960 
decisions of scheduling would not be
repeated<00:01:55.080> year<00:01:55.770> after<00:01:56.100> year<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
repeated year after year but that the

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.120 
repeated year after year but that the
decisions<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.660> the<00:01:57.750> scheduling<00:01:58.290> would<00:01:58.830> fall

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
decisions of the scheduling would fall

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.600 
decisions of the scheduling would fall
in<00:01:59.430> an<00:01:59.910> annual<00:02:00.590> rotation<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:02.190> would<00:02:02.369> allow

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
in an annual rotation that would allow

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.300 
in an annual rotation that would allow
fairness<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.600> each<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.350> every<00:02:04.470> conference

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
fairness for each and every conference

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.590 
fairness for each and every conference
opponent<00:02:05.910> so<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.619> me<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:09.000> was<00:02:09.179> my

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
opponent so to me if it was my

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.740 
opponent so to me if it was my
conference<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:11.550> would<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.910> as<00:02:12.060> simple<00:02:12.420> as

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
conference that would be as simple as

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.390 
conference that would be as simple as
falling<00:02:13.590> off<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.769> log<00:02:14.330> but<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:16.620> got<00:02:16.739> traditions

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
falling off a log but you got traditions

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.789 
falling off a log but you got traditions
of<00:02:17.670> play<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.170> self<00:02:19.560> serving<00:02:20.040> boats<00:02:20.370> and

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799
