Did this is in the raw silk in claret

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.429 
Did this is in the raw silk in claret
and<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.880> reason<00:00:28.210> that<00:00:28.360> I<00:00:28.420> am<00:00:28.840> reviewing<00:00:29.200> the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
and the reason that I am reviewing the

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.170 
and the reason that I am reviewing the
Morticia<00:00:30.220> of<00:00:30.310> course<00:00:30.489> at<00:00:30.610> the<00:00:30.700> second<00:00:31.029> time

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
Morticia of course at the second time

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.990 
Morticia of course at the second time
has<00:00:31.390> a<00:00:31.570> few<00:00:31.840> different<00:00:31.989> reasons<00:00:32.230> actually<00:00:33.000> one

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
has a few different reasons actually one

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.270 
has a few different reasons actually one
this<00:00:34.300> is<00:00:34.480> a<00:00:34.510> larger<00:00:34.960> size<00:00:35.170> this<00:00:35.410> is<00:00:35.470> a<00:00:35.590> size<00:00:35.829> 22

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
this is a larger size this is a size 22

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.700 
this is a larger size this is a size 22
the<00:00:36.940> one<00:00:37.090> that<00:00:37.239> I<00:00:37.270> had<00:00:37.480> review<00:00:37.930> before<00:00:38.410> it<00:00:38.530> was

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
the one that I had review before it was

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.210 
the one that I had review before it was
a<00:00:38.950> size<00:00:39.239> 18<00:00:40.239> and<00:00:40.780> so<00:00:41.500> there<00:00:41.770> are<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:41.950> few

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
a size 18 and so there are a few

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.280 
a size 18 and so there are a few
differences<00:00:42.790> between<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.390> larger<00:00:43.720> sizes<00:00:43.899> and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
differences between the larger sizes and

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.160 
differences between the larger sizes and
the<00:00:44.440> smaller<00:00:44.739> sizes<00:00:45.450> at<00:00:46.450> least<00:00:46.690> at<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:46.960> time

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
the smaller sizes at least at the time

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.010 
the smaller sizes at least at the time
that<00:00:47.650> I've<00:00:47.950> made<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.370> review<00:00:48.520> a<00:00:49.060> few<00:00:49.750> years

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
that I've made the review a few years

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.070 
that I've made the review a few years
ago<00:00:50.170> so<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.850> one<00:00:52.030> actually<00:00:52.270> has<00:00:52.570> more<00:00:52.840> bones

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
ago so this one actually has more bones

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.990 
ago so this one actually has more bones
it<00:00:53.260> has<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.380> few<00:00:53.620> differences<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.310> it<00:00:54.460> so<00:00:54.910> I'm

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
it has a few differences to it so I'm

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.610 
it has a few differences to it so I'm
going<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.240> be<00:00:55.390> going<00:00:55.510> over<00:00:55.780> those<00:00:56.140> differences

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
going to be going over those differences

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.790 
going to be going over those differences
today<00:00:57.010> another<00:00:57.940> reason<00:00:58.360> is<00:00:58.570> that<00:00:59.050> this<00:00:59.590> is

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
today another reason is that this is

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.190 
today another reason is that this is
obviously<00:01:00.130> made<00:01:00.850> in<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.150> raw<00:01:01.300> silk<00:01:01.630> so<00:01:01.870> I<00:01:01.900> can

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
obviously made in the raw silk so I can

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.750 
obviously made in the raw silk so I can
show<00:01:02.500> you<00:01:02.560> guys<00:01:02.830> what<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.160> raw<00:01:03.280> soap<00:01:03.520> looks

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
show you guys what the raw soap looks

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.219 
show you guys what the raw soap looks
like<00:01:03.940> from<00:01:04.089> up<00:01:04.210> close<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.839> third<00:01:05.019> reason

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
like from up close and the third reason

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.260 
like from up close and the third reason
is<00:01:05.530> that<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:06.130> first<00:01:06.400> review<00:01:06.729> that<00:01:06.880> I<00:01:06.909> had<00:01:07.119> done

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
is that the first review that I had done

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.240 
is that the first review that I had done
on<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.450> Morticia<00:01:07.869> corset<00:01:08.320> a<00:01:08.350> few<00:01:08.619> years<00:01:08.829> ago<00:01:08.950> I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
on the Morticia corset a few years ago I

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.060 
on the Morticia corset a few years ago I
hadn't<00:01:09.759> really<00:01:10.060> grown<00:01:10.420> into<00:01:10.689> my<00:01:11.560> comfortable

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
hadn't really grown into my comfortable

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.530 
hadn't really grown into my comfortable
way<00:01:12.220> of<00:01:12.400> doing<00:01:12.790> course<00:01:13.060> of<00:01:13.180> reviews<00:01:13.509> and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
half inches I will still say that if you

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.800 
half inches I will still say that if you
have<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.310> shorter<00:01:52.700> torso<00:01:52.910> you<00:01:53.360> might<00:01:53.570> want<00:01:53.750> to

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
have a shorter torso you might want to

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.030 
have a shorter torso you might want to
go<00:01:53.960> with<00:01:53.990> one<00:01:54.260> of<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.410> shorter<00:01:54.740> courses

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
go with one of the shorter courses

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.590 
go with one of the shorter courses
because<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:55.790> might<00:01:55.910> have<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.120> little<00:01:56.300> bit<00:01:56.510> of

because you might have a little bit of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.440

underwire<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.060> little<00:02:08.450> bit<00:02:08.600> so<00:02:08.810> watch<00:02:09.140> out<00:02:09.350> for

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
underwire a little bit so watch out for

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.980 
underwire a little bit so watch out for
that<00:02:09.880> however<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:11.150> find<00:02:11.360> that<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.660> corset

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
that however I find that this corset

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.570 
that however I find that this corset
does<00:02:12.140> not<00:02:12.290> ride<00:02:12.530> up<00:02:12.710> on<00:02:12.860> me<00:02:13.010> very<00:02:13.220> much<00:02:13.400> even

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
does not ride up on me very much even

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.610 
does not ride up on me very much even
what<00:02:13.790> I'm<00:02:13.880> sitting<00:02:14.180> down<00:02:14.210> because<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.230> has

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
what I'm sitting down because it has

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.770 
what I'm sitting down because it has
that<00:02:16.070> very<00:02:16.250> conical<00:02:16.850> rib<00:02:17.000> cage<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:17.420> it's<00:02:17.600> sort

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
that very conical rib cage and it's sort

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.990 
that very conical rib cage and it's sort
of<00:02:17.840> hooks<00:02:18.110> underneath<00:02:18.920> my<00:02:19.190> rib<00:02:19.310> cage<00:02:19.370> right<00:02:19.850> at

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
of hooks underneath my rib cage right at

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.120 
of hooks underneath my rib cage right at
the<00:02:20.120> waistline<00:02:20.540> here<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.320> it's<00:02:21.770> very

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
the waistline here so it's very

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.800 
the waistline here so it's very
difficult<00:02:22.550> for<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.000> actually<00:02:23.180> push<00:02:23.630> up

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
difficult for it to actually push up

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.900 
difficult for it to actually push up
because<00:02:24.080> my<00:02:24.200> rib<00:02:24.380> cage<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:24.770> actually<00:02:25.190> holding

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
because my rib cage is actually holding

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.120 
because my rib cage is actually holding
it<00:02:26.030> down<00:02:26.150> right<00:02:26.420> now<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.870> still<00:02:27.680> maintain<00:02:27.860> that

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
it down right now I still maintain that

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.190 
it down right now I still maintain that

I've<00:02:30.320> tried<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:30.860> Morticia<00:02:31.250> corset<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:31.850> the

I've tried this Morticia corset is the
one<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.270> closely<00:02:32.510> matches<00:02:33.050> my<00:02:33.820> custom

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
one that closely matches my custom

one that closely matches my custom
measurements<00:02:35.690> because<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.410> rib<00:02:36.530> cage<00:02:36.710> here

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.790 
measurements because the rib cage here
is<00:02:37.130> about<00:02:37.370> 30<00:02:37.820> inches<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.959> waist<00:02:39.320> obviously

there and it's not very pinchy it would

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.120 
there and it's not very pinchy it would
probably<00:02:53.420> be<00:02:53.630> not<00:02:53.959> pinchy<00:02:54.560> at<00:02:54.680> all<00:02:54.800> if<00:02:55.010> I

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
probably be not pinchy at all if I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.770 
probably be not pinchy at all if I
weren't<00:02:55.310> wearing<00:02:55.700> jeans<00:02:55.970> underneath<00:02:56.420> here<00:02:56.660> if

of<00:02:59.780> this<00:03:00.320> corset<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:01.130> probably<00:03:01.700> wouldn't

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
of this corset it probably wouldn't

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.640 
of this corset it probably wouldn't
pinch<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:02.239> much<00:03:02.390> but<00:03:02.570> I<00:03:02.660> actually<00:03:02.840> have<00:03:03.170> some

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
pinch so much but I actually have some

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.920 
pinch so much but I actually have some
bulk<00:03:04.130> underneath<00:03:04.580> there<00:03:04.850> which<00:03:05.000> is<00:03:05.150> kind<00:03:05.840> of

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
bulk underneath there which is kind of

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.590 
bulk underneath there which is kind of
making<00:03:06.860> out<00:03:07.100> some<00:03:07.310> extra<00:03:07.580> space<00:03:07.790> there<00:03:07.850> this

you are completely new to corseting then

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
course at laying flat and from the

course at laying flat and from the
material<00:03:23.720> of<00:03:23.870> this<00:03:24.080> I<00:03:24.380> believe<00:03:24.650> there<00:03:24.800> are

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
material of this I believe there are

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.860 
material of this I believe there are
three<00:03:25.130> layers<00:03:25.459> in<00:03:25.580> here<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:26.270> fashion<00:03:26.690> layer

three layers in here the fashion layer

three layers in here the fashion layer
as<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.200> had<00:03:27.680> explained<00:03:28.070> before<00:03:28.400> is<00:03:28.670> this

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
as I had explained before is this

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.500 
as I had explained before is this
beautiful<00:03:29.720> raw<00:03:30.410> silk<00:03:30.830> in<00:03:31.130> claret<00:03:31.820> and<00:03:32.030> then

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
beautiful raw silk in claret and then

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.290 
beautiful raw silk in claret and then
that<00:03:32.750> is<00:03:32.930> backed<00:03:33.170> on<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.800> a<00:03:33.830> strong<00:03:34.580> strength

that is backed on to a strong strength
layer<00:03:35.600> I<00:03:35.840> believe<00:03:36.170> is<00:03:36.410> cotton<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:36.980> then<00:03:37.489> on

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
layer I believe is cotton and then on

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.449 
layer I believe is cotton and then on
the<00:03:37.760> inside<00:03:38.150> here<00:03:38.690> is<00:03:38.840> also<00:03:39.200> another<00:03:39.770> cotton

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
the inside here is also another cotton

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
twill layer but the construction of this

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.330 
twill layer but the construction of this
this<00:03:43.220> has<00:03:43.519> a<00:03:43.760> five<00:03:44.209> panel<00:03:44.930> pad

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
this has a five panel pad

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.250 
this has a five panel pad
or<00:03:45.489> essentially<00:03:46.090> six<00:03:46.390> if<00:03:46.569> you<00:03:46.599> count<00:03:46.690> this

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
or essentially six if you count this

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.320
