00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
spear world and we saw the owl thing

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.020 
spear world and we saw the owl thing
from<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.410> last<00:00:43.590> airbender<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.489> we<00:00:44.789> didn't

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
from the last airbender and we didn't

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.690 
from the last airbender and we didn't
really<00:00:45.149> deal<00:00:45.960> too<00:00:46.379> much<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.250> spirit

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
really deal too much with the spirit

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.729 
really deal too much with the spirit
world<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.030> original<00:00:48.180> series<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.440> looks

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
world in the original series so it looks

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.500 
world in the original series so it looks
like<00:00:50.010> they<00:00:50.250> might<00:00:50.489> end<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.969> working<00:00:51.270> with

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
like they might end up working with

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.389 
like they might end up working with
everything<00:00:52.230> they<00:00:52.350> possibly<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.980> from<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
everything they possibly can from the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.650 
everything they possibly can from the
first<00:00:53.640> part<00:00:53.879> which<00:00:53.969> means<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.239> might<00:00:54.360> get<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
first part which means we might get the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.229 
first part which means we might get the
face<00:00:54.899> stealer<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.500> well<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.670> season

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
face stealer as well in this season

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.110 
face stealer as well in this season
because<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.230> mean<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:58.710> don't<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.760> too

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
because I mean they don't have to too

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.560 
because I mean they don't have to too
much<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.780> go<00:01:01.050> off<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.340> but<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.329> have

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
much to go off of but what they do have

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.509 
much to go off of but what they do have
they<00:01:04.140> should<00:01:04.379> utilize<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.100> think<00:01:05.369> that's

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
they should utilize I think that's

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.030 
they should utilize I think that's
pretty<00:01:05.820> much<00:01:06.000> why<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.960> owl<00:01:07.409> creature

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
pretty much why we see the owl creature

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130 
pretty much why we see the owl creature
there's<00:01:08.490> also<00:01:08.640> some<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.180> cool<00:01:09.450> variety<00:01:10.049> in

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
there's also some really cool variety in

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.230 
there's also some really cool variety in
the<00:01:10.229> way<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.650> animated<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.610> art<00:01:11.939> style

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the way it's animated and the art style

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.340 
the way it's animated and the art style
we<00:01:12.420> could<00:01:12.540> probably<00:01:12.659> expect<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> see<00:01:13.320> some

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
we could probably expect to see some

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.130 
we could probably expect to see some
beautiful<00:01:13.979> scenes<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> way

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
beautiful scenes and just just the way

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.380 
beautiful scenes and just just the way
it's<00:01:16.320> animated<00:01:16.770> looks<00:01:17.040> fresh<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.670> awesome

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
it's animated looks fresh and awesome

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.270 
it's animated looks fresh and awesome
and<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.960> interesting<00:01:19.200> how<00:01:19.619> they'll<00:01:19.950> go

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and it's interesting how they'll go

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.940 
and it's interesting how they'll go
between<00:01:20.729> these<00:01:21.030> two<00:01:21.330> different<00:01:21.570> styles<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
between these two different styles and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.429 
between these two different styles and
just<00:01:23.340> feels<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.939> art<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.390> animation<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.140> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
just feels of art and animation and I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.260 
just feels of art and animation and I
really<00:01:25.860> hope<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> go<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.640> some<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.150> our

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
interesting to see what the ultimate

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.069 
interesting to see what the ultimate
goal<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.460> season<00:01:50.700> will<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:51.509> well<00:01:51.720> it's

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
goal of the season will be as well it's

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.170 
goal of the season will be as well it's
not<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.530> obvious<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.369> time<00:01:53.579> around<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:54.030> it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
not so obvious this time around like it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.969 
not so obvious this time around like it
was<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.720> entire<00:01:55.200> way<00:01:55.439> through<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
was the entire way through with the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.310 
was the entire way through with the
original<00:01:56.340> series<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.820> had<00:01:56.969> one<00:01:57.240> set<00:01:57.659> goal<00:01:58.020> now

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
original series we had one set goal now

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.719 
original series we had one set goal now
it's<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.680> clear<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.280> trailer<00:01:59.610> doesn't

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it's not so clear the trailer doesn't

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.190 
it's not so clear the trailer doesn't
really<00:02:00.000> give<00:02:00.149> us<00:02:00.270> too<00:02:00.450> much<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.750> clue<00:02:01.020> about

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
really give us too much of a clue about

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.600 
really give us too much of a clue about
that<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:01.979> looks<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:02.340> definitely

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that but it looks like it's definitely

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.980 
that but it looks like it's definitely
