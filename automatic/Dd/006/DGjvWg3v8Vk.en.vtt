00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
it's hard for me to kind of twist neatly

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.219 
it's hard for me to kind of twist neatly
and<00:01:45.429> it's<00:01:46.429> that<00:01:46.819> it's<00:01:47.000> not<00:01:47.149> curly<00:01:47.720> it's<00:01:47.929> more

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
and it's that it's not curly it's more

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.109 
and it's that it's not curly it's more
wavy<00:01:48.819> so<00:01:49.819> I<00:01:50.709> don't<00:01:51.709> know<00:01:51.920> maybe<00:01:52.520> as<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:52.849> go<00:01:53.030> along

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
wavy so I don't know maybe as I go along

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.350 
wavy so I don't know maybe as I go along
then<00:01:53.739> everything<00:01:54.739> would<00:01:54.950> just<00:01:55.009> relax<00:01:55.970> and

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
then everything would just relax and

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.199 
then everything would just relax and
just<00:01:56.479> become<00:01:56.929> one<00:01:56.959> a<00:01:57.860> little<00:01:58.310> bit<00:01:58.399> of<00:01:58.520> history

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209
