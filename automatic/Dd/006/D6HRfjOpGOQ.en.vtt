00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.539 
can replace the height of that 8x8 sill
by<00:01:02.910> using<00:01:03.350> two<00:01:04.350> inch<00:01:04.530> boards<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.189> might<00:01:05.339> want

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
by using two inch boards you might want

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.219 
by using two inch boards you might want
to<00:01:05.610> start<00:01:05.820> off<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.390> did<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.810> house<00:01:07.049> I

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
to start off like I did on this house I

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.929 
to start off like I did on this house I
got<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:08.030> pressure-treated<00:01:10.070> two<00:01:11.070> by<00:01:11.250> two<00:01:11.820> by

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
got a pressure-treated two by two by

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.969 
got a pressure-treated two by two by
eight<00:01:12.180> which<00:01:13.080> meant<00:01:13.380> where<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.830> had<00:01:13.950> been

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
eight which meant where it had been

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.190 
eight which meant where it had been
planed<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.610> both<00:01:14.790> sides<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:15.390> actually<00:01:15.869> two

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
planed on both sides it was actually two

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.660 
planed on both sides it was actually two
and<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> half<00:01:16.500> inches<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.100> had<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> half<00:01:17.430> inch

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and a half inches so I had a half inch

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.929 
and a half inches so I had a half inch
to<00:01:17.790> play<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.049> put<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
to play with and then I put a like a

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.670 
to play with and then I put a like a
three<00:01:20.939> inch<00:01:21.119> by<00:01:21.360> eight<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.869> top<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.409> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
three inch by eight on top of that and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.899 
three inch by eight on top of that and
then<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> two<00:01:23.040> inch<00:01:23.220> by<00:01:23.369> eight<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.580> top<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.850> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
then a two inch by eight on top of that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.580 
then a two inch by eight on top of that
and<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.150> used<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.600> variety<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.049> wood<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and I used a variety of wood to get the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.190 
and I used a variety of wood to get the
exact<00:01:26.369> level<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.880> wanted<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.810> use<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
exact level I wanted and then I use the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.890 
exact level I wanted and then I use the
wedges<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.890> adjust<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> height<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.030> literally

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
wedges to adjust the height I literally

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.539 
wedges to adjust the height I literally
found<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.590> lift<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> whole<00:01:31.920> house<00:01:32.250> up

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
found out I can lift the whole house up

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.910 
found out I can lift the whole house up
by<00:01:32.729> driving<00:01:33.030> oak<00:01:33.360> wedges<00:01:33.810> into<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.470> that

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
by driving oak wedges into that and that

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
piece I can show you I would but I've

already kind of buttoned up my
insulation<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.890> year<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.280> hope<00:01:53.820> that

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
insulation for the year I hope that

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.880 
insulation for the year I hope that
helps<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.600> probably<00:01:55.290> could<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.590> said<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.770> in

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
helps I probably could have said that in

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.109 
helps I probably could have said that in
a<00:01:56.009> letter<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.520> would've<00:01:56.700> took<00:01:56.820> forever

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
a letter but it would've took forever

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.510 
a letter but it would've took forever
and<00:01:57.240> maybe<00:01:57.780> sometimes<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.439> easier<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> try

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and maybe sometimes it's easier to try

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.100 
and maybe sometimes it's easier to try
to<00:01:59.579> make<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> video<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.390> explain<00:02:00.479> how<00:02:00.930> it's

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
to make a video and explain how it's

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.240 
to make a video and explain how it's
