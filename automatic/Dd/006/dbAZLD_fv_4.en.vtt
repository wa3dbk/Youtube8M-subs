00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.060 
I think that's one of the major setbacks
that<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.670> xbox<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.270> faced<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.500> finally

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
that the xbox one faced and finally

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.980 
that the xbox one faced and finally

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
opinions and what I feel now the final

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.499 
opinions and what I feel now the final
thing<00:02:02.159> I'll<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.520> talking<00:02:02.670> about<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.479> idea

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
thing I'll be talking about is the idea

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.840 
thing I'll be talking about is the idea
of<00:02:03.990> sharing<00:02:04.259> games<00:02:04.619> without<00:02:04.799> denying<00:02:05.219> family

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
of sharing games without denying family

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.180 
of sharing games without denying family
members<00:02:06.180> across<00:02:07.140> different<00:02:07.770> consoles

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
members across different consoles

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.100 
members across different consoles
anywhere<00:02:08.550> they<00:02:08.789> want<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.270> Microsoft<00:02:10.020> has

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
anywhere they want a Microsoft has

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.809 
anywhere they want a Microsoft has
dropped<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.470> idea<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:11.009> really<00:02:11.550> think<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
dropped that idea I really think that

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.860 
dropped that idea I really think that
was<00:02:12.000> probably<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.360> best

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
was probably the best

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.539 
was probably the best
positive<00:02:13.650> idea<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.069> they're<00:02:14.159> dropping

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
positive idea that they're dropping

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.009 
positive idea that they're dropping
everything<00:02:14.849> else<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.239> basically<00:02:15.629> negative

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
everything else is basically negative

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.630 
everything else is basically negative
and<00:02:16.140> stupid<00:02:16.560> but<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:17.040> actually<00:02:17.099> think<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.489> is

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and stupid but I actually think this is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.649 
and stupid but I actually think this is
kind<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.879> cool<00:02:17.940> because<00:02:18.239> now<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.569> can

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
kind of cool because now you can

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.780 
kind of cool because now you can
actually<00:02:19.170> share<00:02:19.349> games<00:02:19.650> with<00:02:20.280> your<00:02:20.489> actual

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
actually share games with your actual

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.910 
actually share games with your actual
friends<00:02:21.239> um<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.049> not<00:02:22.319> have<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.620> like<00:02:22.680> actually

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
friends um and not have to like actually

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.470 
friends um and not have to like actually
go<00:02:23.220> there<00:02:23.340> house<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:23.819> get<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.030> game<00:02:24.180> or

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
go there house to be get the game or

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.210 
go there house to be get the game or
anything<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:24.989> because<00:02:25.650> now<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:25.980> can

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
anything like that because now you can

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.399 
anything like that because now you can
just<00:02:26.909> if<00:02:27.150> they<00:02:27.330> install<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.959> game<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.349> the

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
just if they install the game on to the

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.869 
just if they install the game on to the
hard<00:02:28.590> drive<00:02:28.650> or<00:02:29.010> they<00:02:29.159> bought<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> game<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.819> you

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
hard drive or they bought a game and you

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.940 
hard drive or they bought a game and you
guys<00:02:30.540> were<00:02:30.750> listed<00:02:31.110> as<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.200> family<00:02:31.560> member<00:02:31.590> on

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
guys were listed as a family member on

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.440 
guys were listed as a family member on
their<00:02:32.069> account<00:02:32.280> than<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:32.610> guys<00:02:32.730> could<00:02:32.940> use<00:02:33.180> on

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
their account than you guys could use on

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.539 
their account than you guys could use on
their<00:02:33.930> games<00:02:34.200> whatever<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.709> wanted<00:02:34.980> for<00:02:35.280> free

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
their games whatever you wanted for free

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.180 
their games whatever you wanted for free
I<00:02:36.079> think<00:02:37.079> that's<00:02:37.200> really<00:02:37.530> really<00:02:37.829> cool<00:02:37.920> how

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
I think that's really really cool how

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.250 
I think that's really really cool how
they<00:02:38.370> would<00:02:39.030> have<00:02:39.150> let<00:02:39.299> you<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.659> but<00:02:39.840> that

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
they would have let you do that but that

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.380 
they would have let you do that but that
idea<00:02:40.440> has<00:02:40.739> been<00:02:40.799> scrapped<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.879> that<00:02:42.090> will<00:02:42.209> not

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
idea has been scrapped so that will not

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.900 
idea has been scrapped so that will not
be<00:02:42.599> coming<00:02:43.319> anymore<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.430> coming<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.760> steam

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
be coming anymore it is coming to steam

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.220 
be coming anymore it is coming to steam
though<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.420> article<00:02:45.720> i'm<00:02:45.780> reading<00:02:46.019> it

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
though in the article i'm reading it

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.360 
though in the article i'm reading it
says<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.560> steam<00:02:46.799> will<00:02:47.010> be<00:02:47.099> getting<00:02:47.340> that

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
says that steam will be getting that

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.740 
says that steam will be getting that
feature<00:02:47.670> i<00:02:47.819> think<00:02:48.120> that's<00:02:48.239> pretty<00:02:48.390> cool<00:02:48.599> for

I<00:03:59.190> think<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.660> xbox<00:04:01.079> changing<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:01.910> online

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
I think that the xbox changing on online

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.030 
I think that the xbox changing on online
all<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.419> time<00:04:03.629> policy<00:04:04.199> and<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.680> trade<00:04:04.889> in

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
all the time policy and the trade in

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.400 
all the time policy and the trade in
Game<00:04:05.489> policy<00:04:06.000> that's<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.870> step<00:04:07.169> in<00:04:07.199> the<00:04:07.290> right

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
Game policy that's a step in the right

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.020 
Game policy that's a step in the right
direction<00:04:07.470> but<00:04:07.889> i<00:04:08.040> think<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:08.669> damage<00:04:08.940> is

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
direction but i think that the damage is

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.220 
direction but i think that the damage is
already<00:04:09.090> be<00:04:09.329> done<00:04:09.510> with<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.750> consumers

already be done with the consumers

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.770 
already be done with the consumers

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.020 
even going to buy a next-gen console

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
summer games for my xbox 360 and I'll

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.070 
summer games for my xbox 360 and I'll
wait<00:04:31.520> until<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.790> price<00:04:31.970> drops<00:04:32.300> on<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.540> ps4<00:04:32.870> or

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
wait until the price drops on the ps4 or

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.500 
wait until the price drops on the ps4 or
the<00:04:33.470> xbox<00:04:33.830> one<00:04:34.070> I<00:04:34.310> also<00:04:34.850> don't<00:04:35.060> like<00:04:35.150> that<00:04:35.390> the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
the xbox one I also don't like that the

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.950 
the xbox one I also don't like that the
Xbox<00:04:35.840> one<00:04:36.140> has<00:04:36.520> always<00:04:37.520> online<00:04:37.760> connect<00:04:38.750> thing

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
Xbox one has always online connect thing

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.930 
Xbox one has always online connect thing
so<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.200> always<00:04:39.320> have<00:04:39.500> to<00:04:39.530> be<00:04:39.620> turned<00:04:39.800> on<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.190> it

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
so it always have to be turned on and it

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.400 
so it always have to be turned on and it
will<00:04:41.030> always<00:04:41.150> be<00:04:41.270> listening<00:04:41.420> to<00:04:41.720> you<00:04:41.810> in<00:04:42.140> order

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
will always be listening to you in order

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.530 
will always be listening to you in order
to<00:04:42.530> have<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.710> console<00:04:43.100> actually<00:04:43.370> work<00:04:43.550> if

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
to have the console actually work if

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.180 
to have the console actually work if
they<00:04:44.690> change<00:04:44.930> that<00:04:45.170> I<00:04:45.320> think<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.620> xbox<00:04:45.950> one

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
they change that I think the xbox one

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.670 
they change that I think the xbox one
will<00:04:46.430> be<00:04:46.790> very<00:04:47.000> similar<00:04:47.210> to<00:04:47.420> the<00:04:47.540> xbox<00:04:47.960> 360<00:04:48.440> on

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
will be very similar to the xbox 360 on

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.220 
will be very similar to the xbox 360 on
simply<00:04:49.550> just<00:04:49.730> better<00:04:50.000> graphics<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.660> better

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
simply just better graphics and better

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.440 
simply just better graphics and better
games<00:04:51.530> but<00:04:52.370> um<00:04:52.580> they<00:04:52.910> need<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.120> change<00:04:53.150> that

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
games but um they need to change that

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.940 
games but um they need to change that
first<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:53.990> i<00:04:54.110> really<00:04:54.320> think<00:04:54.470> that<00:04:54.560> sony's

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
first and i really think that sony's

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.520 
first and i really think that sony's
doing<00:04:55.160> a<00:04:55.250> very<00:04:55.340> good<00:04:55.430> job<00:04:55.600> with<00:04:56.600> their<00:04:56.840> public

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
doing a very good job with their public

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.980 
doing a very good job with their public
relations<00:04:58.400> and<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:59.030> you<00:04:59.660> know<00:04:59.750> how<00:04:59.870> they're

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
relations and I you know how they're

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.780 
relations and I you know how they're
designing<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.470> console<00:05:00.830> for<00:05:00.920> us<00:05:01.040> but<00:05:01.610> I<00:05:01.670> mean

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
designing the console for us but I mean

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.030 
designing the console for us but I mean
guys<00:05:01.880> if<00:05:02.090> my<00:05:02.240> opinion<00:05:02.650> like<00:05:03.650> I<00:05:03.740> said<00:05:03.800> I<00:05:03.920> don't

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
guys if my opinion like I said I don't

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.500 
guys if my opinion like I said I don't
know<00:05:04.160> if<00:05:04.280> I'm<00:05:04.370> even<00:05:04.490> going<00:05:04.820> to<00:05:04.940> get<00:05:05.060> a<00:05:05.090> next-gen

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
know if I'm even going to get a next-gen

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.600 
know if I'm even going to get a next-gen
console<00:05:05.930> for<00:05:06.710> about<00:05:06.860> like<00:05:06.890> six<00:05:07.160> months<00:05:07.340> to<00:05:07.490> a

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
console for about like six months to a

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.580 
console for about like six months to a
year<00:05:07.700> afterwards<00:05:08.210> but<00:05:08.780> if<00:05:08.900> I<00:05:09.020> did<00:05:09.200> I<00:05:09.230> probably

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
year afterwards but if I did I probably

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.830 
year afterwards but if I did I probably
get<00:05:10.040> the<00:05:10.190> ps4<00:05:10.430> somebody<00:05:11.090> because<00:05:11.270> I<00:05:11.300> think<00:05:11.750> it

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
get the ps4 somebody because I think it

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.680 
get the ps4 somebody because I think it
looks<00:05:12.020> cooler<00:05:12.290> and<00:05:12.560> cheaper<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:13.640> um<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.660> know

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690

looks cooler and cheaper and um you know
the<00:05:14.840> graphic<00:05:15.170> toys<00:05:15.410> better<00:05:15.590> on<00:05:15.680> a<00:05:15.770> ps4<00:05:16.040> so<00:05:16.520> um

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
the graphic toys better on a ps4 so um

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.700 
the graphic toys better on a ps4 so um
