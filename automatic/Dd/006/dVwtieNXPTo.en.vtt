00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:24.919
 we look shoulder to shoulder from current 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:28.130
 European champion Victor Waltz after the beginning 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.090
 very good with over 240 fischer in the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.220
 first hour 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.239
 He is currently delivering a head to head 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.239
 race with the place 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.350
 he also understands that angel is moving up 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.629
 Gives at most a handful of fish 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.309
 difference between these soon stefans 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.680
 Daily is a little different 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.829
 It's about a meter away 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.829
 outside 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.030
 the news on this point is that 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:34.520
 poland link at the very front in two sectors 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:39.890
 but I have to fight on the 20th I'm sure 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.120
 he will change that if we are a bit 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.010
 look up 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.800
 we consider that poland important 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.870
 are set critically 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.360
 Jan van Schijndel told us this was dark 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.530
 is not the dutch style the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.390
 but we can not say the same 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.970
 There we see a whole web palette 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.230
 his target colleagues all have the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.230
 same tactic chosen 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.970
 Pohland ling on the first place of 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.590
 yesterday 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:22.880
 but if it continues like this 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:24.620
 podiumsplatz is guaranteed but counting 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.810
 the big fish turn up at the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.180
 route on poland really have 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.230
 Difficulties in some sectors then 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.230
 everything is still open 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.570
 I am here at the beginning 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:46.250
 d sector 112 medium to German 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.680
 Austria both of these anglerheim 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:58.100
 sectors won yesterday and both 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:03:01.520
 just sit with a small 1.218 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.550
 fish but just before the chamber run 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:17.690
 Mario Little has a two to 300 gram 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:18.590
 skimmer had both catch in well 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.959
 this sector 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.940
 It is difficult to estimate who 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.100
 lies in front 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.940
 lutz has more fishermen but those of 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.280
 marius are average big both 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.630
 with a point you both with a good one 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.630
 chance on podium in 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.739
 in under b sector between places b6 and 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.430
 b 19 four anglers sit with one point 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:52.239
 from day 1 the entire leadership of 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.170
 yesterday came from slovenia baranek 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:59.019
 unfortunately not very well on p13 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.299
 also b19 the rooftops of truck 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.209
 one is the only angela here in the 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.129
 sector who still good small fishing and 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.180
 hence a good candidate as well 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:12.819
 world champion austrian markus balogh 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.859
 a few will fit on p6 like yesterday 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.650
 need to get ahead 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.310
 There are ten anglers with a point of 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.919
 yesterday 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.250
 the lime mario in the sector next to one 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.800
 other 4 in lower b sector and here 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.530
 diandra four anglers are sitting in a sector 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.949
 with a dot in the bag the first one 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.180
 angler we meet at the end place is 37 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.560
 The Englishman already earned 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.570
 It is the last hour 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.750
 if it's a head to head race between 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.599
 already at the pole on a 24 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.820
 the pole has significantly more fish in the 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:52.419
 net but already has a few beans 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.460
 fischer already angel shortly on top 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.070
 new tenants as well as red eyes 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.280
 Here are the big ball ice types 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.009
 to boles fish up to 100 grams plus am 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.320
 end is expected but either lies 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:09.460
 Harry or does he let us know if it is 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:15.370
 The polar gregor mass bag weighs 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.780
 four kilo 152 with 309 fischer already allowed 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.030
 just watching from far 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.330
 he wanted the last of it in this 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.330
 sector 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:57.250
 five kilo 149 a kilo more with total 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.410
 250 fischer two sectors won but 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.580
 now would be phoned to the 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.430
 other sectors 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.470
 whoever has two more points gives it 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.750
 not yet officially announced 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.430
 but in the country com congratulate only if 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.430
 which are 100 percent safe 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:55.090
 because finally please complete 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.300
 the course top price then earned 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.240
 is a new world champion Poland 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:23.420
 twelve points more than home nation by 15 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.520
 or france all in the top four 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.830
 when it comes to small fish 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.720
 tactics are working 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.880
 Germany lands after space on five 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.890

 england italy hungary and the 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.910
 Dutch people would all go home 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.810
 go out and come up with new tactics for 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.630
 next year 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.840

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.880
 organize 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.970
 everything could be a small fish again 

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:53.410
