00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
have a adductor II moment of the lower

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.710 
have a adductor II moment of the lower
extremity<00:01:51.080> with<00:01:51.710> internal<00:01:52.190> spin<00:01:52.720> that's

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
extremity with internal spin that's

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.850 
extremity with internal spin that's
gonna<00:01:53.900> stress<00:01:54.230> the<00:01:54.410> knee<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.680> it's<00:01:54.770> gonna

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
gonna stress the knee and it's gonna

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.740 
gonna stress the knee and it's gonna
stress<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.340> hip<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:56.000> it's<00:01:56.180> gonna<00:01:56.300> stress<00:01:56.600> the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
stress the hip and it's gonna stress the

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.900 
stress the hip and it's gonna stress the
knee<00:01:56.900> from<00:01:57.050> a<00:01:57.230> ligamentous<00:01:57.770> standpoint<00:01:58.310> um

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
knee from a ligamentous standpoint um

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.850 
knee from a ligamentous standpoint um
it's<00:01:59.390> gonna<00:01:59.540> stress<00:02:00.110> some<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.530> posterior

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
it's gonna stress some of the posterior

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.620 
it's gonna stress some of the posterior
dept<00:02:01.460> muscles<00:02:01.760> because<00:02:02.060> they're<00:02:02.210> trying<00:02:02.540> to

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
dept muscles because they're trying to

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.770 
dept muscles because they're trying to
decelerate<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.320> motion

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
decelerate the motion

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.300 
decelerate the motion
and<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.440> going<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.650> stress<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> hip<00:02:05.130> because

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and it's going to stress the hip because

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.640 
and it's going to stress the hip because
it<00:02:05.430> needs<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.760> decelerate<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.510> extremity<00:02:07.080> as

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
it needs to decelerate the extremity as

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.980 
it needs to decelerate the extremity as
it<00:02:07.860> strike<00:02:08.130> in<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> ground<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.000> you're<00:02:09.899> gonna

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
it strike in the ground so you're gonna

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.360 
it strike in the ground so you're gonna
strike<00:02:10.319> you're<00:02:10.500> gonna<00:02:10.590> strike<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.250> bit

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
strike you're gonna strike a little bit

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.830 
strike you're gonna strike a little bit
more<00:02:11.580> you're<00:02:11.910> gonna<00:02:11.970> strike<00:02:12.300> laterally<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
more you're gonna strike laterally a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.210 
more you're gonna strike laterally a
little<00:02:13.050> bit<00:02:13.170> more<00:02:13.319> aggressively<00:02:13.770> maybe<00:02:14.130> a

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
little bit more aggressively maybe a

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.100 
little bit more aggressively maybe a
little<00:02:14.340> bit<00:02:14.520> more<00:02:14.700> pronounced<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.720> longer

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
little bit more pronounced and longer

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.140 
little bit more pronounced and longer
and<00:02:16.260> then<00:02:16.350> when<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.590> finally<00:02:16.970> drop<00:02:17.970> that

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and then when you finally drop that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150 
and then when you finally drop that
forefoot<00:02:18.630> varus<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.410> know<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.709> medial<00:02:19.980> side

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
forefoot varus you know the medial side

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.250 
forefoot varus you know the medial side
of<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.340> tripod<00:02:20.880> with<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> big<00:02:21.209> cosign<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:21.959> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
or the medial side of the foot down it's

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.180 
or the medial side of the foot down it's
gonna<00:02:24.780> be<00:02:24.989> rather<00:02:25.319> aggressive<00:02:25.830> right<00:02:25.980> it's

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
gonna be rather aggressive right it's

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.920 
gonna be rather aggressive right it's
gonna<00:02:26.280> drive<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.520> lot<00:02:26.819> I<00:02:26.940> think<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.810> lot

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
gonna drive a lot I think so and a lot

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.750 
gonna drive a lot I think so and a lot
of<00:02:27.989> steel<00:02:28.260> our<00:02:28.470> nation<00:02:28.770> yeah<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.310> we<00:02:29.459> see<00:02:29.730> a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
of steel our nation yeah and we see a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.250 
of steel our nation yeah and we see a
lot<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.030> people<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.420> again<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.750> depends<00:02:31.080> upon

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
lot of people and again it depends upon

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.190 
lot of people and again it depends upon
your<00:02:31.470> Anatomy<00:02:32.040> yeah<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:32.700> for<00:02:32.910> some<00:02:33.090> folks<00:02:33.480> that

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
your Anatomy yeah so for some folks that

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.440 
your Anatomy yeah so for some folks that
might<00:02:34.350> actually<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.980> good<00:02:35.340> gait<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:36.269> know

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
might actually be a good gait you know

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.210 
might actually be a good gait you know
and<00:02:36.690> for<00:02:36.870> some<00:02:37.080> folks<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.590> may<00:02:37.769> not<00:02:37.980> be<00:02:38.040> a

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
and for some folks that may not be a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.400 
and for some folks that may not be a
good<00:02:38.430> gait<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.180> could<00:02:39.330> say<00:02:39.480> for<00:02:39.750> sure<00:02:40.019> it's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
good gait and I could say for sure it's

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.240 
good gait and I could say for sure it's
certainly<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.190> gait<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.430> causes<00:02:41.910> problems<00:02:42.390> in

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
certainly a gait that causes problems in

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.320 
certainly a gait that causes problems in
some<00:02:44.250> folks<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.760> same<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.090> know<00:02:45.180> could

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
some folks and the same you know could

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.940 
some folks and the same you know could
be<00:02:45.420> said<00:02:45.600> for<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.810> valgus<00:02:46.080> with<00:02:46.410> heel<00:02:46.620> striking

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
be said for a valgus with heel striking

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.090 
be said for a valgus with heel striking
you<00:02:47.190> know<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.519> have<00:02:47.959> basically<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.110> all<00:02:49.950> the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
you know we have basically the all the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.229 
you know we have basically the all the
scientific<00:02:50.550> studies<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.970> show<00:02:51.209> that

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
scientific studies that show that

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.009 
scientific studies that show that
forefoot<00:02:52.230> impact<00:02:52.860> or<00:02:53.280> forefoot<00:02:53.970> striking<00:02:54.540> has

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
forefoot impact or forefoot striking has

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.309 
forefoot impact or forefoot striking has
less<00:02:55.970> initial<00:02:56.970> impact<00:02:57.300> force<00:02:57.630> then<00:02:57.930> heel

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
less initial impact force then heel

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.690 
less initial impact force then heel
strike<00:02:58.590> me<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:58.860> that's<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.069> fact<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.459> we've

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
strike me and that's a fact and we've

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.949 
strike me and that's a fact and we've
looked<00:02:59.819> at<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> lot<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.180> studies<00:03:00.510> for<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:00.690> but

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
looked at a lot of studies for that but

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.640 
looked at a lot of studies for that but
is<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.560> necessarily<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:02.250> bad<00:03:02.430> thing<00:03:03.319> and<00:03:04.319> I

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
is that necessarily a bad thing and I

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.900 
is that necessarily a bad thing and I
don't<00:03:04.709> really<00:03:04.980> know<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> answer<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.700> I'm<00:03:05.760> not

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
don't really know the answer and I'm not

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.460 
don't really know the answer and I'm not
trying<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.239> say<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.660> one<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:07.019> better<00:03:07.200> over

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
trying to say that one is better over

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.590 
trying to say that one is better over
the<00:03:07.590> other<00:03:07.739> they're<00:03:08.610> different<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.329> I<00:03:09.540> think

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
the other they're different and I think

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.590 
the other they're different and I think
that<00:03:09.989> if<00:03:10.079> your<00:03:10.260> body<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.950> able<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.600> compensate

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
that if your body is able to compensate

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.910 
that if your body is able to compensate
in<00:03:12.630> other<00:03:12.780> words<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.049> have<00:03:13.170> an<00:03:13.290> intact<00:03:13.620> motor

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
in other words you have an intact motor

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.069 
in other words you have an intact motor
system<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.640> your<00:03:14.850> nerve<00:03:15.000> systems<00:03:15.510> intact<00:03:15.810> your

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
system in your nerve systems intact your

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.340 
system in your nerve systems intact your
muscles<00:03:16.470> are<00:03:16.709> competent<00:03:17.610> then<00:03:18.510> you're<00:03:19.110> going

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
muscles are competent then you're going

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.800 
muscles are competent then you're going
to<00:03:19.650> strike<00:03:20.070> most<00:03:20.370> efficiently<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:21.630> like

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
to strike most efficiently and we like
