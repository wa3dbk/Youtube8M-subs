00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.910
 hello good we're all in minecraft 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.259
 once again with the blood mold that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.800
 not that I have and nothing is playing other 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:25.720
 with us in mode d 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.720
 we go when I just do not say 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.700
 and I'm here it's not because if it's worth what 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.950
 let's do is a yoyo 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.480
 to this platform has put here more 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.540
 that nothing to not die with him then what 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.090
 make in your rival 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.730
 you will ask why he has fire not 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.690
 it's not because there's a spike that also does not 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.970
 it's because I've done this very 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.160
 intelligently in a snowy area in 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.550
 a snowy area and it became me 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.440
 ice 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.080
 you know you see there in the background that there is 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.340
 bottle and then that and of course how is 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.630
 this to cover so that to avoid 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.830
 let me die if I stay in a block of 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.830
 ice for my dear do pupa no 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.130
 I'm in fire good nonsense after 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.350
 happy 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.390
 first I will do in creative to see 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.770
 so you can see how good is 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.960
 basic 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.790
 is worth of carmona is not worth 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.229
 these are the usual cables that 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.890
 true that does not explain in another video 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.280
 because it was more like a trailer or something 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.619
 A) Yes 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.540
 the other good video because I explain the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.610
 mode by pressing the uvi the time you release the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.070
 hooks and pressing the center button of the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.810
 you release it 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.360
 uy 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.770
 the bit 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.009
 v 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.700
 mola much we pity the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.700
 download of fps 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.890
 it's six blocks work mark the 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.770
 point 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.530
 of maximum tension to demand it you arrive 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.780
 there and it's going to spin pam pim pam pam so 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.030
 does not warn my ass 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.090
 and quite realistic this the truth that 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.260
 is that not 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.540
 this one goes so far but instead 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.030
 with this it is so that you go down from 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.319
 up all the way down more very well can 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.510
 create very very cool way 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.140
 Anyway what would they saw me as 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.770
 the text 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.770
 term 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.420
 by pressing the sign you do not have up 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.420
 let's see if it comes out because it 's a little bit 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.560
 complicated 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.880
 what was said 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.880
 here I am already grabbing 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.600
 when I record I have more tiles and what happens 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.770
 what's wrong I'm sorry I can not be anything 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.970
 you can buy your computer better 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.970
 have prescribed I can no longer 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.660
 ay ay 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.230
 jolÃ­n I'm almost to put this inside and 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.420
 It's so beautiful there with the hooks that 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.850
 damn me I do this by pressing say 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.020
 we are taking momentum 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.610
 now and 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.970
 to see if we get to the middle that you pencil 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.810
 blue 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.060
 okay I think he's hit 200 good guys 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.920
 He has beaten me sorry and I will try to 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.060
 do not spend much and come see 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.630
 trying to reach the blocks of 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.060
 lapis lazuli not there we have already arrived 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.310
 now I suppose we will pass you almost 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.860
 we are coming 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.570
 whether wet 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.580
 I would love to put this needs to be 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.040
 analyzed the cibon but I was going to 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.630
 exploit the pc you know what happens not good 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.790
 Well now what I'm going to do as a 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.450
 'jojoy' my god is made and ximo 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.450
 baleares that this is not a game to play 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.780
 with a swing with a swing forgiveness 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.780
 mole mound 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.840
 utility to 0 must also be said that 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.990
 this is to hang out so 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.990
 creative 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.000
 and look at something I'm thinking 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.880
 that in survival your newspaper would be 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.800
 so 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.800
 of the entity in this is outside 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.349
 and this is going to be super epic I'm going to drop 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.870
 the cables when they are in tension 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.920
 maximum this is going to molar come to the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.790
 following 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.790
 yes no peta 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.889
 fix 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.030
 even though I was going to go further and see 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.030
 because we try again total 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.720
 book 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.260
 it's difficult is you would call me bank but not 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.900
 that if I strip for a while until 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.250
 I am today it is patented by me 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.270
 sure another person has happened 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.280
 but I mean I have not seen 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.820
 no video and it has occurred to me 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.820
 hang out 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:51.610
 this has hung down once again 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.929
 urvial jeans everything can happen this in the 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.249
 real life do not do it that the 

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:58.110
 legs shot and everything else too 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:05:00.690
 the water is coming 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:05.180
 and it has returned to me to petar boys and girls 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.180
 this is minecraft the things p is good 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:14.360
 give me your hand up I went down 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:18.300
 from so much saying things my things 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:21.319
 let's leave it there I'll jump 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.319
 to infinity 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.220
 thank goodness that put the water 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.660
 Blackberry 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:33.220
 mola mola mola mola 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:39.000
 and that is that I'm safe 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:41.550
 almost almost the truth 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.550
 uff 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.070
 once again 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.110

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.480
 gas we are also has gas what have 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.250
 done in a hurry because the series I think 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.930
 that has been alive for two months , I think 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.020
 that takes two months to live or so 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.490
 zinc series that I want that I do say 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.320

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.249
 well I'll say it so that he is not dead 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.369

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:10.649
 we want 

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:12.719
 in the video come out killing a gas that 

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:15.229
 it seems more epic than the more epic 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.229
 what happened to me 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:23.760
 and that I am here chatting on what 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:28.550

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.550
 to infinity that little has gone up 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.540

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.900
