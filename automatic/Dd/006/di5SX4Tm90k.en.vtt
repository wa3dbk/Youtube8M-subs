outer basket in this vertical aspect
back<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.740> forth<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> went<00:00:29.939> ahead<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.179> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
back and forth so I went ahead and I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.479 
back and forth so I went ahead and I
made<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> couple<00:00:30.689> marks<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.710> outer<00:00:31.859> basket

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
made a couple marks on the outer basket

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.330 
made a couple marks on the outer basket
that<00:00:32.940> you'll<00:00:33.059> see<00:00:33.360> now<00:00:33.600> here<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.380> these<00:00:34.590> tangs

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
that you'll see now here on these tangs

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.240 
that you'll see now here on these tangs
that<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.090> now<00:00:36.239> oriented<00:00:36.989> horizontally<00:00:37.250> these

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
that are now oriented horizontally these

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.000 
that are now oriented horizontally these
were<00:00:38.520> originally<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> previous

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
were originally and in the previous

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.819 
were originally and in the previous
videos<00:00:41.120> oriented<00:00:42.120> vertically<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.530> they<00:00:43.770> were

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
videos oriented vertically so they were

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.670 
videos oriented vertically so they were
in<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.460> position<00:00:44.940> here<00:00:45.360> now<00:00:46.110> turn<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> motor

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
in this position here now turn the motor

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.910 
in this position here now turn the motor
over<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.120> are<00:00:48.270> now<00:00:48.530> at<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.620> 90<00:00:49.860> degree

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
over so that they are now at a 90 degree

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.020 
over so that they are now at a 90 degree
angle<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.820> wanted<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> see<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:53.030> if

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
angle because I wanted to see if the if

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.970 
angle because I wanted to see if the if
the<00:00:54.180> movement<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.629> outer<00:00:54.780> basket<00:00:55.230> follows

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the movement of the outer basket follows

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.430 
the movement of the outer basket follows
the<00:00:56.340> position<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> basket<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.320> is

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the position of the basket or if it is

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.990 
the position of the basket or if it is
independent<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.489> position<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.940> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
independent of the position of the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.110 
independent of the position of the
basket<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:01.170> turns<00:01:01.350> out<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:02.070> laxity<00:01:03.000> that

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
basket and it turns out the laxity that

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.910 
basket and it turns out the laxity that
I'm<00:01:03.210> seeing<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.719> independent<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I'm seeing is independent of the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.649 
I'm seeing is independent of the
position<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.400> basket<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:06.270> here

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
position of the basket because here

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.289 
position of the basket because here
again<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.650> was<00:01:08.280> dependent<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> basket

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
again if it was dependent on the basket

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.090 
again if it was dependent on the basket
position<00:01:09.659> I'd<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.960> able<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> move<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.650> basket

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
position I'd be able to move the basket

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.410 
position I'd be able to move the basket
this<00:01:11.939> way

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
this way

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.410 
this way
and<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:13.380> cannot<00:01:13.710> however<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:15.119> grab<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and I cannot however I can grab the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.980 
and I cannot however I can grab the
outer<00:01:15.509> basket<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> moves<00:01:21.630> up<00:01:21.869> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
outer basket here and it moves up and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.410 
outer basket here and it moves up and
down<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.580> regardless<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.880> where<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.299> outer

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
down so regardless of where the outer

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.050 
down so regardless of where the outer
baska<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.930> actually<00:01:25.320> positioned<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.700> still

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
baska is actually positioned I'm still

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.380 
baska is actually positioned I'm still
getting<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:28.490> movement<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.759> being<00:01:30.090> able<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
getting this movement of being able to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.410 
getting this movement of being able to
rock<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.840> outer<00:01:30.990> basket<00:01:31.530> as<00:01:31.680> well<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
rock the outer basket as well as the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.270 
rock the outer basket as well as the
inner<00:01:33.869> basket<00:01:35.150> shaft<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.259> down<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:38.100> not

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
inner basket shaft up and down it's not

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.560 
inner basket shaft up and down it's not
nearly<00:01:38.549> as<00:01:38.670> evident<00:01:39.150> here<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> video

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
nearly as evident here on the video

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.179 
nearly as evident here on the video
moving<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.500> down<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.009> still

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
moving this up and down but it's still

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.730 
moving this up and down but it's still
really<00:01:41.520> yeah<00:01:42.049> see<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.259> watch<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.649> outer

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
really yeah see if you watch the outer

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.940 
really yeah see if you watch the outer
basket<00:01:44.189> there<00:01:45.470> you<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.619> see<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> whole

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
basket there you can see the whole

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.740 
basket there you can see the whole
assembly<00:01:47.520> move<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.450> oh<00:01:49.490> dear<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:51.479> is

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
assembly move so oh dear this is

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.039 
assembly move so oh dear this is
probably<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.470> good<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.270> was<00:01:54.600> looking<00:01:54.899> for

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
probably not good so I was looking for

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.819 
probably not good so I was looking for
some<00:01:55.140> advice<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.740> where<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> go<00:01:56.340> next<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.829> how

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
some advice of where to go next and how

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.740 
some advice of where to go next and how
much<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.219> time<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.430> need<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.640> tear<00:01:59.850> into

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
much of this time I need to tear into

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.810 
much of this time I need to tear into
you
