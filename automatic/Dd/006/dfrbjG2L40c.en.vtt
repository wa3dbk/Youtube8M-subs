well and nabbit is this guy right here

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.479 
well and nabbit is this guy right here
on<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> package<00:01:03.690> he<00:01:04.290> actually<00:01:04.739> can't<00:01:05.070> get<00:01:05.280> hit

on the package he actually can't get hit
by<00:01:05.670> enemies<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.810> he<00:01:06.930> can't<00:01:07.170> die<00:01:07.439> by<00:01:07.740> hitting

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
by enemies so he can't die by hitting

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.770 
by enemies so he can't die by hitting
enemies<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:08.520> he<00:01:08.610> also<00:01:08.760> can't<00:01:09.060> use<00:01:09.119> power-ups

they<00:01:49.200> cheaped<00:01:49.500> out<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> lot<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
they cheaped out because a lot of the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.359 
they cheaped out because a lot of the
newer<00:01:50.610> manuals<00:01:51.210> are<00:01:51.509> being<00:01:51.899> omitted<00:01:52.470> almost

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
newer manuals are being omitted almost

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.620 
newer manuals are being omitted almost
then<00:01:53.640> maybe<00:01:53.820> they're<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.479> go

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
then maybe they're just going to go

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.810 
then maybe they're just going to go
online<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.439> say<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:55.890> online<00:01:56.399> for

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
online and just say go online for

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.399 
online and just say go online for
everything<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.689> kind<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.320> when

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
everything but I kind of like it when

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.230 
everything but I kind of like it when
they<00:01:58.560> do<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.950> I'm<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.399> happy<00:01:59.670> Nintendo

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

this code that you see down here on the

this code that you see down here on the
club<00:02:08.369> nintendo<00:02:08.550> i<00:02:09.119> will<00:02:09.569> actually<00:02:09.720> already

club nintendo i will actually already
register<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.610> does<00:02:11.819> come<00:02:12.120> with<00:02:12.150> one

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
register that but it does come with one

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.480 
register that but it does come with one

of those pamphlets as all
and<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.510> obviously<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:16.230> time<00:02:16.500> has<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:17.070> nice

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
and it obviously this time has a nice

little Luigi picture on there rather

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.860 
little Luigi picture on there rather
than<00:02:19.350> Mario<00:02:19.800> it's<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> nice<00:02:20.310> touch<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.480> here<00:02:21.750> is

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
than Mario it's a nice touch so here is

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.060 
than Mario it's a nice touch so here is
the<00:02:22.080> disc<00:02:22.350> for<00:02:23.040> new<00:02:23.430> super<00:02:23.940> Luigi<00:02:24.570> u<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:25.070> let's

the disc for new super Luigi u and let's

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.440 
the disc for new super Luigi u and let's
see<00:02:26.250> if<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.460> does<00:02:26.490> have<00:02:26.850> some<00:02:27.120> sort<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.360> a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
see if it does have some sort of a

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.780 
see if it does have some sort of a
manual<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.830> really<00:02:29.070> doesn't<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.670> really

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
manual and it really doesn't it really

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.340 
manual and it really doesn't it really
has<00:02:30.060> almost<00:02:30.330> nothing<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.020> says<00:02:31.140> if<00:02:31.290> you

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
has almost nothing it just says if you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.500 
has almost nothing it just says if you
like<00:02:31.530> these<00:02:31.680> games<00:02:32.010> if<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.000> like<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.300> game

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
like these games if you like this game

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.270 
like these games if you like this game
try<00:02:33.720> these<00:02:33.780> other<00:02:33.930> games<00:02:34.200> using<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
try these other games using the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.920 
try these other games using the
electronic<00:02:35.670> manual<00:02:36.150> because<00:02:36.600> it's<00:02:36.810> an

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
electronic manual because it's an

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.750 
electronic manual because it's an
electronic<00:02:37.560> manual<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.220> actually<00:02:38.550> comes

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
electronic manual that actually comes

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.000 
electronic manual that actually comes
and<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.150> tells<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.540> how<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.750> go<00:02:40.020> there<00:02:40.050> so

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
and it just tells you how to go there so

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.680 
and it just tells you how to go there so
it<00:02:41.100> doesn't<00:02:41.430> actually<00:02:41.550> come<00:02:42.000> with<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.360> manual

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
it doesn't actually come with a manual

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.960 
it doesn't actually come with a manual
this<00:02:42.930> time<00:02:43.170> it's<00:02:43.680> almost<00:02:44.070> very<00:02:44.340> useless<00:02:44.670> to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
this time it's almost very useless to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.170 
this time it's almost very useless to
get<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.300> disc<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.140> feel<00:02:46.410> but<00:02:47.340> if<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.790> want<00:02:48.000> to

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
get this disc I feel but if you want to

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.500 
get this disc I feel but if you want to
just<00:02:48.480> quickly<00:02:48.810> compare<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.680> two<00:02:49.890> discs<00:02:50.510> this

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
just quickly compare the two discs this

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.910 
just quickly compare the two discs this
one's<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.960> Luigi<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.830> new

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
one's the Luigi and this is the new

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.280 
one's the Luigi and this is the new
Super<00:02:53.190> Mario<00:02:53.430> Bros<00:02:53.820> u<00:02:54.180> there's<00:02:54.810> not<00:02:54.990> much

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
Super Mario Bros u there's not much

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.080 
Super Mario Bros u there's not much
difference<00:02:55.500> they<00:02:56.280> did<00:02:56.520> design<00:02:56.940> it

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
difference they did design it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.700 
difference they did design it
differently<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.540> they<00:02:57.780> did<00:02:57.960> put<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.350> here

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
differently and they did put on here

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.240 
differently and they did put on here
though

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
though

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.400 
though
the<00:02:59.670> year<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.180> Luigi<00:03:00.330> thirtieth<00:03:01.260> anniversary

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
the year of Luigi thirtieth anniversary

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.530 
the year of Luigi thirtieth anniversary
so<00:03:02.040> that's<00:03:02.190> pretty<00:03:02.460> cool<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.940> they<00:03:03.390> obviously

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
so that's pretty cool and they obviously

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.090 
so that's pretty cool and they obviously
did<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.050> design<00:03:04.320> completely<00:03:04.710> differently

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
did the design completely differently

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.160 
did the design completely differently
but<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.940> looks<00:03:06.150> almost<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.570> same<00:03:06.660> they<00:03:07.140> just

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
but it looks almost the same they just

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.170 
but it looks almost the same they just
swapped<00:03:07.530> out<00:03:07.740> all<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.010> characters<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.790> they

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
swapped out all the characters and they

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.400 
swapped out all the characters and they
swapped<00:03:09.540> out<00:03:09.720> all<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.990> different<00:03:10.080> little

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
swapped out all the different little

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.410 
swapped out all the different little
images<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:11.250> design<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.940> same<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.150> should

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
images the design is the same I should

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.860 
images the design is the same I should
say<00:03:13.550> so<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.790> pretty<00:03:15.000> neat<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.510> the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
say so that is pretty neat it is the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.600 
say so that is pretty neat it is the
year<00:03:15.990> of<00:03:16.020> Luigi<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.440> can't<00:03:16.890> wait<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.190> play<00:03:17.400> this

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
year of Luigi I can't wait to play this

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.790 
year of Luigi I can't wait to play this
I'm<00:03:18.180> actually<00:03:18.510> headed<00:03:18.960> out<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.260> friend's

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
I'm actually headed out to a friend's

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.950 
I'm actually headed out to a friend's
place<00:03:20.430> out<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:20.910> town<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.390> play<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.720> tonight

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
place out of town to play this tonight

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.870 
place out of town to play this tonight
and<00:03:22.470> hopefully<00:03:23.160> we<00:03:23.280> get<00:03:23.430> through<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.730> whole

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
and hopefully we get through the whole

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.790 
and hopefully we get through the whole
thing<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.450> can<00:03:24.600> probably<00:03:24.900> do<00:03:25.350> some<00:03:25.560> sort<00:03:25.770> of

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
thing and I can probably do some sort of

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.280 
thing and I can probably do some sort of
an<00:03:25.920> impression<00:03:26.220> video<00:03:26.640> some<00:03:27.300> other<00:03:27.450> day<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.990> I

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
an impression video some other day and I

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.840 
an impression video some other day and I
do<00:03:28.350> have<00:03:28.680> obviously<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.190> two<00:03:29.370> copies<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
do have obviously the two copies the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.880 
do have obviously the two copies the
other<00:03:29.910> one<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.150> will<00:03:30.390> keep<00:03:30.570> sealed<00:03:30.960> and<00:03:31.260> just

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
other one I will keep sealed and just

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.770 
other one I will keep sealed and just
because<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.670> year<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.150> Luigi<00:03:33.570> I

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
because it is the year of Luigi I

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.600
