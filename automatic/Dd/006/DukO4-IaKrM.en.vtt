looking for or helped us to really

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.580 
looking for or helped us to really
understand<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.870> needed<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.230> create<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
understand that we needed to create a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.490 
understand that we needed to create a
product<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.160> was<00:01:02.609> both<00:01:02.850> more<00:01:03.300> custom<00:01:03.780> but

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
product that was both more custom but

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.530 
product that was both more custom but
also<00:01:04.680> at<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> same<00:01:05.309> time<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:06.090> highly

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
that we realized when we start working

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.580 
that we realized when we start working
on<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.209> collection<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.049> there's<00:02:22.260> so

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
on this collection is that there's so

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.190 
on this collection is that there's so
many<00:02:22.860> different<00:02:23.060> dimensions<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.480> our<00:02:24.660> kind

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
many different dimensions that our kind

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.130 
many different dimensions that our kind
of<00:02:25.440> common<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:26.670> kitchen<00:02:27.360> making<00:02:27.720> cabin

of common in kitchen making cabin
cabinetry<00:02:28.880> world<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.269> one<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.019> things

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
cabinetry world and one of the things

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.449 
cabinetry world and one of the things
that<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.440> tried<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.860> do<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.310> actually

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
that we tried to do is to actually

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.300 
that we tried to do is to actually
minimize<00:02:33.299> those<00:02:33.930> dimension<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.799> work<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.280> a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
minimize those dimension and work with a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.000 
minimize those dimension and work with a
very<00:02:35.760> very<00:02:36.060> clean<00:02:36.510> grid<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.620> will<00:02:37.830> be<00:02:37.980> a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
very very clean grid that will be a

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.130 
very very clean grid that will be a
guiding<00:02:38.610> principle<00:02:38.640> for<00:02:39.269> for<00:02:40.019> everything

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
guiding principle for for everything

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.479 
guiding principle for for everything
we've<00:02:40.769> actually<00:02:41.070> created<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:42.079> tighter<00:02:43.489> system

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
we've actually created a tighter system

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.229 
we've actually created a tighter system
by<00:02:45.209> tighter<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.600> mean<00:02:46.010> we<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.250> fewer<00:02:47.910> size

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
by tighter I mean we have fewer size

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.690 
by tighter I mean we have fewer size
variations<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.470> idea<00:02:49.799> in<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> design<00:02:50.400> is

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
variations and the idea in the design is

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.390 
variations and the idea in the design is
to<00:02:50.910> really<00:02:51.150> create<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.900> design<00:02:52.320> where<00:02:52.920> repeat

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
to really create a design where repeat

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.509 
to really create a design where repeat
the<00:02:53.640> same<00:02:53.940> size<00:02:54.810> module<00:02:55.440> over<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.160> over<00:02:56.280> again

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
the same size module over and over again

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.400 
the same size module over and over again
and<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:56.940> here<00:02:57.269> we're<00:02:57.630> working<00:02:57.900> with<00:02:57.989> two<00:02:58.170> sides

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
and so here we're working with two sides

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.190 
and so here we're working with two sides
modules<00:02:58.920> there's<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.160> 24-inch<00:02:59.910> module<00:03:00.510> which

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
modules there's a 24-inch module which

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.990 
modules there's a 24-inch module which
we're<00:03:01.440> using<00:03:01.680> for<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.220> upper<00:03:02.459> cabinets<00:03:02.910> and

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
we're using for the upper cabinets and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.759 
we're using for the upper cabinets and
the<00:03:03.060> base<00:03:03.239> cabinets<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:04.260> perfectly

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
the base cabinets that perfectly

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.280 
the base cabinets that perfectly
integrates<00:03:05.340> such<00:03:05.640> details<00:03:06.120> as<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.750> recycling

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
integrates such details as the recycling

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.319 
integrates such details as the recycling
center<00:03:07.319> as<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:09.440> dishwasher<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:11.069> sink<00:03:11.430> the

beautiful finished interior cabinet with
dovetail<00:03:27.269> would<00:03:27.720> roll<00:03:27.959> outs<00:03:28.260> and

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
dovetail would roll outs and

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.740 
dovetail would roll outs and
in<00:03:29.290> espresso<00:03:29.860> machine<00:03:30.250> it's<00:03:30.760> truly<00:03:31.270> a<00:03:31.300> custom

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
in espresso machine it's truly a custom

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.340 
in espresso machine it's truly a custom
product<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:32.650> even<00:03:33.040> though<00:03:33.220> it's<00:03:33.730> been<00:03:33.970> very

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350
