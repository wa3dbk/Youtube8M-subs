00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.370
 what is there 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.689
 shortly 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.300
 it was a fish 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.730
 on their zone in passing 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.909
 so it's not easy to run 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.840
 like that 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.880
 and passing the costs are out 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.890
 we will quickly realize that 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.890
 which is plateaus and planets to full surya 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.110
 other hassle 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.560
 we tried to put at the forefront on these 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.670
 this zone 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.650
 with the increase in endowment is going well 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.650
 we are trying to catch the fish 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.890
 to help you 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.540
 not sure 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.740
 must have done that 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.740
 it is also enough of the ciudad deportiva 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.540
 that question 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.540
 easy 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.560
 so that's the palette of depths 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.730
 it's too much pressure 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.730
 during this trial m on the small plateau 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.570
 about to put a headband 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.180
 here is a split screen 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.180
 in the immediate future 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.050
 because after a first pass in length 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.050
 to try to spot 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.490
 and it's probably quite a lot of snacks go down young people there 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.490
 but people 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:14.249
 but in fact what I'm looking for a break 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.969
 tqs that will mark different 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.179
 in the homeland very well 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:28.419
 well-being of the freedmen 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.579
 what are we going to do 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.439
 here 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.189
 we want to do 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.189
 in employment 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.409
 public fish acuity 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.409
 a little bit, it's a very good sign 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.359
 I take a turn in the other direction 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:52.279
 Friday to limit 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.439
 that's why if the fish 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.759
 it's still not bad 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:07.019
 wooden cashier goes up 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.579
 and it seems to me to be a single hard line 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.579
 so if we can only be interesting to prospect 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.109
 to reach the area 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.479
 dance cahill is possible 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.889
 on the contrary 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.889
 it will be constituted 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.199
 - coconut 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.159
 I think moreover 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.159
 what is called here 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.619
 a complaint 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:45.349
 then interpretation on the spot just below her 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.639
 perhaps 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.759
 for the moment be sure 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:53.619
 I am at the limit 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:56.649
 at the limit that moment they are even at the room comont 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:59.069
 it seems to me that no 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.069
 to do it more 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.679
 about fifteen minutes around 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:10.229
 and voila 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.229
 the complaint filed 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.499
 Series 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:34.099
 the fishing strategy was successful 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:35.669
 this city 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.350
 that's when I made compiegne not to have 22 kilos 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.530
 the knowledge or the other 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.080
 with the crisis a mannequin 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.210
 this little car watson 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.059
 he took 8 pounds 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:53.059
 three French clubs 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.979
 in the kent I typed 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.659
 the other 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:33.340
 paulhe very unhappy me
