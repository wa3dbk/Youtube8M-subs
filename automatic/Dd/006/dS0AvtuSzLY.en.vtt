 sale is growing strongly we are afraid it's eric's position 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.970
 this new earthquake during this situation 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.159
 it's a little different for their growth of 12% in competition 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.630
 so we found posed at its highest level 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.990
 the second site 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.569
 it is first against the south of israel is not necessarily a strong sign 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.070
 the best 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.769
 we will see according to their possibilities 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.719
 eyi 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.719
 but we are also wondering if this vote of confidence 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.029

 the news gives the story of experience gained in the second round 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.009
 by that specific date 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.369
 I hope we will get a little more to get a good result here 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:48.659
 but that you know this total change of scenery achieved in 2008 and who 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.929

 the football was 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:01.859
