00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.790
 yes so a wire army that should be fine 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.780
 can play football and corn think so 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.940
 to defend 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.500
 of course we are going new system we are going 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.020
 probably also try playing 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.240
 so that 's telling something about it 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.350
 yes those are some more defenders and so on 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.449
 it doesn't have to be that right 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.510
 completely play a door but it does 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.710
 some more defenders and yes that means 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.689
 that you are just constructive 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.980
 must be strong and you had it 1 or 2 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.539
 pointed towards you and that you have to 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.540
 Switch off 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.950
 He always feels that he is the one 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.360
 rational 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.360
 play soccer find defender find it 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.370
 Think about their decisions that 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.910
 that can move the game to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.860
 to the next line and you 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.250
 practically we know what they do and what they do 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.149
 have to do 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.280
 as a defender my job and yes it is 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.410
 very clear here what the tasks are 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.410
 and what to do 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.850
 yes that is nice working so how is it 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.219
 with the atmosphere it is a bit 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.480
 try to point yourself out at elbows 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.189
 in the field or everyone is tall 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.659
 proving oneself is becoming field 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.700
 it's not a whole move 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.159
 along with stefan to a more equal one 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.530
 made a chat and no, that's it 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.710
 no competition at all 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.240
 in the well do n't look at you 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.740
 competitors are now just prime 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.030
 enjoyed it 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.159
 the most important thing is preparation 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.930
 Africa that that is optimal and that he 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.020
 goes well and I think so 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.020
 main 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.750
 And yes Stefan does not follow of course 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.650
 want to agree with feyenoord and you this 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.939
 last 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.090
 certainly after the win on very good is you 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.670
 build up and 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.439
 yes I think hopefully goes neck to neck 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.960
 but we see that then 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.509
 yes you see that so nice neck yes i mean 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.039
 we are all the same age to play 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.340
 the longer in the machines have some 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.890
 more experience but yes how can you do that 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.990
 say i said i think we already have one 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.369
 kind of comparable, so say 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.289
 I then neck to neck 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.880
 what do you think he will give by 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.200
 last season or you think so 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.119
 these days also very important 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.950
 will be i think at the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.390
 think for the most part what your magazine 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.819
 of course see me last season but me 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.680
 think if you are here it will be very good 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.110
 does that you also have a big chance then 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.910
 that you are here because that 4 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.319
 whatever yourself yes that I go 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.150
 of course that I will play and the snap 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.370
 so just me or last season 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.510
 more and more important is what you need now 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.510
 now can show i hope 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.060
 now because yes I went for the win 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.770
 it's good but then the senate will 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.410
 less and now I am again 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.300
 I love that you risk growing 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.300
 probably now goes through the elements 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.650
 as the national coach tightly towards you 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.090
 comes and tells you 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.920
 tell me why should you go to it 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.830
 wk what do you say then 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.480
 you will not regret it but that 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.470
 are already have questions then you can not 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.060
 to film 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.320
 no but just if he asks you now 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.320
 why do you have to go to the world cup 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.170
 our rozemeijer sees that but der vinne 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.460
 to say i am i i think i am 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.540
 could play very well there and I am the 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.190
 Best 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.110
 well i am not someone that that that 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.160
 so pronounce is that a piece 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.700
 modesty 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.740
 yes I think so but I also think so 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.380
 more better others can be judged there 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.130
 and that you do not have that about yourself 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.590
 must be 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.590
 we must do ok we will do
