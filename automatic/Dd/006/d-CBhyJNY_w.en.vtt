all<00:00:01.110> right<00:00:01.290> welcome<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.740> tutorial<00:00:02.460> number<00:00:02.580> two

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
all right welcome to tutorial number two

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.829 
all right welcome to tutorial number two
we'll<00:00:03.300> do<00:00:03.449> some<00:00:03.750> more<00:00:04.160> basics<00:00:05.480> some<00:00:06.480> things<00:00:06.720> I

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
we'll do some more basics some things I

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.980 
we'll do some more basics some things I
missed<00:00:07.080> in<00:00:07.200> tutorial<00:00:07.440> 1<00:00:07.740> but<00:00:07.980> we'll<00:00:08.340> focus<00:00:08.670> on

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
missed in tutorial 1 but we'll focus on

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.240 
missed in tutorial 1 but we'll focus on
constraints<00:00:10.219> so<00:00:11.219> that'll<00:00:11.460> be<00:00:11.550> step<00:00:11.759> 2<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
constraints so that'll be step 2 in the

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.269 
constraints so that'll be step 2 in the
sketching<00:00:14.250> section<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.839> one<00:00:16.740> thing<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.010> forgot

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
sketching section so one thing I forgot

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.120 
sketching section so one thing I forgot
to<00:00:17.460> mention<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.359> perhaps<00:00:18.960> very<00:00:19.619> useful

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
to mention that is perhaps very useful

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.279 
to mention that is perhaps very useful
is<00:00:20.310> selecting<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:22.380> deleting<00:00:23.240> drawings<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.660> if

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
is selecting and deleting drawings so if

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.009 
is selecting and deleting drawings so if
you<00:00:25.619> click<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.220> drag<00:00:26.570> you<00:00:27.570> make<00:00:27.750> these

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
you click and drag you make these

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.640 
you click and drag you make these
selection<00:00:28.680> boxes<00:00:29.099> if<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.179> go<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:31.050> quadrant

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
selection boxes if you go this quadrant

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.150 
selection boxes if you go this quadrant
is<00:00:32.000> different<00:00:33.000> than<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:34.050> quadrant<00:00:34.559> visually

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
is different than this quadrant visually

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.010 
is different than this quadrant visually
but<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.880> also<00:00:36.000> selects<00:00:36.420> differently<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:36.960> if

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
but it also selects differently so if

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.270 
but it also selects differently so if
you<00:00:37.170> select<00:00:38.450> down<00:00:39.450> into<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> right

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
you select down into the right

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.440 
you select down into the right
anything<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.520> completely<00:00:41.940> contained

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
anything that is completely contained

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.350 
anything that is completely contained
will<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.960> selected<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.550> circle<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.149> will

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
will be selected so the circle now will

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.029 
will be selected so the circle now will
be<00:00:45.450> completely<00:00:45.899> contained<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> only

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
be completely contained and is the only

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.660 
be completely contained and is the only
thing<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.430> selected<00:00:47.690> if<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:48.899> deletes

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
thing that is selected if one deletes

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.389 
thing that is selected if one deletes
drawings<00:00:50.670> hit<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> Delete<00:00:51.480> key<00:00:51.949> or<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.280> could

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
drawings hit the Delete key or you could

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.319 
drawings hit the Delete key or you could
also<00:00:53.520> select<00:00:53.820> them<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.840> by<00:00:54.960> clicking<00:00:55.289> them

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
also select them just by clicking them

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.060 
also select them just by clicking them
now<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.390> other<00:00:57.750> selection<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.410> anything<00:00:58.859> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
now the other selection is anything that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.670 
now the other selection is anything that
touches<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.390> selection<00:01:00.899> box<00:01:01.140> will<00:01:01.649> be

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
touches the selection box will be

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.149 
touches the selection box will be
selected<00:01:03.379> so<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.439> hope<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.979> see<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
selected so I hope you see the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.410 
selected so I hope you see the
difference<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.939> one<00:01:06.119> has<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
difference there this one has to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.840 
difference there this one has to
completely<00:01:06.960> cover<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> be

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
completely cover it for it to be

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.950 
completely cover it for it to be
selected<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.340> other<00:01:11.460> method<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.420> it's

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
selected and the other method if it's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.109 
selected and the other method if it's
just<00:01:13.110> touching<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.770> will<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:13.979> selected<00:01:14.340> so

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
just touching it it will be selected so

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.120 
just touching it it will be selected so
let's<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.780> clear<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> canvas<00:01:16.530> from<00:01:16.890> last

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
let's just clear the canvas from last

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.960 
let's just clear the canvas from last
time<00:01:18.020> now<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.200> want<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> constraints<00:01:21.380> ok<00:01:22.380> so

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
time now as we want to constraints ok so

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.560 
time now as we want to constraints ok so
you're<00:01:23.970> drawing<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.990> circle<00:01:25.729> so<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.909> click<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
you're drawing a circle so we click and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.120 
you're drawing a circle so we click and
draw<00:01:28.909> but<00:01:30.110> we<00:01:31.110> don't<00:01:31.470> really<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.770> what<00:01:31.920> size

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
draw but we don't really know what size

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.359 
draw but we don't really know what size
this<00:01:32.340> circle<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.770> want<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
this circle is and we want it to be a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.950 
this circle is and we want it to be a
specific<00:01:35.549> size<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.210> escape<00:01:36.750> from<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
specific size so we escape from the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.840 
specific size so we escape from the
circle<00:01:37.229> command<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.130> now<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.759> a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
circle command so now we we have a

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.300 
circle command so now we we have a
circle<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.590> we're<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.770> constrain<00:01:41.280> it

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
circle and we're going to constrain it

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.240 
circle and we're going to constrain it
so<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.810> easy<00:01:42.960> way<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.590> would<00:01:44.189> be

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
so one easy way to do that would be

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.330 
so one easy way to do that would be
click<00:01:44.610> general<00:01:45.149> dimensions<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.780> d<00:01:46.340> click

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
click general dimensions so d click

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.740 
click general dimensions so d click
dimension<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.090> click<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> circle<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
dimension then we click the circle and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.560 
dimension then we click the circle and
it<00:01:48.810> will<00:01:48.930> give<00:01:49.049> us<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.259> diameter<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:51.509> we

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it will give us a diameter so now we

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.219 
it will give us a diameter so now we
have<00:01:51.720> diameter<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:53.030> it's<00:01:54.030> one<00:01:54.270> point<00:01:54.479> two<00:01:54.869> six

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
have diameter and it's one point two six

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.870 
have diameter and it's one point two six
six<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.710> don't<00:01:55.829> want<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.130> point<00:01:56.310> two<00:01:56.430> six<00:01:56.579> we

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
six we don't want one point two six we

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.120 
six we don't want one point two six we
want<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:58.040> diameter<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.159> two<00:01:59.520> inches<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:01.130> if

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
want a to a diameter of two inches so if

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.130 
want a to a diameter of two inches so if
we<00:02:02.250> click<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> dimension<00:02:03.719> box<00:02:03.930> up

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
we click that we get a dimension box up

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.830 
we click that we get a dimension box up
here<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.649> says<00:02:04.710> edit<00:02:05.100> dimension<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.420> let's<00:02:06.659> say

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
here it says edit dimension so let's say

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.520 
here it says edit dimension so let's say
2

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
2

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.630 
2
now<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.770> constrains<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.849> dimension<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
now it constrains it to dimension of to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.040 
now it constrains it to dimension of to
also<00:02:14.640> if<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:14.940> want<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> zoom<00:02:15.300> extents<00:02:15.510> really

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
also if you want to zoom extents really

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.650 
also if you want to zoom extents really
quickly<00:02:16.349> one<00:02:16.500> one<00:02:16.800> tool<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.880> use<00:02:18.090> often<00:02:18.330> is

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
quickly one one tool I use often is

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.130 
quickly one one tool I use often is
double-click<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.319> mouse<00:02:19.860> wheel<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:22.020> will

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
double-click the mouse wheel that will

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.979 
double-click the mouse wheel that will
zoom<00:02:22.380> extents<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.880> now<00:02:24.150> we<00:02:24.209> have<00:02:24.450> constrained

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
zoom extents so now we have constrained

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.770 
zoom extents so now we have constrained
this<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.410> two<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.190> exit<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.060> dimension

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
this to two so exit the dimension

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.180 
this to two so exit the dimension
feature<00:02:30.709> another<00:02:31.709> example<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.670> rectangle

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
feature another example is to rectangle

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.050 
feature another example is to rectangle
we<00:02:35.190> want<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.489> rectangle<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.090> be<00:02:36.180> two<00:02:36.810> by<00:02:37.260> ten

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
we want this rectangle to be two by ten

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.090 
we want this rectangle to be two by ten
or<00:02:39.060> two<00:02:39.360> by<00:02:39.510> one<00:02:39.540> let's<00:02:40.019> say<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.650> dimension

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
or two by one let's say so the dimension

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.949 
or two by one let's say so the dimension
click<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.940> side<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:43.560> 0.71<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:48.450> when<00:02:48.930> I

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
click the side is 0.71 so to and when I

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.280 
click the side is 0.71 so to and when I
decide<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.470> be<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:54.049> don't<00:02:55.049> know<00:02:55.110> why<00:02:55.230> is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
decide to be one I don't know why is

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.620 
decide to be one I don't know why is
opening<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.709> other<00:02:55.830> window<00:02:56.299> anyways<00:02:57.299> one

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
opening on the other window anyways one

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.030 
opening on the other window anyways one
also<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:00.810> want<00:03:01.049> this<00:03:01.920> corner<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:04.110> line<00:03:04.560> up<00:03:04.739> with

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
also we want this corner to line up with

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.520 
also we want this corner to line up with
the<00:03:05.250> circle<00:03:05.580> directly<00:03:05.760> or<00:03:06.360> better<00:03:06.959> yet<00:03:07.170> we

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
the circle directly or better yet we

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.930 
the circle directly or better yet we
want<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:09.180> be<00:03:09.209> tangent<00:03:09.870> with<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.170> circle

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
want this to be tangent with the circle

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.520 
want this to be tangent with the circle
so<00:03:11.940> we've<00:03:12.180> got<00:03:12.330> constraints<00:03:12.989> up<00:03:13.109> here<00:03:13.320> we've

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
so we've got constraints up here we've

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.490 
so we've got constraints up here we've
got<00:03:13.769> we<00:03:14.640> got<00:03:14.910> coincident<00:03:16.340> collinear

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
got we got coincident collinear

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.120 
got we got coincident collinear
concentric<00:03:19.970> just<00:03:20.970> fix<00:03:21.620> vertical<00:03:22.620> constraints

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
concentric just fix vertical constraints

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.530 
concentric just fix vertical constraints
tons<00:03:23.430> different<00:03:23.790> constraints<00:03:24.030> but<00:03:24.299> we<00:03:24.359> want

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
tons different constraints but we want

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.340 
tons different constraints but we want
tangential<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.970> we<00:03:27.180> want<00:03:27.359> this<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:28.320> be

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
tangential so we want this to be

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.130 
tangential so we want this to be
tangential<00:03:28.980> with<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:30.019> there<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.079> have

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
tangential with that and there you have

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.199 
tangential with that and there you have
it<00:03:33.829> basically<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:35.070> just<00:03:35.100> play<00:03:35.519> around<00:03:35.640> adding

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
it basically you just play around adding

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.140 
it basically you just play around adding
constraints<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.989> your<00:03:37.109> drawing<00:03:37.880> until<00:03:38.880> it<00:03:39.030> is

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
constraints to your drawing until it is

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.440 
constraints to your drawing until it is
completely<00:03:39.630> how<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.900> like<00:03:40.200> it

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
completely how you like it

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.069 
completely how you like it
let's<00:03:42.450> say<00:03:42.720> we<00:03:42.930> want<00:03:43.200> this<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:45.269> be<00:03:45.299> up<00:03:45.420> there<00:03:45.720> of

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
let's say we want this to be up there of

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.160 
let's say we want this to be up there of
these<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.500> remain<00:03:46.709> tangential<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:49.170> let's

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
these to remain tangential so let's

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.160 
these to remain tangential so let's
create<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.319> dimension<00:03:52.859> and<00:03:53.540> we'll<00:03:54.540> say<00:03:54.840> we

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
create this dimension and we'll say we

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.789 
create this dimension and we'll say we
want<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.590> point<00:03:55.950> one<00:03:57.109> so<00:03:58.109> there<00:03:58.319> you<00:03:58.709> have<00:03:58.950> it

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
want it point one so there you have it

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.160 
want it point one so there you have it
if<00:04:01.799> this<00:04:01.980> is<00:04:02.130> what<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.340> wanted<00:04:02.760> it's<00:04:03.450> very<00:04:03.810> easy

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
if this is what I wanted it's very easy

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.539 
if this is what I wanted it's very easy
to<00:04:04.350> create<00:04:04.790> so<00:04:05.790> I'll<00:04:06.239> go<00:04:06.450> over<00:04:06.480> some<00:04:07.549> basic

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
to create so I'll go over some basic

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.920 
to create so I'll go over some basic
examples<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:09.630> sort<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:09.989> use<00:04:10.410> these<00:04:10.620> features

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
examples that sort of use these features

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.569 
examples that sort of use these features
somewhat<00:04:12.930> more<00:04:13.560> clearly<00:04:13.980> than<00:04:14.190> what<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.430> have

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
somewhat more clearly than what I have

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.469 
somewhat more clearly than what I have
done<00:04:14.730> here<00:04:15.000> in<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.870> next<00:04:16.260> tutorial<00:04:16.919> so
