seconds<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:56.670> green<00:00:56.969> LED<00:00:57.510> will<00:00:57.719> start

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
seconds the green LED will start

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.189 
seconds the green LED will start
flashing<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:59.460> confirms<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> EEPROM

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
flashing that confirms that the EEPROM

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.969 
flashing that confirms that the EEPROM
has<00:01:01.500> been<00:01:01.890> erased<00:01:02.750> so<00:01:03.750> I'll<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.170> wait<00:01:04.379> for

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
has been erased so I'll just wait for

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:18.539 
has been erased so I'll just wait for
the<00:01:05.369> light<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.580> start<00:01:06.000> flashing

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.789 

okay<00:01:19.390> let's<00:01:19.750> now<00:01:19.899> confirm<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.649> e

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
okay let's now confirm that the e

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.050 
okay let's now confirm that the e
problems<00:01:21.189> are<00:01:21.340> raised<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.990> now<00:01:23.380> we<00:01:23.439> are<00:01:23.770> in<00:01:24.189> box

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
problems are raised so now we are in box

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.999 
problems are raised so now we are in box
in<00:01:25.359> a<00:01:25.509> blank<00:01:25.840> situation<00:01:27.899> unplug<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.079> USB

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.830 

that's<00:01:33.009> now<00:01:33.280> ready<00:01:33.579> to<00:01:33.670> program<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.539> vehicle

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
that's now ready to program to a vehicle

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.330 
that's now ready to program to a vehicle
so<00:01:35.619> remove<00:01:36.189> the<00:01:36.369> jumper<00:01:36.549> cable<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:38.380> turn<00:01:38.649> it<00:01:38.860> 90

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
so remove the jumper cable we turn it 90

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.120 
so remove the jumper cable we turn it 90
degrees<00:01:39.759> just<00:01:40.149> so<00:01:40.719> that<00:01:40.869> we<00:01:41.020> can<00:01:41.469> retain<00:01:41.829> it<00:01:41.979> on

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
degrees just so that we can retain it on

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.130 
degrees just so that we can retain it on
one<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.549> pins<00:01:42.819> just<00:01:43.209> to<00:01:43.569> keep<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:43.929> in<00:01:44.079> a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
one of the pins just to keep it in a

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.230 
one of the pins just to keep it in a
safe<00:01:44.350> place<00:01:47.310> although<00:01:48.310> I've<00:01:48.610> got<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.850> harness

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
safe place although I've got the harness

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.600 
safe place although I've got the harness
connected<00:01:49.750> here<00:01:49.959> we've<00:01:50.319> got<00:01:50.469> no<00:01:50.770> electrical

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
connected here we've got no electrical

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.699 
connected here we've got no electrical
connections<00:01:52.149> to<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:52.810> board<00:01:53.049> whatsoever

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
connections to the board whatsoever

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.300 
connections to the board whatsoever
whatsoever<00:01:54.989> we<00:01:55.989> want<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.319> then<00:01:56.470> send<00:01:57.189> a

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
whatsoever we want to then send a

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.729 
whatsoever we want to then send a
program<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.810> board<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.659> plug<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.349> USB

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:02.739 
program to the board so plug the USB

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:11.640 
program to the board so plug the USB
cable<00:02:03.039> back<00:02:03.700> in

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.540 

right<00:02:12.650> now<00:02:13.160> we're<00:02:13.370> going<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.640> run<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.750> program

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
right now we're going to run the program

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.550 
right now we're going to run the program
so
