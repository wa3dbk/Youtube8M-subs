clan so we did shuffle around the team's
quite<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.109> bit<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.109> to<00:03:04.290> get<00:03:04.410> make<00:03:04.709> sure<00:03:04.859> we

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
quite a bit so it is to get make sure we

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.020 
quite a bit so it is to get make sure we
got<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.099> matchup<00:03:05.900> but<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.310> what<00:03:08.310> what<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.849> guys

got a matchup but the what what the guys

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.259 
got a matchup but the what what the guys
have<00:03:09.060> told<00:03:09.510> me<00:03:09.690> is<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:09.989> i<00:03:10.620> know<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.519> I

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
have told me is that i know the I

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.809 
have told me is that i know the I
suppose<00:03:12.959> their<00:03:13.410> their<00:03:13.859> processes<00:03:14.519> are<00:03:14.670> better

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
suppose their their processes are better

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.339 
suppose their their processes are better
than<00:03:14.910> as<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.269> more<00:03:15.450> established<00:03:15.540> they've<00:03:16.170> got

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
than as the more established they've got

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.940 
than as the more established they've got
better<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:17.280> know<00:03:17.900> they<00:03:18.900> collaborate<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.739> in

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
better you know they collaborate is in

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.330 
better you know they collaborate is in
raid<00:03:20.519> strategies<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.269> opinions<00:03:21.720> much<00:03:21.930> more

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
raid strategies and opinions much more

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.250 
raid strategies and opinions much more
and<00:03:23.340> work<00:03:24.180> together<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.720> think<00:03:24.810> that's

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
and work together I think that's

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.750 
and work together I think that's
something<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.650> we<00:03:25.859> lack<00:03:26.099> a<00:03:26.130> little<00:03:26.459> bit<00:03:26.609> and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
something that we lack a little bit and

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.250 
something that we lack a little bit and
I'm<00:03:26.849> not<00:03:27.030> afraid<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.329> admit<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:27.959> think<00:03:28.019> it's

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
I'm not afraid to admit it I think it's

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.199 
I'm not afraid to admit it I think it's
something<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.680> I'm<00:03:28.859> gonna<00:03:29.099> miss<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.609> become

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
something that I'm gonna miss it become

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.330 
something that I'm gonna miss it become
very<00:03:30.419> high<00:03:30.630> on<00:03:30.660> my<00:03:30.870> priority<00:03:31.319> list<00:03:31.349> but<00:03:32.190> we

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
very high on my priority list but we

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.970 
very high on my priority list but we
were<00:03:33.019> relatively<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.560> know<00:03:34.680> we<00:03:34.799> were

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
were relatively you know we were

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.559 
were relatively you know we were
relatively<00:03:35.430> experience<00:03:36.120> but<00:03:36.269> we've<00:03:36.450> got

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
relatively experience but we've got

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.140 
relatively experience but we've got
we've<00:03:36.720> got<00:03:37.109> one<00:03:37.319> not<00:03:37.560> naive<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.700> think<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.970> we

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
we've got one not naive to think that we

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.460 
we've got one not naive to think that we
haven't<00:03:39.359> got<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> long<00:03:39.690> way<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:39.959> go<00:03:40.169> because<00:03:40.260> we

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
haven't got a long way to go because we

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.550 
haven't got a long way to go because we
have<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:41.730> this<00:03:41.940> war<00:03:42.329> sort<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.079> pointed<00:03:43.440> out

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
have and this war sort of pointed out

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.319 
have and this war sort of pointed out
that<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.799> little<00:03:44.130> bit<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.430> me<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.120> guys

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
that a little bit to me and to the guys

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.379 
that a little bit to me and to the guys
and<00:03:45.900> yes<00:03:46.470> our<00:03:46.650> teamwork<00:03:47.099> wasn't<00:03:47.519> wasn't<00:03:48.000> up<00:03:48.329> to

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
and yes our teamwork wasn't wasn't up to

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.099 
and yes our teamwork wasn't wasn't up to
where<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.959> should<00:03:49.230> be<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:50.060> but<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.630> know<00:03:51.780> we

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
where it should be and but you know we

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.390 
where it should be and but you know we
still<00:03:52.380> managed<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.680> get<00:03:52.829> some<00:03:53.040> good<00:03:53.130> three

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
still managed to get some good three

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.270 
still managed to get some good three
stars<00:03:53.669> on<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.940> board<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.540> i<00:03:55.079> think<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:56.040> clash

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
stars on the board and i think the clash

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.400 
stars on the board and i think the clash
gods<00:03:56.579> were<00:03:56.819> not<00:03:56.970> in<00:03:57.120> our<00:03:57.239> favor<00:03:57.419> too<00:03:58.019> much

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
gods were not in our favor too much

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.110 
gods were not in our favor too much
there<00:03:58.680> were<00:03:58.739> some<00:03:59.040> pretty<00:03:59.250> tough<00:03:59.549> basis

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
there were some pretty tough basis

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.659 
there were some pretty tough basis
compared<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.049> what<00:04:01.200> we<00:04:01.349> find<00:04:01.590> war<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.459> war

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
compared to what we find war in a war

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.059 
compared to what we find war in a war
out<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.200> but<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.349> was<00:04:04.500> what<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.769> point<00:04:04.919> of

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
out and but that was what the point of

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.309 
out and but that was what the point of
this<00:04:05.129> whole<00:04:05.280> thing<00:04:05.700> was<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:06.480> really<00:04:06.840> get<00:04:07.169> an

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
this whole thing was to really get an

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.110 
this whole thing was to really get an
idea<00:04:07.440> now<00:04:07.950> i'm<00:04:08.069> not<00:04:08.250> going<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.459> go<00:04:08.519> in<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:08.849> ruin

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
idea now i'm not going to go in and ruin

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.210 
idea now i'm not going to go in and ruin
everyone's<00:04:09.450> base<00:04:09.750> because<00:04:10.319> if<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.859> haven't<00:04:11.129> got

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
everyone's base because if I haven't got

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.830 
everyone's base because if I haven't got
the<00:04:11.310> content<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.849> show<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:12.090> what's<00:04:12.419> the<00:04:12.569> point

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
the content to show you what's the point

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.379 
the content to show you what's the point
I<00:04:13.650> will<00:04:14.459> do<00:04:14.609> is<00:04:14.730> have<00:04:14.849> a<00:04:14.879> run<00:04:15.090> through<00:04:15.269> the

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
I will do is have a run through the

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.620 
I will do is have a run through the
attack<00:04:15.629> log<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.079> you'll<00:04:16.680> see<00:04:16.859> what<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:17.010> mean

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
attack log and you'll see what I mean

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.250 
attack log and you'll see what I mean
and<00:04:18.630> we<00:04:18.780> got<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.169> 16<00:04:19.620> hours<00:04:19.769> remaining<00:04:20.250> and

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
and we got to 16 hours remaining and

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.810 
and we got to 16 hours remaining and
yeah<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.440> hit<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.800> ninety-six<00:04:23.400> percent<00:04:23.520> which

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
yeah I hit the ninety-six percent which

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.140 
yeah I hit the ninety-six percent which
I<00:04:24.030> did<00:04:24.300> upload<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.900> youtube<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.789> but<00:04:26.789> you're

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
I did upload to youtube and but you're

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
going to see now what the war logs

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.250 
going to see now what the war logs
actually<00:04:29.340> like<00:04:29.669> and<00:04:30.479> you'll<00:04:30.690> see<00:04:30.870> where<00:04:31.080> one

actually like and you'll see where one

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.450 
actually like and you'll see where one
hive<00:04:31.469> came<00:04:31.800> hard

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
hive came hard

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.820 
hive came hard
this<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:33.240> couple<00:04:33.750> of<00:04:33.900> three<00:04:34.139> stars<00:04:34.500> at<00:04:34.710> the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
this a couple of three stars at the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.400 
this a couple of three stars at the
lower<00:04:35.100> level<00:04:35.639> 13<00:04:36.150> techno<00:04:36.600> point<00:04:36.930> one<00:04:37.050> taken<00:04:37.319> on

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
lower level 13 techno point one taken on

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.189 
lower level 13 techno point one taken on
13<00:04:38.220> that<00:04:38.580> was<00:04:38.639> a<00:04:38.729> would<00:04:39.449> having<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.660> nice<00:04:39.840> three

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
13 that was a would having a nice three

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.499 
13 that was a would having a nice three
star<00:04:40.470> on<00:04:40.650> lose<00:04:40.830> base<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:43.160> again<00:04:44.160> lot<00:04:44.729> quite<00:04:45.479> a

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
star on lose base and again lot quite a

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.900 
star on lose base and again lot quite a
few<00:04:45.569> one<00:04:45.930> stars<00:04:46.319> here<00:04:46.620> unfortunately<00:04:46.910> from

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
few one stars here unfortunately from

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.409 
few one stars here unfortunately from
from<00:04:48.210> emphatically<00:04:48.810> going<00:04:49.229> in<00:04:50.270> but<00:04:51.270> you'll

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
from emphatically going in but you'll

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.300 
from emphatically going in but you'll
see<00:04:51.660> that<00:04:51.810> this<00:04:51.960> fails<00:04:52.259> both<00:04:52.620> sides<00:04:52.979> and<00:04:53.250> the

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
see that this fails both sides and the

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.339 
see that this fails both sides and the
point<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:53.849> that<00:04:53.910> when<00:04:54.509> you<00:04:54.599> don't<00:04:54.870> know<00:04:55.020> traps

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
point is that when you don't know traps

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.080 
point is that when you don't know traps
it's<00:04:55.590> diff<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.919> is<00:04:56.160> difficult<00:04:56.430> you<00:04:56.759> have<00:04:56.880> to

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
it's diff it is difficult you have to

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.140 
it's diff it is difficult you have to
guess<00:04:57.300> now<00:04:57.990> by<00:04:58.949> talking<00:04:59.580> through<00:04:59.699> as<00:04:59.789> a<00:04:59.880> team

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
guess now by talking through as a team

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.089 
guess now by talking through as a team
and<00:05:01.099> fully<00:05:02.870> you<00:05:03.870> know<00:05:03.930> analyzing<00:05:04.440> a<00:05:04.710> base<00:05:04.889> you

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
and fully you know analyzing a base you

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.650 
and fully you know analyzing a base you
can<00:05:05.310> work<00:05:05.490> out<00:05:05.669> quite<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:05.940> lot<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.270> it<00:05:06.360> does

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
can work out quite a lot and it does

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.219 
can work out quite a lot and it does
become<00:05:06.930> quite<00:05:07.169> obvious<00:05:07.919> over<00:05:08.220> time<00:05:08.460> and<00:05:09.229> I

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
become quite obvious over time and I

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.610 
become quite obvious over time and I
think<00:05:10.500> that<00:05:11.070> that's<00:05:11.280> something<00:05:11.849> that<00:05:12.090> we<00:05:12.419> as<00:05:12.840> I

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
think that that's something that we as I

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.589 
think that that's something that we as I
said<00:05:13.650> can<00:05:13.949> work<00:05:14.130> on<00:05:14.310> better<00:05:14.580> but<00:05:15.150> once<00:05:15.330> you've

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
said can work on better but once you've

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.870 
said can work on better but once you've
seen<00:05:16.590> an<00:05:16.800> attack<00:05:17.009> a<00:05:17.099> lot<00:05:17.280> of<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.430> three<00:05:17.639> stars

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
seen an attack a lot of the three stars

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.189 
seen an attack a lot of the three stars
come<00:05:18.120> from<00:05:18.150> cleanups<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:18.810> you'll<00:05:18.960> see

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
come from cleanups and you'll see

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.350 
come from cleanups and you'll see
although<00:05:19.860> they<00:05:20.039> do<00:05:20.099> hit<00:05:20.430> quite<00:05:20.789> a<00:05:20.849> number<00:05:21.210> of

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
although they do hit quite a number of

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.850 
although they do hit quite a number of
threes<00:05:21.780> on<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.050> first<00:05:22.259> time<00:05:22.500> which<00:05:22.680> is

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
threes on the first time which is

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.909 
threes on the first time which is
impressive<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:24.199> this<00:05:25.199> is<00:05:25.349> where<00:05:25.530> one<00:05:25.710> harvest

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
impressive and this is where one harvest

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.070 
impressive and this is where one harvest
on<00:05:26.159> to<00:05:26.310> come<00:05:26.490> come<00:05:26.759> out<00:05:26.880> as<00:05:27.000> hard<00:05:27.210> deco<00:05:27.810> in<00:05:27.960> with

on to come come out as hard deco in with

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.520 
on to come come out as hard deco in with
a<00:05:28.110> 99<00:05:28.830> followed<00:05:29.639> by<00:05:29.820> chasing<00:05:30.659> with<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:30.870> 98<00:05:31.500> I

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
a 99 followed by chasing with the 98 I

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.010 
a 99 followed by chasing with the 98 I
mean<00:05:31.800> that<00:05:32.099> it's<00:05:32.250> gut-wrenching<00:05:32.870> Sevani<00:05:33.870> in
