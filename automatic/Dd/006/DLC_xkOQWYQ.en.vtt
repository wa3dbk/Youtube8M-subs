00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:09.389
 Epistle of the Apostle Saint Paul to the 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:09.389
 Roman Romans Chapter 12 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.420
 I beg you, brothers, for the great 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.210
 Tenderness of God 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.300
 that they offer their own person as 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.680
 a living and holy sacrifice capable of 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.500
 please him 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.320
 this cult suits creatures that 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.050
 they have a trial 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.170
 do not follow the current of the world in which 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.150
 We live but rather to transform 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.790
 from an interior renovation 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.290
 so they will know how to distinguish 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:50.200
 God what it is good what 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:52.540
 he likes what is perfect 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.210
 the grace that God has given me 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.750
 authorizes to tell everyone and everyone 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.300
 from you 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:05.760
 that do not intrude on anything 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:09.810
 but aspire to what to look for 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.090
 that each one acts wisely according to the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.090
 charisma that God has given him 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.020
 look how many parts our 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.390
 body and it is one 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.670
 although the different parties do not 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.670
 they perform the same function 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.760
 so we also form a single 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.370
 body in Christ 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.920
 we depend on each other 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.620

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.140
 they perform the same function as well 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.950
 we form a single body in 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.799
 christ we depend on each other 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.730
 and we have different charisms according to the 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.060

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:06.210
