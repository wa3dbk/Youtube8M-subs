as well it's to make a W so what you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.870 
as well it's to make a W so what you
want<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> do<00:01:37.920> that's<00:01:38.070> what's<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.729> get

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
want to do that's what's going to get

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.179 
want to do that's what's going to get
the<00:01:39.000> most<00:01:39.150> surface<00:01:39.360> area<00:01:39.650> really<00:01:40.650> cocked<00:01:40.979> back

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the most surface area really cocked back

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.190 
the most surface area really cocked back
boom<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.119> know<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.540> release<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> forward

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
boom you know and release it forward

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.789 
boom you know and release it forward
then<00:01:44.189> when<00:01:44.369> you're<00:01:44.490> done<00:01:44.640> doing<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.799> you're

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
then when you're done doing that you're

then when you're done doing that you're
going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> probably<00:01:47.220> learn<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.240> where<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
going to probably learn to do where you

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.560 
going to probably learn to do where you
actually<00:01:49.530> step<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.159> go<00:01:50.280> forward<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.090> then

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
actually chest you hop over here for a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.160 
actually chest you hop over here for a
second<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.610> if<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> sideline<00:02:00.509> ignore

getting the reason you do that is you
get

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
get

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.060 
get
Menem<00:02:13.640> so<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:15.350> know<00:02:15.470> you're<00:02:15.680> going<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.980> do<00:02:16.040> a

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
Menem so you know you're going to do a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.710 
Menem so you know you're going to do a
little<00:02:16.280> hop<00:02:16.460> and<00:02:16.700> then<00:02:16.970> drag<00:02:17.240> your<00:02:17.270> foot<00:02:17.570> and

then you're off and that's something
you're<00:02:19.580> going<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.760> learn<00:02:19.850> in<00:02:20.000> soccer<00:02:20.210> too<00:02:20.450> is

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
you're going to learn in soccer too is

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.120 
you're going to learn in soccer too is
your<00:02:20.990> first<00:02:21.230> step<00:02:21.440> should<00:02:21.470> always<00:02:21.710> be<00:02:21.860> moving

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
your first step should always be moving

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.350 
your first step should always be moving
when<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.280> pass<00:02:22.520> your<00:02:22.790> first<00:02:23.000> step<00:02:23.150> should<00:02:23.180> be

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
when you pass your first step should be

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.230 
when you pass your first step should be
moving<00:02:23.720> it's<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.230> same<00:02:24.380> of<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.590> throw<00:02:24.770> on

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
moving it's the same of the throw on

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.960 
moving it's the same of the throw on
again<00:02:26.240> what<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.510> like<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.930> actually<00:02:27.110> do<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:28.130> to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
again what I like to actually do is a to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.610 
again what I like to actually do is a to
get<00:02:29.090> even<00:02:29.330> more<00:02:29.450> power<00:02:29.690> as<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:29.990> do<00:02:30.050> this<00:02:30.320> I<00:02:30.500> do

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
get even more power as I do this I do

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.340 
get even more power as I do this I do
kind<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.070> like<00:02:31.160> this<00:02:31.400> hop<00:02:31.700> where<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.959> know<00:02:33.080> I'm

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
kind of like this hop where you know I'm

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.920 
kind of like this hop where you know I'm
running<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.890> I'm<00:02:33.980> hopping<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:35.540> get<00:02:35.720> more

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
running and I'm hopping to get more

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.860 
running and I'm hopping to get more
power<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.880> again<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.330> reason<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.720> do<00:02:38.840> that

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
power so again and the reason to do that

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.570 
power so again and the reason to do that
is<00:02:39.050> it's<00:02:39.380> just<00:02:39.440> kind<00:02:39.740> of<00:02:39.830> it's<00:02:40.310> kind<00:02:40.550> of

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
is it's just kind of it's kind of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.820 
is it's just kind of it's kind of
torquing<00:02:40.940> your<00:02:41.060> body<00:02:41.240> into<00:02:41.480> momentum<00:02:42.020> so<00:02:42.560> but

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
torquing your body into momentum so but

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.470 
torquing your body into momentum so but
when<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.040> first<00:02:43.220> start<00:02:43.520> out<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:43.940> might<00:02:44.420> want

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
when you first start out you might want

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.620 
when you first start out you might want
to<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.410> know<00:02:45.440> run<00:02:45.770> up<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.130> line

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
to just you know run up to the line

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.800 
to just you know run up to the line
throw<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:47.989> then<00:02:48.680> drag<00:02:49.340> your<00:02:49.520> foot<00:02:49.810> one
