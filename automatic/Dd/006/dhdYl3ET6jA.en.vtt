00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
something that I didn't really condone

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.450 
something that I didn't really condone
or<00:01:38.040> use<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.090> football<00:01:39.509> manager<00:01:39.540> 2013<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.340> this

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
or use in football manager 2013 but this

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.980 
or use in football manager 2013 but this
series<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.909> all<00:01:42.030> about<00:01:42.060> recreating<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
series is all about recreating the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.170 
series is all about recreating the
tactics<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.530> realistically<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.310> possible<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
tactics as realistically as possible and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.490 
tactics as realistically as possible and
so<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.479> believe<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.930> having<00:01:46.079> both<00:01:46.350> these

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
so I believe that having both these

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.289 
so I believe that having both these
players<00:01:46.770> set<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.189> playmaker<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> best<00:01:48.149> way

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
players set to playmaker is the best way

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.870 
players set to playmaker is the best way

with this series we're looking at trying
to<00:02:39.599> create<00:02:39.780> these<00:02:40.049> tactics<00:02:40.469> realistically

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
to create these tactics realistically

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.009 
to create these tactics realistically
and<00:02:41.579> whilst<00:02:41.790> I've<00:02:41.939> not<00:02:42.090> had<00:02:42.239> too<00:02:42.540> much<00:02:42.719> time<00:02:42.959> to

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
and whilst I've not had too much time to

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.440 
and whilst I've not had too much time to
test<00:02:43.349> this<00:02:43.499> tactic<00:02:43.919> in<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.099> lot<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.310> detail<00:02:44.939> I<00:02:45.180> do

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
test this tactic in a lot of detail I do

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.659 
test this tactic in a lot of detail I do
intend<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.139> do<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.799> potentially<00:02:47.519> in<00:02:47.579> the

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:47.669 
intend to do so and potentially in the

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.300 
intend to do so and potentially in the
future<00:02:47.930> kind<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.049> amend<00:02:49.469> these<00:02:49.620> tactics<00:02:50.159> and

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
future kind of amend these tactics and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.490 
future kind of amend these tactics and
refine<00:02:50.639> tactics<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.269> do<00:02:51.329> in<00:02:51.599> this<00:02:51.719> series<00:02:52.139> so

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
refine tactics I do in this series so

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.140

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
the same with Pedro and so to compensate

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.909 
the same with Pedro and so to compensate
with<00:03:30.599> that<00:03:30.780> using<00:03:31.259> the<00:03:31.470> new<00:03:31.590> player

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
with that using the new player

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
instructions I've said it so that in

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.020 
instructions I've said it so that in
left<00:03:33.810> attack<00:03:34.109> in<00:03:34.290> mid<00:03:34.500> when<00:03:34.979> Pedro<00:03:35.250> plays<00:03:35.729> here

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
left attack in mid when Pedro plays here

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.360 
left attack in mid when Pedro plays here
he<00:03:36.269> set<00:03:36.509> to<00:03:36.689> a<00:03:36.720> winger<00:03:37.169> on<00:03:37.199> support<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.250> when

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
he set to a winger on support and when

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.099 
he set to a winger on support and when
Neymar's<00:03:38.790> here<00:03:39.000> as<00:03:39.120> he<00:03:39.239> is<00:03:39.359> currently<00:03:39.599> picked

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
Neymar's here as he is currently picked

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:40.999 
Neymar's here as he is currently picked
for<00:03:40.319> this<00:03:40.439> position

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:41.009 
for this position

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.069 
for this position
he's<00:03:41.340> an<00:03:41.489> inside<00:03:41.790> forward<00:03:42.150> set<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.479> attack<00:03:42.810> and

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
he's an inside forward set to attack and

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.990 
he's an inside forward set to attack and
then<00:03:43.109> on<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> flipside<00:03:43.889> if<00:03:44.370> we<00:03:44.489> look<00:03:44.699> at<00:03:44.849> it

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
then on the flipside if we look at it

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.390 
then on the flipside if we look at it
you<00:03:45.389> can<00:03:45.419> see<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:46.109> Neymar<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.590> set<00:03:46.919> to<00:03:47.040> inside

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.800 
you can see that Neymar is set to inside
forward<00:03:47.669> attack<00:03:47.970> if<00:03:48.120> he's<00:03:48.239> on<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.419> right-hand
