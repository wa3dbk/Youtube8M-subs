many units on the ground to see we just

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.289 
many units on the ground to see we just
can't<00:01:16.860> cope<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.610> him<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:17.939> expansion

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
can't cope with him and that expansion

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.340 
can't cope with him and that expansion
goes<00:01:18.509> down<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:18.930> feel<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.170> saber

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
goes down and I just feel it saber

and<00:01:24.750> flash<00:01:24.960> comfortably<00:01:25.470> team<00:01:25.590> that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and flash comfortably team that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.499

expansion<00:01:26.040> down<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:26.939> flashes<00:01:27.299> yet

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
expansion down and I think flashes yet

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.480 
expansion down and I think flashes yet
again<00:01:27.750> gonna<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.350> able<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.560> starve<00:01:28.890> Savior<00:01:29.340> out

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
again gonna be able to starve Savior out

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.859 
again gonna be able to starve Savior out
see<00:01:29.700> who's<00:01:29.820> got<00:01:29.939> his<00:01:30.180> hive<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:30.720> he's

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
see who's got his hive up now he's

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.480 
see who's got his hive up now he's
getting<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> ultras<00:01:31.470> cavern<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.460> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
getting the ultras cavern going but I

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.410 
getting the ultras cavern going but I
think<00:01:32.579> flash<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> gonna<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.240> able<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
think flash is gonna be able to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.760 
think flash is gonna be able to
comfortably<00:01:33.720> starve<00:01:34.110> saber<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.650> we're

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
comfortably starve saber out see we're

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.469 
comfortably starve saber out see we're
now<00:01:34.890> trying<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.670> get<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> expansion<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.299> at

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
now trying to get the expansion up at

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.539 
now trying to get the expansion up at
the<00:01:36.680> eleven<00:01:37.680> o'clock<00:01:37.740> position<00:01:38.220> he<00:01:38.280> clearly

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the eleven o'clock position he clearly

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.710 
the eleven o'clock position he clearly
feels<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.909> need<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> seven<00:01:39.390> gasps<00:01:39.540> and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
feels you need the seven gasps and

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.609 
feels you need the seven gasps and
that's<00:01:39.780> why<00:01:39.990> he<00:01:40.079> went<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> expansion

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that's why he went for the expansion

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.260 
that's why he went for the expansion
first<00:01:41.070> because<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.939> should<00:01:42.090> actually

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
first because and I should actually

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.609 
first because and I should actually
realized<00:01:42.689> when<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.899> saw<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.079> expansion<00:01:43.439> reason

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
realized when I saw the expansion reason

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.630 
realized when I saw the expansion reason
we<00:01:43.680> went<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> expansion<00:01:44.130> forces<00:01:44.460> because

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
we went for the expansion forces because

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.490 
we went for the expansion forces because
he<00:01:44.700> needs<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.180> gas<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.960> his<00:01:46.049> heavy<00:01:46.200> ultra

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
he needs the for gas for his heavy ultra

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.950 
he needs the for gas for his heavy ultra

numbers<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.739> units<00:03:42.040> i<00:03:42.130> think<00:03:42.310> flash<00:03:42.489> has<00:03:42.669> got

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
numbers of units i think flash has got

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.520 
numbers of units i think flash has got
more<00:03:42.970> units<00:03:43.329> which<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.599> always<00:03:43.810> disasters<00:03:44.410> if

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
more units which is always disasters if

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.020 
more units which is always disasters if
you're<00:03:44.620> playing<00:03:44.829> as<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.310> circular<00:03:45.760> versus

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:48.579 
best of seven series I know it isn't but

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:49.949 
best of seven series I know it isn't but
I'm<00:06:48.909> sure<00:06:49.029> the<00:06:49.149> players<00:06:49.359> probably<00:06:49.569> see<00:06:49.809> it<00:06:49.869> as

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:49.959 
I'm sure the players probably see it as

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:52.349 
I'm sure the players probably see it as
like<00:06:50.079> as<00:06:50.649> that<00:06:50.949> flash<00:06:51.219> would<00:06:51.429> have<00:06:51.519> come<00:06:52.269> up

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:52.359 
like as that flash would have come up

00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:53.399 
like as that flash would have come up
with<00:06:52.389> a<00:06:52.509> comfortable<00:06:52.809> when<00:06:52.989> that<00:06:53.109> means<00:06:53.289> that

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:53.409 
with a comfortable when that means that

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:54.899 
with a comfortable when that means that
if<00:06:53.559> it<00:06:53.649> was<00:06:53.739> the<00:06:53.799> best<00:06:53.919> of<00:06:54.039> five<00:06:54.219> series<00:06:54.249> senior

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:54.909 
if it was the best of five series senior

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:57.389 
if it was the best of five series senior
did<00:06:55.029> take<00:06:55.149> the<00:06:55.179> first<00:06:55.479> three<00:06:55.689> games<00:06:56.189> but<00:06:57.189> you

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:57.399 
did take the first three games but you

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:58.439 
did take the first three games but you
never<00:06:57.639> know<00:06:57.819> what<00:06:57.999> would<00:06:58.089> have<00:06:58.179> happened

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:58.449 
never know what would have happened

00:06:58.449 --> 00:06:59.459 
never know what would have happened
maybe<00:06:58.569> flash<00:06:58.749> would<00:06:58.959> have<00:06:59.049> made<00:06:59.139> more<00:06:59.289> of<00:06:59.349> an

00:06:59.459 --> 00:06:59.469 
maybe flash would have made more of an

maybe flash would have made more of an
effort<00:06:59.499> maybe<00:06:59.829> he<00:07:00.009> wanted<00:07:00.309> to<00:07:00.519> give<00:07:01.089> Savior<00:07:01.359> a

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
effort maybe he wanted to give Savior a

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:02.489
