verbal diarrhea anyway right this chord
pattern<00:03:58.340> consists<00:03:59.120> of<00:03:59.239> two<00:03:59.569> bars<00:03:59.780> so<00:04:00.440> two

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
pattern consists of two bars so two

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.010 
pattern consists of two bars so two
times<00:04:01.640> four<00:04:01.880> is<00:04:02.060> eight

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
times four is eight

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.270 
times four is eight
that<00:04:03.200> means<00:04:03.380> there<00:04:03.500> are<00:04:03.560> eight<00:04:03.709> beats<00:04:03.980> in<00:04:04.220> a

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
that means there are eight beats in a

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.580 
that means there are eight beats in a
bar<00:04:04.430> then<00:04:05.090> you<00:04:05.239> play<00:04:05.450> each<00:04:05.660> chord<00:04:06.110> for<00:04:06.410> two

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
bar then you play each chord for two

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.220 
bar then you play each chord for two
beats<00:04:06.770> of<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.100> bar<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:07.850> G<00:04:08.030> for<00:04:08.239> 2<00:04:08.390> D<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:08.959> small

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
beats of the bar so G for 2 D so small

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.590 
beats of the bar so G for 2 D so small
for<00:04:09.380> to<00:04:09.500> see<00:04:09.860> at<00:04:09.950> 9<00:04:10.130> 4<00:04:10.370> 2<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:10.730> D<00:04:10.910> sub<00:04:11.120> 4<00:04:11.330> 4<00:04:11.480> 2

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
for to see at 9 4 2 and the D sub 4 4 2

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.630 
for to see at 9 4 2 and the D sub 4 4 2
so<00:04:12.470> that<00:04:12.650> means<00:04:12.890> it's<00:04:13.269> 1<00:04:14.269> 2<00:04:14.840> 3<00:04:15.470> 4<00:04:16.190> 2<00:04:16.790> 2<00:04:17.120> 3<00:04:17.650> 4<00:04:18.680> if

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
so that means it's 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 if

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.880 
so that means it's 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 if

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
you like to count it in that way in case

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.220 
you like to count it in that way in case
you<00:04:22.220> like<00:04:22.340> music<00:04:22.700> theory<00:04:22.970> ok<00:04:23.600> back<00:04:24.020> to<00:04:24.140> how<00:04:24.200> you

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
pattern again then you have the second

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.070 
pattern again then you have the second
line<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.669> song<00:04:40.940> without<00:04:41.479> saying<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:42.050> word

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
pattern again it changes right so that

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.130 
pattern again it changes right so that
from<00:04:47.660> beginning<00:04:47.810> sounds<00:04:48.470> like

[Music]

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.200

whoa run out of breath and last bit okay

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.089 
whoa run out of breath and last bit okay
and<00:05:14.419> then<00:05:14.839> it<00:05:15.020> goes<00:05:15.169> into<00:05:15.349> try<00:05:15.650> as<00:05:15.710> I<00:05:15.919> may<00:05:16.069> I

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
and then it goes into try as I may I

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.189 
and then it goes into try as I may I
could<00:05:16.309> never<00:05:16.490> explain<00:05:16.699> so<00:05:17.599> this<00:05:17.839> is<00:05:17.960> where<00:05:18.110> it

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
could never explain so this is where it

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.499 
could never explain so this is where it
changes<00:05:18.229> just<00:05:19.039> slightly<00:05:19.279> so<00:05:19.909> you<00:05:19.969> have<00:05:20.150> C<00:05:20.389> at

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
changes just slightly so you have C at

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.279 
changes just slightly so you have C at
nine<00:05:20.689> and<00:05:21.279> then<00:05:22.279> D<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:23.210> C<00:05:23.449> at<00:05:23.539> nine<00:05:23.719> is<00:05:23.960> just

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
nine and then D and C at nine is just

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.140 
nine and then D and C at nine is just
down<00:05:24.439> strums<00:05:24.740> and<00:05:24.979> then<00:05:25.099> D<00:05:25.279> is<00:05:25.309> danced<00:05:25.759> on<00:05:25.879> so

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
down strums and then D is danced on so

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:33.489 
down strums and then D is danced on so
try<00:05:31.150> so<00:05:32.150> that<00:05:32.180> was<00:05:32.479> just<00:05:32.659> before<00:05:32.839> never<00:05:33.169> it

00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:33.499 
try so that was just before never it

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
changes to a d saucepan and just down

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.279 
changes to a d saucepan and just down
strums<00:05:35.719> then<00:05:36.319> it<00:05:36.409> goes<00:05:36.559> back<00:05:36.860> into<00:05:37.069> the<00:05:38.289> normal

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:47.860 
strums then it goes back into the normal
pattern<00:05:46.149> or<00:05:47.149> you<00:05:47.180> could<00:05:47.360> do<00:05:47.419> something<00:05:47.689> a<00:05:47.749> bit

pattern<00:07:21.260> so<00:07:21.919> you<00:07:22.250> know<00:07:22.430> then<00:07:23.030> you<00:07:23.120> play<00:07:23.270> that

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:23.480 
pattern so you know then you play that

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.879 
pattern so you know then you play that
cool<00:07:23.660> pattern<00:07:23.960> twice<00:07:24.139> and<00:07:24.410> then<00:07:24.500> straightens

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:24.889 
cool pattern twice and then straightens

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:26.620 
cool pattern twice and then straightens
the<00:07:24.950> second<00:07:25.280> verse<00:07:25.400> which<00:07:25.760> is<00:07:26.090> exactly<00:07:26.510> the

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:26.630 
the second verse which is exactly the

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:32.379 
the second verse which is exactly the
same<00:07:28.120> my<00:07:29.120> god<00:07:29.450> my<00:07:29.600> throat's<00:07:29.870> like<00:07:30.050> dry<00:07:31.389> anyway

but<00:07:33.729> then<00:07:34.729> the<00:07:34.820> cool<00:07:35.000> part<00:07:35.180> is<00:07:35.300> basically

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:35.750 
but then the cool part is basically

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.620 
but then the cool part is basically
exactly<00:07:36.080> the<00:07:36.350> same<00:07:36.470> all<00:07:36.919> the<00:07:36.979> way<00:07:37.130> through

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:37.630 
exactly the same all the way through

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.879 
exactly the same all the way through
apart<00:07:38.630> from<00:07:38.720> the<00:07:38.840> solo<00:07:39.169> where<00:07:39.410> it<00:07:39.470> goes<00:07:39.590> into

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:39.889 
apart from the solo where it goes into

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:43.030 
apart from the solo where it goes into
like<00:07:40.010> EB<00:07:40.700> flat<00:07:40.940> and<00:07:41.090> a<00:07:41.500> I'm<00:07:42.500> not<00:07:42.560> gonna<00:07:42.889> take

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.040 
like EB flat and a I'm not gonna take

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.860 
like EB flat and a I'm not gonna take
chance<00:07:43.250> play<00:07:43.370> that<00:07:43.550> because<00:07:43.940> I<00:07:44.240> don't<00:07:44.810> know

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:44.870 
chance play that because I don't know

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.360 
chance play that because I don't know
how<00:07:44.960> to<00:07:45.020> play<00:07:45.169> that<00:07:45.200> bit<00:07:45.470> and<00:07:45.620> see<00:07:46.040> honest<00:07:46.220> is

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:46.370 
how to play that bit and see honest is

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.700 
how to play that bit and see honest is
not<00:07:46.400> really<00:07:46.910> necessary<00:07:47.389> unless<00:07:47.750> you<00:07:48.530> know<00:07:48.650> you

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:48.710 
not really necessary unless you know you

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.409 
not really necessary unless you know you
