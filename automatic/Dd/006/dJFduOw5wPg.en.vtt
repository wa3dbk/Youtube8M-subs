00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.269
 so this is our bird 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:14.160
 show sink marks on it we have identified the place 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:19.350
 Cases should be done to make the bottom of the sink marks 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.769
 texture this here wing tail here I 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.689
 I do not know whether 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:30.689
 max wing makes it usually past 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.600
 good seam out trying 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.600
 symmetrically pierce 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:50.579
 I am then three times the usual basting stitch 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:53.610
 forward needle back and forth account 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.820
 pull up pull up so hard 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.559
 how much do you need to drown the fabric 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.559
 volume happened 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.559
 are needed 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.490
 this way you can make anything 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.460
 we sew back 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:44.350
 here we have already seen only a baby 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:48.689
 no, i cut it off and so here inside 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:59.110
 pushing so this minute people always 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:02:07.289
 I go out further, I just as small 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:07.289
 stitches do the texture of the wing 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.490
 you can do it on a sewing machine 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.710
 care drag machine here 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.650
 just pull up 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.650
 we hold 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.690
 need to go through all the blocks 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:03:05.300
 further back thrust here side by side 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:05.300
 go out together following basting 5 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.930
 everything is so ugly 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:05.790
 Well, so doing, I feel it can 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.969
 handle even baby appliances very 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.969
 simple 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:29.790
 all the bumps and beautiful seams bent 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:32.850
 close now show now do this 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:38.930
 utya this is the usual seam over the edge 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:41.120
 just write well, not the cord is not here 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.100
 cotton yarn for knitting 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:51.630
 ribbon here is this principle 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.800
 done here in this way means you 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.250
 stick in 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.530
 needle capture deep September heat 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.080
 in place here you go out at this point 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.570
 make a seam back in here and 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.600
 again capturing dcom padding 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:13.520
 deeper and go out at this point and so 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:17.120
 way will do the delay this minutes 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:25.520
 you need to apply a drawing 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:28.520
 Zhlobin where pull so here for example 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.520
 poke 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:47.330
 and here we are side by side 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:47.330
 pulling up 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:08.530
 who likes to sit sew 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:18.199
 ear of patience maybe a great job 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:22.460
 do need to sew lace need 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:24.560
 colored thread relief and sew though 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:30.729
 plastic food rings now 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.729
 bring all that to you speaker 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:44.170
 that's the way cups are made here 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:50.950
 did utyazki I here sewed lace 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:54.670
 booster saw somehow in the spring well all 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:58.150
 in general, it can now be primed 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:00.360
 I will probably turn her on one layer 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:04.030
 I will continue with acrylic paints 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.510
 paint it I'll show you the process 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.510
 work
