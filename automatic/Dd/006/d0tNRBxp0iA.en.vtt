 the advancement of medicine that allows 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.320
 regression of a degenerative disease of the 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.480
 CNS evil of parkinson 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.430
 the immense gain in quality of life is 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.920
 possible thanks to a surgery called 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.390
 pacemaker 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.070
 this year for the second time 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.990
 neurologists were able to do the 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.650
 surgical procedure here in the field 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.779
 great 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.910
 our team followed step by step to 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.250
 operation of a patient with the disease 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.680
 we followed the six hours that separated 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.320
 your dílson of a new life 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.860
 it was exciting let's see movements 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.860
 involuntary 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:55.480
 stiff muscles make difficult steps 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.480
 it is almost impossible to walk 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.570
 for eight years living with the evil of 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.520
 parkinson your dilson pilotava planes 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.380
 and it was precisely with the profession that 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.940
 discovered the disease 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.860
 who does the health inspection 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:19.780
 required 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:24.550
 the pilot then you go through 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.950
 Vehicle psychiatrist at the time 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.200
 in a private hospital 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.960
 Your country is waiting for you. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.479
 surgery that can change his life is the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.500
 eighth -south-mato-grossense through the 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.080
 procedure 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.080
 the second operated here in the capital 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.190
 parkinson's disease is an illness 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.740
 degenerative disease that causes the death 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.979
 neurons is characterized by tremors 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.259
 rigidity and slow movements to 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.810
 brain stimulation called surgery 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.569
 involves the implantation of a 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.930
 mark step on the chest of the patient on 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:04.299
 to the brain an electrode the device emits 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.619
 electrical impulses that regulate the 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.450
 functions hampered by the disease 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.380
 ademir discovered that he was the carrier of evil 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.680
 Parkinson's disease at age 33 began with 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.650
 the login finger started tremendously 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.120
 slowly I did not want to believe that 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.360
 was not part of it 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.690
 but with the trip to São Paulo we went to do 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.440
 an ultrasound resonance right 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.380
 was found to be part of the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.370
 disease progressed rapidly to dener 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.450
 take 28 tablets daily for 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.480
 to mitigate the effects 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.570
 in 2008 he did the surgery in curitiba 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.280
 the movements returned and today the 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.690
 businessman takes a life practically 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.040
 normal I use normal work makes a 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.440
 dance

 pass on the manes of hair is soccer 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.989
 I'm playing soccer, I was adenir. 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.989
 an airplane workshop that encouraged the 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.910
 Pilot friend making surgery team 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.790
 doctor authorized our team to 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.010
 follow your dilson's surgery 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.959
 Everything is already prepared for 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.130
 this procedure how do you 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.430
 this is how you are doing 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.900
 feeling before youtube operation and 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.290
 the expectation that has become 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.370
 alive 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.739
 before the last evaluation with the doctor 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.470
 operation is about to begin. 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.060
 patient is already in the operating room we 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.380
 we need to talk a little more 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.410
 because of this 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.530
 proximity and will cameraman lourival 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.940
 stolen we are totally 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.330
 as well as the entire team of 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.209
 medical nurses who are working 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.120
 in this surgery before the patient passed 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.620
 by two tomographies precisely so that 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.380
 the doctors could do a scan 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.410
 and see if exactly the point to 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.380
 insertion of the anesthesia electrode is 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.320
 place your dilson becomes aware the time 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.049
 a neuro surgeon and a 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.930
 neurologist make the incision where 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.600
 the electrode will be implanted the first 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.060
 results are observed as soon as the 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.870
 device is placed in the brain of the 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.450
 patient 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.780
 better I do not understand, you like it there 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.500
 have the order sent to surgery 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.090
 has now reached a crucial moment 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.669
 very important that it is precisely the 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.419
 when it will be connected all that 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:38.419
 will produce the electrical stimuli that 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.840
 will make to cease to end with the fears 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:44.460
 caused by the parkinson's body reacts to 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.490
 every impulse 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.590
 there is no such thing in a few minutes 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.350
 movements are made with more 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.180
 facility 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.639
 so Dr. Renato has now been found 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.270
 in with transato to be made this 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.770
 stimulation is the exact point was 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.069
 located through stimuli that are 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.349
 performed at the time of surgery is in 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.080
 moment the potenza you found 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:14.180
 tremor and the rigidity of the 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.860
 patient disappear immediately 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.259
 so we already see that the right side 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.870
 for example it much calmer tatá 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.430
 calm and can keep you stopped is 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.759
 can see the right side of 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.860
 present if it is with a quiet posture 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:32.039
 while the left side is still 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.020
 pathologically maintains the patient because 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.979
 presenting the persistent fears of 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.810
 his illness 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.750
 the time we finally did 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.979
 intervention on the other side there fully 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.740
 he is controlled 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.699
 right for us that we witnessed that we saw 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.099
 huh 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.949
 the patient before surgery with all 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:52.740
 those fears could not even walk 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:55.680
 really sees it already on the 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.900
 Surgery is incredible is the miracle that the 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.509
 science can do 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.030
 it was six hours of surgery now 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:06.060
 the period of adaptation and 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.070
 evaluation of the results soon your 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.669
 day will only know if you can perform your 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.720
 greatest wish revealed just moments before 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:18.040
 of operation luxury vuitton 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.040
 who to vote for beer 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.779
 [Music] 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.940
 now your afternoon is not going to make the 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.950
 first movements with a device 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.700
 that was placed during the 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.800
 surgery 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.620
 according to the renato physician neurologist 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.500
 Ferraz tonight he'll be able to go 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.540
 although good home recovery for the 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.140
 his dilson and that he realizes the desire 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.140
 back to fly
