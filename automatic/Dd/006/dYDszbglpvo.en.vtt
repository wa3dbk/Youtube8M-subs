00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
when I see that the dough starts to go

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.590 
when I see that the dough starts to go
around<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.710> blade<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.180> have

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
around the blade then I know that I have

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.520 
around the blade then I know that I have
enough<00:01:06.990> water<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.450> you're<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.780> sure<00:01:10.229> on

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
enough water and if you're not sure on

enough water and if you're not sure on
how<00:01:10.560> much<00:01:11.040> water<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.640> add<00:01:12.290> then<00:01:13.290> stop<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
how much water to add then stop the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.090 
how much water to add then stop the
machine<00:01:14.670> every<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:15.750> take<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.860> top

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
machine every now and then take the top

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.260 
machine every now and then take the top
off<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.729> feel<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.580> if<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.729> holds<00:01:20.909> together

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
off and feel it and if it holds together

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.929 
off and feel it and if it holds together
you<00:01:22.080> know<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.590> that's<00:01:22.770> enough<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.790> out<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
you know that that's enough so get out a

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.620 
you know that that's enough so get out a
piece<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.420> plastic<00:01:24.930> wrap<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:29.270> put<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> dough

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
piece of plastic wrap and put the dough

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.440 
piece of plastic wrap and put the dough
in<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.079> refrigerator<00:01:31.939> kind<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.299> into

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
in the refrigerator kind of get it into

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.399 
in the refrigerator kind of get it into
a<00:01:33.600> disk<00:01:34.020> shape<00:01:35.810> like<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:39.049> put<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
a disk shape like that put it on the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.600 
a disk shape like that put it on the
paper<00:01:41.720> wrap<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.899> well

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
paper wrap it well

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.630 
paper wrap it well
and<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:45.750> refrigerator<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.590> goes<00:01:46.860> for

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
and in the refrigerator it goes for

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.190 
and in the refrigerator it goes for
about<00:01:48.560> an<00:01:49.560> hour<00:01:50.040> or<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.210> when<00:01:52.050> it's

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
about an hour or so and when it's

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:01.010 
about an hour or so and when it's
chilled<00:01:58.370> it'll<00:01:59.370> look<00:01:59.550> like<00:01:59.760> that<00:02:00.060> now<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:00.750> have

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
chilled it'll look like that now we have

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.590 
chilled it'll look like that now we have
to<00:02:01.170> roll<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.710> dough<00:02:01.950> out<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:03.420> there's

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
to roll the dough out and there's

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.670 
to roll the dough out and there's
several<00:02:03.840> ways<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.470> do<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.980> you<00:02:06.110> can<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.470> on

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
several ways to do that you can do it on

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.950 
several ways to do that you can do it on
a<00:02:08.040> floured<00:02:08.820> board<00:02:09.710> and<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:12.180> best<00:02:12.420> thing<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.690> do

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
a floured board and the best thing to do

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.250 
a floured board and the best thing to do
is<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.380> tap<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:14.040> go<00:02:14.220> down<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.550> little<00:02:14.940> bit

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
is just tap the go down a little bit

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.050 
is just tap the go down a little bit
kind<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.380> just<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.680> distribute<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.520> thickness

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
kind of just to distribute the thickness

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.790 
kind of just to distribute the thickness
of<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.690> then<00:02:19.590> begin<00:02:20.400> rolling<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.800> that's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
of it and then begin rolling it that's

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.130 
of it and then begin rolling it that's
one<00:02:23.100> way<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.310> do<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.610> what<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.450> don't<00:02:24.780> want<00:02:25.050> to

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
one way to do it what you don't want to

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.040 
one way to do it what you don't want to
do<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.590> add<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.250> lot<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.790> flour<00:02:27.090> because<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
do is add a lot of flour because the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.250 
do is add a lot of flour because the
more<00:02:28.260> flour<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.920> add<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:30.510> tougher<00:02:31.080> that

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
more flour you add the tougher that

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.250 
more flour you add the tougher that
dough<00:02:31.530> will<00:02:31.980> be<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:33.180> either<00:02:33.390> do<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:33.959> this

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
dough will be so either do it like this

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.680 
dough will be so either do it like this
on<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:35.160> board<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.790> has<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:36.060> little<00:02:36.450> bit<00:02:36.570> of

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
on a board that has a little bit of

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.530 
on a board that has a little bit of
flour<00:02:37.220> or<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:39.000> other<00:02:39.209> way<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.540> do<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.330> do

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
flour or the other way to do it is to do

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.180 
flour or the other way to do it is to do
it<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> sheet<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.560> parchment<00:02:43.980> paper<00:02:46.190> because

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
it on a sheet of parchment paper because

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.070 
it on a sheet of parchment paper because
then<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.550> really<00:02:47.910> can<00:02:48.150> control<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.810> flour

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
then you really can control the flour

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.280 
then you really can control the flour
and<00:02:49.920> if<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.910> put<00:02:51.090> another<00:02:51.330> sheet<00:02:51.720> over<00:02:52.140> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
and if you put another sheet over the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.610 
and if you put another sheet over the
top<00:02:52.850> then<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.180> roll<00:02:54.420> over<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.959> parchment

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
top then you can roll over the parchment

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.690 
top then you can roll over the parchment
and<00:02:55.860> try<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.640> roll<00:02:56.940> from<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.780> center<00:02:58.320> out<00:02:59.190> to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
and try to roll from the center out to

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.910 
and try to roll from the center out to
the<00:02:59.820> edges<00:03:00.030> instead<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:00.750> rolling<00:03:00.989> across<00:03:01.290> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
the edges instead of rolling across the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.560 
the edges instead of rolling across the
dough<00:03:02.100> like<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.670> because<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.360> will<00:03:03.510> just

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
dough like that because that will just

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.380 
dough like that because that will just
toughen<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.230> dough<00:03:04.410> as<00:03:04.620> well<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:06.090> once<00:03:06.239> you

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
toughen the dough as well so once you

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.750 
toughen the dough as well so once you
get<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.720> out<00:03:06.930> into<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.650> diameter<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.430> you

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
get it out into the diameter that you

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.759 
get it out into the diameter that you
want<00:03:11.090> then<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.120> want<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.540> take<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.019> top<00:03:13.260> paper

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
want then you want to take the top paper

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.880 
want then you want to take the top paper
off

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.620 

leave<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.130> bottom<00:03:19.520> paper<00:03:19.790> on<00:03:20.120> because<00:03:20.480> now

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
leave the bottom paper on because now

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:28.830 
leave the bottom paper on because now
you're<00:03:20.810> going<00:03:20.990> to<00:03:21.080> bake<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.320> on<00:03:21.710> a<00:03:24.730> baked<00:03:25.730> sheet

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.720 

so<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.900> put<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.350> right<00:03:30.590> on<00:03:30.890> your<00:03:30.920> rimless

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
so you put it right on your rimless

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.090 
so you put it right on your rimless
baked<00:03:32.030> sheet<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:33.370> here's<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:34.580> wonderful

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
baked sheet and here's that wonderful

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.950 
baked sheet and here's that wonderful
almond<00:03:37.100> paste

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
almond paste

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.940 
almond paste
already<00:03:38.960> prepared<00:03:39.970> see<00:03:40.970> it<00:03:41.090> looks<00:03:41.300> like<00:03:41.540> that

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
already prepared see it looks like that

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.070 
already prepared see it looks like that
and<00:03:43.120> remember<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.150> told<00:03:44.300> you<00:03:44.660> that<00:03:44.780> this<00:03:44.900> is

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
and remember I told you that this is

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.360 
and remember I told you that this is
just<00:03:45.260> almonds<00:03:45.890> and<00:03:46.250> sugar<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:47.800> think<00:03:48.800> it's<00:03:49.160> nice

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
just almonds and sugar I think it's nice

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.970 
just almonds and sugar I think it's nice
to<00:03:49.610> roll<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:50.450> almond<00:03:50.780> paste<00:03:50.930> out<00:03:51.230> to<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.680> size

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
to roll the almond paste out to the size

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.490 
to roll the almond paste out to the size
of<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:53.510> dough<00:03:54.940> it's<00:03:55.940> very<00:03:56.330> pliable<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:57.230> if<00:03:57.350> it

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
of the dough it's very pliable so if it

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.470 
of the dough it's very pliable so if it
breaks<00:03:57.710> you<00:03:57.980> can<00:03:58.160> just<00:03:58.370> patch<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:58.730> very<00:03:59.210> easily

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
breaks you can just patch it very easily

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.730 
breaks you can just patch it very easily
so<00:04:00.380> roll<00:04:01.010> it<00:04:01.160> out<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.790> then<00:04:04.660> carefully<00:04:05.740> lift

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
so roll it out and then carefully lift

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.380 
so roll it out and then carefully lift
it<00:04:06.890> up<00:04:07.070> and<00:04:07.220> if<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.430> breaks<00:04:07.580> that's<00:04:07.910> okay

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
it up and if it breaks that's okay

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.000 
it up and if it breaks that's okay
because<00:04:08.630> it's<00:04:08.960> all<00:04:09.200> going<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.620> cook<00:04:09.800> together

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
because it's all going to cook together

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.900 
because it's all going to cook together
and<00:04:10.460> here's<00:04:11.360> a<00:04:11.450> trick<00:04:11.870> if<00:04:12.080> it<00:04:12.200> does<00:04:12.440> stick<00:04:12.920> to

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
and here's a trick if it does stick to

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.220 
and here's a trick if it does stick to
your<00:04:14.060> counter<00:04:15.640> once<00:04:16.640> you<00:04:16.820> get<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.150> over<00:04:17.870> the

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
your counter once you get it over the

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:25.180 
your counter once you get it over the
dough<00:04:21.520> you<00:04:22.520> can<00:04:22.700> just<00:04:23.030> roll<00:04:23.390> over<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:24.190> very

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
dough you can just roll over that very

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.550 
dough you can just roll over that very
gently<00:04:25.790> and<00:04:26.090> that's<00:04:26.690> why<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:26.960> want<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.350> use<00:04:27.380> a

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
gently and that's why you want to use a

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.940 
gently and that's why you want to use a
rimless<00:04:29.290> cookie<00:04:30.290> sheet

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
rimless cookie sheet

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:37.120 
rimless cookie sheet
now<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.050> apricot<00:04:33.050> part<00:04:33.880> here<00:04:34.880> we<00:04:35.030> have<00:04:36.130> dried

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
now the apricot part here we have dried

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.380 
now the apricot part here we have dried
apricots<00:04:38.410> and<00:04:39.410> I'm<00:04:39.860> just<00:04:40.100> going<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.580> overlap

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
apricots and I'm just going to overlap

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.980 
apricots and I'm just going to overlap
them<00:04:41.780> all<00:04:42.230> I<00:04:42.710> did<00:04:43.070> with<00:04:43.220> these<00:04:43.490> was<00:04:43.790> by<00:04:44.000> either

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
them all I did with these was by either

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.330 
them all I did with these was by either
Turkish<00:04:45.560> or<00:04:45.800> California<00:04:46.760> dried<00:04:47.090> apricots<00:04:47.840> and

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
Turkish or California dried apricots and

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.770 
Turkish or California dried apricots and
poach<00:04:49.340> them<00:04:49.700> just<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.120> get<00:04:50.300> them<00:04:50.480> a<00:04:50.510> little<00:04:50.630> bit

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
poach them just to get them a little bit

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.100 
poach them just to get them a little bit
more<00:04:50.900> pliable<00:04:51.350> because<00:04:51.920> they<00:04:52.040> are<00:04:52.160> very<00:04:52.430> dry

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
more pliable because they are very dry

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.140 
more pliable because they are very dry
when<00:04:54.110> you<00:04:54.260> buy<00:04:54.470> them<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.040> you<00:04:55.610> can<00:04:55.760> just<00:04:55.790> poach

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
when you buy them and you can just poach

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.120 
when you buy them and you can just poach
them<00:04:56.390> in<00:04:56.510> a<00:04:56.570> little<00:04:56.810> water<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.410> then<00:04:57.470> just

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
them in a little water and then just

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.870 
them in a little water and then just
cover<00:04:58.850> the<00:04:59.480> tart<00:04:59.840> the<00:05:00.050> marzipan<00:05:00.320> part<00:05:00.920> with

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
cover the tart the marzipan part with

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.060 
cover the tart the marzipan part with
the<00:05:02.540> apricots<00:05:03.760> going<00:05:04.760> all<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.240> way<00:05:05.270> around<00:05:06.070> if

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
the apricots going all the way around if

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.500 
the apricots going all the way around if
you<00:05:07.190> want<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.460> take<00:05:07.640> your<00:05:07.760> time<00:05:08.090> to<00:05:08.330> make<00:05:08.360> a

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
you want to take your time to make a

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.550 
you want to take your time to make a
really<00:05:08.960> nice<00:05:09.170> design<00:05:10.510> you<00:05:11.510> can<00:05:11.900> but<00:05:12.290> this<00:05:12.410> is

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
really nice design you can but this is

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.790 
really nice design you can but this is
all<00:05:12.740> going<00:05:12.920> to<00:05:13.010> get<00:05:13.130> covered<00:05:13.670> up<00:05:13.880> with<00:05:14.800> some

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
all going to get covered up with some

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.600 
all going to get covered up with some
egg<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:16.430> sugar<00:05:17.830> okay<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:18.860> think<00:05:18.980> you<00:05:19.280> get<00:05:19.460> the

you put that milk mixture on is to bring
these<00:05:26.540> edges

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
these edges

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.230 
these edges
somewhat<00:05:28.020> because<00:05:28.229> you<00:05:28.680> have<00:05:29.129> to<00:05:29.310> hold<00:05:29.610> in<00:05:30.060> the

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
juices so lift up the edges as you go

you may have to lower your temperature
to<00:07:00.770> 350<00:07:01.770> degrees<00:07:02.719> look<00:07:03.719> how<00:07:03.839> pretty<00:07:04.020> that<00:07:04.139> is

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 
to 350 degrees look how pretty that is

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.179 
to 350 degrees look how pretty that is
alright<00:07:05.639> that's<00:07:05.879> ready<00:07:06.240> to<00:07:06.419> go<00:07:06.830> in<00:07:07.830> the<00:07:08.009> bottom

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:08.189 
alright that's ready to go in the bottom

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:15.260 
alright that's ready to go in the bottom
oven<00:07:09.139> and<00:07:10.610> I'm<00:07:11.610> baking<00:07:11.939> it<00:07:12.360> a<00:07:13.699> preheated<00:07:14.699> stone

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
oven and I'm baking it a preheated stone

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.320 
oven and I'm baking it a preheated stone
but<00:07:16.139> you<00:07:16.169> don't<00:07:16.409> have<00:07:16.620> to<00:07:16.860> do<00:07:17.039> that<00:07:17.219> I<00:07:17.460> like<00:07:18.210> to

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
but you don't have to do that I like to

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.579 
but you don't have to do that I like to
bake<00:07:18.449> it<00:07:18.599> on<00:07:18.719> the<00:07:18.810> stone<00:07:19.020> because<00:07:19.289> I<00:07:19.409> always

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:19.589 
bake it on the stone because I always

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:21.619 
bake it on the stone because I always
keep<00:07:19.860> my<00:07:20.069> stone<00:07:20.370> in<00:07:20.550> the<00:07:20.639> oven<00:07:20.939> because<00:07:21.389> I'm

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:21.629 
keep my stone in the oven because I'm

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:23.329 
keep my stone in the oven because I'm
making<00:07:21.960> pizza<00:07:22.139> and<00:07:22.469> bread<00:07:22.680> so<00:07:22.889> I<00:07:22.919> just<00:07:23.189> leave

00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:23.339 
making pizza and bread so I just leave

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:23.809 
making pizza and bread so I just leave
it<00:07:23.490> there

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:23.819 
it there

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:26.689 
it there
so<00:07:24.449> 375<00:07:25.439> degrees<00:07:25.889> it's<00:07:26.099> probably<00:07:26.460> going<00:07:26.610> to

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:26.699 
so 375 degrees it's probably going to

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:29.600 
so 375 degrees it's probably going to
take<00:07:26.939> you<00:07:27.240> oh<00:07:27.270> about<00:07:27.839> 25<00:07:28.529> to<00:07:28.830> 30<00:07:29.099> minutes<00:07:29.189> and

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
take you oh about 25 to 30 minutes and

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.980 
take you oh about 25 to 30 minutes and
then<00:07:29.699> you<00:07:29.789> really<00:07:30.150> want<00:07:30.270> to<00:07:30.449> let<00:07:30.689> that<00:07:30.719> cool

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
then you really want to let that cool

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.770 
then you really want to let that cool
down
