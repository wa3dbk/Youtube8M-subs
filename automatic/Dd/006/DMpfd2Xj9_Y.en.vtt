00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
these and not many different ways but

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.690 
these and not many different ways but
these<00:02:30.269> were<00:02:30.480> actually<00:02:31.110> pretty<00:02:31.319> cheap<00:02:31.860> um<00:02:32.100> they

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
these were actually pretty cheap um they

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.740 
these were actually pretty cheap um they
started<00:02:33.150> out<00:02:33.390> at<00:02:33.950> $44<00:02:34.950> which<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.819> too<00:02:36.360> much<00:02:36.510> for

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
started out at $44 which is too much for

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.890 
started out at $44 which is too much for
me<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:36.930> they<00:02:37.260> were<00:02:37.319> forty<00:02:37.680> percent<00:02:38.010> off<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.900> um

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
me but they were forty percent off so um

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.759 
me but they were forty percent off so um
they<00:02:40.319> ended<00:02:40.590> up<00:02:40.709> being<00:02:40.980> like<00:02:42.500> what<00:02:43.500> does<00:02:43.620> that

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.150 
say like I were six usually but this fix
is<00:04:27.300> kind<00:04:27.600> of<00:04:27.690> tight<00:04:27.900> on<00:04:28.140> me<00:04:28.350> so<00:04:28.560> last<00:04:28.830> year<00:04:29.040> I

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
is kind of tight on me so last year I

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.270 
is kind of tight on me so last year I
got<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.520> seven<00:04:30.060> well<00:04:30.750> they<00:04:31.260> stretch<00:04:31.620> out<00:04:31.890> a<00:04:31.920> lot

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
got a seven well they stretch out a lot

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.220 
got a seven well they stretch out a lot
so<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.730> seven<00:04:33.120> ended<00:04:33.390> up<00:04:33.540> being<00:04:33.840> like<00:04:34.020> an

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
so the seven ended up being like an

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.630 
so the seven ended up being like an
eight<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.740> now<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:34.830> can't<00:04:35.160> even<00:04:35.220> more<00:04:35.460> how<00:04:35.550> many

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
eight and now I can't even more how many

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.330 
eight and now I can't even more how many
marks<00:04:36.030> are<00:04:36.210> just<00:04:36.360> too<00:04:36.540> big<00:04:36.780> so<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:37.830> would<00:04:38.100> go

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
marks are just too big so I would go

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.220 
marks are just too big so I would go
with<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.700> smaller<00:04:38.880> size<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:39.810> wait<00:04:39.930> for<00:04:40.140> them

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
with the smaller size and wait for them

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.650 
with the smaller size and wait for them
to<00:04:40.290> stretch<00:04:40.740> out<00:04:41.010> that<00:04:41.730> way<00:04:41.910> you<00:04:41.970> can<00:04:42.330> get<00:04:42.450> more

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
to stretch out that way you can get more

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.380 
to stretch out that way you can get more
