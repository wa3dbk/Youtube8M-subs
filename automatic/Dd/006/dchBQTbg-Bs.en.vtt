00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:28.292
 Hi guys, I'm Loz and I'm a project manager at Nash. 

00:00:28.292 --> 00:00:33.626
 This gives me really great opportunities and insights into the development of new technologies, as well as the knowledge about placing new products on the market. 

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:37.209
 Today I have some completely new and very interesting stuff with myself. 

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:39.792
 Let me run through a number of new products and show you what's new. 

00:00:40.417 --> 00:00:42.626
 Materials for systems. 

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:44.542
 First of all, we have the incentives. 

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:47.042
 Now we have some brand new material for you. 

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.292
 For the start I will show you Combilink. 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.751
 Combilink is a classic woven material with removable wrapping. 

00:00:52.751 --> 00:01:00.501
 He is half-hearted, and just as the name suggests gives you the capability for a large number of different combinations of the system that will allow you to 

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:03.125
 that your bait behaves exactly the way you want it. 

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:09.501
 The first system I'm going to show you is my standard depth system. 

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:15.792
 I flipped the blowback rig system with the Fang Twister hook and added a little silicone tube to boost the hooking. 

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:22.501
 After that, I just peeled off a few inches of the Combilini wrapper under the wrist. 

00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:27.792
 With this I got the system that I hunt, and the memory of the material helps to hook the fish into the mouth. 

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:34.501
 However, I still have nice smooth movements of the bait on the hook when it comes down to the bottom so that the fish can suck the bait and get stuck. 

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:37.751
 The next system I have is another blowback rig system. 

00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:45.501
 What I have done now is that I peeled the wrapper with Combilinka not only at the wrists but also at the groove. 

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:52.667
 By removing wrappings in the garden, we still have a strong self-sucking effect due to the memory of the material 

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:54.459
 which is located at the bottom of the lake. 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.375
 However, in this way, the bait has much more power to run. 

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:05.292
 For my third system of this type (blowback rig), I remove only a small part of the wraparound with Combilinka in the middle. 

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:10.999
 In this way, we get a really nice effect of stinging fish, even when there are leaves and garbage at the bottom of the lake. 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.209
 This is better than rigid systems, which only drops down on it. 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.918
 This system is good for hunting, but it is also beautifully nestled at the bottom of the lake and follows its contours. 

00:02:23.083 --> 00:02:30.125
 So how do you see, Combilink is very versatile and gives you a great number of options in the presentation of your bait and hook at the bottom. 

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:35.667
 It comes in three different colors: green like grass, pebble / clay and sludge. 

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:41.792
 It has different capacities, from 15lb, 20lb, 25lb and 35lb. 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.292
 Next is Armourlink. 

00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:49.125
 This is a very interesting material, and something that makes everyone in Nash very excited. 

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:54.959
 This is not a wrapping material in the classical sense, and there is no possibility of downloading just like Combilika. 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.375
 But she has a waxed wrap shelf. 

00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:02.334
 This is why fishermen can use Armourlink in a number of different ways. 

00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:07.918
 You can use it directly with the spool while retaining its wax coat, but also the semi rigid, and semi soft features of the material. 

00:03:07.918 --> 00:03:13.417
 You can work with him by sliding it between your nail on his fingers and he will become a super soft sponge for beggars. 

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:23.125
 Armourlink is very wear-resistant, quick-tones, even three times faster than fluorocarbon, and while you know that fish you know it is at the bottom of the lake. 

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:31.042
 Armourlink is a super-soft, wear-resistant material with multiple uses. It has three different colors, four different loads and is resistant to wear. 

00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:36.417
 The color of grass, sludge, and gravel, and the strength of 15lb, 20lb, 25lb and 35lb. 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.209
 Cling On 

00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:46.667
 All the fishermen know how important it is to your end accessories at the bottom. 

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:56.751
 That's why we would like to give you a sub-series of products called Cling-On that are designed to flood all your bottom systems. 

00:03:57.042 --> 00:03:59.709
 The first is the Cling-On mass for aggravation. 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.918
 It has been on the market for some time, so some of you have certainly seen how easy it is to work, how difficult it is to come in a cool box. 

00:04:06.918 --> 00:04:11.209
 It comes in three different colors to better cover all the fishing situations you can find. 

00:04:12.626 --> 00:04:14.292
 The next is Cling-On leader. 

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:22.459
 It is a lead-free lead-free material that is super-hard and very soft and well follows the contours of the bottom of the lake. 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:35.083
 It comes in three different colors: grass, pebble and sludge. Its load capacity is 40 lb and it is not easy to pull it. 

00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:48.501
 Next we have Cling-On tungsten tube. 

00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:52.542
 This is an excellent material for all water situations that have a ban on the lead, and when we need a rig tube for our fishermen. 

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:56.626
 He is especially hard and is beautifully lying on the bottom of the lake. 

00:04:58.334 --> 00:05:00.667
 Next we have tungsten clingers. 

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:06.834
 These are pearls impregnated with tungsten, which are placed on nylon or on the material for underwear, and have very wide use. 

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:12.167
 You can use them to counterbalance your floating bait with him. 

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:18.083
 You can put them on your main nylon to help them sink. Big Clingers are fishing age with chod systems. 

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:23.876
 Just like any other tungsten clingers are available in three different sizes in the Camo version. 

00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:26.667
 And finally we have Cling-On fluid. 

00:05:26.667 --> 00:05:29.083
 We have discussed it very well with it. 

00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:34.667
 It is full of tungsten and can be painted by your leader or promotional material. 

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.876
 All to maximally flood their equipment and deceive the fish. 

00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:46.334
 Now you've seen some of the latest great accessories for the Nasha terminal kit (TT range). 

00:05:46.334 --> 00:05:49.209
 They are in the shops now so go and check them out
