00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.150 
with the melodies to kind of hear how it
sounds<00:02:46.850> with<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.480> with<00:02:47.750> other<00:02:48.140> parts<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:48.980> this

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
sounds with it with other parts so this

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.030 
sounds with it with other parts so this
is<00:02:49.370> what<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:50.000> sounds<00:02:50.390> like<00:02:50.450> with<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.170> bass<00:02:51.380> so

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
is what it sounds like with the bass so

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.610 
is what it sounds like with the bass so
here<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.310> is

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
here it is

00:02:53.620 --> 00:04:21.590 
here it is
start<00:02:54.430> here<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.849> sounds<00:02:55.030> like<00:02:55.120> this

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.629 

so<00:04:22.600> that's<00:04:22.870> what<00:04:23.050> it<00:04:23.139> sounds<00:04:23.530> like<00:04:24.009> with<00:04:24.430> the

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
so that's what it sounds like with the

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.980 
so that's what it sounds like with the
base<00:04:24.850> so<00:04:25.120> they<00:04:25.210> kind<00:04:25.419> of<00:04:25.449> get<00:04:25.539> a<00:04:25.600> better<00:04:25.720> feel

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
base so they kind of get a better feel

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.260 
base so they kind of get a better feel
for<00:04:26.020> how<00:04:26.199> it<00:04:26.410> works<00:04:26.440> now<00:04:27.370> I'm<00:04:27.699> going<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.090> show

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
for how it works now I'm going to show

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.290 
for how it works now I'm going to show
you<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.740> baseline<00:04:30.669> we've<00:04:30.880> kind<00:04:31.120> of<00:04:31.150> moved

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
you the the baseline we've kind of moved

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.909 
you the the baseline we've kind of moved
the<00:04:31.449> camera<00:04:31.660> here<00:04:31.900> so<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:32.110> can<00:04:32.289> see<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.710> base

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
the camera here so you can see the base

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.290 
the camera here so you can see the base
all<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.280> way<00:04:33.490> through<00:04:33.699> us<00:04:33.910> to<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.090> end

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
all the way through us to the end

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.689 
all the way through us to the end
because<00:04:35.289> I<00:04:35.500> know<00:04:35.560> that<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:36.069> can't<00:04:36.430> show<00:04:36.580> the

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
because I know that I can't show the

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.100 
because I know that I can't show the
whole<00:04:36.880> entire<00:04:37.509> view<00:04:38.020> of<00:04:38.199> it<00:04:38.400> so<00:04:39.400> here<00:04:40.300> is<00:04:40.509> the

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
whole entire view of it so here is the

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.749 
whole entire view of it so here is the
baseline<00:04:41.560> okay<00:04:42.009> I'm<00:04:42.160> gonna<00:04:42.250> try<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.490> move<00:04:42.580> out

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
baseline okay I'm gonna try to move out

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.260 
baseline okay I'm gonna try to move out
of<00:04:42.789> the<00:04:42.880> way<00:04:42.910> as<00:04:43.090> much<00:04:43.150> as<00:04:43.270> possible<00:04:43.630> so<00:04:45.270> so

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
of the way as much as possible so so

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.939 
of the way as much as possible so so
here's<00:04:46.509> the<00:04:46.660> baseline<00:04:47.080> so<00:04:47.650> what<00:04:47.740> you're<00:04:47.860> gonna

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
here's the baseline so what you're gonna

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.860 
here's the baseline so what you're gonna
do<00:04:48.220> there's<00:04:48.669> gonna<00:04:49.889> see<00:04:51.000> down<00:04:52.000> hands<00:04:52.270> your<00:04:52.660> low

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
do there's gonna see down hands your low

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.499 
do there's gonna see down hands your low
seat<00:04:53.139> right<00:04:53.349> here<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.889> oh<00:04:53.979> I<00:04:54.009> can<00:04:54.360> go<00:04:55.360> like

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
seat right here and oh I can go like

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.460 
seat right here and oh I can go like
this<00:04:55.690> it<00:04:55.960> goes

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:10.420 

again<00:04:59.160> soon

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.200 

three<00:05:11.430> goes<00:05:11.759> on<00:05:11.939> a<00:05:12.240> bang<00:05:12.960> two<00:05:13.830> three<00:05:14.699> goes<00:05:14.999> down

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
three goes on a bang two three goes down

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.670 
three goes on a bang two three goes down
F<00:05:15.509> yeah

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
F yeah

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.110 
F yeah
it<00:05:18.040> was<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:19.199> gj2<00:05:20.199> three<00:05:21.070> goes<00:05:21.310> to<00:05:21.460> c<00:05:22.500> c23<00:05:24.120> was

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
it was the gj2 three goes to c c23 was

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.060 
it was the gj2 three goes to c c23 was
on<00:05:25.330> a<00:05:25.570> man<00:05:27.030> whose<00:05:28.030> death

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.870 

four<00:05:31.760> things<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.330> gene

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
four things the gene

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:41.850 
four things the gene
three<00:05:34.180> goes<00:05:34.360> day<00:05:38.580> two<00:05:39.580> three<00:05:40.420> photos<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:41.590> a

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
three goes day two three photos the a

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.520 
three goes day two three photos the a
two

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:56.830 

two<00:05:46.530> three<00:05:47.400> I<00:05:47.430> goes<00:05:47.790> to<00:05:47.820> G<00:05:48.180> G<00:05:48.930> 2<00:05:49.680> 3<00:05:50.520> again<00:05:55.310> -

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
two three I goes to G G 2 3 again -

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.030 
two three I goes to G G 2 3 again -
again

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.439 

three<00:06:00.580> goes<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.150> see<00:06:01.390> see

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.879 

I<00:06:06.860> guess

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:18.179 

three<00:06:10.219> more<00:06:10.729> times

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:18.189 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:22.839 

so<00:06:19.389> that's<00:06:20.389> how<00:06:20.569> the<00:06:20.629> base<00:06:20.870> goes<00:06:21.219> so<00:06:22.219> that's<00:06:22.610> it

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
so that's how the base goes so that's it

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.640 
so that's how the base goes so that's it
for<00:06:22.999> my<00:06:23.090> tutorial<00:06:23.599> for<00:06:23.629> this<00:06:24.020> part<00:06:24.349> you<00:06:24.530> have

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
for my tutorial for this part you have

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.320 
for my tutorial for this part you have
the<00:06:24.770> melody<00:06:25.099> and<00:06:25.219> the<00:06:25.279> bassline<00:06:25.669> learn<00:06:25.939> my

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
the melody and the bassline learn my

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.269 
the melody and the bassline learn my
second<00:06:26.689> part<00:06:26.900> will<00:06:27.020> be<00:06:27.169> the<00:06:27.469> little<00:06:28.039> middle

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:28.279 
second part will be the little middle

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.760 
second part will be the little middle
lines<00:06:28.580> of<00:06:28.909> the<00:06:29.419> middle<00:06:29.659> part<00:06:29.900> in<00:06:30.080> between<00:06:30.499> a

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
lines of the middle part in between a

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.890 
lines of the middle part in between a
little<00:06:31.099> more<00:06:31.219> complex<00:06:31.580> or<00:06:31.849> more<00:06:32.449> typical<00:06:32.779> to

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
little more complex or more typical to

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.300 
little more complex or more typical to
play<00:06:33.080> so<00:06:33.379> I'm<00:06:33.499> going<00:06:33.620> to<00:06:33.680> show<00:06:33.800> you<00:06:33.830> that<00:06:34.069> here

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
play so I'm going to show you that here

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.999 
play so I'm going to show you that here
in<00:06:34.370> my<00:06:34.430> next<00:06:34.669> video
