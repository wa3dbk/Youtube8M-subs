your apps
and<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.670> guess<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.969> could<00:00:39.120> actually<00:00:39.300> even<00:00:39.660> text

and I guess you could actually even text
with<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.469> don't<00:00:41.070> think<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.460> would<00:00:41.610> be

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
with it but don't think that would be

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.180
