Hey, everyone.

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.860
Today we're here to
talk about smart TVS.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.440
There's more to this technology
than internet connectivity.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.100
It's all about the features and
interfaces that make using the TV fun

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.210
and easy.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.320
To find out more, I went to CES to
see what smart TVS are all about.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.410
First and foremost, a smart
TV should be easy to set up.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.740
Roughly 52% of the
customers who buy smart TVs

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.307
get frustrated in the set-up system,
and never connect it to the internet.

00:00:24.307 --> 00:00:26.140
If the interface is
cumbersome or confusing,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.500
most people won't take
advantage of the features.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.299
A good interface is intuitive,
customizable and fast.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:36.580
Home button, launcher, select
the one you want, off you go.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.610
You're not selecting inputs anymore.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.170
You're not turning things on.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.490
It's all automatic for you.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.010
Another cool feature available
on a lot of smart TVs

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.130
is the ability to quickly
switch entertainment options.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.230
So when you're actually watching TV,
and you're successfully connected up

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.040
to the internet, there's
a lot that you want to do.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.050
Do you want to maybe access Netflix?

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.260
Do you want to watch live TV?

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.593
Maybe you want to watch Blu-ray.

00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:01.770
With our simple switching, all you
have to do is hit the home button.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.970
Essentially this is how we're used
to using computers and smartphones,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.980
with multiple programs readily
available on one screen,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.160
with the ability to quickly
switch between them.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.930
We've turned anything that you want
to do with your TV into an app.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.730
More and more TV isn't
just for watching TV.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.020
Smart TVs connect
families to apps and games

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.350
that download directly onto the TV.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.910
Of course there's also a wide range
of sources for great shows and movies.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.400
Now get access to all
this content, however

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.940
many channels your cable's giving
you, whatever Netflix is giving you,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.960
all of those other providers,
how do you find what's on?

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.520
We're going to make that easy for you
as well with our simple discovery.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.860
Smart TV brings everything together.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.500
It's really a multimedia
entertainment system.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.740
The remote is a crucial
part of the TV experience,

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.300
and you want a smart TV
remote that does it all.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.840
You could find ones the
point, click, scroll,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.570
and even receive voice commands.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.492
When you get your TV, the first thing
to do is connect the remote to the TV.

00:01:55.492 --> 00:01:57.700
And there's some pretty
creative ways for doing this.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.690
The first thing the TV asks you to
do is pick up the remote control.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.570
Wave it a couple of times.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.000
And on screen is a
sleeping bird, Bean Bird.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.539
And then you're instructed on
the screen to poke Bean Bird.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.280
So you poke him a couple of times.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.140
He wakes up.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.620
That simple game paired
up your remote control.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.780
If you decide to go the
smart TV route, first

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.900
make sure you find one
that's easy to use.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.130
Once you're set up, there's a world
of awesome media content right

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.202
at your fingertips.

00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:24.410
I hope this has been helpful.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.790
Thanks to Bob for his insight.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.810
And thanks for watching.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.800
Have a great day.
