00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.939
 the brother of 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.939
 register no 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.629
 arrested in tehran 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.759
 and here we are back with little ones 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.039
 depends on model. Exactly where we left with imac 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.039
 ie place of impact 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.320
 where we have to finish the day 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.320
 hokkaidoken to sea bari picnik 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.279
 we need 20 pikmin for the engine, so a little bit more 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.589
 I saw a lot of numbers down there 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:31.599
 the thing that is there 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.390
 many are interested in teresanna 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.600
 then rt that below are three numbers 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.630
 13 23 activity 3 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.250
 okay the left one 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.710
 they are the picnik number and they are following us at that time 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.000
 those half are the numbers is the number of pikmin in the field in general also 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.430
 those who are not following us 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.430
 and the right one the number of pigments in general that we have 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.740
 including those of onion 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.740
 because it is the maximum number of pikmin that passed the same field and 100 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.130
 I don't know why a mixture of semifreddo commands maybe someone already knows 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.970
 details without knowing how the right has gone for am entertainment 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.230
 watching this video 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.060
 however we have now criticized here here we have to take yamaha engine 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.960
 when I took the album the engine will end the day 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.840
 then 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.880
 aveo 23 picnik I remember that we can take 25 so we have to 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.110
 look for the producer top that allows us to take more picnik 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.040
 so I put 2 picnik wiki aside 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.240
 so that others do not take the engine 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.640
 and with these I look for 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.580
 missing token 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.500
 then 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.740
 if it is not of 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.300
 and of course from here 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.300
 hahaha yes I understand capistrello ringing 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.350
 prealpina we are picnik herzen atom power or faster names do sad 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.650
 then he fucks 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.170
 perfect 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.170
 1 2 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.190
 palinuro 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.100
 now there are those there 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.480
 I hope also they arrive first ip so here is the token if they arrive 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.809
 those with the engine then can no longer take it anymore 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.839
 my two additional picnik 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:15.189
 because when it is rejected when the engine gets golf in the day 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.359
 ends 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.720
 then go help them as much as you can 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.199
 d 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.029
 transfect that sprout 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:25.819
 therefore certainly cannot 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.819
 stop the Tuareg guesses 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.139
 are you there 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.139
 we are just waiting for you is 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.259
 I love 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.349
 but because it sprouted 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.269
 a second later than the other and when and to the connection he had come to the same 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.489
 strange moment 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.899
 ok 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:52.959
 the pigments of nothing the treasures of the dolphin fishing adolfini 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.959
 they will automatically bring near the appreciates 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:58.090
 so that then 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.229
 from giussano 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:00.639
 so apple 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.939
 dadadau 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.409
 perfect once the engine has stopped 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.159
 the dolphin will be able to take off without any or all the others 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:11.889
 pieces 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.789
 that we need to recover 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.509
 however listed there is no octotravel homeworld of unima 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.170
 but with the engine tomorrow we can explore a new cafora la area 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.879
 forest hope 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.629
 a wonderful one of loans - photo great leap forward on the way to 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:28.439
 home 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.359
 were imhoff headset - 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.279
 the glimmer of hope speak shines more and more 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.279
 but that in the other missing pieces 2 later to look for them 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:37.899
 perfect 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.879
 and so the day ends 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.090
 sunset falls we do not know how to add two seconds ago was full 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.919
 afternoon 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.059
 however one day like this 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.969
 there is no time and alternatively the day ends when we sport the 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.729
 adolfini piece 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:57.120
 from the next day 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.120
 everything will become normal the real game begins 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.849

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:09.419
 church the nocturnal creatures arrive 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.419
 together associated everything is explained olimar tranquilli 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:18.840
 perfect 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.710
 one day from the impact I somehow managed to get adolfini off but 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.529
 I was amazed to see the onion start with mac 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:29.050
 maybe pic - they can survive the night on the planet's surface 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.330
 1 simply decided to join me for some other reason 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.169
 however it seems that they want to help me tomorrow too 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.319
 adolphe missing 29 prices

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.020
 how can I fix the dalfin in such a short time 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.319
 on the surface below you see a thick forest because mine is a 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.310
 hope of survival I called it forest hope the roads I will explore 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.999

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.240
 of which we have already taken the engine 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.319
