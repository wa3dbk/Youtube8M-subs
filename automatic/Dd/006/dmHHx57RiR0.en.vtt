00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:19.910 
I'm either good with these things are
sometimes<00:00:08.340> on<00:00:08.760> my<00:00:08.849> nightmare<00:00:18.320> so<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> project

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
sometimes on my nightmare so the project

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.130 
sometimes on my nightmare so the project
is<00:00:20.130> about<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.820> different<00:00:21.270> illustration<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
is about a different illustration of a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.710 
is about a different illustration of a
glass<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.980> every<00:00:23.340> day<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.699> week<00:00:23.730> whereas

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
glass for every day of the week whereas

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.170 
glass for every day of the week whereas
monday<00:00:25.140> would<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.590> more<00:00:26.279> businesslike<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
monday would be more businesslike the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.179 
monday would be more businesslike the
start<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> week<00:00:27.840> your<00:00:28.289> professional<00:00:28.710> side

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
start of the week your professional side

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.389 
start of the week your professional side
leading<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.330> sunday<00:00:31.199> being<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.070> bit<00:00:32.219> more

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
leading to sunday being a bit more

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.220 
leading to sunday being a bit more
leisure<00:00:32.669> your<00:00:33.270> day<00:00:33.450> off<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:35.719> basically<00:00:36.719> went

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
leisure your day off I basically went

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.750 
leisure your day off I basically went
through<00:00:37.500> all<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.040> different<00:00:38.370> eyeglasses

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
through all of the different eyeglasses

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.170 
through all of the different eyeglasses
and<00:00:39.239> picked<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.140> what<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.649> would<00:00:41.640> ideally<00:00:42.000> be

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and picked out what I would ideally be

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.930 
and picked out what I would ideally be
wearing<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:42.899> each<00:00:43.260> day<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> week<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.700> shape

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
wearing for each day the week the shape

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.700 
wearing for each day the week the shape
feels<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.420> little<00:00:45.570> bit<00:00:45.840> different<00:00:46.350> whether

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
feels a little bit different whether

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.650 
feels a little bit different whether
it's<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.070> stems<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> side<00:00:47.969> whether<00:00:48.450> it's

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
it's the stems on the side whether it's

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.510 
it's the stems on the side whether it's
the<00:00:48.809> nose<00:00:48.960> pieces<00:00:49.320> everything's<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.250> little

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the nose pieces everything's a little

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.189 
the nose pieces everything's a little
bit<00:00:50.700> more<00:00:50.910> obscure<00:00:52.789> my<00:00:53.789> illustration<00:00:54.600> type<00:00:54.899> I

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
bit more obscure my illustration type I

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.799 
bit more obscure my illustration type I
would<00:00:55.649> consider<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.340> bit<00:00:56.520> off<00:00:56.730> based<00:00:57.570> on

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
would consider it a bit off based on

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.420 
would consider it a bit off based on
glasses<00:00:58.320> being<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.800> different<00:00:59.160> shape<00:00:59.399> than

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
glasses being a different shape than

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.910 
glasses being a different shape than
what<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.940> actually<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.390> one<00:01:01.170> side<00:01:01.440> heavier

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
what it actually is one side heavier

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.460 
what it actually is one side heavier
than<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> other<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:03.420> stems<00:01:03.719> being<00:01:04.049> shorter

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
than the other the stems being shorter

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.800 
than the other the stems being shorter
than<00:01:04.619> they<00:01:04.710> really<00:01:05.010> are<00:01:05.060> different<00:01:06.060> views<00:01:06.570> of

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
than they really are different views of

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.780 
than they really are different views of
the<00:01:06.930> glass<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> way<00:01:08.280> they<00:01:08.430> turned<00:01:08.610> up

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the glass I like the way they turned up

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.219 
the glass I like the way they turned up
I<00:01:10.729> mean<00:01:11.729> an<00:01:11.850> eyeglass<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.600> completely<00:01:13.080> change

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
I mean an eyeglass can completely change

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.120 
I mean an eyeglass can completely change
the<00:01:13.740> character<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:15.030> preppy<00:01:15.869> glass<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the character for a preppy glass to a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.580 
the character for a preppy glass to a
more<00:01:17.369> casual<00:01:17.820> glass<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.960> more<00:01:19.229> advanced

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
more casual glass it's a more advanced

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.010 
more casual glass it's a more advanced
accessory<00:01:20.600> when<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.689> want<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> make<00:01:21.990> a
