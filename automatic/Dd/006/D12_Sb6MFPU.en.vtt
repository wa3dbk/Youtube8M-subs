00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 by 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.260
 in the province where we called attention 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.770
 impassive clear red clares that is this river that crosses all the populations 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.200
 important of the province 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.300
 the province has something more than 100 thousand square kilometers the leader of the 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.550
 pp is a little less than the Murcian region 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.720
 a little bit more about navarra 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.550
 and all this terrain detect about 50 thousand inhabitants, that is, we go out to about 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.860
 50 liters per square kilometer, apparently few 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.830
 Well, this is one of the most populated rural areas of Australia. 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.830
 rest 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.860
 there are religious positions fsln mark twain 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.000
 the same name and that of his son 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.380
 this excess 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.719
 as it is in these texts as light poles they are painted as tarzan and it is 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.289
 that his designs the analysis of kilts 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.460
 this forum has more than two thousand inhabitants 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.620
 Well, it's capable of gathering more than 500 crossbowmen 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:13.290
 as I already told you that around here they will be together with the greats because in the band 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:17.459
 it reiterated through art the little ones like us efe behind 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.699
 if you have children attend boleros 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.069
 and they have been doing it for more than 100 years 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.389
 but not all the social entertainment of tlaxcala and zacatecas this is a 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.529
 madness 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.529
 pp lotina look at what pumpkin 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.089
 we 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.859
 p 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.659
 p 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.349
 a little further another 15 kilometers farther from there went to beaches 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.689
 this other town since I took last year as the best Australian people 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.979
 by a prestigious tourist magazine 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.680
 it's called times where you come to eat 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.959
 the bomb 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.559
 the quality of its beaches the national parks that surround it the climate that 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:19.559
 we enjoyed him as a pp series 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:24.799
 this small town may well be proud to represent the style of 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.659
 life australia 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.090
 tiny beach populations along a virginal post on one side 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.179
 and on the other if you throw the mountain inland 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:38.179
 the exuberance of subtropical forests 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:44.999
 for the pp that they combine 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.999
 when the hosts saw cut 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.849
 added 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.589
 the correct answer is 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:56.899
 in one of the leisure and free time places 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:04:00.129
 the position protocol 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.449
 this province 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.449
 as all have their capital is called 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:09.429
 here we did not have above the sidewalks we do it on carpets of 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.429
 flowers look bp 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.650
 no more than two decades 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.630
 what I am most proud of, lives expectantly of the state 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.029
 yes no 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:28.190
 there is not a single traffic light 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.360
 bp assumes no corruption 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.490
 these two cities 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.480
 Many occasions 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.150
 you do not need to stop the car 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.949
 another technical thing 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.219
 an American bomber of no more than two weeks 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.889
 good 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.900
 they are not suitable for 15 thousand inhabitants it deserves
