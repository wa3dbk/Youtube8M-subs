00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.220 
bluetooth basically and the standard one
was<00:00:19.859> rubbish<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.720> along<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:22.020> came

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230

pretty<00:00:22.680> poor<00:00:23.340> based<00:00:23.670> response<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> decided

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
pretty poor based response so I decided

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.650 
pretty poor based response so I decided
to<00:00:25.560> buy<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.789> supplement<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.330> head<00:00:27.480> unit

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
don't listen to dance and club music so

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.979 
don't listen to dance and club music so
hopefully<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.059> give<00:00:33.149> some<00:00:33.180> cheesy<00:00:33.540> demos

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
hopefully and we give some cheesy demos

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.970 
hopefully and we give some cheesy demos
now<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.040> sounds<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:39.980> pointer

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
now of what it sounds like a pointer

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.080 
now of what it sounds like a pointer
note<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.370> probably<00:00:41.640> worth<00:00:41.760> way<00:00:41.969> with

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
note it's probably worth way with

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.299 
note it's probably worth way with

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that made it you couldn't really tell

00:00:45.780 --> 00:01:29.710 
that made it you couldn't really tell
much<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.260> difference<00:00:46.559> from<00:00:46.710> speak

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
if you have a guest already I don't have

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.040 
if you have a guest already I don't have
any<00:01:32.700> professional<00:01:32.910> audio<00:01:33.600> recording

equipments<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.950> from<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
equipments this is just from the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.400 
equipments this is just from the
camera's<00:01:35.550> microphone<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.080> wasn't<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
camera's microphone and so it wasn't the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.480 
camera's microphone and so it wasn't the
best<00:01:37.590> response<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.160> think<00:01:38.190> it<00:01:38.400> was

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
best response I think it was

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.730 
best response I think it was
auto-leveling<00:01:39.050> when<00:01:40.050> I<00:01:40.140> put<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> subwoofer

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
auto-leveling when I put the subwoofer

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.650 
auto-leveling when I put the subwoofer
on<00:01:40.860> fall<00:01:41.160> in<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.640> there<00:01:41.910> is<00:01:42.000> didn't<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.360> quiet

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
on fall in and there is didn't go quiet

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.150 
on fall in and there is didn't go quiet
on<00:01:42.780> purpose<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.380> recovers<00:01:43.590> your<00:01:43.950> self

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
on purpose and it recovers your self

00:01:44.160 --> 00:02:02.540 
on purpose and it recovers your self
leveling<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:01.320> slightly<00:02:01.590> more<00:02:01.740> technical<00:02:02.070> wear

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
leveling so slightly more technical wear

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.190 
leveling so slightly more technical wear

what you can get out of a car and just

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.820 
what you can get out of a car and just
