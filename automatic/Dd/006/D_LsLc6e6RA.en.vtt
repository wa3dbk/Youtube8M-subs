bottom side with the ribbons in place
and<00:00:11.780> as<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.960> can<00:00:13.110> see<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.469> I've<00:00:13.620> laid<00:00:13.920> out<00:00:14.509> all

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
and as you can see it I've laid out all

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.990 
and as you can see it I've laid out all
of<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.809> ribbon<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.289> I'm<00:00:16.410> going<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.740> use<00:00:17.000> and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
of the ribbon that I'm going to use and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.689 
of the ribbon that I'm going to use and
these<00:00:18.210> are<00:00:18.359> six<00:00:18.720> inch<00:00:19.050> long<00:00:20.010> ribbons<00:00:20.400> but<00:00:20.609> you

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
these are six inch long ribbons but you

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.179 
these are six inch long ribbons but you
could<00:00:20.910> use<00:00:21.090> some<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.630> varying<00:00:22.080> lengths<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.980> as

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
could use some of varying lengths and as

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.769 
could use some of varying lengths and as
you<00:00:23.369> can<00:00:23.519> see<00:00:23.730> I've<00:00:23.910> chosen<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.420> different

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
you can see I've chosen a different

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.599 
you can see I've chosen a different
different<00:00:25.470> colors<00:00:26.010> widths<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.590> shape<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.830> a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
different colors widths and shape of a

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:39.369 
different colors widths and shape of a
ribbon<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.730> now<00:00:33.739> I'll<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:34.950> back<00:00:35.520> these<00:00:35.850> away

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.520 

and<00:00:40.379> place<00:00:41.390> at<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.540> top<00:00:42.780> panel<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.410> I've

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and place at the top panel that I've

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.869 
and place at the top panel that I've
already<00:00:43.890> made<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.629> bottom<00:00:46.340> again<00:00:47.340> right

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
already made to the bottom again right

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.350 
already made to the bottom again right
sides<00:00:48.210> together<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:50.879> I've

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
sides together and as you can see I've

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.709 
sides together and as you can see I've
pressed<00:00:51.750> open<00:00:52.110> my<00:00:52.739> seam<00:00:53.039> again<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:54.360> again

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
pressed open my seam again and again

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.029 
pressed open my seam again and again
this<00:00:54.930> prevents<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.489> fabric<00:00:56.910> from<00:00:57.149> bunching

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
this prevents the fabric from bunching

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.540 
this prevents the fabric from bunching
so<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.219> making<00:01:00.210> sure<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.780> your<00:01:01.430> edges<00:01:02.430> are

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
so now making sure that your edges are

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.380 
so now making sure that your edges are
aligned<00:01:03.409> you're<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.710> loop<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:06.060> ribbon

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
aligned you're going to loop the ribbon

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.880 
aligned you're going to loop the ribbon
like<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:09.180> loop<00:01:09.390> goes<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
like this and the loop goes on the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.870 
like this and the loop goes on the
inside<00:01:14.119> and<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.040> bit<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
inside and you can have a bit of the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.080 
inside and you can have a bit of the
ribbon<00:01:18.240> hanging<00:01:18.750> off<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.200> edge<00:01:19.880> because<00:01:20.880> this

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
ribbon hanging off the edge because this

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.090 
ribbon hanging off the edge because this
isn't<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.479> precise<00:01:21.930> measurement<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> six

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
isn't a precise measurement of the six

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.050 
isn't a precise measurement of the six
inch<00:01:23.310> long<00:01:23.729> ribbon<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:27.659> now<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.930> will<00:01:28.790> pin<00:01:29.790> all

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
inch long ribbon so now you will pin all

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.840 
inch long ribbon so now you will pin all
the<00:01:30.210> ribbons<00:01:30.570> again<00:01:31.009> with<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> loops<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the ribbons again with the loops on the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.000 
the ribbons again with the loops on the
inside

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.400 

putting<00:01:39.700> them<00:01:39.820> all<00:01:40.030> in<00:01:40.210> place<00:01:40.450> on<00:01:40.780> all<00:01:41.050> four

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
putting them all in place on all four

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:51.270 
putting them all in place on all four
sides<00:01:45.660> and<00:01:46.920> once<00:01:47.920> these<00:01:48.160> are<00:01:48.220> in<00:01:48.490> place<00:01:50.280> you're

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
sides and once these are in place you're

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.080 
sides and once these are in place you're
going<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.260> again<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:54.190> quarter-inch<00:01:54.580> seam

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
going to so again the quarter-inch seam

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.870 
going to so again the quarter-inch seam
allowance<00:01:55.660> on<00:01:56.670> almost<00:01:57.670> all<00:01:57.970> four<00:01:58.450> sides<00:01:59.880> but

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
allowance on almost all four sides but

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.750 
allowance on almost all four sides but
I'll<00:02:01.030> show<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:02.010> that<00:02:03.010> you're<00:02:03.160> going<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.520> want

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
I'll show you that you're going to want

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.210 
I'll show you that you're going to want
to<00:02:03.850> leave<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.390> little<00:02:04.600> bit<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:04.990> an<00:02:05.110> opening<00:02:05.590> just

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
to leave a little bit of an opening just

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.330 
to leave a little bit of an opening just
on<00:02:06.430> one<00:02:06.670> of<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.910> sides<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.619> that<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:08.920> can<00:02:09.100> turn

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
on one of the sides so that you can turn

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.240 
on one of the sides so that you can turn
this<00:02:09.580> inside<00:02:09.940> out<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:11.470> in<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.620> sense<00:02:12.070> it's

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
this inside out and in that sense it's

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.670 
this inside out and in that sense it's
kind<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.580> like<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.820> pillow<00:02:13.410> when<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.500> make<00:02:14.650> a

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
kind of like a pillow when you make a

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.490 
kind of like a pillow when you make a
pillow<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:16.240> don't<00:02:16.450> want<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.720> sew<00:02:16.930> all<00:02:17.230> four

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
pillow you don't want to sew all four

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.470 
pillow you don't want to sew all four
sides<00:02:17.800> shut<00:02:18.190> or<00:02:18.520> else<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.850> won't<00:02:18.970> be<00:02:19.180> able<00:02:19.300> to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
sides shut or else you won't be able to

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.450 
sides shut or else you won't be able to
flip<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.810> inside<00:02:19.990> out<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:23.080> again<00:02:23.410> you'll<00:02:24.160> go

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
flip it inside out so again you'll go

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.430 
flip it inside out so again you'll go
around<00:02:24.580> on<00:02:24.850> all<00:02:24.970> four<00:02:25.240> sides<00:02:25.350> pinning<00:02:26.350> the
