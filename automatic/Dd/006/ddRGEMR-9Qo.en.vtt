we're<00:00:08.830> here<00:00:08.980> Camelback<00:00:09.490> to<00:00:09.730> showcase<00:00:10.600> the<00:00:10.750> new

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
we're here Camelback to showcase the new

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.100 
we're here Camelback to showcase the new
antidote<00:00:11.350> reservoir<00:00:12.059> ships

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.679 

for<00:00:15.380> the<00:00:15.769> 2011<00:00:16.090> line<00:00:19.029> we<00:00:20.029> design<00:00:20.330> all<00:00:20.510> of<00:00:20.600> our

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
for the 2011 line we design all of our

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.600 
for the 2011 line we design all of our
hydration<00:00:20.960> systems<00:00:21.500> around<00:00:21.770> the<00:00:22.070> reservoir

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
hydration systems around the reservoir

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.580 
hydration systems around the reservoir
so<00:00:23.360> we<00:00:23.480> figured<00:00:23.750> we'd<00:00:23.900> start<00:00:24.110> there<00:00:24.349> with<00:00:24.500> the

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
so we figured we'd start there with the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.690 
so we figured we'd start there with the
full<00:00:24.770> redesign<00:00:25.099> I<00:00:25.880> need<00:00:26.509> done<00:00:27.490> down<00:00:28.490> here

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
full redesign I need done down here

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.820 
full redesign I need done down here
you've<00:00:28.880> got<00:00:29.090> your<00:00:29.420> standard<00:00:29.990> tried-and-true

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
you've got your standard tried-and-true

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.740 
you've got your standard tried-and-true
Omega<00:00:31.250> probably<00:00:32.059> seen<00:00:32.210> it<00:00:32.300> run<00:00:32.390> over<00:00:32.629> by

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
Omega probably seen it run over by

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.240 
Omega probably seen it run over by
vehicles<00:00:33.230> you<00:00:33.470> know<00:00:33.590> stands<00:00:33.830> the<00:00:33.949> test<00:00:34.100> of

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
vehicles you know stands the test of

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.660 
vehicles you know stands the test of
time<00:00:34.510> but<00:00:35.510> just<00:00:35.660> time<00:00:35.780> for<00:00:35.989> an<00:00:36.050> update<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:36.670> this

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
time but just time for an update so this

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.049 
time but just time for an update so this
is<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:37.910> antidote<00:00:38.150> check<00:00:38.930> consumer<00:00:39.410> feedback

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
is the antidote check consumer feedback

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.250 
is the antidote check consumer feedback
number<00:00:41.059> one<00:00:41.180> thing<00:00:41.390> was<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.600> cap<00:00:41.780> is<00:00:41.989> hard<00:00:42.140> to

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
number one thing was the cap is hard to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.610 
number one thing was the cap is hard to
open

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
open

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.020 
open
so<00:00:42.890> we've<00:00:44.230> swapped<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:45.730> got<00:00:46.730> rid<00:00:46.910> of<00:00:46.940> that

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
so we've swapped that got rid of that

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.990 
so we've swapped that got rid of that
issue<00:00:47.269> with<00:00:47.540> this<00:00:47.659> quarter<00:00:48.019> turn<00:00:48.229> open<00:00:48.589> cap

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
issue with this quarter turn open cap

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.210 
issue with this quarter turn open cap
quick<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.150> easy<00:00:50.299> we<00:00:51.199> increase<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.620> diameter

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
quick and easy we increase the diameter

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.500 
quick and easy we increase the diameter
so<00:00:52.250> it's<00:00:52.549> the<00:00:52.640> largest<00:00:52.879> footprint<00:00:53.330> on<00:00:53.449> the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
so it's the largest footprint on the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.439 
so it's the largest footprint on the
market<00:00:54.460> when<00:00:55.460> doing<00:00:55.699> that<00:00:55.820> we<00:00:56.000> were<00:00:56.089> also<00:00:56.210> able

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
market when doing that we were also able

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.530 
market when doing that we were also able
to<00:00:56.860> keep<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:58.010> stack<00:00:58.250> height<00:00:58.519> reduced<00:00:59.360> it<00:00:59.510> by

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
to keep the stack height reduced it by

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.799 
to keep the stack height reduced it by
28%<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:00.739> it's<00:01:00.890> lower<00:01:01.040> profile<00:01:01.580> and<00:01:02.119> ninety

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
28% so it's lower profile and ninety

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.109 
28% so it's lower profile and ninety
percent<00:01:02.989> lighter

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
percent lighter

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.210 
percent lighter
we're<00:01:05.600> also<00:01:05.720> able<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.110> add<00:01:06.200> in<00:01:06.470> features<00:01:06.890> like

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
we're also able to add in features like

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.490 
we're also able to add in features like
hidden<00:01:08.000> dryer<00:01:08.390> arms<00:01:08.780> pulled<00:01:09.140> out<00:01:09.259> from<00:01:09.380> the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
hidden dryer arms pulled out from the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.230 
hidden dryer arms pulled out from the
fill<00:01:09.710> port<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.759> you<00:01:10.820> can<00:01:11.090> open<00:01:11.210> this<00:01:11.450> up<00:01:13.240> and

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
fill port so you can open this up and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.539 
fill port so you can open this up and
dry<00:01:14.570> it<00:01:14.630> anywhere<00:01:15.259> you<00:01:15.350> go<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:15.979> if<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:16.159> can't<00:01:16.430> be

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
dry it anywhere you go so if it can't be

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.370 
dry it anywhere you go so if it can't be
in<00:01:16.850> staying<00:01:17.090> in<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.270> hotel<00:01:17.420> or<00:01:17.990> if<00:01:18.079> you're<00:01:18.200> just

in staying in a hotel or if you're just

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.350 
in staying in a hotel or if you're just
at<00:01:18.530> home<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:18.950> don't<00:01:19.610> want<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:19.850> keep<00:01:20.000> track<00:01:20.210> of

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
at home and don't want to keep track of

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.240 
at home and don't want to keep track of
cleaning<00:01:20.720> kit<00:01:20.930> it's<00:01:21.439> all<00:01:21.590> integrated<00:01:22.039> right

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
cleaning kit it's all integrated right

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.410 
cleaning kit it's all integrated right
into<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.610> reservoir<00:01:24.820> other<00:01:25.820> features<00:01:26.240> we've

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
into the reservoir other features we've

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.919 
into the reservoir other features we've
got<00:01:26.630> are<00:01:26.960> we<00:01:27.409> added<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:28.630> baffle<00:01:29.630> down<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
got are we added the baffle down the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:31.929 
got are we added the baffle down the
center<00:01:30.200> which<00:01:30.320> we<00:01:30.470> use<00:01:30.590> in<00:01:30.860> some<00:01:31.759> of<00:01:31.789> our

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
center which we use in some of our

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.700 
center which we use in some of our
wearable<00:01:32.360> product<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:33.259> we're<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.439> military

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710
