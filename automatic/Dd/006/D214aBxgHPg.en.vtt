00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Welcome to this new 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.330
 video from me and I got post 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.649
 from the company glas and the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.300
 should not quite be one or the other 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.950
 be unknown because I already have 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.320
 Products of which on a canal 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.949
 tested that were the last time iphone 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.439
 6 and iphone 6 plus films namely 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.199
 armored glass foil with rounded edges 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.359
 In addition, the device completely protect and 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.000
 in this case I have her further 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.560
 I'll do it again very briefly 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.179
 up with the camera around you 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.980
 show what we do with this early one 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.530
 can protect you by what you love 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.510
 that is the slogan of the company and in 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.809
 In this case, I would like to foil you 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.030
 imagine for the apple watch namely 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.680
 first the scrub awakens and then see 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.899
 you all here something belongs there 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.120
 my address is on it but you see 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.190
 I got some packages here 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.899
 and of course I want you the the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.969
 over remains after the video lottery 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.070
 That's why it stays tuned to the end 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.530
 and here I have these little ones 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.440
 packages and in this small package 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.019
 there is a liquid film for 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.659
 the apple watch in my case here the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.100
 apple golfing with 38 millimeters and 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.170
 I would like to have one of these now 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.630
 unpack small packaging and then 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.520
 once this liquid foil on mine 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.600
 Apple Watch brings you likes shows 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.600
 how it works 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.780
 then we will pack best now 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.820
 once here the packing issue price 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.530
 the whole paperwork is taken out 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.090
 and there you will find some more 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.840
 safety instructions and general 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.900
 information 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.420
 But more important is the content and indeed 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.130
 that apple logic well I have here already 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.570
 my apple bosch we refuse to see 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.820
 you do not have to settle the users 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.560
 but of course you can do it and then 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.470
 you see that apple soon 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.030
 turtle out here we have once 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.890
 safety instructions and on the other 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.440
 side we have the instructions for use 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.940
 So there should definitely be before 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.580
 The whole then applies again 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.470
 look over it and then that 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.750
 Follow all and we will now 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.060
 in this video too we do 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.770
 pack now again the small package 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.709
 here from what was attached that 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.120
 black sooner 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.770
 and we even have alcohol falls 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.630
 then here's another one 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:25.430
 small microfiber cloth and the whole 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:28.250
 important here is the liquid apple logic 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.959
 So will the protective film and the need 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.870
 we also cut to get it I once 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.610
 very quickly the scissors are so heavy 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.500
 and then I would say we start 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.459
 also directly and first of all 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.769
 we clean our device here 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.730
 we come to the attached material 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.220
 So use the attached rag of the 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.230
 microfiber cloth what brought us here 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.820
 and of course our device should be 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.680
 very thoroughly clean that's why here 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.390
 also that alcohol fed as a small tip 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.560
 in the drostei way she did that 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.459
 should do in the evening 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.350
 because this liquid protective film should 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.030
 to harden for at least twelve hours and 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.560
 accordingly it makes whole 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.319
 evening to do if you have the apple 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:19.530
 then he does not use the slippery well 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:25.380
 possible but as she herself is tricked 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:29.099
 and you should definitely be very 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.400
 take good care that you are really gone 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:35.670
 and every dust here is quite simple 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.500
 away and that's what I'm doing here 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.730
 he should also be done well in the end 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.630
 look like that and then we cut that 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:51.720
 whole is easy but also and look 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:55.620
 what's going on inside will find that 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.660
 very strong in any case 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.160
 have such a little paper sees that 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:09.090
 already the blue thing and that has easy 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:11.430
 once out and thus in here as now 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.700
 our apple watch does it all 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.769
 I'm here now so you should do the whole thing 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.510
 Apply evenly and slowly here 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.850
 and you see, that's real 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.310
 fluently i hope that this is one 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.660
 can recognize 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.919
 and I carry it all here now 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.080
 careful and slow also with that 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.169
 everywhere really on about 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.090
 also applied to the edges 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.419
 has been 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:43.620
 and if you have then done that the 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.880
 pad walk waits about a minute and a half 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.229
 then you can then with the 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.789
 supplied microfiber cloth the corner 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.210
 Do not cool her and do the whole thing 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:58.010
 we for after this this one 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.660
 liquid accredited dried 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.190
 Now about a minute has passed and 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.229
 We will definitely see you on the 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.280
 Edward that we film this liquid 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.900
 On it is this on something light 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.280
 Let's see that the adwords on the 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.169
 suspect that the film has on it and 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.419
 we will do all this with this now 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.270
 ball against cloth just cool your bite 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.670
 as a lance so until it looks nice 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:28.380
 and you can see it will be okay on everyone 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:30.180
 fall a little cloudy in any case the 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.850
 has already looked very good 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.650
 and in the end who is that then 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.020
 how should now in any case 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.140
 wash your hands because they are just that 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.250
 liquid display glass has touched now 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.260
 you should wash your hands 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.880
 that is definitely recommended and 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.080
 Now you can watch the corner theoretically 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.540
 however you should use 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.400
 at least twelve hours wait 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.800
 all I'm doing now and namely 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.870
 then you will see my view the next day 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.840
 and then feels the whole thing in everyday life 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.000
 beats just look at us now 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.520
 The display of the apple watch after twelve 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.140
 hours of rest as you can see 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.300
 nothing and that's what you wanted 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.760
 because the protection is completely invisible 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.860
 the glass liquid turns out to be extreme 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.840
 thin layer over your apple watch 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.030
 display and thus ensures an extra 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.740
 protection of the manufacturer according to the hardness 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.080
 should approach from sapphire 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.910
 thus will scratch if your watch 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.710
 somewhere against pushes avoided 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.050
 however, you have no extra 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.660
 protective film such as panzerglas 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.850
 slide over your watch and if strong 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.680
 bumps or falling down with it 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.790
 I can give you a break 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.530
 unfortunately not in this video 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.000
 demonstrate because that's mine for me 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.710
 Apple Watch is just too expensive 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.600
 I personally see a very clear 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.740
 advantage that the protective layer too 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.110
 is thin and you can not see her 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.030
 because I already have protective films 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.560
 used for the apple watch and that are 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.400
 just ugly and also limit the 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.560
 use one 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.020
 because they are not rounded sits 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.370
 far gestures heavy thus execute 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.900
 do you have one with lars league? 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.030
 Invisible protective layer yours 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.220
 display as far as possible from scratches and 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.620
 wanted to protect other damage 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.450
 and another advantage offers the 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.250
 invisible protective layer even more than that 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.490
 direction permeability and perspective 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.630
 as well as colors remain unchanged and 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.550
 the protective layer is also waterproof 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.560
 the reliability does not become this 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.700
 affected by one 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.740
 unrestricted protection too 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.870
 should ensure that apply 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.180
 But the glass is lying down after a year 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.860
 repeat if you protect yourself 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.060
 I think I should grow now 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.710
 everyone decide for themselves 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.270
 I'll keep you in any case 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.230
 ongoing and if in the next 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.610
 months 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.860
 Strasser should I recognize you 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.200
 inform about it and for all the 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.060
 first try free glass first 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.440
 we would like to be able to do this 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.090
 participate in the prize draw 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.070
 because I am giving away four small ones here 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.690
 effects as in the beginning mentioned 

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.730
 All you have to do is subscribe 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.290
 a channel of his comments or 

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.120
 leave a thumb up there and 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.860
 Looks definitely on the glass 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.350
 facebook side over and that too there 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.090
 a lighter i wish you a lot 

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.140
 luck and see you next time 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.140
 video again
