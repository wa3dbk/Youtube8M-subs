have<00:01:16.140> been<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.880> epic<00:01:17.880> long<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:19.110> late

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
have been going on epic long as of late

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.810 
have been going on epic long as of late
and<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> am<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.420> am<00:01:21.900> surprised<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.640> say<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
and so I am I am surprised to say the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.960 
and so I am I am surprised to say the
least<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:25.350> they<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.710> been<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.100> short<00:01:26.400> we

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
least that they have been so short we

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.460 
least that they have been so short we
will<00:01:27.090> see<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.420> how<00:01:27.600> long<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.020> game<00:01:28.200> goes

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
will see just how long this game goes

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.030 
will see just how long this game goes
now<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.210> certainly<00:01:30.619> favorable<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
now this is certainly favorable for the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.460 
now this is certainly favorable for the
Terran<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.700> these<00:01:32.909> positions<00:01:33.150> lots<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.200> drop

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
Terran in these positions lots of drop

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.340 
Terran in these positions lots of drop
opportunities<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.780> times<00:01:36.960> you'll<00:01:37.170> see

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
opportunities a lot of times you'll see

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.249 
opportunities a lot of times you'll see
them<00:01:37.560> happen<00:01:38.189> down<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.579> around<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:40.079> even

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
them happen down and around here or even

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.020 
them happen down and around here or even
just<00:01:40.290> skirting<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> outside<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
just skirting on the outside of the the

just skirting on the outside of the the
base<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:42.840> certainly<00:01:43.200> down<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.890> for

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
base here but certainly down here for

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
for quick little pokes in at the mineral

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.249 
for quick little pokes in at the mineral
line<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.340> maybe<00:01:47.520> even<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.450> distract<00:01:48.899> before

right<00:04:08.590> now<00:04:08.910> no<00:04:09.910> fourth<00:04:10.330> gate<00:04:10.540> as<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:11.140> yet<00:04:11.320> but

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
right now no fourth gate as it yet but

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.680 
right now no fourth gate as it yet but
it<00:04:11.650> looks<00:04:11.680> on<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.670> much<00:04:12.820> like<00:04:13.120> a<00:04:13.150> four<00:04:13.480> gate

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
it looks on so much like a four gate

with<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:14.050> pylon<00:04:14.800> down<00:04:15.660> but<00:04:16.660> perhaps<00:04:16.840> it<00:04:17.169> is

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
with that pylon down but perhaps it is

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.479 
with that pylon down but perhaps it is
just<00:04:17.320> going<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.859> be<00:04:18.040> some<00:04:18.370> some<00:04:19.200> aggression

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
just going to be some some aggression

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.890 
just going to be some some aggression
before<00:04:21.489> an<00:04:21.760> expansion<00:04:22.210> we<00:04:22.360> do<00:04:22.450> have<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.630> pylon

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
before an expansion we do have a pylon

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.240 
before an expansion we do have a pylon
here<00:04:23.200> so<00:04:23.350> that<00:04:23.500> could<00:04:23.620> be<00:04:23.650> an<00:04:23.800> option<00:04:23.980> as<00:04:24.220> well

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
here so that could be an option as well

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.770 
here so that could be an option as well

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
little bit of an attack pattern down

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.930 
little bit of an attack pattern down
here<00:05:32.650> and<00:05:32.830> look<00:05:32.950> at<00:05:33.040> this<00:05:33.070> this<00:05:33.430> is<00:05:33.490> actually

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
here and look at this this is actually

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.980 
here and look at this this is actually
going<00:05:34.060> to<00:05:34.150> be<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.300> same<00:05:34.419> thing<00:05:34.600> and<00:05:34.720> they<00:05:34.900> are

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
going to be the same thing and they are

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
reinforcements and he did not make it

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.680 
reinforcements and he did not make it
there<00:06:03.460> in<00:06:03.490> time<00:06:03.699> he<00:06:04.120> got<00:06:04.270> caught<00:06:04.479> off<00:06:04.659> guard

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
there in time he got caught off guard

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.890 
there in time he got caught off guard
and<00:06:05.169> terrible<00:06:06.039> terrible<00:06:06.400> timing<00:06:06.789> for<00:06:07.539> Fred

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
massive uphill climb he is going to see

massive uphill climb he is going to see
the<00:06:23.319> units<00:06:23.680> coming<00:06:23.860> down<00:06:24.099> here<00:06:24.370> and<00:06:24.430> we<00:06:24.819> could

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
the units coming down here and we could

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.439 
the units coming down here and we could
again<00:06:25.270> be<00:06:25.330> seeing<00:06:25.720> a<00:06:25.780> very<00:06:26.110> quick<00:06:26.789> GG<00:06:27.789> scenario

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
again be seeing a very quick GG scenario

ground he was going for the Forge and he

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.670 
ground he was going for the Forge and he
hasn't<00:06:34.330> gone<00:06:34.419> for<00:06:34.690> there<00:06:34.870> we<00:06:34.990> go<00:06:35.080> the<00:06:35.229> Pilon<00:06:35.560> is

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680
