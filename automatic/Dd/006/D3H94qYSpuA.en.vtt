from being almost dead or being dead now

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.140 
from being almost dead or being dead now
this

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
this

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.390 
this
battery<00:04:24.479> or<00:04:25.139> any<00:04:25.169> really<00:04:25.560> any<00:04:25.650> extended

battery or any really any extended

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.550 
battery or any really any extended
battery<00:04:26.699> takes<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.509> about<00:04:27.660> six<00:04:28.199> hours

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
battery takes you about six hours

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.490 
battery takes you about six hours
because<00:04:29.160> there's<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.490> lot<00:04:29.699> more<00:04:30.419> it's<00:04:31.169> a<00:04:31.320> bigger

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
because there's a lot more it's a bigger

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.610 
because there's a lot more it's a bigger
battery<00:04:31.740> so<00:04:31.979> it<00:04:32.100> takes<00:04:32.280> more<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.669> charging<00:04:33.620> now

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
battery so it takes more to charging now

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.650 
battery so it takes more to charging now
when<00:04:35.160> you're<00:04:35.280> charging<00:04:35.669> it<00:04:35.759> and<00:04:36.000> let's<00:04:36.539> say

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
after two hours you see a green light it

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.450 
after two hours you see a green light it
is<00:04:38.789> not<00:04:39.000> fully<00:04:39.240> charged<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:40.220> found<00:04:41.220> that<00:04:41.310> out
