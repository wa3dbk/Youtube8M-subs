00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 Sometimes I want to knit a product 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.750
 gum 2 by 2 through one needle but such 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.590
 the product always wants at least something 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.039
 decorate and you can help 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.680
 ordinary pigtails to spit us 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.130
 knit comfortable and comfortable we little 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.640
 change the density settings if the gum 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.220
 you have been connected tightly enough then 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 we need to add density on 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.200
 back room 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.110
 I add up to 5 that is significantly 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.239
 more she's the front needle cases we 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.129
 add density slightly 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.300
 either do not add at all due to 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.090
 dense 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.680
 the seamy side we have with you and 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.449
 front side did not look loose 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.340
 we knit several rows while 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.340
 Of course we look at the density 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:07.320
 fit easily and the canvas does not work 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.970
 very loose we will do with you 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.369
 several braids 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:18.509
 on the center of our sample on 6 two 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:22.830
 you and I have a beekeeper to 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:27.030
 braids were tied easily to the need for 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:33.750
 on the seamy side 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.630
 goats push the needle work on 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.250
 front fanta and after that we 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.009
 we knit one row 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.350
 do not forget the position 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.240
 the front needle cases should be already on 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.280
 these and ticks that we are with you 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.759
 exhibited educated 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.729
 we can calm them 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:00.420
 reset due to these nakidov 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:06.060
 size increases 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:10.910
 loops on the back and an upper room and 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.910
 using 2 2 coal century 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:21.000
 we can start moving with you 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.300
 loops first i do it on 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:32.250
 central gooks because guide 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:33.810
 for me is zero and the same 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.420
 doing on the other two 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:48.269
 very convenient to put all the loops in 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:51.660
 forward working or until it stops 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.410
 and you see that on the front mountains and 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.489
 the upper room 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.019
 very tight loops turned out 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:05.160
 so we will knit very 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:08.870
 careful very tight knitting 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.030
 and after that we will definitely add 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:18.690
 density on the front needle bar on 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:21.930
 front carriage see very carefully 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.530
 even with the other hand holding the front 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.040
 carriage so that carriages walked evenly 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.970
 knit now 6 rows and in front 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.040
 sixth row, we again exhibit 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.320
 needles need to put needles so 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.109
 so they got into everything 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.640
 twos who are involved in the transfer 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:47.609
 loops and the last sixth row 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.980
 see the bows again we're just as simple 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:59.130
 movement looped off the needle 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:01.790
 a little bit and do the same 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.790
 operation 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.659
 You can put needles at once 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.960
 here now and have added density 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.850
 before 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:42.490
 loop transfer is much easier 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:49.169
 this is how you can decorate the product 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.169
 tied and completely elastic and 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:05:00.370
 we knit the same six rows on the sixth 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.610
 row 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.610
 repeat the same operation again
