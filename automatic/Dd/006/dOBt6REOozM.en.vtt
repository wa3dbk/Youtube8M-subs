00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.629
 Welcome to the further review 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.180
 here on ketscher blaser point ch no 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:14.209
 it is not about the Samsung Galaxy S3 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.240
 as hardware itself already gives 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.850
 some reviews and reports on us 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.050
 Of course the blogs will be linked 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:28.700
 this is about the adoro i hope so 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.560
 right out is a case for the sgs 3 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.520
 and let's have a look 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:42.190
 take a closer look 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:44.170
 Carefully cut up beautiful fabric 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.739
 feels good 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.370
 the workmanship is not approaching 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.600
 visible 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:57.769
 speak inside very very nice 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.960
 processed here at the front of the logo 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.839
 the name inside you can find 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.229
 So-called polar flows is extra thick 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:10.490
 nice and soft, especially what's great here 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:13.280
 advantage is with touch devices like ss sgs 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.990
 three, of course, is also something and 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.719
 that's the whole lot 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.149
 fingerprints here with this polar 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.780
 you have the possibility if it flows 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.850
 pushes a bit too while ejecting 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.359
 that the display will be cleaned immediately 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.840
 So great side effect next to the 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:34.250
 Of course Samsung Galaxy S3 is perfect 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.890
 is protected in here 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.070
 through this thick we are flowing in 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.200
 the next few weeks more 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.719
 Introduce adoption products under 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.969
 for the nexus 7 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.759
 definitely have a look here too 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.159

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.100
