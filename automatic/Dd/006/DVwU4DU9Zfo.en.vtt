00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
you do get into a situation where a base

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.480 
you do get into a situation where a base
is<00:01:16.080> under<00:01:16.259> heavy<00:01:16.470> attack<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.369> all

eventually lost it but I got a shitload
of<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.670> certs<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.659> ended<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:42.869> getting<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
of a certs I ended up getting I think I

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.480 
of a certs I ended up getting I think I
ended<00:01:44.790> up<00:01:44.880> grinding<00:01:45.390> about<00:01:45.659> 80<00:01:46.020> certs<00:01:46.590> 80<00:01:47.189> to

100<00:01:47.850> certs<00:01:48.090> last<00:01:48.420> night<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:49.380> doing<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.799> I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
100 certs last night just doing this I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.340 
100 certs last night just doing this I
was<00:01:50.040> listening<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.399> podcasts<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.240> from<00:01:52.229> what

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
was listening to podcasts and from what

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.510 
was listening to podcasts and from what
I<00:01:52.380> understand<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.009> completely<00:01:53.399> legal

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520

I understand this is completely legal
like<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:53.970> isn't<00:01:54.299> boosting<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.020> just

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
like this isn't boosting this is just

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.950 
like this isn't boosting this is just
like<00:01:56.310> repairing<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.060> gun<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.450> nobody<00:01:57.780> else

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
like repairing a gun and nobody else

had this happen like two or three times
at<00:02:11.340> two<00:02:11.459> or<00:02:11.550> three<00:02:11.730> different<00:02:11.879> bases<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:13.170> one

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
at two or three different bases this one

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.000 
at two or three different bases this one
was

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
was

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.679 
was
a<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.459> strong<00:02:14.700> example<00:02:15.239> because<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.569> was

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
a really strong example because I was

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.030 
a really strong example because I was
constantly<00:02:16.110> repairing<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.769> thing<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
constantly repairing the thing the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.649 
constantly repairing the thing the
second<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.430> get<00:02:17.489> into<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:17.909> I<00:02:17.970> just<00:02:18.000> get<00:02:18.239> blown<00:02:18.510> up

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
second I get into it I just get blown up

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.270 
second I get into it I just get blown up
like<00:02:19.230> you'll<00:02:19.470> see<00:02:19.650> her<00:02:19.739> in<00:02:19.829> a<00:02:19.920> second<00:02:20.189> I<00:02:20.220> think

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
like you'll see her in a second I think

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.050 
like you'll see her in a second I think
I<00:02:20.489> get<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:21.349> actually<00:02:22.610> sometimes<00:02:23.610> they<00:02:23.730> blow<00:02:23.849> me

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
I get in actually sometimes they blow me

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.250 
I get in actually sometimes they blow me
up<00:02:24.090> instantly<00:02:24.540> sometimes<00:02:24.959> they<00:02:25.110> don't

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
up instantly sometimes they don't

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.050 
up instantly sometimes they don't
occasionally<00:02:26.069> I'll<00:02:26.430> actually<00:02:26.579> get<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.879> few

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
occasionally I'll actually get a few

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.369 
occasionally I'll actually get a few
kills<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.629> I'll<00:02:27.689> catch<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.989> few<00:02:28.140> people

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379
