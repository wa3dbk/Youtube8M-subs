the owners of that building are twofold
in<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.560> short-term<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.190> bet<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.400> they

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
in the short-term and I bet you they

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:14.710 
in the short-term and I bet you they
thought<00:02:13.730> about<00:02:13.879> this<00:02:14.030> they're<00:02:14.269> going<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.599> be

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
their rent by 15 or even 18 percent thus

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.900 
their rent by 15 or even 18 percent thus
offsetting<00:02:25.160> some<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.459> damage<00:02:25.700> done<00:02:25.879> by
