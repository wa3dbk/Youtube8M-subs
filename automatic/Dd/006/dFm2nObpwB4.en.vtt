00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:07.359
 all 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:10.120
 there are two methods is the bath method 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.760
 Maria that is put in a pot we put a 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.890
 water then it 's super important that the 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.949
 bowl that will use lace 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.720
 perfect in the pot side we already have water 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.960
 at this moment we have water up here 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.030
 let's put the bowl the bain-marie is 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.520
 a technique that is used to 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.150
 control temperatures then let's 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.949
 control several things 1 size I'm going to 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.860
 split the chocolate before you start 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.210
 because that's going to make me melt 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.489
 much easier is more in touch 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.410
 with the heat the heat of a chocolate goes 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.059
 to help melt the other the other 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.280
 control the heat because I'm not going to 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.739
 warm up super strong let's go 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.780
 slowly melting we have another 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.559
 theme avoid water contact water 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.489
 super important we have the method that 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.489
 it's in the microwave 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.790
 we have to make sure before putting 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.790
 in my microwave 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.630
 to microwave power then to me 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.240
 I always like to start with a minute 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.070
 to make sure that the microwave does not 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.229
 have a temperature soon higher 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.150
 of which I need and here another tip 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.190
 For example, start with a little 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.890
 amount is another thing super important 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.960
 it's never refrigerated in chocolate over 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.729
 everything if they are going to melt it because 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.950
 take it out of the fridge there is a process of 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.570
 condensation that is going to bubble out 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.700
 of water are cut when you do not take things out 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.440
 from the fridge and that's going to interrupt us 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.540
 the theme of chocolate fluency 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.050
 then we already have this here we have the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.880
 hot water I have some spatulas 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.800
 with which I will also work 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.509
 then we control heat we control 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.330
 size and we're stirring 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.850
 constantly then here you can 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.679
 give account that starts on the walls to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.990
 melt the chocolate we can leave this 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.149
 spatula here because there is no other 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.820
 heat will not affect and the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.800
 microwave oven 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.800
 we start with a minute 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.320
 also then let's stir from that 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.060
 it depends that he himself goes 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.459
 incorporating in the microwave there is a 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.810
 important issue and it is not necessarily 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.970
 we have to remove until the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.250
 chocolate see liquid which is what 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.349
 we are used to that he does not put and not 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.060
 what the liquid and returns and puts it and not what 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.799
 the liquid and it returns puts you and the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.140
 chocolate has an exact temperature 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.120
 in which it merges in this case we have 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.280
 in the bathroom, marÃ­a semiamargo chocolate 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:32.090
 it's a darker chocolate 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:35.430
 they do not have any milk percentage 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.040
 Sugar is a little more bajita 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.099
 It depends a lot on the uses that go 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.730
 to give the temperatures the percentages 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.120
 of cocoa 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.150
 if they want for example for some 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.640
 preparations let's say chocolate or 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.310
 I personally like mousse a lot 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.439
 more semiamargo chocolate if I go to 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.659
 work things like for children by 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.340
 example I'm going with a white chocolate 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.079
 then you can see here at this time 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.480
 just come out look there's still 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.310
 trunks but if the new thing starts to give me 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.159
 account that is of retirement and spent a 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.019
 minute here I will incorporate with the 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.239
 heat of some I will continue stirring 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.310
 others realized that we did not receive 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.730
 until it was liquid 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.560
 we will be giving fluidity to the 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.019
 same residual heat from the others 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.329
 chocolates that we have and from here in 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.639
 go ahead for safety I'm going to go with 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.200
 20 seconds then we need a little 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.709
 more heat can put 20 seconds more 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.709
 Hello 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.220
 and we come back on this side we melt the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.220
 that we are mixing the one in the 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.040
 bain marie this is the one we have in the 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.989
 microwave look at this moment 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.480
 it starts to be a lot more liquid 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.590
 we still have there are a few bits with the 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.849
 movement temperature control 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.800
 we are making it more and more fluid and 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.220
 that's what we 're looking for that the 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.260
 chocolate 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.660
 look like in Christ when he is 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.630
 completely melted begins to have 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.960
 as 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.630
 one is screwed when it goes is falling 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.209
 so here we have the chocolate 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.820
 melted the microwave walt remove the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.709
 white chocolate that I also know is 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.660
 a little harder let's say now no 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:30.240
 have those cocoa solids 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.240
 It is more susceptible to heat 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.510
 so now I'm going to start mixing it 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.350
 against the edges of the bowl that they have 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.350
 still a heat 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.900
 here you can see then this is the 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.870
 way to remove chocolate control 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.840
 temperature control the size 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.840
 constantly stir and be far 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.600
 of water three different chocolates two 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.350
 different fusion techniques so that 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.580
 start with these lessons to apply 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.580
 chocolate in other presentations 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.380
 all right 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:25.110
 let's then show applications 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:27.110
 with the melted chocolate we have for 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.550
 here the strawberries that saw them right now 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.469
 We use the two chocolate chocolates 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.899
 white and milk chocolate and now 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:35.879
 let's put some samples but for 

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:38.009
 change the color that are white you 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:40.379
 let's put aniline to chocolate and 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.749
 that there is a super important issue and it is the 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:45.270
 salinas should be liposoluble is the 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:47.159
 way they are found in the 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.889
 stores where they are sold means 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:52.099
 which is to dilute it in oil because the 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.330
 chocolate is based on a vegetable fat 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:56.279
 then with the help of a stick 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.080
 teeth are going to catch a little bit of 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:00.330
 angelina are going to put on the 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.189
 chocolate and here we go with a 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.759
 spoon let's start stirring 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.899
 until he gives us the color we want 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.369
 a 

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:10.319
 angelina different chocolate 

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:12.990
 would begin to become dense because the 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:16.649
 would accept then we did here we have 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:19.969
 three colors I have a green light 

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:22.099
 we have a pink and a purple 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:26.529
 and let's play then with the ones I sent 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:26.529
 we both put only diagonally 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.850
 Y 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.000
 ah
