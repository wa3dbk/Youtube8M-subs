00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.640
 asparagus 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.870
 sorry to teach children and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.120
 girls to cultivate the habit of eating 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.280
 fruits and vegetables is not an easy task 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.470
 but it 's important for growth 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.540
 of them since these foods 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.240
 contain large amounts of 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.630
 vitamins and minerals children can 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.050
 start eating fruits after 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.810
 six months when the period ends 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.980
 of exclusive breastfeeding in the 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.630
 children of school age for example 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.630
 we talk about two to three portions of 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.890
 fruits in the day that can be three 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:50.900
 units an orange 2 tangerine a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.520
 banana two oranges a piece of watermelon 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.200
 that would be a green portion 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.370
 then we talk about three to four 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.160
 portions for school-age children 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.199
 for children under one year old we talk about 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.329
 a portion that can around that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.740
 can go around half a cup to 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:10.560
 that children of 6 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.500
 these foods need to be presented 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.780
 those in a creative and attractive way is 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.509
 say preparing fruits and vegetables 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.119
 of forms of caritas or animals 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.549
 you also have to see the example of the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.280
 parents introduce the fruits to 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.580
 kids in really attractive way about 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.060
 everything in children a little bigger than not 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.640
 does not the habit was not established 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.770
 in the first two years of life there 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.020
 we can ask the children to eat 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.810
 fruits and they do not come to us to do it 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.270
 it has to be part of our 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.429
 daily feeding the fruits and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.039
 vegetables besides being rich foods 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.440
 help to prevent diseases in the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.860
 boys and girls fruits and vegetables 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.880
 They are rich in vitamins and minerals that 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.799
 can help strengthen the system 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.310
 immune of children the vitamin gives 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.280
 example we know it more as its function 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.950
 for the eyes but vitaminada has a 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.020
 very important function in prevention 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.690
 of diseases 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.330
 whenever possible make him eat the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.610
 fruits and vegetables with the skin because 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.070
 when they peel they lose a lot of fibers and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.360
 nutrients and always remember to wash 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.870
 these foods should not have 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.870
 add salt or sugar that's why 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.350
 we recommend that the fruit be consumed and 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.830
 not only juices or fresh fruit 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.400
 because in general we add sugar 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.440
 that is not a healthy habit and something 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.920
 important that you have to mention also 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.560
 is hygienic care with fruits and 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.650
 vegetables that are consumed raw you have to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.920
 wash them well with soap and water if it is 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.680
 possible to have chlorinated water that can be 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.930
 prepare at home easily so that 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.990
 these foods that are so nutritious 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.790
 are not a vehicle of infection or 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.430
 disease 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.799
 to make it winter these foods 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.989
 they play a very important role in the 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.000
 correct feeding by helping 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.849
