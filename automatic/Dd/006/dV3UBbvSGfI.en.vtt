00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
stitch and so that is the stitch I'm

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.959 
stitch and so that is the stitch I'm
going<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.710> use<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:40.980> my<00:00:41.070> demonstrations<00:00:41.700> now

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
going to use for my demonstrations now

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.119 
going to use for my demonstrations now
before<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:42.989> get<00:00:43.110> started<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.590> shell<00:00:43.860> stitch

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
is abbreviated shell and that's

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.069 
is abbreviated shell and that's
important<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.770> know<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.100> pattern<00:00:47.399> reading

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
important to know for pattern reading

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.360 
important to know for pattern reading

place three more double crochets into

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.179 
place three more double crochets into
the<00:01:29.820> same<00:01:29.850> stitch<00:01:30.500> okay<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.560> yarn<00:01:31.890> over<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the same stitch okay so yarn over the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.760 
the same stitch okay so yarn over the
hook<00:01:32.570> enter<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> hook<00:01:33.810> into<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.170> same<00:01:34.409> stitch

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
hook enter the hook into the same stitch

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.719 
hook enter the hook into the same stitch
yarn<00:01:36.350> over<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.530> hook<00:01:37.560> again<00:01:37.770> pull<00:01:38.579> through

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
yarn over the hook again pull through

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.670 
yarn over the hook again pull through
the<00:01:38.820> stitch<00:01:39.200> yarn<00:01:40.200> over<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.470> hook<00:01:40.500> pull

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
the stitch yarn over the hook pull

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
the stitch yarn over the hook pull
through<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.250> first<00:01:41.280> two<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.000> then<00:01:42.450> yarn<00:01:42.689> over

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
through the first two and then yarn over

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.090 
through the first two and then yarn over
the<00:01:42.960> hook<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.259> pull<00:01:43.409> through<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> last<00:01:43.829> two

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the hook and pull through the last two

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.749 
the hook and pull through the last two
and<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.060> two<00:01:45.270> more<00:01:45.299> times

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.080 

so<00:01:52.759> there's<00:01:52.969> three<00:01:53.210> double<00:01:53.479> crochets<00:01:55.000> do<00:01:56.000> it

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
so there's three double crochets do it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.540 
so there's three double crochets do it
one<00:01:56.179> more<00:01:56.359> time

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.899 

you

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
you

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.589 
you
and<00:02:04.999> there's<00:02:05.810> your<00:02:05.960> fourth<00:02:06.289> double<00:02:06.590> crochet

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
and there's your fourth double crochet

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.059 
and there's your fourth double crochet
now<00:02:08.599> you<00:02:08.660> can<00:02:08.959> place<00:02:09.229> more<00:02:09.500> double<00:02:09.769> crochet

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
now you can place more double crochet

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.040 
now you can place more double crochet
stitches<00:02:10.369> into<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.940> same<00:02:11.150> stitch<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.780> create

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
stitches into the same stitch to create

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.170 
stitches into the same stitch to create
a<00:02:12.080> shell<00:02:12.379> but<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.190> typically<00:02:13.670> don't<00:02:13.910> want<00:02:14.090> to

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
a shell but you typically don't want to

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.940 
a shell but you typically don't want to
do<00:02:14.269> less<00:02:14.480> than<00:02:14.510> four<00:02:14.900> stitches<00:02:15.200> or<00:02:15.560> more<00:02:15.799> than

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
do less than four stitches or more than

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.100 
do less than four stitches or more than
ten<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.209> because<00:02:17.569> anything<00:02:17.900> less

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
ten and this is because anything less

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.110 
ten and this is because anything less
than<00:02:18.590> four<00:02:18.890> stitches<00:02:19.190> will<00:02:19.549> not<00:02:19.760> create<00:02:20.090> a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
than four stitches will not create a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.330 
than four stitches will not create a
shell<00:02:20.450> like<00:02:20.599> shape<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.290> anything<00:02:22.010> with<00:02:22.129> more

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
shell like shape and anything with more

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.690 
shell like shape and anything with more
than<00:02:22.489> ten<00:02:22.790> stitches<00:02:22.940> can<00:02:23.450> look<00:02:23.599> too<00:02:23.750> crowded

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
than ten stitches can look too crowded

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.160 
than ten stitches can look too crowded
okay<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:25.760> here's<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.120> picture<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.540> what<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.810> five

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
okay so here's a picture of what a five

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.140 
okay so here's a picture of what a five
double<00:02:27.620> crochet<00:02:27.980> shell<00:02:28.220> looks<00:02:28.489> like<00:02:28.760> and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
double crochet shell looks like and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.839 
double crochet shell looks like and
here's<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.170> picture<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.799> six<00:02:31.099> double<00:02:31.489> crochet

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
here's a picture of a six double crochet

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.839 
here's a picture of a six double crochet
shell<00:02:32.090> now<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.049> last<00:02:33.319> image<00:02:33.560> shows<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.310> 10

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
shell now this last image shows a 10

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.479 
shell now this last image shows a 10
double<00:02:35.209> crochet<00:02:35.239> shell<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:37.010> reason<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.370> am

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
double crochet shell and the reason I am

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.009 
double crochet shell and the reason I am
showing<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:37.790> these<00:02:38.000> different<00:02:38.390> pictures<00:02:38.780> is

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
showing you these different pictures is

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.300 
showing you these different pictures is
so<00:02:39.140> that<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.349> fully<00:02:39.590> understand<00:02:40.099> what<00:02:40.280> a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
so that you fully understand what a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.130 
so that you fully understand what a
shell<00:02:40.670> stitch<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.750> different

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
shell stitch is and the different

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.800 
shell stitch is and the different
variations<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:42.769> can<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:43.569> okay<00:02:44.569> so<00:02:44.599> the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
variations you can have okay so the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.300 
variations you can have okay so the
reason<00:02:45.079> this<00:02:45.170> stitch<00:02:45.410> is<00:02:45.440> called<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.010> shell

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
reason this stitch is called the shell

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.789 
reason this stitch is called the shell
is<00:02:46.549> simple<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.120> probably<00:02:47.569> obvious<00:02:48.049> and<00:02:48.379> I'm

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
is simple and probably obvious and I'm

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.410 
is simple and probably obvious and I'm
sure<00:02:48.980> you've<00:02:49.129> figured<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.519> out<00:02:49.640> already<00:02:49.849> the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
sure you've figured it out already the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.850 
sure you've figured it out already the
reason<00:02:50.720> it's<00:02:50.870> called<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.200> shell<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.590> because

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
reason it's called the shell is because

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.949 
reason it's called the shell is because
it's<00:02:52.010> shaped<00:02:52.190> like<00:02:52.370> one<00:02:52.670> now<00:02:53.569> I'm<00:02:53.690> sure<00:02:53.840> you

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
it's shaped like one now I'm sure you

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.630 
it's shaped like one now I'm sure you
probably<00:02:54.230> thought<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:54.620> tutorial<00:02:55.129> was<00:02:55.280> over

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
probably thought this tutorial was over

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.220 
probably thought this tutorial was over
but<00:02:56.000> there's<00:02:56.180> another<00:02:56.420> stitch<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:56.989> really

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
but there's another stitch that I really

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.960 
but there's another stitch that I really
want<00:02:57.379> to<00:02:57.440> talk<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.739> you<00:02:57.829> about<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.459> that

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
want to talk to you about and that

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.089 
want to talk to you about and that
stitch<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.269> called<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.660> fan<00:02:59.870> stitch<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.890> fan

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
stitch is called the fan stitch the fan

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.400 
stitch is called the fan stitch the fan
stitch<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.519> abbreviated<00:03:02.090> fan<00:03:02.329> and<00:03:03.079> again

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
stitch is abbreviated fan and again

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.660 
stitch is abbreviated fan and again
that's<00:03:03.560> important<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.069> know<00:03:04.160> for<00:03:04.340> pattern

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
that's important to know for pattern

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.849 
that's important to know for pattern
reading<00:03:04.970> now<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.019> reason<00:03:06.349> why<00:03:06.440> this<00:03:06.500> stitch

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
reading now the reason why this stitch

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.500 
reading now the reason why this stitch
is<00:03:07.010> important<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.489> know<00:03:07.640> is<00:03:07.819> because<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.269> fan

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
is important to know is because the fan

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.180 
is important to know is because the fan
stitch<00:03:08.810> is<00:03:08.959> very<00:03:09.200> closely<00:03:09.530> related<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.010> the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
stitch is very closely related to the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.129 
stitch is very closely related to the
shell<00:03:10.400> stitch<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.970> it's<00:03:11.540> so<00:03:11.720> closely<00:03:11.959> related

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
shell stitch and it's so closely related

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.020 
shell stitch and it's so closely related
that<00:03:12.650> many<00:03:12.829> people<00:03:13.040> actually<00:03:13.459> consider<00:03:13.849> the

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
that many people actually consider the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.759 
that many people actually consider the
fan<00:03:14.209> stitch<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.750> be<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.959> shell<00:03:15.230> stitch<00:03:15.440> and

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
fan stitch to be a shell stitch and

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.789 
fan stitch to be a shell stitch and
that's<00:03:16.400> totally<00:03:16.670> fine<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.750> reason<00:03:18.049> I<00:03:18.170> want<00:03:18.470> to

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
that's totally fine the reason I want to

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.409 
that's totally fine the reason I want to
show<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.190> fan<00:03:19.400> stitch<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.120> reason<00:03:20.329> I

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
show you the fan stitch and the reason I

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.030 
show you the fan stitch and the reason I
feel<00:03:20.569> it's<00:03:20.720> important<00:03:21.139> is<00:03:21.260> because<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.769> fan

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
feel it's important is because the fan

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.490 
feel it's important is because the fan
and<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.459> shell<00:03:22.760> can<00:03:23.389> and<00:03:23.690> have<00:03:23.900> both<00:03:24.290> been

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.159

stitch looks like now the fan stitch
also<00:05:12.200> has<00:05:12.590> several<00:05:12.980> variations<00:05:13.330> for<00:05:14.330> example

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
also has several variations for example

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.170 
also has several variations for example
the<00:05:14.960> fan<00:05:15.560> stitch<00:05:15.890> can<00:05:16.220> be<00:05:16.340> worked<00:05:16.550> with<00:05:16.820> three

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
the fan stitch can be worked with three

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.510 
the fan stitch can be worked with three
double<00:05:17.360> crochets<00:05:17.900> two<00:05:18.770> chains<00:05:19.130> and<00:05:19.400> then

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
double crochets two chains and then

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.040 
double crochets two chains and then
three<00:05:19.730> double<00:05:20.000> crochets<00:05:20.390> all<00:05:20.600> into<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.020> same

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
three double crochets all into the same

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.380 
three double crochets all into the same
stitch<00:05:21.560> or<00:05:22.400> it<00:05:22.490> can<00:05:22.640> also<00:05:22.760> be<00:05:22.970> worked<00:05:23.300> with

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
stitch or it can also be worked with

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.660 
stitch or it can also be worked with
four<00:05:23.720> double<00:05:23.870> crochets<00:05:24.440> two<00:05:24.920> chains<00:05:25.280> and<00:05:25.550> then

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670

four double crochets into the same

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.470 
four double crochets into the same
stitch<00:05:27.440> now<00:05:27.770> I've<00:05:28.400> also<00:05:28.580> seen<00:05:28.850> the<00:05:29.000> fan<00:05:29.180> stitch

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
stitch now I've also seen the fan stitch

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.090 
stitch now I've also seen the fan stitch
done<00:05:29.750> in<00:05:29.900> other<00:05:30.050> ways<00:05:30.170> but<00:05:30.710> again<00:05:30.950> it<00:05:31.070> just

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
done in other ways but again it just

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.030 
done in other ways but again it just
really<00:05:31.460> depends<00:05:31.820> on<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.090> pattern<00:05:32.890> so<00:05:33.890> the

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
really depends on the pattern so the

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.590 
really depends on the pattern so the
difference<00:05:34.370> between<00:05:34.430> the<00:05:34.850> shell<00:05:35.090> stitch<00:05:35.360> and

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
difference between the shell stitch and

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.230 
difference between the shell stitch and
the<00:05:35.660> fan<00:05:35.900> stitch<00:05:36.260> is<00:05:36.560> very<00:05:36.620> simple<00:05:37.340> the<00:05:37.970> shell

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
the fan stitch is very simple the shell

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.060 
the fan stitch is very simple the shell
stitch<00:05:38.480> has<00:05:38.690> no<00:05:38.900> splits<00:05:39.290> or<00:05:39.440> chains<00:05:39.740> in<00:05:39.980> the

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
stitch has no splits or chains in the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.850 
stitch has no splits or chains in the
stitch<00:05:40.340> and<00:05:40.640> the<00:05:40.790> fan<00:05:41.000> stitch<00:05:41.330> does<00:05:41.630> I<00:05:41.930> really

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
stitch and the fan stitch does I really

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.620 
stitch and the fan stitch does I really
hope<00:05:43.040> that<00:05:43.130> this<00:05:43.340> tutorial<00:05:43.550> made<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.390> shell

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
hope that this tutorial made the shell

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.810 
hope that this tutorial made the shell
stitch<00:05:44.900> more<00:05:45.170> clear<00:05:45.560> and<00:05:45.800> thank<00:05:46.400> you<00:05:46.490> so<00:05:46.640> much
