00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hey people what is going to be hot fitness 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.139
 here and look as bank press is 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.080
 announced 112 5 kilo six sets three 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.340
 repetitions and yes you are right 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.740
 is under 25 because I have to 75 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.449
 increased and I said yes that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.350
 it could possibly be scarce but 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.869
 As you can see I got through 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.029
 are still relatively good with two 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.649
 three times my ass bank is high from the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.210
 gone there, for example, not here 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.559
 I'm not sure but 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.570
 now, for example, at the third 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.190
 There is, for example, high in any case 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.230
 gone but she is the ass on the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.870
 stay bank but that is me now 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 First of all, no matter because there is now 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.840
 durchzubekommen this cycle 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.879
 After that I will definitely not 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.199
 can only increase by 75 kilos 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.059
 and I will not do that, though 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.860
 is definitely important with that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.210
 get through and there for example 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.210
 the ass stayed on the bench 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.670
 that is, sometimes that is 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.430
 Tick the man to fell three free 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.409
 brings and then just the ass 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.570
 and high pressure should of course not 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.340
 so be here from the view 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.020
 that indeed have people that want 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.549
 I'll bring in other perspectives 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.320
 Well here you can of course now 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.680
 not as seen here, it looks like as 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.759
 the ass will go up but behind 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.350
 you can see it is still such a piece 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.900
 black and these are my two 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.479
 bake your cheeks up 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.320
 the bank 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.450
 look at a few different ones here 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.970
 perspectives so you can watch six 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.650
 put three repetitions 112 5 last 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.479
 showed it was 5 x 2 with 112 5 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.979
 and why does that work at the moment? 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.149
 good with me, why am I so upset 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.290
 quick and easy gravel this technique 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.640
 I have so much now 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.210
 experimented by the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.790
 shoulder injury too and have a lot 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.540
 try with let activation and active 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.790
 to press rhine 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.799
 and someday all of a sudden before two 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.990
 months or so or before one and a half 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.060
 months that was the technique it was 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.220
 I only had six weeks, really 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.119
 suddenly had this activation 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.290
 me that suddenly 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.030
 Intuitive in it that the lecturer and it was 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.500
 From the chest at once so easy 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.870
 yes that means suddenly against the weight 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.440
 high down without me on it 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.840
 I've used your muscles 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.250
 times so electrically already is 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.200
 a very effective methods and 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.340
 Because of that is with me also in me 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.709
 moment with the bank I did not have 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.180
 expected next week 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.910
 are 120 five times 217.5 was the other day 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.660
 times maximum weight two months ago 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.299
 two months 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.190
 and now I make 2.5 kilos more 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.450
 five sentences always two repetitions what 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.120
 is there or for example here 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.519
 100 that's 100 kilos and great 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.560
 by the times how often I press the 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.970
 Many think so even if I am here now 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.099
 For example, only five repetitions with 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.790
 100 makes me only 100 kilo five times 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.769
 can press 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.690
 but even after seven sentences bank 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.420
 I would press the 100 more 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.760
 nine times now and they 're down 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.470
 with break this pauses yes it is 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.989
 Now not a touch and go Switzerland 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.220
 with tango I know even more and 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.650
 I probably also regenerated 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.209
 Remember, that means when you see me here 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.200
 Five repetitions make that happen 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.790
 does not mean that I only have five 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.160
 I can train repetitions 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.599
 not to the muscle never fail 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.169
 otherwise i could not do my training 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.660
 pull through 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:29.849
 I never kick I never train to 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.849
 also fail the 180 in the bow 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.389
 the x 3 i could probably 180 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.049
 won it five or six times when I got it 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.709
 I probably challenge six 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.620
 Do not know 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.019
 yes, probably six times and really 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.690
 yes my training is not based on 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.629
 this springs testing method but 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.799
 emphasize on straif building that is 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.359
 I do not want to destroy me 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.629
 would not have to prove anything but me 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.190
 I want to bring new stimuli to my body 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.879
 yes, but it can still regenerate 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.609
 yes that does not totally destroy and 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:05.459
 so 109 repeat age after 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.799
 seven sets were in there as running 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.510
 just good at the moment next month 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.269
 schori I raise you to everyone 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.769
 know and then we'll see you in the 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.500
 next video my friends short 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:21.079
 update until then 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.079
 sweep video parts makes it good
