00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
that is not because I don't think that

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.389

getting us towards our goals would be

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.299 
getting us towards our goals would be
having<00:00:35.960> workers<00:00:36.380> get<00:00:36.590> paid<00:00:36.620> living<00:00:37.100> wages

that our place the call for a boycott

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.080 
that our place the call for a boycott
should<00:00:49.100> come<00:00:49.340> from<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.550> workers<00:00:49.910> themselves

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
should come from the workers themselves

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.510 
should come from the workers themselves
so<00:00:50.930> we're<00:00:51.200> working<00:00:51.410> with<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:51.920> workers<00:00:52.250> on<00:00:52.399> the

to educate and empower them organize

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.910 
to educate and empower them organize
them<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.789> eventually<00:00:59.629> call<00:01:00.050> for<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.379> boycott<00:01:00.620> of

them to eventually call for a boycott of
Nike<00:01:01.160> products<00:01:01.640> because<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:02.690> consumer<00:01:03.440> boycott

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
Nike products because a consumer boycott

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.459 
Nike products because a consumer boycott
would<00:01:04.339> be<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.299> most<00:01:05.570> effective<00:01:06.049> means<00:01:06.229> of

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:06.469 
would be the most effective means of

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:08.459 
would be the most effective means of
breaking<00:01:06.740> Nikes<00:01:07.250> back<00:01:07.460> on<00:01:07.700> these<00:01:07.819> issues<00:01:07.999> I

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
breaking Nikes back on these issues I

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.800 
breaking Nikes back on these issues I
don't<00:01:09.469> think<00:01:09.859> that<00:01:10.729> when<00:01:11.119> people<00:01:11.600> ask<00:01:11.719> the

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
don't think that when people ask the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.510 
don't think that when people ask the
questionable<00:01:12.259> if<00:01:12.529> we<00:01:12.679> boycott<00:01:13.009> the<00:01:13.100> products

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
questionable if we boycott the products

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.709 
questionable if we boycott the products
but<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:13.969> know<00:01:14.029> mark<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.329> workers<00:01:14.600> gonna

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
but you know mark the workers gonna

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.139 
but you know mark the workers gonna
suffer<00:01:15.109> horribly<00:01:15.439> I<00:01:15.709> don't<00:01:16.579> think<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:16.999> would

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
suffer horribly I don't think that would

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.019 
suffer horribly I don't think that would
be<00:01:17.179> the<00:01:17.359> reality<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.170> reason<00:01:18.499> being<00:01:18.679> that

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:19.029 
be the reality the reason being that

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:21.969 
be the reality the reason being that
Nike<00:01:20.029> is<00:01:20.090> very<00:01:20.539> sensitive<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.679> amount<00:01:21.920> of

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
Nike is very sensitive to the amount of

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.800 
Nike is very sensitive to the amount of
money<00:01:22.099> they<00:01:22.369> make<00:01:22.579> that<00:01:22.939> is<00:01:23.179> ultimately<00:01:23.719> what

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
money they make that is ultimately what

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.859 
money they make that is ultimately what
Nike<00:01:24.049> cares<00:01:24.409> about<00:01:24.709> profits<00:01:25.609> so<00:01:26.240> we<00:01:26.689> would

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
Nike cares about profits so we would

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.800 
Nike cares about profits so we would
only<00:01:27.020> need<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.649> put<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.950> very<00:01:28.369> small<00:01:28.639> dent<00:01:29.539> in

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
only need to put a very small dent in

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.559 
only need to put a very small dent in
Nikes<00:01:30.409> products<00:01:31.249> to<00:01:31.759> get<00:01:32.060> them<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.389> pay

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
Nikes products to get them to pay

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.539 
Nikes products to get them to pay
attention<00:01:32.599> to<00:01:33.439> these<00:01:33.560> worker<00:01:33.950> rights<00:01:34.189> issues

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
attention to these worker rights issues

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.629 
attention to these worker rights issues
in<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:34.880> very<00:01:35.090> serious<00:01:35.479> way<00:01:35.779> so<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.340> know<00:01:37.429> that

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:37.639 
in a very serious way so you know that

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.749 
in a very serious way so you know that
small<00:01:38.149> debt<00:01:38.509> would<00:01:38.959> not<00:01:39.259> cause<00:01:39.619> this<00:01:40.009> massive

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
small debt would not cause this massive

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.120 
small debt would not cause this massive
slowdown<00:01:41.419> in<00:01:41.659> global<00:01:41.810> production<00:01:42.349> that<00:01:43.009> would

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
slowdown in global production that would

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.279 
slowdown in global production that would
put<00:01:43.310> millions<00:01:43.639> of<00:01:44.029> workers<00:01:44.240> out<00:01:44.569> of<00:01:44.599> work<00:01:44.719> it's

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
put millions of workers out of work it's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.109 
put millions of workers out of work it's
simply<00:01:45.740> not<00:01:45.919> going<00:01:46.609> to<00:01:46.700> happen<00:01:46.849> so<00:01:48.999> what<00:01:49.999> do<00:01:50.060> we

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
simply not going to happen so what do we

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:50.800 
simply not going to happen so what do we
do<00:01:50.270> right<00:01:50.299> now

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
do right now
