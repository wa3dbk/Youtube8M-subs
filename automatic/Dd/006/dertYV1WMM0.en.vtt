00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:06.030
 windows 7 starter is not for 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:08.970

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.880
 here it's different from mine 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.790
 but the same as the download 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.930

 Are you seeing all the images? 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.730
 This is how your windows do not have 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:24.959

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:28.550

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.280
 psychosis can choose 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:55.140
 there you choose what you will change if 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:05.269
