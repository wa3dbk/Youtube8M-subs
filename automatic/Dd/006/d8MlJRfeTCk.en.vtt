education spending but the president

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.580 
education spending but the president
refused<00:03:58.070> to<00:03:58.220> compromise<00:03:58.750> at<00:03:59.750> that<00:03:59.990> point<00:04:00.350> I

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
refused to compromise at that point I

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.850 
refused to compromise at that point I
said<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.100> myself<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.930> president<00:04:03.440> gets<00:04:03.650> it

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
said to myself the president gets it

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.130 
said to myself the president gets it
because<00:04:04.340> in<00:04:04.640> politics<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:05.630> really<00:04:05.900> do<00:04:06.020> have

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
because in politics you really do have

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.250 
because in politics you really do have
to<00:04:06.200> draw<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.530> lie<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:07.430> at<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.090> point<00:04:08.390> he

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
to draw a lie and at that point he

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.540 
to draw a lie and at that point he
understood<00:04:09.710> that<00:04:09.920> he<00:04:09.980> had<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.220> draw<00:04:10.430> a<00:04:10.460> line

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
understood that he had to draw a line

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.060 
understood that he had to draw a line
and<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.720> think<00:04:11.930> it<00:04:12.080> was<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.410> turning<00:04:12.770> point<00:04:12.950> in

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
and I think it was a turning point in

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.990 
and I think it was a turning point in
the<00:04:13.160> presidency<00:04:14.080> Clinton's<00:04:15.080> risk<00:04:15.380> paid<00:04:15.860> off
