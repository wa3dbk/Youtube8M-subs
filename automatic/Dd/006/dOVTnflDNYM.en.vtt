00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.850
 April here 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:49.379
 Then you'll do what I know to be a 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:56.219
 so that you can see that she is 10 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:01:02.219
 install a point 2 by type mode and 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:08.810
 of the class nihei cans was a template out there 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.810
 I thought I knew I read wrong 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.229
 warm up with him 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:31.090
 I already found some of them here and I talked to them 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.400
 talk for example I'm going to invent week that is 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.460
 the motto for those who like to rock the 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.690
 things not invented in some videos 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:48.850
 here showing the black system 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:52.020
 hence for example the mote is pre requisites 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:02:02.470
 you need to have at least the module or 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:04.540
 fml installed that zip ford 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.840
 the point is that I downloaded complexes here 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:14.470
 It's here in the middle I know I 'm very 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:16.330
 more ready ready here I hope to have a 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:26.019
 person he will calculate his highest 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:28.959
 craft minecraft population manager case 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:33.459
 the court is not done with the vector 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.890
 Just wait a little 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.790
 It does not take long, it can not be there. 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.320
 seemed ready should be lot will 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.670
 point who the backup is 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.350
 I recommend even putting a backup 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.299
 it will take a little longer because 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.700
 will have to make up the backup 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.670
 I'll leave here it will be a little bit not 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.209
 take too long, I'll show you 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.790
 I'll wait so I'll wait. 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:07.840

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:11.489

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.380
 his channel will install a description 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.640
 If you had said that, you could 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:24.900
 sued by another monk for a year 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.900
 message well or induces 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.040
 file compression can still 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.370
 to look for other ways and 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.370
 mold cool right here since 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:42.200

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:57.310
 only gives 1.4.2 of strawberries and backup and I 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:12.710
 I found the boys moby potato I found 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:15.230
 this was delaying the backup 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.470
 It's so time-consuming, yes, I take it so. 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.470
 on here 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.340
 he is fast I do not know why he was wondering if 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:30.770
 It's taking so long because I'm recording a 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:42.380
 recipe well well well well slower in a 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:57.140

00:04:42.380 --> 00:05:00.380

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.200

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:07.340
 down so that the mold is light carry 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.419
 This betray the mod will tell you is 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.900

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.700

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.919

 a lot of people looking for it is not easy 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:29.360
 appears promptly the module has been installed 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:31.370
 that is why before closing the deal 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.770
 line confirm that mark will open 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.360

 while watching twitter twitter tweets 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:55.039
