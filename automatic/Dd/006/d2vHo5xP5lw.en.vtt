00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:15.670
 Sanitation control of facilities is also important in soft drink production 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:20.440
 This is an overview of the existing facilities of the soft drink factory 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:25.200
 Tank piping to various facilities that produce potable water 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.200
 Equipment such as machinery is arranged 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:34.940
 Contamination of foreign matter in hygiene control of facilities and equipment 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:43.579
 Movement of human beings and things such as microbial pollution crosses and causes 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:47.870
 A way is taken to make the work area deeper by pressing the marshy key to prevent cross takeover 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.140
 This is called zoning 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.820
 Working area 9 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:59.070
 Working area in politics Semi- normal working area 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:06.140
 It is divided like a general work area 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.140
 This will manage station management create and manage installation requirements management requirements table 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:27.690
 The most basic task in hygiene management of plant facilities is the battlefield 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:29.900
 The idea and action of always cleaning the machine and keeping the sexual emotion become the second nature 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:36.310
 Must be 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:39.369
 Hate There is cip cleaning wash on the battlefield and automatically battlefield 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.430
 The battlefield steps are the same 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.430
 cip Let's take a look at the washing steps on the battlefield 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.730
 After which produced the work after the end promptly component 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:57.000
 Wash with warm water 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:02:02.320
 It is further washed with detergent and rinsed with warm water 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.960
 The battlefield needs to fully understand the nature of 8 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:12.250
 You also need to select the cleaning agent according to the application 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.910
 We use properly depending on the machinery 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:22.080
 Increase the temperature of sterilizer after cip washing 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.080
 This message water sterilization in the normal contact 90 degrees or more 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.700
 Hmm 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:40.270
 Check if the last important work done on the boat was completely washable 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:49.390
 In other words , the evaluation of the effectiveness of the battlefield 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:51.990
 When the cleaning is completed by evaluating its effectiveness by physical, chemical and sensory methods 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.990
 I can say that 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:07.060
 It is produced by equipment device a wide range of 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:13.690
 In fact, maintenance inspection is essential to keep the soft drink hygienic 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:20.760
 It is very important in maintenance activities to detect and treat daily chopped abnormalities. 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.760
 If these occur frequently, you know where you need the circuit . 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:31.080
 Although this is an example of Heather not think 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:33.660
 Specifically, for each facility equipment to be targeted in management 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:39.000
 Maintenance standard table 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:43.820
 Create a set of inspection standard table maintenance cards 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.820
 So that you can see at any time anyone 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:56.190
 Specific contents must be described in these 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.190
 Always assess the effectiveness of the morning 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:06.600
 Manufactured through many facilities and equipment from raw materials to products 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:13.690
 Soft drink 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:21.510
 In order to provide a safe and safe drink that the consumer can feel at ease 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:21.510
 High hygiene awareness of each and every person involved in manufacturing is required
