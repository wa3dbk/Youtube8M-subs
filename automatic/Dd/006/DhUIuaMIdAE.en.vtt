00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.460
 if garcía of meteorological service 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.020
 relational continues to report on the 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.180
 presence of systems to doctors 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.890
 that are dominating most of the 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.080
 Mexican Republic at this time 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.420
 we still have the unstable area there 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.150
 in the south of the gulf of mexico has a 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.699
 60% of potential to generate a new 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.480
 tropical cyclone in that region generates 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.660
 enough cloudiness 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.980
 part of the southeast part of the east and 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.140
 virtually the state of the cross 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.110
 cloudy with rainfall that can 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.520
 become strong and intense 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.770
 of course the wind starts to have 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.750
 the important presence in all that 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.940
 region the swell on the axis just like 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.559
 two to four meters high in all 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.410
 this area is an unstable area 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.809
 very important with 60 percent of 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.030
 ability to generate a new cyclone 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.550
 tropical as a virus of the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.010
 tropical storm manuel there in the 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.149
 north of the pacific littoral 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.460
 strictly in what is the area 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.800
 border of durango chihuahua and sinaloa 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.119
 there is 50 of the system but it is a 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.830
 tropical storm that continues to lose 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.440
 intensity but it also continues 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.660
 providing enough moisture and cloudiness 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.360
 zacatecas a durango coahuila and chihuahua 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.250
 south of sound and not to say sinaloa 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.110
 we will also expect rainfall of 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.170
 strong to intense throughout that region 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.630
 on the part of the tropical storm Manuel 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.240
 that continues to lose intensity in this 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.030
 region of the Mexican republic for another 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.190
 side we have the arrival of humidity to the south 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.050
 to the west to the center of the country humidity 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.370
 also from the gulf of mexico to the north 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.170
 republic and we would continue with 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.760
 precipitation in most of the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.710
 territory that can become of 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.590
 strong to very strong while the 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.930
 temperatures look at you from temperatures 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.940
 elevated from 37 to 39 and tables until 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.760
 40 degrees at some point like it can be 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.410
 altar can be chosen new lion or san 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.380
 felipe and in baja california temperatures 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.540
 very high some rainfall that 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.990
 we already said in what they are now very 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.970
 strengths in intense sinaloa from 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.980
 all this moisture overflow from 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.200
 the tropical storm while in the 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.760
 peaceful medium with temperatures that already 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.970
 begin to have values ​​a little more 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.140
 pleasant from 31 to 33 degrees the sky of 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.840
 Partly cloudy to cloudy with rains 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.400
 strong to very strong in the south south 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.290
 of the Pacific littoral also with 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.580
 pleasant temperatures from 21 to 32 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.840
 degrees the sky 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.270
 again half cloudy to cloudy 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.310
 precipitation also from strong to 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.990
 intense warrior in guajaca and the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.900
 State of Chiapas in the peninsula 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.850
 Yucatan where this system of 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.790
 good instability we keep getting 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.720
 humidity of what is the Caribbean Sea 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.730
 rainfall in what is Campeche 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.710
 yucatán quintana roo from strong to very 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.020
 strong and temperatures of 29 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.270
 32 degrees celsius the coastline of the gulf 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.890
 of mexico that is currently seen in his 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.140
 southern region dominated by this area 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.820
 unstable we will wait for precipitation 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.890
 of course first the cloudy ones the 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.810
 abundant rainfall can arrive 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.450
 to be intense in everything that is the 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.310
 shoreline of the mexico Gulf with 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.410
 temperatures that can reach 34 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.940
 degrees is the order that receives moisture 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.680
 both the Pacific and the Gulf of 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.270
 mexico a sky half cloudy to cloudy 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.740
 Precipitation from strong to very strong 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.460
 and the temperatures of warm to 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.590
 hot the center in the center does not 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.990
 removes temperate temperatures from the line 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.520
 to warm the sky half cloudy to 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.620
 cloudy precipitations also of 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.210
 strong to very strong and in the capital of 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.930
 the Mexican Republic we will wait for this 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.820
 Friday Friday Saturday and Sunday 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.590
 again with humidity medium sky 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.330
 cloudy to cloudy precipitations of 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.450
 moderate to strong temperatures of 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.750
 22 to 23 maybe there are the 24 degrees of 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.540
 maximum temperature of the minimum you see 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.430
 10 to 12 degrees Celsius for the capital 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.080
 of the Mexican republic of the most 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.730
 important that we have to you from the 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.730
