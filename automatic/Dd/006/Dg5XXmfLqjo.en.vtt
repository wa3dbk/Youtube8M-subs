Congress's fault interest rates we go

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.850 
Congress's fault interest rates we go
five<00:02:36.090> ten<00:02:36.420> fifteen<00:02:36.900> or<00:02:37.050> twenty<00:02:37.260> percent<00:02:37.590> and

all be solved with a gold standard I'm
just<00:03:14.310> asking<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.790> these<00:03:14.940> questions<00:03:15.000> because

significance of the ron paul gold back

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.390 
significance of the ron paul gold back
dollar<00:03:22.110> that's<00:03:22.380> why<00:03:22.560> i<00:03:22.590> think<00:03:22.739> it's<00:03:22.920> important

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
dollar that's why i think it's important

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.430 
dollar that's why i think it's important
for<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:23.610> articulate<00:03:24.269> this<00:03:24.450> stuff<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.230> it

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
for you to articulate this stuff so it

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.979 
for you to articulate this stuff so it
just<00:03:25.470> saying<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.160> congressman<00:03:26.760> rates<00:03:27.570> would

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
just saying is congressman rates would

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.110 
just saying is congressman rates would
shoot<00:03:28.410> up<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:29.340> would<00:03:29.550> damage<00:03:29.760> the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
shoot up and that would damage the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.600 
shoot up and that would damage the
economy<00:03:30.390> right<00:03:30.870> away<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.500> we<00:03:31.530> wouldn't<00:03:32.400> live

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
economy right away and we wouldn't live

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.699 
economy right away and we wouldn't live
on<00:03:32.850> borrowed<00:03:33.150> time<00:03:33.300> we<00:03:34.019> wouldn't<00:03:34.290> be<00:03:34.380> able<00:03:34.530> to

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
on borrowed time we wouldn't be able to

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.560 
on borrowed time we wouldn't be able to
have<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.040> Fed<00:03:35.280> manipulate<00:03:35.940> interest<00:03:36.330> rates

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
have the Fed manipulate interest rates

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.390 
have the Fed manipulate interest rates
and<00:03:36.690> we<00:03:37.140> would<00:03:37.320> therefore<00:03:37.500> pay<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.190> piper

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
and we would therefore pay the piper

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.550 
and we would therefore pay the piper
right<00:03:38.910> away<00:03:39.239> in<00:03:39.480> other<00:03:39.630> words<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.989> discipline

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
right away in other words the discipline

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.180 
right away in other words the discipline
would<00:03:40.680> be<00:03:40.860> fast<00:03:41.250> acting<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.450> fair<00:03:43.190> yeah

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
would be fast acting is that fair yeah

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.890 
would be fast acting is that fair yeah
that<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.790> true<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.180> correction<00:03:45.600> would<00:03:45.720> come

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
that is true the correction would come

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.140 
that is true the correction would come
more<00:03:46.140> quickly<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.769> would<00:03:46.920> be<00:03:47.100> deeper<00:03:47.700> but

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
more quickly and it would be deeper but

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.270 
more quickly and it would be deeper but
it<00:03:48.239> would<00:03:48.360> help<00:03:48.510> some<00:03:48.870> people<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.709> know<00:03:49.830> if<00:03:50.130> we

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
it would help some people you know if we

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.100 
it would help some people you know if we
did<00:03:50.430> this<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.700> quit<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.150> spending<00:03:51.660> taxes

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
did this and quit the spending taxes

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.690 
did this and quit the spending taxes
would<00:03:52.260> go<00:03:52.410> down<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.800> know<00:03:52.980> my<00:03:53.310> goal<00:03:53.489> would<00:03:53.640> be

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
would go down you know my goal would be

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.310 
would go down you know my goal would be
to<00:03:53.790> get<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.150> tax<00:03:54.330> it's<00:03:54.510> very<00:03:54.750> very<00:03:54.930> low<00:03:55.110> so

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
to get the tax it's very very low so

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.630 
to get the tax it's very very low so
that's<00:03:55.530> not<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.450> punishment<00:03:57.450> so<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:59.280> the

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
that's not a a punishment so the the

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.790 
that's not a a punishment so the the
correction<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.840> correction<00:04:01.290> would<00:04:01.440> come<00:04:01.650> but

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
correction the correction would come but

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.710 
correction the correction would come but
you'd<00:04:01.980> have<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.400> change<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.850> spending<00:04:03.300> habits

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
you'd have to change the spending habits

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.170 
you'd have to change the spending habits
and<00:04:03.930> who<00:04:04.830> else<00:04:05.040> would<00:04:05.250> benefit<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:06.000> people

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
and who else would benefit the people

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.270 
and who else would benefit the people
that<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.630> Bernanke's<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.769> Greens<00:04:08.010> fans

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
that the Bernanke's and the Greens fans

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.430 
that the Bernanke's and the Greens fans
never<00:04:08.550> cared<00:04:08.880> about<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.239> that's<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.870> savers

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
never cared about and that's the savers

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.930 
never cared about and that's the savers
people<00:04:10.980> are<00:04:11.040> supposed<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.400> save<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.820> be

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
people are supposed to save and be

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.910 
people are supposed to save and be
responsible<00:04:12.540> but<00:04:12.959> there's<00:04:13.170> no<00:04:13.320> incentive<00:04:13.709> to

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
responsible but there's no incentive to

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.860 
responsible but there's no incentive to
so<00:04:14.250> savers<00:04:14.700> might<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.390> know<00:04:15.510> instead<00:04:15.660> of

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
so savers might you know instead of

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.599 
so savers might you know instead of
making<00:04:16.109> one<00:04:16.320> or<00:04:16.470> two<00:04:16.680> percent<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.280> take<00:04:17.430> care
