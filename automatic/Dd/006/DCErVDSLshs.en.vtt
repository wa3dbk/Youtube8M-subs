is<00:01:35.189> easy<00:01:35.549> too<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:37.040> mean<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.130> don't<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.520> about

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
is easy too I mean I don't like about

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.399 
is easy too I mean I don't like about
this<00:01:38.939> case<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.570> doesn't<00:01:39.840> lay<00:01:39.990> flat

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
this case is that it doesn't lay flat

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.050 
this case is that it doesn't lay flat
and<00:01:40.649> when<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.159> doesn't<00:01:41.310> lay<00:01:41.520> flat<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.909> always

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and when it doesn't lay flat that always

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.850 
and when it doesn't lay flat that always
means<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.540> dirt<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.259> stuff<00:01:43.560> could<00:01:43.740> get

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
means that dirt or stuff could get

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.649 
means that dirt or stuff could get
underneath<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.340> case<00:01:44.549> even<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.180> really<00:01:45.479> like

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
underneath the case even I really like

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.389 
underneath the case even I really like
about<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.140> case<00:01:46.469> is<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.040> has<00:01:47.219> this

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
about this case is that it has this

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.160 
about this case is that it has this
material<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.329> front<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.899> little

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
material on the front of this little

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200 
material on the front of this little
cover<00:01:49.380> here<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.430> very<00:01:50.490> grippy<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
cover here and it is very grippy you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.030 
cover here and it is very grippy you
simply<00:01:51.509> put<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.869> back<00:01:52.110> underneath<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.710> flap

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
simply put that back underneath the flap

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.160 
simply put that back underneath the flap
as<00:01:53.280> you'll<00:01:53.700> see<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.210> clip<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.840> you'll

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
as you'll see here in a clip and you'll

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.959 
as you'll see here in a clip and you'll
be<00:01:55.320> able<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:55.829> hold<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.789> at<00:01:56.880> this

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
be able to like hold it and it's at this

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.490 
be able to like hold it and it's at this
so<00:01:57.149> grippy<00:01:57.539> it's<00:01:57.689> not<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> fall<00:01:58.170> out<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
so grippy it's not going to fall out and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.760 
so grippy it's not going to fall out and
it's<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.770> really<00:01:58.950> nice<00:02:00.289> on<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.439> front<00:02:01.680> of

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it's just really nice on the front of

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.200 
it's just really nice on the front of
the<00:02:01.860> case<00:02:02.039> it<00:02:02.280> also<00:02:02.340> has<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.759> really<00:02:02.969> nice

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the case it also has this really nice

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.819 
the case it also has this really nice
material<00:02:03.689> i'm<00:02:04.020> pretty<00:02:04.259> sure<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.619> leather

material i'm pretty sure it's a leather
but<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.219> doesn't<00:02:05.520> what<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.119> looks<00:02:06.299> like

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360

but it doesn't what kind of looks like
leather<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.960> doesn't<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.259> feel<00:02:07.380> like

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590
