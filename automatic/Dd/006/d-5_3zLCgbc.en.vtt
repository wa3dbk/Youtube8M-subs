00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.050
 the figurehead of mitsubishi the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.050
 new evolution 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.300
 nice especially if you have the car 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.970
 It's a car for people who are electric 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.950
 fun driving have so for those 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.730
 He says I only need a car 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.730
 needs four liters 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.360
 but you have to be careful because it is 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.090
 always quickly endangered in the fine 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.770
 Zone 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.960
 Even better would be jürgen klopp with 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.560
 the most prestigious mitsubishi car 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.910
 on road 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.280
 the new evolution a turbo with 295 hp 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.700
 a smart all-wheel drive and 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.230
 a torque of 366 newton meters the 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.650
 power turns on the leisetreter 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.650
 pleasurable object 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.480
 a sprint value of 5 seconds and a 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.340
 top speed of 240 km / h ham for 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.300
 A Japanese mid-size sedan 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.130
 already impression 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.410
 no less impressive 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.120
 four-wheel drive this sorts the power 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.130
 not only variable between front and 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.810
 rear axle but layers 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.979
 fast curve drive in the rear also still 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.979
 from the inside to the outside 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.940
 Similar to the new bmw x6 this will be the 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.570
 moment so distributed that the mensa 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.790
 almost by itself to fix the curves 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.229
 It is a car with three different ones 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.030
 or ultimately with 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.830
 six different driving behavior 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.720
 I've got something on the one hand the 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.520
 normal mode where I am normal on the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.810
 The road can roll quite comfortably 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.910
 Can the kids in the back with them 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.490
 Just wrap it up because I have isofix points 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.260
 to decorate children then can 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.950
 I have the sport mode in there you have 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.060
 then maybe always the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.590
 Mother-in-law with it because yes 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.030
 could be dizzy and maybe 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.350
 I have the super sport mode where is 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.210
 Of course, then properly drained 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.910
 that is the area where the 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.770
 motorsport starts right 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.320
 the design divorces at the level 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.450
 the ghosts evil eye and huge grill 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.610
 has the civilian lancer clearly on 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.709
 the evolution is won with stature 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.870
 his wide-open jet fighter 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.570
 grill of the rugged bonnet 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.700
 completely the father of his opponents 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.880
 proud of the two tailpipes and above all 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.130
 his wide rear spoiler shows and the 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.480
 polarized for the one cult for the 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.560
 He is simply one to others 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.560
 sweeping beer counter 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.840
 at that time the rear spoiler the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:44.010
 breakfast tray looks okay 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:47.440
 maybe a bit adolescent 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.920
 I would like to say polic aerodynamics fits 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.870
 Of course, of course, but documented 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.120
 Of course 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.980
 here comes what potentes but find 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.330
 actually , his looks 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.080
 athletic claim accordingly 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.080
 really good 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.080
 Driving in the evo is now easy and 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.670
 though through the security systems abs 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.909
 electronic stability control 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.430
 asc and of course by the four-wheel 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.470
 technology super oréal control 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.330
 It will be almost unchanged even at the 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.610
 rallye dakar and wrc rally 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.580
 world championship speak the 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.840
 Rally technology ensures safe driving 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.730
 for an even better traction 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.980
 achieve coordinated four-wheel drive 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.440
 three main systems 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.000
 the four-wheel system works more or 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.349
 less with three differentials with the 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.110
 on the previous day differential mid-differential 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.709
 and the alpsee differential on the 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.569
 hinterachse 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.400
 all three differentials ran 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.650
 corresponding value because the control unit 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.230
 and there is electronically the whole 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.500
 linked and become a perfect one 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.540
 result in mitsubishi den 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.430
 Supersportler also as a family car 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.190
 The interior has to sell 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.349
 the positive way changed again 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.780
 can increase the driving pleasure with the 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.140
 first double clutch from japan for 2000 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.140
 euro surcharge 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.550
 as usual for mitsubishi is the 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.880
 standard equipment very extensive 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.250
 The basic price of the ewo is scarce 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.010
 46,000 euros also with recaro seat of the 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:23.440
 fully equipped evolution mr costs 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.440
 proud 53 1850 euro 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.390
 who wants to be physically fit 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.340
 this only when the electronics are switched off 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.280
 But the plus of technology screws that 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.720
 weight at 1600 kilograms and drives 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.150
 the fuel consumption with sporty 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.150
 driving up to 16 liters upwards 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.790
 Conclusion of the evo is the driving machine in 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.890
 pure culture 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.070
 Mitsubishi wants to get away from the whine 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.020
 image around with m3 or s4 in a league 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.120
 could play the interior 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.250
 even better quality when it comes to 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.880
 the driving fun is there is the evo 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.880
 true champion
