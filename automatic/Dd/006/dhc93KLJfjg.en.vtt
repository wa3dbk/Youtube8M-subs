00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:23.033
Just wanted a life free and easy

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
In a small town I found some relief

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:35.367
But I was so wrong, you can bet on that

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.267
Broke up with the flow and took off in a jet

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:49.600
‘Cause life was too simple. I had to add some spice.

00:00:54.333 --> 00:01:01.733

Cards were dealt, I’m right on the edge.

00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:54.570
I dream with the aces and kings in my hands.

00:01:56.333 --> 00:02:01.800
It's time to make it, you're not calling my bluff.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:11.830
Don't wanna get out; can't take a deep breath

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.970
Life was too simple. I had to add some spice.

I've taken my chances. That's the feeling I need.

I've taken my chances. Well, that's the feeling I need.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.370
I’m making my own way of living!

It's my life and my own way of living!

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:30.130
Don't wanna change my way of living. That's how 
 I live and it feels so good.
