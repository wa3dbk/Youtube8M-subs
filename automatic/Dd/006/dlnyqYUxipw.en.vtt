very easy to create the froth notice how
the<00:04:17.530> milk<00:04:17.829> starting<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.250> expand<00:04:18.640> is<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.180> froth

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
the milk starting to expand is the froth

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.770 
the milk starting to expand is the froth
builds<00:04:19.780> up<00:04:20.910> when<00:04:21.910> I<00:04:21.940> feel<00:04:22.210> we<00:04:22.360> have<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.540> nut

builds up when I feel we have a nut

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.040 
builds up when I feel we have a nut
froth<00:04:23.020> I'll<00:04:23.350> raise<00:04:23.890> up<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.460> cup<00:04:25.240> so<00:04:25.780> that<00:04:25.960> the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
froth I'll raise up the cup so that the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.650 
froth I'll raise up the cup so that the
milk<00:04:26.290> actually<00:04:26.560> covers<00:04:27.220> that<00:04:27.370> small<00:04:27.760> hole<00:04:28.060> and

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
milk actually covers that small hole and

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.540
