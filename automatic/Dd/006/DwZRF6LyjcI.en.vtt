00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
understand that the aim is clearly on

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.780 
understand that the aim is clearly on
him<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> saw<00:01:13.439> wants<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> clear<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.520> for

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
him so I saw wants to clear that up for

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.679 
him so I saw wants to clear that up for
me<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:15.560> much<00:01:16.560> appreciated<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:17.490> uh<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.150> do

me but much appreciated but uh I I do

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.600 
me but much appreciated but uh I I do
think<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.200> some<00:01:19.409> pie<00:01:19.560> bug<00:01:19.799> glad<00:01:20.220> she<00:01:20.400> got<00:01:20.430> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
think this some pie bug glad she got to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.850 
think this some pie bug glad she got to
be<00:01:20.670> more<00:01:20.909> accurate<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> thermal<00:01:22.439> sight<00:01:22.650> on

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
be more accurate with a thermal sight on

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.450 
be more accurate with a thermal sight on
earth<00:01:23.220> snipers<00:01:24.530> well<00:01:25.530> least<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.189> my<00:01:26.310> opinion

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
earth snipers well least in my opinion

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.749 
earth snipers well least in my opinion
anyway<00:01:26.900> either<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.259> I'm<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.159> I'm

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
anyway either that or I'm just the I'm

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.730 
anyway either that or I'm just the I'm
just<00:01:29.970> bad<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> thermal<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.110> um<00:01:31.290> yeah<00:01:31.530> i

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
just bad with a thermal but um yeah i

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.499 
just bad with a thermal but um yeah i
definitely<00:01:32.250> recommend<00:01:32.579> using<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> thermal

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
definitely recommend using the thermal

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.510 
definitely recommend using the thermal
sniper<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:34.920> map<00:01:35.189> because

subscribers<00:03:37.800> and<00:03:37.890> it's<00:03:38.010> worth<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.400> really<00:03:38.640> is

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
subscribers and it's worth it really is

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.930

going<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:38.970> be<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.090> HD<00:03:39.510> DVR<00:03:39.960> a<00:03:40.290> half<00:03:41.010> hog<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.520> think

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
going to be a HD DVR a half hog I think

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.910 
going to be a HD DVR a half hog I think
that's<00:03:42.060> how<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.210> say<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.780> don't<00:03:43.080> know<00:03:43.200> where

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
that's how you say it I don't know where

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.250 
that's how you say it I don't know where
that<00:03:43.950> comes<00:03:44.310> from<00:03:44.400> but<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:45.210> know<00:03:45.570> as<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:45.870> hasty

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
that comes from but I know as a hasty

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.470 
that comes from but I know as a hasty
PVR<00:03:46.740> so<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.310> quality<00:03:47.520> be<00:03:47.820> a<00:03:47.850> lot<00:03:48.000> better<00:03:48.150> if<00:03:48.390> I

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
PVR so the quality be a lot better if I

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.290 
PVR so the quality be a lot better if I
get<00:03:48.630> that<00:03:48.660> but<00:03:49.020> none<00:03:49.700> again<00:03:50.700> Astros<00:03:50.940> at<00:03:51.270> the

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
this this fact because well see if they

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.230 
this this fact because well see if they
want<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.080> have<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.500> Maya<00:04:26.430> pinion<00:04:26.850> my

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
view on the Y supposed to be one of the

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.480 
view on the Y supposed to be one of the
best<00:04:30.060> headsets<00:04:30.539> around<00:04:30.840> so<00:04:31.169> I<00:04:31.620> don't<00:04:32.310> think

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
best headsets around so I don't think

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.249
