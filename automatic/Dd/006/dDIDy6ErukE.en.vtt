is that sort of cloudy past 3k sound our
body<00:00:44.629> which<00:00:44.899> is<00:00:45.019> just<00:00:45.199> sort<00:00:45.499> of<00:00:45.559> before<00:00:46.100> bass

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
body which is just sort of before bass

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.639 
body which is just sort of before bass
and<00:00:46.819> under<00:00:47.120> mid-range<00:00:47.569> re<00:00:47.809> words<00:00:48.109> where<00:00:48.379> you

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
and under mid-range re words where you

know cabinets sort of resonated and the

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.529 
know cabinets sort of resonated and the
335<00:00:51.409> has<00:00:51.679> it<00:00:51.829> sort<00:00:51.979> of<00:00:52.039> lumped<00:00:52.339> to<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.179> I<00:00:53.210> can

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
335 has it sort of lumped to it so I can

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.329 
335 has it sort of lumped to it so I can
take<00:00:53.659> my<00:00:53.719> sort<00:00:54.019> of<00:00:54.109> thin<00:00:54.260> sounding<00:00:54.679> strat<00:00:55.010> and

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
take my sort of thin sounding strat and

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:56.979 
take my sort of thin sounding strat and
by<00:00:55.819> turning<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.239> giggidy<00:00:56.539> on<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.780> way<00:00:56.870> it's

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
by turning the giggidy on the way it's

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.180 
by turning the giggidy on the way it's
set<00:00:57.170> up<00:00:57.199> is<00:00:57.379> just<00:00:57.530> going<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:57.710> warm<00:00:57.979> it<00:00:58.100> up

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
set up is just going to warm it up

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.219 
set up is just going to warm it up
almost<00:00:58.639> like<00:00:58.879> they<00:00:59.059> went<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.299> a<00:00:59.359> humbucker<00:00:59.780> or

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
almost like they went to a humbucker or

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.020 
almost like they went to a humbucker or
like<00:01:00.589> a<00:01:00.620> Marshall<00:01:01.280> stack<00:01:01.370> or<00:01:01.639> something<00:01:01.940> so

like a Marshall stack or something so

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.579 
like a Marshall stack or something so
I've<00:01:02.149> got<00:01:02.299> this<00:01:02.479> set<00:01:02.539> up<00:01:02.780> here<00:01:02.809> kind<00:01:03.379> of<00:01:03.440> like<00:01:03.559> a

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
I've got this set up here kind of like a

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:20.020 
I've got this set up here kind of like a
basic<00:01:04.010> friendly<00:01:04.489> bright

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.160 

you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.300> all<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> these<00:01:21.659> sort<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.960> pick

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you can see all of these sort of pick

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
you can see all of these sort of pick
attack<00:01:22.470> has<00:01:22.650> been<00:01:22.770> smooth<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:24.090> almost

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
attack has been smooth now it's almost

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.240 
attack has been smooth now it's almost
has<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.659> resonant<00:01:25.350> sort<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.590> 1/4<00:01:25.950> acre<00:01:26.040> than

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
has that resonant sort of 1/4 acre than

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.460 
has that resonant sort of 1/4 acre than
that<00:01:26.369> sort<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.700> semi<00:01:27.000> hollow<00:01:27.270> thing<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
that sort of semi hollow thing and the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.900 
that sort of semi hollow thing and the
way<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:28.950> use<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.400> at<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.580> end<00:01:29.729> of

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
way I like to use it is at the end of

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.520 
way I like to use it is at the end of
the<00:01:29.970> pedal<00:01:30.300> board<00:01:30.330> so<00:01:31.050> it's<00:01:31.170> usually<00:01:31.320> I

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the pedal board so it's usually I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.380 
the pedal board so it's usually I
already<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> sound<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.400> want<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.940> one

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
already have a sound I want and one

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.880 
already have a sound I want and one
basic<00:01:33.810> sound<00:01:34.080> so<00:01:34.320> maybe<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.560> don't<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:34.830> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
basic sound so maybe I don't have a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.440 
basic sound so maybe I don't have a
channel<00:01:35.130> switching<00:01:35.460> amplicon<00:01:35.880> maybe<00:01:36.030> again

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
channel switching amplicon maybe again

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.420 
channel switching amplicon maybe again
the<00:01:36.540> Fender<00:01:36.810> combo<00:01:37.140> or<00:01:37.259> something<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.190> I<00:01:38.250> may

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the Fender combo or something so I may

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.600 
the Fender combo or something so I may
use<00:01:38.640> sparkle<00:01:39.060> drive<00:01:39.240> ma<00:01:39.450> maybe<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.930> little<00:01:40.140> echo

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
use sparkle drive ma maybe a little echo

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.859 
use sparkle drive ma maybe a little echo
and<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.820> way<00:01:41.940> I<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.300> a<00:01:42.330> nice<00:01:42.509> clean

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
and in a way I can have a nice clean

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:59.590 
and in a way I can have a nice clean
sound<00:01:43.110> still<00:01:43.470> chiming

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.610 

and<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.780> almost<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.140> you're<00:02:01.380> switching

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
and it's almost like you're switching

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.320 
and it's almost like you're switching
from<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.040> crunchy<00:02:02.490> sound<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.970> this<00:02:03.060> big

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
from this crunchy sound to this big

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.810 
from this crunchy sound to this big
Marshall<00:02:03.900> with<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.050> Les<00:02:04.260> Paul<00:02:04.430> but<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.580> it's

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
Marshall with a Les Paul but it's it's

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.580 
Marshall with a Les Paul but it's it's
again<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.570> little<00:02:06.870> pedal<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.410> could

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
again it's one little pedal that I could

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.840 
again it's one little pedal that I could
