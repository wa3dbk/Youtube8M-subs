gotta<00:01:50.549> stick<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.850> we<00:01:50.970> got<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.210> do<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.990> that

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
gotta stick to we got to do is that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.350 
gotta stick to we got to do is that
difficult<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.680> achieve<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.579> timing<00:01:54.060> over

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
difficult to achieve that timing over

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.179 
difficult to achieve that timing over
the<00:01:54.450> summer<00:01:54.630> or<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.320> sort<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.070> a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
the summer or is that just sort of a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.440 
the summer or is that just sort of a
process<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.759> kind<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.060> takes<00:01:57.240> care<00:01:57.420> of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
process that kind of takes care of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.050 
process that kind of takes care of
itself<00:01:57.689> with<00:01:58.290> extra<00:01:58.950> effort<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.369> mean<00:01:59.729> it's

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
itself with extra effort I mean it's

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.340 
itself with extra effort I mean it's
definitely<00:02:00.210> difficult<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.140> mean<00:02:01.290> I

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
definitely difficult to do but I mean I

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.590 
definitely difficult to do but I mean I
think<00:02:01.560> we've<00:02:01.710> worked<00:02:01.920> enough<00:02:02.189> with<00:02:02.369> um<00:02:02.579> with<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
think we've worked enough with um with a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.230 
think we've worked enough with um with a
