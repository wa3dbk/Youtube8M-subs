00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.110
 recording sound 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.120
 so 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.850
 is introduced ie 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.170
 audio 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.039
 and we are going to give it 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.259
 The when 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.420
 then I started recognizing let's go 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.929
 both will look like a window in that window are going to see couple options 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.390
 the two ediles want 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.890
 blind offers 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.650
 once 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.859
 various forms of 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.019
 interpret the information that this 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.409
 inside the yes 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.439
 Caesar various ways of interpreting information 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.729
 depending on the programs it has on your computer 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:37.389
 if he wants it in this case play as he understands it is a music cinema 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.020
 offers you and programs that play music 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.290
 in this case what we want is to copy 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.910
 I am a choice of so many that we are copying music ie using the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.190
 windows media player 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.570
 because the same writers can make a copy for example this 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.180
 d of January but we will use the windows media 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.940
 when we are going to see the copy we accept that 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.780
 that there is that operation but the pao tomaticán people start to record it 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.400
 we do not want that 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.850
 then we look to say 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.970
 if we stop the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.299
 the copy operation 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.310
 hakkinen in this vow 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.430
 percent 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.540
 and they selected city the music we want 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.410
 percent copies 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.020
 then 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.110
 percent 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.170
 josé luis moya select a single song 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.770
 in that case the number 11 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.770
 10 is the song of the xii that I want copies 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.940
 now the format 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.660
 the way he's going to record this music on my computer 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.200
 by the way it was 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.520
 you see several formats and he 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.600
 percent to select the format in that case mp3 why 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.120
 the and they get worse 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.780
 hool archives of enschede 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.490
 in a circus more 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.860
 formats be 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.280
 per cent we're going to change that format will be to be recorded computation 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.500
 like mp3 then it gives in ram memory while 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.579
 we search 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.919
 option options 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.559
 i 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:17.639
 the prey of collecting music from ourselves we click 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.299
 because then it is not percent indicating the format 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.579
 where it's going to be recorded to music 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.459
 a-rod computer 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.459
 for us why the mp3 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:32.669
 and what quality 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.429
 of recording 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.429
 aa the lizard for copy of samos 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:41.230
 we then forecast the changes 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.149
 peace mp3 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:47.879
 and before accepting let's look then tondero to be recorded 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:51.679

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.079
 we have selected desktop put this select any 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.079
 physical or political storage device 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.049
 in your case do in the written 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.269
 if we want we create a folder 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.629
 let's call it music 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.379
 I entered 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.239
 this one yes 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.109
 or to get a 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.109
 then that folder that you have written 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:32.339
 in these months 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:38.030
 Vasquez explained 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.379
 the one that everyone 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.029
 and this in this court 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:45.029
 goodbye 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.719
 6 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:08.719
 and the crowd 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.099
 Israel 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.099
 because it also appears with a key 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.090
 in January 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.090
 the pair was filled 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.559
 I think the key 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:28.069
 art that is next to the spacebar the appear 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.409
 efe 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.999
 the menu 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:34.049
 and there the options come back to the stage 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.039
 eyelash 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.569
 Yes, good 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.569
 little by little those who do not start copying themselves 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:46.460
 he begins to record the one that is marked 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.460
 in a check box 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:53.219
 milingo in his moron while 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.520
 hence, I have stored where 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.249
 we told him not to 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:02.889
 who was recording 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.889
 last night I was going to give the information 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:08.749
 they already started 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:10.410
 3 of these to this 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.909
 but is not 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.339
 Then you can go and find the face 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:16.699
 the music there in the folder 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.699
 recorded music that we created 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:23.699

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.710
