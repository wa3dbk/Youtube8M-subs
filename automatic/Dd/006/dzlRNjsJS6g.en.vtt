00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
tip on how to make panel gaps in blender

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.990 
tip on how to make panel gaps in blender
using<00:00:06.390> just<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.750> modifiers<00:00:07.550> so<00:00:08.550> just<00:00:08.820> give<00:00:08.910> it

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
using just the modifiers so just give it

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.520 
using just the modifiers so just give it
a<00:00:09.030> quick<00:00:09.150> little<00:00:09.210> example<00:00:09.809> I'm<00:00:09.870> gonna<00:00:10.019> add<00:00:10.469> a

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
a quick little example I'm gonna add a

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.259 
a quick little example I'm gonna add a
UV<00:00:10.920> sphere<00:00:10.980> here<00:00:13.790> just<00:00:14.790> living<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.059> up<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.179> bit

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
UV sphere here just living it up a bit

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.010 
UV sphere here just living it up a bit
and<00:00:15.750> shade<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.430> all<00:00:17.430> right<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.029> let's<00:00:18.779> say<00:00:18.869> we

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
and shade it all right so let's say we

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.230 
and shade it all right so let's say we
wanted<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.320> make<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.740> some<00:00:20.250> sort<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.550> exotic

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
wanted to make this some sort of exotic

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.179 
wanted to make this some sort of exotic
sci-fi<00:00:21.900> ball<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.590> wanted<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.039> look<00:00:23.130> like

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
sci-fi ball and we wanted to look like

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.099 
sci-fi ball and we wanted to look like
yours<00:00:23.519> made<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> multiple<00:00:24.390> interlocking

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
yours made out of multiple interlocking

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.640 
yours made out of multiple interlocking
panels<00:00:26.660> now<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.960> actually<00:00:28.109> do<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
panels now we can actually do that a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.650 
panels now we can actually do that a
blender<00:00:29.039> using<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> modifier<00:00:30.090> stack<00:00:30.240> so

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
blender using just the modifier stack so

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.410 
blender using just the modifier stack so
we<00:00:30.750> never<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.170> modify<00:00:31.590> our<00:00:31.619> base<00:00:31.920> mesh<00:00:32.420> so

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
we never have to modify our base mesh so

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.490 
we never have to modify our base mesh so
the<00:00:33.510> first<00:00:33.660> thing<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.870> need<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:33.989> do<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.260> drop

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the first thing we need to do is drop

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.870 
the first thing we need to do is drop
into<00:00:34.739> any<00:00:34.829> mode<00:00:35.010> really<00:00:35.309> quick<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.760> is

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
into any mode really quick and this is

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.250 
into any mode really quick and this is
going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> be<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> only<00:00:36.420> step<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.050> edit

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
going to be the only step we do in edit

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.200 
going to be the only step we do in edit
mode<00:00:37.340> is<00:00:38.340> we're<00:00:38.520> just<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> mark<00:00:38.969> where

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
mode is we're just going to mark where

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.130 
mode is we're just going to mark where
we<00:00:39.300> want<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> panel<00:00:39.780> gaps<00:00:40.219> probably<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:42.140> those

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
we want the panel gaps probably do those

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.490 
we want the panel gaps probably do those
edges<00:00:44.360> that's<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.570> little<00:00:45.719> complicated<00:00:45.960> path

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
edges that's a little complicated path

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:56.389 
edges that's a little complicated path
here<00:00:47.719> maybe<00:00:48.719> down<00:00:48.989> there<00:00:51.829> maybe<00:00:52.829> outline<00:00:55.399> it

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
here maybe down there maybe outline it

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.070 
here maybe down there maybe outline it
like<00:00:56.640> that

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.310 

we'll<00:01:02.590> make<00:01:02.770> another<00:01:02.980> panel<00:01:03.340> going<00:01:03.490> this<00:01:03.700> way

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
we'll make another panel going this way

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.230 
we'll make another panel going this way
alright<00:01:05.320> that's<00:01:05.500> pretty<00:01:05.560> good<00:01:05.800> so<00:01:06.610> first<00:01:07.120> of

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
alright that's pretty good so first of

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.910 
alright that's pretty good so first of
all<00:01:07.270> we<00:01:07.450> need<00:01:07.570> to<00:01:07.630> flag<00:01:07.870> these<00:01:08.080> actually<00:01:08.710> being

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
all we need to flag these actually being

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.770 
all we need to flag these actually being
gaps<00:01:09.220> for<00:01:09.550> blender<00:01:09.850> so<00:01:10.000> who'd<00:01:10.180> control<00:01:10.540> eat

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
gaps for blender so who'd control eat

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.560 
gaps for blender so who'd control eat
and<00:01:11.080> hit<00:01:11.200> mark<00:01:11.680> sharp<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:13.300> that<00:01:13.420> won't

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
and hit mark sharp and that won't

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.850 
and hit mark sharp and that won't
actually<00:01:13.750> change<00:01:13.900> your<00:01:14.140> model<00:01:14.500> at<00:01:14.590> all<00:01:14.710> in

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
actually change your model at all in

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.770 
actually change your model at all in
edit<00:01:15.100> mode<00:01:15.130> it'll<00:01:15.490> just<00:01:15.730> tell<00:01:15.910> blender<00:01:16.240> that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
edit mode it'll just tell blender that

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.680 
edit mode it'll just tell blender that
markers<00:01:17.290> where<00:01:17.560> edge<00:01:18.070> splits<00:01:18.610> need<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.940> be<00:01:19.060> so

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
markers where edge splits need to be so

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.300 
markers where edge splits need to be so
go<00:01:19.750> ahead<00:01:19.900> and<00:01:20.050> hit<00:01:20.260> tab<00:01:20.440> drop<00:01:20.800> out<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.130> mode

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
go ahead and hit tab drop out and mode

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.310 
go ahead and hit tab drop out and mode
won't<00:01:21.550> need<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.790> be<00:01:21.910> used<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.150> many<00:01:22.330> more<00:01:22.479> go

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
won't need to be used that many more go

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.540 
won't need to be used that many more go
over<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.530> your<00:01:23.590> modifier<00:01:23.950> stack<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.490> the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
over to your modifier stack and the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.680 
over to your modifier stack and the
first<00:01:24.700> thing<00:01:24.820> we<00:01:24.910> need<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.090> do<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:25.390> actually

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
first thing we need to do is actually

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.510 
first thing we need to do is actually
use<00:01:26.110> those<00:01:26.290> sharp<00:01:26.560> edges<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.979> split<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.340> mesh

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
use those sharp edges to split the mesh

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.830 
use those sharp edges to split the mesh
so<00:01:27.729> go<00:01:27.850> ahead<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.119> add<00:01:28.240> an<00:01:28.420> edge<00:01:28.570> split

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
so go ahead and add an edge split

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.170 
so go ahead and add an edge split
modifier<00:01:29.229> at<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.440> top

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
modifier at the top

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.130 
modifier at the top
uncheck<00:01:31.180> edge<00:01:31.360> angle<00:01:31.540> we're<00:01:31.810> not<00:01:31.930> gonna<00:01:32.050> be

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
uncheck edge angle we're not gonna be

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.070 
uncheck edge angle we're not gonna be
using<00:01:32.290> that<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:34.119> there<00:01:34.300> you<00:01:34.330> can<00:01:34.600> kind<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.900> see

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
using that and there you can kind of see

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.640 
using that and there you can kind of see
we<00:01:35.320> have<00:01:35.550> little<00:01:36.550> gaps<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.479> that<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:38.410> doesn't

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
we have little gaps and that it doesn't

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.139 
we have little gaps and that it doesn't
look<00:01:38.740> like<00:01:38.890> panels<00:01:39.250> yet<00:01:39.430> but<00:01:39.670> we'll<00:01:39.759> get<00:01:39.910> there

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
look like panels yet but we'll get there

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.410 
look like panels yet but we'll get there
so<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.050> had<00:01:41.140> another<00:01:41.290> modifier<00:01:41.710> below<00:01:42.070> that

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
so I had another modifier below that

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.880 
so I had another modifier below that
solidify<00:01:45.330> getting<00:01:46.330> somewhere<00:01:46.660> first<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:47.770> all

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
solidify getting somewhere first of all

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.190 
solidify getting somewhere first of all
go<00:01:48.100> ahead<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.310> drop<00:01:48.460> over<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.570> mesh<00:01:49.840> panel

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
go ahead and drop over to the mesh panel

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.590 
go ahead and drop over to the mesh panel
select<00:01:50.649> Auto<00:01:50.860> smooth<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.580> change<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.149> 30

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
select Auto smooth and change it to 30

this case this is a simple enough design
that<00:02:38.349> we<00:02:38.410> can<00:02:38.560> do<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.770> was<00:02:38.920> just<00:02:39.190> edge<00:02:39.700> angle<00:02:40.349> in

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
that we can do it was just edge angle in

that we can do it was just edge angle in
no<00:02:42.420> there<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.510> go<00:02:43.680> we've<00:02:44.680> cut<00:02:44.890> panel<00:02:45.190> gaps<00:02:45.900> and

no there you go we've cut panel gaps and

no there you go we've cut panel gaps and
the<00:02:47.020> great<00:02:47.170> thing<00:02:47.319> about<00:02:47.410> this<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.830> it's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
the great thing about this is it's

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.250 
the great thing about this is it's
totally<00:02:48.360> non-destructive<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.540> can<00:02:49.720> drop
