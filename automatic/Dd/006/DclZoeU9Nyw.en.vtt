00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.080
 hello everyone this is how are you 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.520
 you listen to me know abidjan friends 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.260
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.910
 new video without my youtube channel 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.160
 in this video I find you 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.560
 simply on call of duty black ops 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.170
 first of the name in matchmaking mode by 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.759
 team on the grunge furie pie and in 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.219
 this video i will play with like 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.440
 main weapon at 47 if you want 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.180
 maybe some information about my class 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.280
 1 you normally see it now 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.960
 on screen so if we today we 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.730
 let's go again by the two call 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.200
 of duty black ops 3 that basically means 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.989
 the next call of duty 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.250
 the tools conference of the year 2015 is 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.199
 today well I'm not going to you 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.820
 give information up but 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.579
 just give you my opinion 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.230
 personal to me on a subject that I 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.539
 think will still interest a lot of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.129
 world since yes I often see in 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.930
 space comment one of my videos 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.729
 people who ask a little bit 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.049
 question that's why I thought 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.299
 common sense where it could be nice 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.250
 why not if you did precisely 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.229
 possibly a video to talk about it 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.880
 a little bit about us it's going to be 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.860
 what is it going to be just talked about a 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.700
 little bit of call of duty black ops 3 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.369
 efforts together 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.390
 if it can be eventually 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.030
 available on older consoles 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.340
 it basically means playstation 3 and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.990
 the xbox 360 that's right are not 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.119
 really super old but areas 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.189
 you really are wrong is to be considered 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.020
 as console and eugene that means in 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.220
 big old generations who 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.049
 today there is news 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.360
 generations who I remember are the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.090
 playstation 4 and the xbox one 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.740
 so I live to make a small summary of 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.060
 call of duty black ops three names for 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.549
 start the game I call him back and 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.920
 will be released officially on November 6th 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.049
 2015 so I will not do either 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.549
 a summary of all of my videos but 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.800
 others here I really did a lot 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.750
 a lot of videos with 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.980
 many many other formations if 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.810
 it tempts you I invite you all 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.400
 just went to see them one will be fine 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.170
 obviously on my channel you just need 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.180
 just go on my channel 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.880
 in the search space and type black 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.680
 ops 3 Â° really to kout but videos 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.270
 information about this game and all 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.130
 leaks that we could find 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.780
 so I remind one the same compared 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.880
 to one of my latest videos and well 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.100
 call of duty black ops roanne will have a 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.650
 beta that will be available in June but 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.290
 the abbot da will only be available on 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.430
 xbox one playstation 4 and pc it wants 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.800
 basically say that she will not be 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.460
 available on consoles like wii 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.170
 or the playstation 3 he exhibited box 360 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.480
 that's why today people are 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.190
 really ask if the game will come out 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.300
 officially on the old 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.520
 consoles because good so 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.170
 of today nothing but really nothing 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.390
 really does not have that I'm not mistaken 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.160
 of course confirmed that the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.680
 next call of duty would not come out 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.650
 officially on playstation 3 and on 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.970
 xbox 360 so that's why I got 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.620
 says good as much you say it because I 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.600
 see anyway the world that says yes 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.970
 but the game does not come out of it 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.350
 game it's true nothing really 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.260
 really been confirmed for the moment 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.760
 even if it's true that astor if call of 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.130
 duty really do not know yet 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.170
 pronounced a rather activity and 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.810
 treyarch have not really gotten 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.520
 pronounced on the supports to which the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.010
 game will finally be available so we 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.810
 will see that way I think a little bit 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.610
 later but for the moment everything 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.890
 that I have to tell you is that the game 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.230
 will normally be released officially 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.880
 it seems obvious it is a small 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.980
 little the latest consoles one of 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.420
 designers who are microsoft and sony 1 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.670
 I remind you that they are the 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.220
 playstation 3 and the xbox wayne it seems 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.930
 completely obvious that the game is coming out 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.720
 officially on his consoles but 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.220
 also on pc so for the rest a 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.080
 little bit we'll see that as I wanted 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.090
 says as and when 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.830
 here I think in a few months 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.050
 by June it's pretty obvious 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.660
 whether we know it or not 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.230
 will come out yes or no on playstation 3 and 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.060
 on xbox 360 but I actually see the 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.400
 world that says that yes the game will come out 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.380
 not officially on these ps3 not on 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.750
 the old consoles what ben because 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.210
 that good there indeed access vision that has 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.680
 set up three who released the gt 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.990
 the game is for the moment on the 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.600
 jackets we only see the pc 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.640
 ok they xbox one and the ps4 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.250
 so it's true that with that we can 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.049
 to say that yes is active ision adli and 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.190
 to put the covers of the console 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.040
 ps3 and xbox 360 be division did it 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.200
 this is precisely what but for a 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.060
 little bit do a little approach on 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.040
 will say before he announces that the game 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.210
 not officially available 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.710
 on old consoles 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.360
 because I really think that 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.780
 this one would be a little shock for all 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.090
 the players 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.370
 because good the game has always been 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.580
 until today available on ps3 and 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.610
 on xbox 360 and not to put 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.260
 this future game on the old consoles 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.120
 will I think a little shock but it takes 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.500
 to confess though I think that 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.640
 you will agree with me when we 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.630
 see a little bit of a beautiful evening 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.000
 because it gave 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.320
 on older consoles compared 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.300
 the new consoles we can say 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.650
 sometimes it's not limiting 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.640
 same game so we can a little bit the 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.290
 understand maybe they do not 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.030
 do not wish to repeat the same thing 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.400
 maybe even he wants to do his 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.340
 share purpose of saving money wholesale 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.730
 well here is the game without refit 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.470
 on ps3 and xbox 360 it's 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.810
 well you have to know that they will need 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.940
 from another developer because that's good 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.800
 happened exactly like that for the 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.100
 dmn evening looks good that I like 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.540
 their game you need another 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.000
 duo that was these games does not deceive a 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.110
 thing with studio a brief I have more 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.450
 really what it 's all about 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.010
 case in all cases this is not it 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.160
 I love game zinc also 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.720
 developed the game on ps4 on ps3 forgiveness 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.610
 and xbox 360 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.590
 so me I really think that is 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.180
 it's an iron saving goal sam be 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.280
 separates purpose is really really to bring back 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.590
 all the players to really try to 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.970
 bring them back as and when 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.830
 new consoles simply 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.150
 obviously that's why I think 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.710
 really they will lose money 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.810
 but maybe not it will depend 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.490
 really to see a little bit if the 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.289
 soul winner either to put a studio in 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.630
 more care not to put just 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.380
 simply play on the old ones 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.060
 consoles m 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.010
 here we are the friends I think now 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.610
 you have pretty much everything said in my opinion 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:13.039
 the game will come out i'm not telling you it's 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.530
 official but according to me in my head I 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.890
 tell me it will come out because good meter 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.630
 in front of a past rather of khost a black 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.280
 ops 305 console 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.720
 I do not think it's time yet 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.630
 I think the moment it may be 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.340
 coming at the next call of duty but 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.630
 for the moment I think it's not 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.370
 really still the moment is maybe 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.410
 they may not know this 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.789
 way will see him a little later so 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.770
 here are the friends me I just hope 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.240
 that the video to accompany you will have pleased you 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.919
 was not she knows why not a 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.570
 little I like it would really make me 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.950
 great pleasure and of course it's 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.930
 give your opinion in space 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.460
 comments of the video do not hesitate 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.320
 also to subscribe for am really 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.060

 tell you very soon it was either 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.960
 the world boats
