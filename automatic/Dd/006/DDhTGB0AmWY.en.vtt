the light you can see that there's
Benjamin<00:02:42.290> right<00:02:42.470> here<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.910> that's<00:02:44.660> how<00:02:44.840> you

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
Benjamin right here so that's how you

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.500 
Benjamin right here so that's how you
know<00:02:45.200> if<00:02:46.040> it's<00:02:46.220> real<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:46.700> then<00:02:46.910> at<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.300> same

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
know if it's real and then at the same

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.840 
know if it's real and then at the same
time<00:02:49.600> on<00:02:50.890> on<00:02:51.890> top<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.400> here

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
time on on top of here

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.590 
time on on top of here
you<00:02:53.240> could<00:02:53.510> feel<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:54.230> kind<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:55.510> it's<00:02:56.510> not

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
you could feel it's kind of it's not

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.260 
you could feel it's kind of it's not
like<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.020> rest<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.590> paper<00:02:57.920> it's<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:59.060> little

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
like the rest of the paper it's a little

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.210 
like the rest of the paper it's a little
bit<00:02:59.390> there's<00:02:59.540> like<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.690> different<00:03:00.410> level<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.860> on

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
bit there's like a different level on on

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.980 
bit there's like a different level on on
it<00:03:01.370> right<00:03:01.520> there<00:03:01.550> you<00:03:02.180> can<00:03:02.360> feel<00:03:02.570> it's<00:03:02.810> more

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
it right there you can feel it's more

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.190 
it right there you can feel it's more
rugged<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:04.580> that's<00:03:05.480> how<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.720> know<00:03:05.930> if

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
rugged and so that's how you know if

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.470 
rugged and so that's how you know if
it's<00:03:06.800> a<00:03:06.920> real<00:03:07.100> hundred<00:03:07.550> from<00:03:08.090> those<00:03:08.240> things

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
it's a real hundred from those things

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.880 
it's a real hundred from those things
and<00:03:08.600> of<00:03:08.660> course<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.960> feeling<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.440> feeling<00:03:09.470> of

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
and of course the feeling the feeling of

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.890 
and of course the feeling the feeling of
it<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.250> there's<00:03:10.940> an<00:03:11.090> also<00:03:11.360> another<00:03:11.510> way<00:03:11.720> if

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
it and there's an also another way if

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.380 
it and there's an also another way if
you<00:03:11.930> put<00:03:12.230> on<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.410> paper<00:03:12.710> and<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.150> scrub<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.270> on<00:03:14.330> a
