round 57 on the new map Alcatraz and I'm
basically<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.840> how<00:00:13.139> i<00:00:13.170> went<00:00:13.380> down<00:00:13.679> i<00:00:13.710> just

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
basically this is how i went down i just

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.860 
basically this is how i went down i just
ran<00:00:14.250> out<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.429> bullets<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.969> my<00:00:15.059> acid<00:00:15.420> gap<00:00:15.630> I

think<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.440> went<00:00:16.650> through<00:00:16.800> maybe<00:00:17.039> like<00:00:17.369> six<00:00:17.940> or

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
think I went through maybe like six or

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.240
