 usb for recharge and also an output for 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.860
 headphones a differential 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.189
 of the new mini is the fact that 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.950
 she is certified and p-60 and 6 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.509
 which makes the product waterproof and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.850
 dust 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.549

 that any peaks of water or grains of 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.350
 dust will not damage the product. 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.930
 Unfortunately, the customer does not 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.210
 your official website and not even in the manuals 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.210
 that accompany the product, what is the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.940
 Battery capacity and amperes hour 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.950
 but the company promises that it is possible 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.470
 listen to your music for up to 10 hours 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.530

 vote on our tests we got close 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.080
 numbers with the volume set at 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.570
 intermediate levels it was possible to hear 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.370
 music for about eight hours without the 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.190
 need to recharge 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.890
 there are two ways to connect your 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.010
 device to mini new customer via 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.920
 bluetooth or nfc the payment process 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.700
 is quite simple and dispenses softwares 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.030
 extras 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.300
 the model has two young people of 1.3 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.490
 inch and a central passive driver that 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.330
 the client named her flower kiss in 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.670
 right 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.459
 its performance is practically the same as 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.160
 subwoofer even if it does not have the 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.350
 sound that can be considered high 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.990
 their qualities are balanced and 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.400
 consistency and levels of distortion 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.400
 are practically nonexistent 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.010
 in an environment of five square meters 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.200
 for example the result is perfect 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.560
 being the ideal model for you to have in 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.430
 bedroom or in the living room in 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.160
 open 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.920
 the result is slightly lower but 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:40.310
 yet perfectly acceptable for 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.810
 your creative mini category yet 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.170
 not available in stores 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.540
 Brazilians in the North American market is 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.100
 models by price 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.960
 ranging between $ 40 and $ 60 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.660
 some items would fall well on the device 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.470
 buttons for forward and reverse 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.230
 bands 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.550
 the most accurate indicator of the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.240
 drums 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.090
 on the other hand the certification and 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.040
 a very welcome and difficult differential 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.100
 to be found in such devices. 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.650
 price range the audio quality is 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.530
 also another positive point of the mummy 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.940
 mini light and small 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.690
 the device is ideal for environments 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.820
 small parties in smaller spaces or 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.460
 still to accompany that barbecue to the 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.400
 poolside in very 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.430
 the sound of it can be lost and not 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.950
 give an account of the message with a good 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.040
 cost benefit and sound quality 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.560
 Our verdict could not be 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.930
 I created this new mini do not 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.810
 power but by the 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.360
 balance and the good final quality of 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.670
 audio that offers 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.890

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.890
