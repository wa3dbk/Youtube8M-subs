00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
but they look just a little bit

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.369 
but they look just a little bit
different<00:00:59.149> see<00:00:59.300> that<00:00:59.449> size<00:00:59.629> difference<00:01:00.050> yeah

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379

and even the touchpad is nice and smooth

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.940 
and even the touchpad is nice and smooth
so<00:01:50.599> I<00:01:50.959> know<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.110> lot<00:01:51.349> of<00:01:51.380> people<00:01:51.470> had<00:01:51.800> problems

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
so I know a lot of people had problems

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.130 
so I know a lot of people had problems
with<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.399> touchpad<00:01:52.729> in<00:01:52.879> the<00:01:52.970> past<00:01:53.209> they<00:01:53.869> also

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
with the touchpad in the past they also

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.400 
with the touchpad in the past they also
made<00:01:54.470> this<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.679> lot<00:01:55.069> easier<00:01:55.099> to<00:01:55.670> use<00:01:55.879> as<00:01:56.869> far<00:01:57.259> as

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
made this a lot easier to use as far as

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.889 
made this a lot easier to use as far as
the<00:01:57.739> format<00:01:58.369> of<00:01:58.399> this<00:01:58.670> guy<00:01:58.879> goes<00:01:59.119> it's

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
the format of this guy goes it's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.410 
the format of this guy goes it's
aluminum<00:02:00.379> on<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.619> top<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.789> kind<00:02:02.149> of<00:02:02.209> feels

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
aluminum on the top so kind of feels

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.600 
aluminum on the top so kind of feels
kind<00:02:02.660> of<00:02:02.750> plastic<00:02:02.899> and<00:02:03.259> cheap<00:02:03.560> but<00:02:04.099> the<00:02:04.220> bottom

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
kind of plastic and cheap but the bottom

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.940 
kind of plastic and cheap but the bottom
is<00:02:04.849> carbon<00:02:05.270> fiber<00:02:05.590> really<00:02:06.590> really<00:02:06.739> nice

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
is carbon fiber really really nice

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.440 
is carbon fiber really really nice
carbon<00:02:07.340> fiber<00:02:07.489> so<00:02:07.759> it's<00:02:07.879> really<00:02:08.149> nice<00:02:08.390> and

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
carbon fiber so it's really nice and

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.110 
carbon fiber so it's really nice and
that<00:02:09.200> also<00:02:09.410> adds<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.099> weight<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.520> why

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
that also adds to the weight of it why

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.910 
that also adds to the weight of it why
it's<00:02:11.270> only<00:02:11.360> three<00:02:11.750> pounds<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.379> it's<00:02:12.530> super

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
it's only three pounds so it's super

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.309 
it's only three pounds so it's super
super<00:02:13.099> lightweight<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:14.660> screen<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.140> course

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
super lightweight the screen of course

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.170 
super lightweight the screen of course
is<00:02:15.500> beautiful<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:16.250> really<00:02:16.610> really<00:02:16.849> bright

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
is beautiful it's really really bright

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.059 
is beautiful it's really really bright
it's<00:02:17.450> very<00:02:17.750> easy<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.170> use<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:18.799> very

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
it's very easy to use and it's very

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.870 
it's very easy to use and it's very
fluid<00:02:19.519> too<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.000> didn't<00:02:20.390> notice<00:02:20.510> an

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
fluid too I didn't notice an

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.030 
fluid too I didn't notice an
kind<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.120> lag<00:02:21.330> or<00:02:21.600> any<00:02:21.780> issues<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:23.010> I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
kind of lag or any issues with that so I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.590 
kind of lag or any issues with that so I

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
know that the processor is definitely

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.330 
know that the processor is definitely
doing<00:02:24.930> what<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.230> supposed<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.680> be<00:02:25.800> doing<00:02:26.100> in

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.070 
noticed about this as well is it's
missing<00:05:12.250> some<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.610> ports<00:05:12.940> so<00:05:13.690> you'll

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
missing some of the ports so you'll

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.770 
missing some of the ports so you'll
usually<00:05:14.440> find<00:05:14.650> HDMI<00:05:15.639> on<00:05:15.789> here<00:05:16.180> an<00:05:16.360> SD<00:05:16.750> card

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
usually find HDMI on here an SD card

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.080 
usually find HDMI on here an SD card
slot<00:05:17.289> sometimes<00:05:18.130> you'll<00:05:18.310> find<00:05:18.520> Ethernet<00:05:18.940> the

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
slot sometimes you'll find Ethernet the

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.790 
slot sometimes you'll find Ethernet the
kind<00:05:19.300> that<00:05:19.419> you<00:05:19.510> can<00:05:19.660> pull<00:05:19.840> down<00:05:20.050> they<00:05:20.620> don't

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
kind that you can pull down they don't

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.180 
kind that you can pull down they don't
have<00:05:20.860> any<00:05:21.039> of<00:05:21.190> those<00:05:21.280> they<00:05:21.550> have<00:05:21.580> USB<00:05:22.060> 3.1<00:05:23.190> the

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
have any of those they have USB 3.1 the

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.100 
have any of those they have USB 3.1 the
side<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.520> a<00:05:24.610> headphone<00:05:24.880> jack<00:05:25.210> on<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.900> other

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
side and a headphone jack on the other

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.290 
side and a headphone jack on the other
side<00:05:26.349> you<00:05:26.500> got<00:05:26.650> mini<00:05:27.370> DisplayPort<00:05:28.090> and

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
side you got mini DisplayPort and

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.379 
side you got mini DisplayPort and
another<00:05:28.990> USB<00:05:29.349> 3.0<00:05:29.889> that's<00:05:30.340> it<00:05:30.520> so<00:05:31.120> you<00:05:31.180> could

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
another USB 3.0 that's it so you could

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.379 
another USB 3.0 that's it so you could
use<00:05:31.599> a<00:05:31.630> mini<00:05:31.840> DisplayPort<00:05:32.440> as<00:05:32.530> an<00:05:32.620> hdmi

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
use a mini DisplayPort as an hdmi

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.089 
use a mini DisplayPort as an hdmi
adapter<00:05:34.389> but<00:05:34.990> only<00:05:35.229> it<00:05:35.560> looks<00:05:35.740> like<00:05:35.800> only<00:05:35.979> two

would I give it to buy yeah I'd add

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:29.129 
would I give it to buy yeah I'd add
another<00:06:28.060> con<00:06:28.330> it's<00:06:28.510> a<00:06:28.539> little<00:06:28.720> high<00:06:28.840> priced

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
another con it's a little high priced

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.050 
another con it's a little high priced
for<00:06:29.470> it<00:06:29.889> is<00:06:30.039> a<00:06:30.070> little<00:06:30.280> hyper<00:06:30.520> I<00:06:30.639> guess<00:06:30.880> that's

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
for it is a little hyper I guess that's

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.820 
for it is a little hyper I guess that's
a<00:06:31.150> couple<00:06:31.479> but<00:06:31.599> it's<00:06:31.750> it's<00:06:32.050> comparable<00:06:32.500> to

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
a couple but it's it's comparable to

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.580 
a couple but it's it's comparable to
like<00:06:33.340> shiny<00:06:33.849> sir<00:06:34.180> at<00:06:34.479> seven<00:06:34.930> and<00:06:35.260> some<00:06:35.440> of<00:06:35.530> the
