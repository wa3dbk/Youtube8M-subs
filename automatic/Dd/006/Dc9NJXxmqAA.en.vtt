00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.039
 in these images we see the signs of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.009
 presence of agricultural activity in 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.900
 farm where the livestock is the 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.689
 Main activity 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.989
 apparently only pastures should 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.020
 occupy significant areas of the farm 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.820
 but we see traces of growing corn and 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.379
 wonder even more 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.050
 use of an irrigation system 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.070
 central pivot that requires a high 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.070
 investment 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.859
 the well-structured feed factory 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.809
 also leads to this questioning by 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.329
 to invest so much whether animals 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.590
 they could simply be fattened 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.809
 pasture 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.539
 the cost of structuring and managing activities 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.690
 so different would not be incompatible 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.280
 with beef cattle 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.380
 or is this integration of 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.020
 activities is that it 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.299
 profitability 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.920
 so when you see here in the mafia the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.590
 renato producing corn in central pivot 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.570
 where he makes two harvests per year 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.320
 It is a high investment but it produces 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.799
 here almost 100 tonnes 50 a 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.930
 ton in each harvest on two trees 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.490
 can produce 100 tonnes of 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.159
 silage while a maize is in a 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.310
 normal rainfed area with low 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.049
 technology will produce 20 tons and 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.930
 15 tons 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.500
 Look, the difference is very great, then. 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.479
 this dilutes the costs 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.250
 I'm not saying here that everyone 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.210
 has to have a central pivot for 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.750
 to produce silage is an alternative 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.130
 had the ability to invest is a 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:12.840
 businessman produced put invested and 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:15.000
 return is highly feasible in a 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.330
 small renato product 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.820
 the silage for his cattle now and then 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.130
 with the possibility of producing up to the grain 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.290
 Corn in the area that also 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.360
 constitutes at 80% the reason of it then cost 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.030
 it's relative 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.930
 I have an investment I have to 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.820
 measuring up to where I have ability to 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.740
 to invest in the production of silage 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.780
 maize is grown to produce 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.260
 high volume per area 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.060
 then the plants are harvested whole 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.850
 this material being placed 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.060
 in a silo where it is compressed and finally 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.510
 closed without the presence of oxygen at 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.850
 forage mass undergoes fermentation 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.590
 performed by bacteria 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.810
 according to the type of bacteria present 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.450
 can even be inserted to 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.910
 to guide the fermentation process that 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.760
 determines a reduction of pH within the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.100
 silo that will prevent the multiplication of 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.580
 and desirable microorganisms that 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.400
 would cause deterioration of the forage 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.310
 thus the forage conservation will be 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.950
 prolonged for several years a silo well 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.530
 made is therefore a forage deposit 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.150
 preserved that is ready to be 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.150
 used any time 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.770
 to size the silos takes into account 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.200
 the total estimated silage consumption 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.750
 multiplying if the average consumption per 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.140
 animal or during confinement by the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.120
 number of animals being confined to 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.240
 varies with the size of the animal 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.940
 but can be estimated considering 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.490
 example for corn silage around 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.830
 of 20 kg of forage per day 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.220
 total consumption must be overestimated 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.610
 by at least 10% as a margin of 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.010
 against possible losses 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.730
 the total consumption in turn must be 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.940
 divided by 650 kilos which is the weight of 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.859
 compacted silage per cubic meter 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.790
 thus obtaining the total volume of the 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.520
 silo the growing area can in turn 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.010
 be calculated by dividing the amount of 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.320
 silage to be produced by the 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.200
 estimate of the crop per hectare 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.350
 in the case of maize for example 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.280
 production is estimated at 45 tonnes per 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.280
 hectare on average
