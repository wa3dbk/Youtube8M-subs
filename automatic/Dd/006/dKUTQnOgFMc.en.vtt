00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
more water about the same again there

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
more water about the same again there
you<00:06:08.090> go<00:06:09.340> stir<00:06:10.340> that<00:06:10.550> in<00:06:10.759> as<00:06:11.449> they<00:06:11.660> heat<00:06:11.840> goes

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
you go stir that in as they heat goes

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.510 
you go stir that in as they heat goes
through<00:06:12.259> that<00:06:12.440> more<00:06:12.590> -<00:06:12.770> it's<00:06:12.889> cold<00:06:13.039> water<00:06:13.310> by

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
through that more - it's cold water by

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.129 
through that more - it's cold water by
the<00:06:13.580> way<00:06:13.759> as<00:06:14.240> it<00:06:14.449> goes<00:06:14.720> through<00:06:14.960> it<00:06:15.020> will

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
the way as it goes through it will

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.640 
the way as it goes through it will
thicken<00:06:15.910> this<00:06:16.910> is<00:06:17.090> looking<00:06:17.300> fantastic<00:06:17.750> you

tender okay guys so one other tip is
that<00:06:54.340> the<00:06:55.340> flour<00:06:55.669> might<00:06:55.969> thicken<00:06:56.389> too<00:06:56.570> much<00:06:56.750> so

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
that the flour might thicken too much so

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.159 
that the flour might thicken too much so
keep<00:06:57.889> your<00:06:58.009> eye<00:06:58.070> on<00:06:58.159> it<00:06:58.509> if<00:06:59.509> so<00:06:59.719> just<00:06:59.990> have<00:07:00.110> the
