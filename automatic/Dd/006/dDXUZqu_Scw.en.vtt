 There are some things today, she 's in 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.950
 The truth is the people this texture is 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.570
 SEFAZ texture 6464 version 2 is one 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.879
 texture galley sang window more or 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.460

 then a texture that is neither a 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.170
 A little boring, more good people, I did. 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.660
 some videos on it and that's why the name 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.430

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.110
 did you see him in the video clips of 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.239
 machinima in the last video a lot of people me 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.460
 He asked to not pass the texture then right 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.110
 I decided to go making the texture a 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.210
 a little more cute to show 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.680
 For you beauty then people 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.660
 the first thing I typed was 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.370
 all blocks I put this brightness 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.920
 nor to keep blinking for more 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.670
 I then edited these blocks 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.619
 on here 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.660
 dt stone sword guys you know 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.030
 that this text does not have that head 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.280
 here I ended up putting a path with 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.259
 the pianists of tre pi ma went to you 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.360
 beauty and guys that I changed but he 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.729
 believed it was from the hotline you 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.290
 can see is that the food will leave a 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.630
 run here to give a source for the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.830
 cvv is that the food is like it's a 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.840
 choose my 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.430
 the heart of this very strong operation 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.560
 red heart that I think more 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.150
 cute does not have to change color 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.189
 and it is not that it gets from the 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.229
 armature put a little leaf tac 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.689
 it's the guava leaf 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.490
 there you can see there that connotes with a 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.280
 kind of lost and how I stayed there 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.560
 guava food then I think it stayed 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.420
 well the time is to show that the particles 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.909
 You too have to be the particle of 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.490
 critical that these things are written 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.799
 guava neftci and when you thing with 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.799
 charles is a green business that christ 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.869
 It was already you who told me to exist. 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.680
 Last video will understand I'll leave it on 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.140
 subscription 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.799
 if you do not understand then 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.930
 guys 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.350
 were few things even though the model 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.030
 texture is okay most of it the question of 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.160
 show the main value that helped her 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.560
 is that your guys caught me 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.890
 texture there that looks a bit like 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.260
 keynote same speech said it is the soup of 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.319
 Coconut understood and I changed the color of the pot. 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.480
 for green and the soup I left that is the color of 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.000
 guava from the guava pulp 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.830
 which seemed to be here as if it were 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.080
 a guava anyway then guys I'll go 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.270
 show it to you now is this texture 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.190
 a bit in ppp for you to see how she 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.569
 so it is more or less and for guys 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.030
 Finally the last thing we should talk to 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.040
 It was that belly under a 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.500
 statement that you are observing 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.850
 he then the red and green bar 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.280
 In order to put this 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.620
 belly is as follows when the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.720
 heart is there it is in the green part 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.310
 You do not take soup when he's in the kitchen. 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.140
 red part is the time you have to 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.120
 have soup then it's to help the galley 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.269
 What are we doing when the time comes? 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.730
 so take out pechiney that you will see 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.620
 read're in the green part still there went from 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.360
 red part on the red part you 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.090
 They should hit the start of your game. 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.000
 tome understood then this was the goal 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.130
 of the tac placing that bar then 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.280
 It will help a lot and you will do p 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.440
 in the part that it is you do not know 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.959
