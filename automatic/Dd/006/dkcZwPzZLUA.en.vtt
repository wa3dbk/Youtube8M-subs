great I think we have great tempo you

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.760 
great I think we have great tempo you
know<00:00:16.500> our<00:00:16.740> our<00:00:17.070> soft<00:00:17.670> tissue<00:00:17.910> injuries<00:00:18.390> were

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
know our our soft tissue injuries were

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.320 
know our our soft tissue injuries were
way<00:00:19.770> down<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.369> thought<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.730> gave<00:00:21.030> me<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> lot<00:00:21.300> of

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
way down I thought I gave me a lot of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.670 
way down I thought I gave me a lot of
good<00:00:21.539> information<00:00:21.690> and<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.350> were<00:00:22.440> able<00:00:22.530> to

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
good information and we were able to

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.920 
good information and we were able to
pretty<00:00:23.369> much<00:00:23.460> stay<00:00:23.880> right<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.240> track<00:00:24.539> with

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
pretty much stay right on track with

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.400 
pretty much stay right on track with
with<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:26.789> aim<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.480> going<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.260> you

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
with what we aim to do going in and you

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.109 
with what we aim to do going in and you
know<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:29.100> the<00:00:29.160> first<00:00:29.310> time<00:00:29.609> through<00:00:29.940> that

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
know for the first time through that

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.900 
know for the first time through that
isn't<00:00:30.359> really<00:00:30.570> easy<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.900> do<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.920> were<00:00:32.099> we

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
isn't really easy to do but we were we

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.250 
isn't really easy to do but we were we
were<00:00:33.030> disciplined<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.780> staying<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.199> our

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
were disciplined and staying on our

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.459 
were disciplined and staying on our
timeframes<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.519> then<00:00:36.179> with<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> type<00:00:37.440> of

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
timeframes and then with the type of

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.319 
timeframes and then with the type of
tempo<00:00:37.979> that<00:00:38.010> our<00:00:38.309> guys<00:00:38.519> practiced<00:00:39.120> with

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
tempo that our guys practiced with

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.669 
tempo that our guys practiced with
enabled<00:00:39.749> us<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.899> stay<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.199> those<00:00:40.409> timeframes

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
enabled us to stay on those timeframes

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:42.259 
enabled us to stay on those timeframes
so<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.249> worked<00:00:41.519> out<00:00:41.609> really<00:00:41.819> well

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
so it worked out really well

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.180 
so it worked out really well
you<00:00:42.539> think<00:00:42.749> the<00:00:42.839> GPS<00:00:43.229> trackers<00:00:43.620> everywhere

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you think the GPS trackers everywhere

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.469 
you think the GPS trackers everywhere
the<00:00:44.339> investments<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.089> want<00:00:45.269> to<00:00:45.359> keep

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:45.479 
the investments that you want to keep

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.889 
the investments that you want to keep
you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.739 
you
oh<00:00:45.929> absolutely<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:48.539> know<00:00:48.629> not

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
oh absolutely it's a it's a you know not

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.660 
oh absolutely it's a it's a you know not
only<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.079> check<00:00:49.289> guys<00:00:49.530> track<00:00:50.069> the<00:00:50.219> team<00:00:50.429> but<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
only to check guys track the team but to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.579 
only to check guys track the team but to
track<00:00:50.879> guys<00:00:51.059> individually<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.019> it'll<00:00:52.440> be

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
track guys individually and it'll be

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.309 
track guys individually and it'll be
it's<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.460> tremendous<00:00:53.909> resource<00:00:54.089> and<00:00:55.489> it's<00:00:56.489> been

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:57.319 
it's a tremendous resource and it's been

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:01.219 
it's a tremendous resource and it's been
it's<00:00:58.319> been<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.530> lot<00:00:58.709> of<00:00:58.739> help<00:00:59.359> a<00:01:00.359> lot<00:01:01.109> of

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
it's been a lot of help a lot of

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:02.809 
it's been a lot of help a lot of
Technology<00:01:01.889> now<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> figure<00:01:02.489> out<00:01:02.609> whether

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:02.819 
Technology now to figure out whether

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:06.140 
Technology now to figure out whether
guys<00:01:03.149> ready<00:01:03.479> to<00:01:03.629> play<00:01:03.809> or<00:01:03.839> not<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:05.150> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
guys ready to play or not and the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.230 
guys ready to play or not and the
catapult<00:01:06.570> system<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.380> uses<00:01:07.860> use<00:01:08.550> allows

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
catapult system that we uses use allows

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.810 
catapult system that we uses use allows
us<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.690> know<00:01:09.870> whether<00:01:10.800> a<00:01:10.920> guy's<00:01:11.160> got<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.490> same

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
us to know whether a guy's got the same

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.820 
us to know whether a guy's got the same
explosive<00:01:12.240> movements<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.110> he<00:01:13.200> had<00:01:13.410> before

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
explosive movements that he had before

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.820 
explosive movements that he had before
for<00:01:14.190> how<00:01:14.370> long<00:01:14.690> we<00:01:15.690> can<00:01:15.840> evaluate<00:01:16.110> whether<00:01:16.620> he

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
for how long we can evaluate whether he

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.800 
for how long we can evaluate whether he
cuts<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.520> same<00:01:17.820> explosive<00:01:18.420> movement

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
cuts with the same explosive movement

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.920 
cuts with the same explosive movement
off<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.200> leg<00:01:19.760> and<00:01:20.760> you<00:01:21.480> know<00:01:21.570> all<00:01:21.750> those

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
off of that leg and you know all those

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.110 
off of that leg and you know all those
things<00:01:22.260> are<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.680> same<00:01:22.710> standard<00:01:23.400> before<00:01:23.850> he

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
things are the same standard before he

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.440 
things are the same standard before he
got<00:01:24.270> hurt<00:01:24.800> so<00:01:25.800> that<00:01:26.310> system<00:01:26.760> really<00:01:27.060> helped<00:01:27.360> us

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
got hurt so that system really helped us

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.990 
got hurt so that system really helped us
a<00:01:27.600> lot<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.260> a<00:01:28.320> medical<00:01:28.770> decision<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.880> know

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
a lot it was a medical decision you know

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.660 
a lot it was a medical decision you know
by<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.210> docs<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.900> based<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.070> all<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.490> that

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
by the docs that based on all that that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.390 
by the docs that based on all that that
he<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:32.910> ready<00:01:33.120> to<00:01:33.300> go<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:34.040> you<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.130> he<00:01:35.220> made

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
he was ready to go and you know he made

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.610 
he was ready to go and you know he made
some<00:01:35.580> good<00:01:35.730> plays<00:01:35.910> out<00:01:36.240> there<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.690> I'm<00:01:37.560> sure

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
some good plays out there and I'm sure

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.650 
some good plays out there and I'm sure
the<00:01:38.100> more<00:01:38.250> he<00:01:38.430> plays<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.970> better<00:01:39.150> better

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
the more he plays the better better

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:49.820 
the more he plays the better better
he'll<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:47.630> I<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:49.170> big<00:01:49.350> does<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> great<00:01:49.770> job

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
he'll get I think big does a great job

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.470 
he'll get I think big does a great job
in<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.490> training<00:01:50.760> room<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:51.240> ours

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
in the training room that I think ours

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.480 
in the training room that I think ours
being<00:01:51.690> able<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.990> manage<00:01:52.290> practice<00:01:52.980> how<00:01:53.250> we<00:01:53.280> do

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
being able to manage practice how we do

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.610 
being able to manage practice how we do
with<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.670> GPS<00:01:54.150> system<00:01:54.390> how<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.720> train<00:01:55.440> with

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
with the GPS system how we train with

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.680 
with the GPS system how we train with
that<00:01:55.680> thing<00:01:56.010> year-round<00:01:56.280> has<00:01:57.150> allowed<00:01:57.420> us<00:01:57.480> to

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
that thing year-round has allowed us to

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.210 
that thing year-round has allowed us to
take<00:01:58.050> a<00:01:58.080> lot<00:01:58.260> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> guesswork<00:01:58.620> out<00:01:58.980> of<00:01:59.040> how

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
take a lot of the guesswork out of how

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.890 
take a lot of the guesswork out of how
tired<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> team<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.030> where<00:02:00.240> your<00:02:00.360> pulls<00:02:00.659> your

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
tired the team is where your pulls your

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.570 
tired the team is where your pulls your
tears<00:02:01.200> your<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.860> there<00:02:02.070> are<00:02:02.130> soft<00:02:02.370> tissue

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
tears your as there are soft tissue

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.460 
tears your as there are soft tissue
ranges<00:02:03.000> are<00:02:03.060> down<00:02:03.210> 88%<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.140> last<00:02:04.290> two

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
ranges are down 88% in the last two

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.110 
ranges are down 88% in the last two
years<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.100> we've<00:02:05.250> been<00:02:05.370> able<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.610> apply<00:02:05.760> that

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
years so we've been able to apply that

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.180 
years so we've been able to apply that
and<00:02:06.330> I've<00:02:07.020> using<00:02:07.350> full<00:02:07.560> time<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.950> gain<00:02:08.069> that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and I've using full time and gain that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.619 
and I've using full time and gain that
information<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:08.940> my<00:02:09.060> desk<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> first

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
information it's on my desk the first

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.390 
information it's on my desk the first
thing<00:02:09.840> we<00:02:09.929> walk<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.289> every<00:02:10.409> day<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.250> how<00:02:11.340> we

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
thing we walk in every day so how we

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.890 
thing we walk in every day so how we
practice<00:02:11.969> the<00:02:12.180> adjustments<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.689> make

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
practice the adjustments I make

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.379 
practice the adjustments I make
individually<00:02:13.680> all<00:02:13.889> that<00:02:14.489> we<00:02:14.700> all<00:02:14.879> based<00:02:15.150> off

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:15.389 
individually all that we all based off

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:17.010 
individually all that we all based off
live<00:02:16.139> by<00:02:16.290> that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
live by that

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.050 
live by that
and<00:02:17.110> how<00:02:17.590> we<00:02:17.650> do<00:02:17.920> things<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.640> takes<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.910> lot

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
and how we do things and it takes a lot

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.640 
and how we do things and it takes a lot
of<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> guesswork<00:02:19.390> out<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.410> mean

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
of the guesswork out of it and I mean

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.200 
of the guesswork out of it and I mean
you're<00:02:20.920> going<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.130> have<00:02:21.250> your<00:02:21.400> majors<00:02:21.790> they're

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
you're going to have your majors they're

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.460 
you're going to have your majors they're
gonna<00:02:22.300> be<00:02:22.420> surgeries<00:02:22.870> at<00:02:22.990> times<00:02:23.230> but<00:02:23.380> you're

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
gonna be surgeries at times but you're

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.530 
gonna be surgeries at times but you're
gonna<00:02:23.650> get<00:02:23.710> a<00:02:23.770> knee<00:02:24.280> or<00:02:24.520> an<00:02:24.610> ankle<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:25.000> broker

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
gonna get a knee or an ankle a broker

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.150 
gonna get a knee or an ankle a broker
leg<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.960> mean<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.230> that's<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.770> can't<00:02:26.980> help

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
leg I mean that that's you can't help

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.700 
leg I mean that that's you can't help
that<00:02:27.310> but<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.700> lot<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.870> wear<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.110> tear<00:02:29.530> on

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
that but a lot of the wear and tear on

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.960 
that but a lot of the wear and tear on
the<00:02:29.800> body<00:02:29.830> we're<00:02:30.250> able<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.520> take<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.670> lot<00:02:30.850> of

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
the body we're able to take a lot of

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.280 
the body we're able to take a lot of
guesswork<00:02:31.240> out<00:02:31.510> now<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.930> be<00:02:32.020> able<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.230> adjust

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
guesswork out now and be able to adjust

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.410 
guesswork out now and be able to adjust
practices<00:02:33.040> individual<00:02:33.700> practices<00:02:34.210> along

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
practices individual practices along

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.230 
practices individual practices along
with<00:02:34.660> two<00:02:35.560> individual<00:02:36.070> players<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:37.000> know<00:02:37.090> how

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
with two individual players you know how

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.820 
with two individual players you know how
we<00:02:37.300> do<00:02:37.600> things<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.020> I<00:02:38.050> think<00:02:38.110> it's<00:02:38.380> been<00:02:38.530> very

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
we do things and I think it's been very

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.050 
we do things and I think it's been very
critical<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.310> our<00:02:39.370> development<00:02:39.880> that<00:02:39.940> our

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
critical in our development that our

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.490 
critical in our development that our
consistence<00:02:40.660> they<00:02:40.780> keep<00:02:40.960> it<00:02:41.080> guys<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
consistence they keep it guys on the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.830 
consistence they keep it guys on the
field<00:02:41.650> does<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.430> health<00:02:42.610> issue<00:02:42.820> recall<00:02:43.540> going

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
field does the health issue recall going

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.180 
field does the health issue recall going
into<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.110> school<00:02:44.350> down<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.620> spring<00:02:44.860> no<00:02:45.010> down

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
into a school down the spring no down

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.470 
into a school down the spring no down
with<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.490> least<00:02:45.700> amount<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:46.000> offseason

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
with the least amount of offseason

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.780 
with the least amount of offseason
injuries<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.020> I<00:02:47.140> guess<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.410> see<00:02:47.590> injuries<00:02:48.520> are

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
injuries and I guess I see injuries are

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.590 
injuries and I guess I see injuries are
very<00:02:49.450> critical<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.900> team<00:02:50.170> success
