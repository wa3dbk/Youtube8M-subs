hey guys is a gamer guy coming at you
I've<00:00:04.920> had<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> lot<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.279> questions<00:00:05.790> about<00:00:05.940> the

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
I've had a lot of questions about the

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.190 
I've had a lot of questions about the
aluminum<00:00:08.210> foil<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.599> he's<00:00:09.809> on<00:00:10.080> that

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
aluminum foil that he's on that

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.930 
aluminum foil that he's on that
permanent<00:00:11.130> repair<00:00:11.400> video<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:13.940> everybody's

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
permanent repair video and everybody's

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.090 
permanent repair video and everybody's
having<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> hard<00:00:15.450> time<00:00:15.509> finding<00:00:16.139> fighting<00:00:17.039> in

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
having a hard time finding fighting in

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.029 
having a hard time finding fighting in
the<00:00:17.160> middle<00:00:17.990> or<00:00:18.990> uneven<00:00:19.350> knowing<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:19.920> it

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
the middle or uneven knowing what it

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.150 
the middle or uneven knowing what it
does<00:00:20.189> at<00:00:20.400> what<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.640> point<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:22.160> someone

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
does at what the point of it is someone

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.710 
does at what the point of it is someone
I<00:00:23.220> kind<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.550> like<00:00:23.760> laid<00:00:23.939> out<00:00:23.970> for<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.600> this

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
I kind of like laid out for you in this

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.370 
I kind of like laid out for you in this
little<00:00:25.019> short<00:00:25.199> video<00:00:26.119> what<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.810> purpose<00:00:28.230> of

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
little short video what the purpose of

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.569 
little short video what the purpose of
it<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.949> why<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> use<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:31.160> I'd<00:00:32.160> say<00:00:32.369> about

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
it is and why I use it I'd say about

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.520 
it is and why I use it I'd say about
like<00:00:32.790> six<00:00:32.940> months<00:00:33.120> ago<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.750> started<00:00:34.170> getting

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
like six months ago I started getting

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.170 
like six months ago I started getting
some<00:00:34.710> repairs<00:00:35.100> back<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.579> those<00:00:35.700> three<00:00:35.969> red

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
some repairs back in those three red

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.229 
some repairs back in those three red
lights<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:37.040> I<00:00:39.020> did<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.050> screw<00:00:40.440> method<00:00:41.239> of

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
lights and I did the screw method of

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.299 
lights and I did the screw method of
adjust<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> pressures<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.320> them<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.649> nothing

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
adjust the pressures on them and nothing

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.970 
adjust the pressures on them and nothing
was<00:00:44.610> working<00:00:44.820> nothing<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.390> stick<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.050> i<00:00:46.350> was

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
was working nothing with stick so i was

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.819 
was working nothing with stick so i was
thinking<00:00:47.370> what<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.660> somehow<00:00:49.460> force<00:00:51.860> the

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
thinking what if I can somehow force the

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.799 
thinking what if I can somehow force the
processor<00:00:55.829> onto<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> board<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.690> get

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
processor onto the board so that you get

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.430 
processor onto the board so that you get
that<00:00:57.960> connection<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.920> missing<00:00:59.520> from<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
that connection that is missing from the

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.939 
that connection that is missing from the
the<00:01:01.440> solder<00:01:01.710> balls<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.850> chip<00:01:03.949> because

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the solder balls on the chip because

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.469 
the solder balls on the chip because
that's<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.220> happens<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:05.970> cracked<00:01:06.299> over

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
that's what happens is they cracked over

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.160 
that's what happens is they cracked over
time<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> heat<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.010> cooling<00:01:09.170> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
time from the heat and the cooling and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.420 
time from the heat and the cooling and
they<00:01:10.350> developed<00:01:10.710> what's<00:01:10.830> called<00:01:10.890> tin

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
they developed what's called tin

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.740 
they developed what's called tin
whiskers

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
whiskers

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.060 
whiskers
but<00:01:14.350> anyways<00:01:14.650> I<00:01:16.110> thought<00:01:17.110> maybe<00:01:17.170> removing<00:01:17.920> us

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
but anyways I thought maybe removing us

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.180 
but anyways I thought maybe removing us
a<00:01:18.880> washer<00:01:19.600> from<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.990> screws<00:01:20.230> would<00:01:20.410> help<00:01:20.620> but

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
a washer from the screws would help but

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.490 
a washer from the screws would help but
all<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:21.310> ends<00:01:21.700> up<00:01:21.790> doing<00:01:22.000> is<00:01:22.350> letting<00:01:23.350> the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
all that ends up doing is letting the

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.950 
all that ends up doing is letting the
the<00:01:24.400> heat<00:01:24.580> sink<00:01:24.820> actually<00:01:25.240> touch<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.510> board

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
the heat sink actually touch the board

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.940 
the heat sink actually touch the board
so<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.650> was<00:01:27.340> no<00:01:27.490> good<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:29.500> lot<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.710> times

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
so that was no good and a lot of times

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.090 
so that was no good and a lot of times
it<00:01:30.070> wouldn't<00:01:30.280> work<00:01:30.340> anyways<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.800> figured

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
it wouldn't work anyways so I figured

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.010 
it wouldn't work anyways so I figured
well<00:01:33.220> when<00:01:33.940> I<00:01:33.970> just<00:01:34.210> keep<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.479> same<00:01:34.660> amount<00:01:34.780> of

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
well when I just keep the same amount of

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.430 
well when I just keep the same amount of
screws<00:01:35.860> same<00:01:36.700> amount<00:01:37.000> of<00:01:37.060> washers<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.750> just

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
screws same amount of washers and just

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.550 
screws same amount of washers and just
add<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.619> piece<00:01:38.860> of<00:01:39.510> metal<00:01:40.510> so<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.869> tried<00:01:41.229> it<00:01:41.410> with

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
add a piece of metal so I tried it with

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.230 
add a piece of metal so I tried it with
copper<00:01:42.130> at<00:01:42.460> first<00:01:42.670> because<00:01:42.820> I<00:01:42.940> thought<00:01:43.060> hate

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
copper at first because I thought hate

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.630 
copper at first because I thought hate
coppers<00:01:43.570> good<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:44.650> just<00:01:44.890> paid<00:01:45.100> seat<00:01:45.340> really

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
coppers good it just paid seat really

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.830 
coppers good it just paid seat really
fast<00:01:45.910> put<00:01:46.899> a<00:01:46.930> piece<00:01:47.080> of<00:01:47.110> copper<00:01:47.470> on<00:01:47.590> there<00:01:47.800> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
fast put a piece of copper on there and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.749 
fast put a piece of copper on there and
right<00:01:49.840> on<00:01:49.990> top<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.380> little<00:01:50.590> GPU<00:01:51.040> and<00:01:51.280> it

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
right on top of the little GPU and it

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.460 
right on top of the little GPU and it
booted<00:01:52.300> right<00:01:52.509> up<00:01:52.690> but<00:01:53.050> then<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.290> fans

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
booted right up but then the fans

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.930 
booted right up but then the fans
started<00:01:53.740> running<00:01:54.130> kind<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.369> fast<00:01:54.640> not

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
started running kind of fast not

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.010 
started running kind of fast not
sticking<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.330> myself<00:01:56.040> why<00:01:57.040> would<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.280> do<00:01:57.399> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
sticking to myself why would it do that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.999 
sticking to myself why would it do that
well<00:01:59.020> actually<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.440> kind<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.649> makes<00:01:59.800> sense

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
well actually it kind of makes sense

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.270 
well actually it kind of makes sense
because<00:02:01.229> copper<00:02:02.229> does<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:02.590> dissipates<00:02:03.190> the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
because copper does it dissipates the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.200 
because copper does it dissipates the
heat<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.640> lot<00:02:03.940> faster<00:02:04.360> than<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.630> aluminum<00:02:05.050> does

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
heat a lot faster than the aluminum does

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.880 
heat a lot faster than the aluminum does
eventually<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.600> coppers<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.110> unloading<00:02:08.649> more

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
eventually the coppers is unloading more

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.250 
eventually the coppers is unloading more
heat<00:02:09.130> than<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.399> aluminum<00:02:09.820> handle<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.630> it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
heat than the aluminum handle and it

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.600 
heat than the aluminum handle and it
backs<00:02:11.470> onto<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.890> copper<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.370> then<00:02:12.489> the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
backs onto the copper and then the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.280 
backs onto the copper and then the
copper<00:02:13.000> heats<00:02:13.209> up<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:14.350> lot<00:02:15.190> quicker<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:16.290> there's

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
copper heats up a lot quicker so there's

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.780 
copper heats up a lot quicker so there's
an<00:02:17.440> exchange<00:02:17.799> back<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.190> forth<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.549> where<00:02:18.670> it

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
an exchange back and forth to where it

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.370 
an exchange back and forth to where it
actually<00:02:18.910> starts<00:02:19.299> to<00:02:19.390> overheat<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.840> process

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
actually starts to overheat the process

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.240 
actually starts to overheat the process
action<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:21.940> figured<00:02:22.030> well<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:23.410> heat<00:02:24.070> sink

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
action so I figured well the heat sink

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.430 
action so I figured well the heat sink
itself<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.820> aluminum<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.840> when<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.019> just<00:02:26.290> get<00:02:26.410> a

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
itself is aluminum so when I just get a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.180 
itself is aluminum so when I just get a
piece<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.709> aluminum<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> went<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:29.190> my

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
piece of aluminum so I went to the my

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.979 
piece of aluminum so I went to the my
local<00:02:30.519> hobby<00:02:30.670> shop<00:02:30.820> that<00:02:31.420> sells<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:31.900> know

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
local hobby shop that sells you know

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.750 
local hobby shop that sells you know
model<00:02:32.320> airplanes<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:33.010> trains<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.610> stuff

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
model airplanes and trains and stuff

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.930 
model airplanes and trains and stuff
like<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:35.130> they<00:02:36.130> had<00:02:36.310> pieces<00:02:36.700> of

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
like that and they had pieces of

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.010 
like that and they had pieces of
aluminum<00:02:37.060> there

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
aluminum there

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.840 
aluminum there
and<00:02:39.470> look<00:02:39.620> like<00:02:39.770> this<00:02:39.980> except<00:02:40.610> they're

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
and look like this except they're

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.200 
and look like this except they're
usually<00:02:41.380> like<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.950> much<00:02:43.190> longer<00:02:43.220> if<00:02:43.850> I<00:02:44.000> got

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
usually like this much longer if I got

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.440 
usually like this much longer if I got
to<00:02:44.360> hear<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:44.980> this<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.310> why<00:02:46.640> like<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.150> and

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
to hear and this is why like that and

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.110 
to hear and this is why like that and
what<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:48.680> it's<00:02:48.920> just<00:02:49.010> see<00:02:49.790> it's<00:02:49.970> like<00:02:50.090> a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
what it is it's just see it's like a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.370 
what it is it's just see it's like a
like<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.810> sheet<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.440> really<00:02:51.710> thin<00:02:51.950> sheet<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:54.350> I

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
like a sheet a really thin sheet that I

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.330 
like a sheet a really thin sheet that I
cut<00:02:54.680> into<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.670> little<00:02:56.600> over<00:02:56.870> an<00:02:56.990> inch<00:02:57.110> my<00:02:57.980> little

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
cut into a little over an inch my little

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.960 
cut into a little over an inch my little
over<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.670> half<00:02:58.820> inch<00:02:59.500> well<00:03:00.500> be<00:03:00.620> technical<00:03:01.100> would

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
over a half inch well be technical would

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.620 
over a half inch well be technical would
be<00:03:02.060> like<00:03:02.210> an<00:03:02.360> inch<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.900> eighth<00:03:03.830> or<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.970> set<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.570> a

be like an inch and eighth or a set of a
half<00:03:05.780> inch<00:03:05.990> should<00:03:06.140> be<00:03:06.290> five<00:03:06.860> eighths<00:03:07.100> or

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
half inch should be five eighths or

half inch should be five eighths or
something<00:03:07.640> like<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:08.240> I<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:10.130> cut<00:03:10.670> him<00:03:10.790> with

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
something like that so I I cut him with

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.100 
something like that so I I cut him with
my<00:03:11.000> dremel<00:03:11.360> tool<00:03:11.540> I've<00:03:11.870> done<00:03:13.480> at<00:03:14.480> least<00:03:14.720> at

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110
