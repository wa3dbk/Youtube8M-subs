00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.220
 Sasha revealed a major 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.110
 but was it as easy as it could 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.559
 appear from those who see 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.100
 Only an account of this game but I will not say 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.029
 of course was easy the first game was 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.939
 slight stress 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.640
 but when at the end of the first half they scored 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.730
 of course it was easier in principle, we 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.660
 control the second half the game despite 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.740
 the fact that the pirates and the Urals were 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.110
 good approaches 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.600
 especially so in the middle closer to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.149
 the end here is the second half I think was 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.149
 fully controlled by us or the case 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.520
 before victory but still quite already 1 1 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.039
 championship and so was 20 his 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.230
 control here I mean of course in 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.270
 championship you understand that uefa cup 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.010
 it is a completely different tournament and 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.920
 completely different here in our tournament 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.159
 table points competitors and there won 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.560
 or lost how did you feel on 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.290
 the field is at a position just above the reference 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.670
 ladies right or or up to the bar rather 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.680
 will ha david david 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.830
 as a good position closer to the reference or 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.689
 on the plan you know played today 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.080
 absolutely on all attacking positions 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.909
 starting on the right then on the left then on 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.530
 center depending then still in 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.869
 trends 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.259
 there were replacements for the most part 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.840
 parts I played under the attacker curious 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.180
 in the middle of the first half there is a feeling 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.900
 that villash-boash gave the command and you with 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.820
 oleg 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.310
 yes somewhere in the 22 minute we changed 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.899
 flanks and after another 5 minutes I 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.880
 moved to the center before she left these 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.310
 changes drag positions they occur 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.930
 as agreed with the ballista or 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.409
 glass issues command 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.189
 you know we are in principle thanks 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:04.140
 installation has become what we can change without 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:07.720
 problems here but if starting positions 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.970
 which he sometimes changes the most experience on 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.480
 10 until the end of the first half 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.610
 the impression that there was an installation on 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.380
 leave the other half without 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.780
 the sword that he had no chance 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.430
 was it really so no 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.970
 setting for the second half was to score 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.549
 second goal and win the game will turn out 3 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.500
 up in the third third assist 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.260
 combination took active part 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.299
 it feels like ova 2 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:42.430
 and in the second I just wanted to say about 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:44.940
 third because 1 no yes there already is igor 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.680
 did directly the last pass 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.959
 just transfer to her eyes unexpectedly 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.930
 for everyone except you there is such a feeling 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.799
 what were you waiting for what zone will follow you 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.609
 you know, we have very creative players 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.489
 really 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:05.920
 and before it and not only expect Danin 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:08.650
 transfer run a random house not only 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.180
 congratulated but somehow with clean 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:16.060
 searched 3 2 1 2 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.010
 yes, I'm glad to be sure and because he 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.470
 scored and heard no jokes 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.250
 day off tomorrow 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.790
 all this we too are glad here mast 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.380
 You, too, Oleg asked Igor 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.680
 smolnikov 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.640
 scale shake to can not can yes how 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.860
 just me 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.990
 Renat Sabitov congratulated stability 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.470
 Now I answered him that she was serious 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.540
 wound up 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.580
 but after such a major success in 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.580
 match with the Urals will not be calm 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.460
 mothers of old 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.190
 Well, I hope that of course not and can not 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.260
 be this again another tournament another 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.900
 stage 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.140
 well that the first match with the Italians 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.580
 so you are such a team exactly your 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.940
 viscous but they learn in the last games 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.350
 33 play would not say that they are viscous and 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.020
 of course they did not climb 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.169
 still but by the results they play very 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.180
 attacking football 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.890
 let me ask how you feel 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.019
 now some amount boy 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.370
 behind prodyshatsya takeoff place 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:30.120
 called yes I think it will be better further 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.940
 because the weather will be warmer than the fields 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.240
 better physical condition will still be 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.240
 it is better
