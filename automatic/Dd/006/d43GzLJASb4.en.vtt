00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.170 
better third thing I can recommend is to
bring<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.569> scissors<00:02:16.099> just<00:02:17.099> bring<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.790> little

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
bring a scissors just bring a little

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.040 
bring a scissors just bring a little
knife<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.930> don't<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.380> some<00:02:19.770> sort<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.010> blade

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
knife I don't know some sort of blade

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.770 
knife I don't know some sort of blade
so<00:02:21.200> if<00:02:21.500> things<00:02:21.710> go<00:02:22.040> really<00:02:22.250> wrong<00:02:22.580> like<00:02:23.360> you

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
so if things go really wrong like you

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.380 
so if things go really wrong like you
just<00:02:23.960> can't<00:02:24.290> get<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.620> piece<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.700> do<00:02:25.910> thing

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
just can't get this piece to do thing

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.390 
just can't get this piece to do thing
just<00:02:27.080> cut<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.380> off<00:02:27.530> just<00:02:27.680> cut<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.100> right<00:02:28.160> off

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
just cut it off just cut it right off

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.750 
just cut it off just cut it right off
and<00:02:28.850> then<00:02:30.010> won't<00:02:31.010> have<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.220> worry<00:02:31.370> about<00:02:31.460> it

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.280 

another<00:02:34.760> tip<00:02:35.030> would<00:02:35.180> be<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.390> just<00:02:35.810> go<00:02:36.020> for<00:02:36.260> a

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
another tip would be to just go for a

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.520 
another tip would be to just go for a
totally<00:02:36.650> new<00:02:36.800> look<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.750> don't<00:02:38.750> know<00:02:39.020> if<00:02:39.350> that

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
totally new look I don't know if that

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.600 
totally new look I don't know if that
works<00:02:39.770> like<00:02:40.280> just<00:02:41.260> instead<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.320> side<00:02:43.310> bangs

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610
