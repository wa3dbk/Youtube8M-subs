00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
trout's where I'm at max of nine miles

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.320 
trout's where I'm at max of nine miles
an<00:00:03.510> hour<00:00:04.069> we'll<00:00:05.069> take<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.609> trot<00:00:05.850> rails<00:00:06.089> in<00:00:06.270> a

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
an hour we'll take the trot rails in a

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.540 
an hour we'll take the trot rails in a
little<00:00:06.600> ten<00:00:06.930> miles<00:00:07.140> an<00:00:07.259> hour<00:00:07.429> something<00:00:08.429> like

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
little ten miles an hour something like

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.720 
little ten miles an hour something like
that<00:00:08.760> but<00:00:09.080> like<00:00:10.080> kind<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.530> start<00:00:10.769> up<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.130> get

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
that but like kind of start up and get

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.950 
that but like kind of start up and get
right<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.940> Tanner<00:00:12.440> and<00:00:13.440> go<00:00:14.630> 50<00:00:15.630> yards

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
right to Tanner and go 50 yards

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.120 
right to Tanner and go 50 yards
realizing<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.529> don't<00:00:16.680> want<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.859> pull<00:00:17.039> this

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
realizing we don't want to pull this

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.900 
realizing we don't want to pull this
back<00:00:17.460> now<00:00:17.760> yeah<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.430> just<00:00:20.430> pass<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
back now yeah so just just pass the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.130 
back now yeah so just just pass the
other<00:00:21.090> time<00:00:21.359> sure<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.680> pedestrian<00:00:23.340> side<00:00:24.140> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
other time sure the pedestrian side and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.240 
other time sure the pedestrian side and
then<00:00:25.230> I'll<00:00:25.350> give<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.590> some<00:00:25.740> scissors<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.189> you

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
then I'll give you some scissors and you

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.210 
then I'll give you some scissors and you
can<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:26.519> cut<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.570> off<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:28.740> we'll<00:00:28.859> crank<00:00:29.070> it

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
can just cut it off and we'll crank it

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.800 
can just cut it off and we'll crank it
back<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.580> what<00:00:29.880> kind<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.060> test<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
back in what kind of test is the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.799 
back in what kind of test is the
smoothness<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> startup<00:00:32.300> okay<00:00:33.300> because

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
smoothness and the startup okay because

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.030 
smoothness and the startup okay because
a<00:00:34.100> real<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:36.450> real<00:00:36.480> value<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> drag<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.829> not

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
a real the real value of the drag is not

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.639 
a real the real value of the drag is not
how<00:00:38.250> tight<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.940> clamp<00:00:39.210> down<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.660> drag<00:00:39.870> is

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
how tight you can clamp down the drag is

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.740 
how tight you can clamp down the drag is
that<00:00:40.890> smoothness<00:00:41.370> when<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.000> takes<00:00:42.180> off<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
that smoothness when it takes off the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.319 
that smoothness when it takes off the
fish<00:00:42.899> takes<00:00:43.200> off<00:00:43.460> if<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.730> hiccupping<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
fish takes off if it's hiccupping and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.619 
fish takes off if it's hiccupping and
bouncing<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.079> drag<00:00:46.590> kind<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> clutch

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
bouncing and drag kind of like a clutch

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.590 
bouncing and drag kind of like a clutch
but<00:00:48.629> rods<00:00:48.930> banging<00:00:49.440> that's<00:00:50.160> no<00:00:50.460> good<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:51.449> no

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
but rods banging that's no good get no

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.260 
but rods banging that's no good get no
feel<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.989> want<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.289> thing<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:53.270> like

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
feel you want this thing to just go like

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.220 
feel you want this thing to just go like
that<00:00:54.480> mm-hmm<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.559> good<00:00:55.770> drag<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.699> then

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
that mm-hmm that's a good drag and then

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.689 
that mm-hmm that's a good drag and then
after<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.320> cut<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> off<00:00:58.680> we're<00:00:59.520> going<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
after you cut it off we're going to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.279 
after you cut it off we're going to
crank<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.180> as<00:01:00.329> fast<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.960> kind<00:01:01.260> of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
crank it in as fast as we can kind of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.500 
crank it in as fast as we can kind of
time<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.739> see<00:01:02.309> how<00:01:02.399> fast<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:02.940> gather<00:01:03.210> line

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
time it see how fast it can gather line

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.210 
time it see how fast it can gather line
so<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> simulate<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> fish<00:01:04.739> running<00:01:05.040> back

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
so to simulate a fish running back

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
so to simulate a fish running back
toward<00:01:05.460> us<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:08.180> then<00:01:09.180> we'll<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.540> look<00:01:09.659> at

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
toward us and then we'll just look at

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.469 
toward us and then we'll just look at
the<00:01:09.900> rails<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.409> take<00:01:10.560> apart<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.270> but<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.360> can

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the rails and take apart and but we can

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.020 
the rails and take apart and but we can
do<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.720> after<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> fact<00:01:13.610> see<00:01:14.610> we've<00:01:14.790> burned

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
do that after the fact see we've burned

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.520 
do that after the fact see we've burned
any<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.600> anything<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.080> well<00:01:16.409> look

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
any up or anything like that well look

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.640 
any up or anything like that well look
at<00:01:16.680> him<00:01:16.799> see<00:01:16.950> how<00:01:17.070> they<00:01:17.220> did<00:01:18.259> see<00:01:19.259> how<00:01:19.380> easy

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
at him see how they did see how easy

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.550 
at him see how they did see how easy
they<00:01:19.979> are<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.630> take<00:01:21.630> apart<00:01:21.869> look<00:01:22.170> at<00:01:22.380> for

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
they are to take apart look at for

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.899 
they are to take apart look at for
maintenance<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.280> those<00:01:23.369> things<00:01:23.640> but

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
maintenance and all those things but

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.080 
maintenance and all those things but
it's<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.869> qualitative<00:01:25.560> measure<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.909> want

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
it's a qualitative measure I just want

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.609 
it's a qualitative measure I just want
to<00:01:27.119> see<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.360> smooth<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> drag<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.320> at<00:01:28.470> first

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
to see how smooth the drag is at first

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.920 
to see how smooth the drag is at first
okay<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:30.119> we're<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.420> want<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.600> do<00:01:30.780> is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
okay what we're going to want to do is

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.810 
okay what we're going to want to do is
crank<00:01:31.170> them<00:01:31.259> about<00:01:31.500> halfway<00:01:31.770> down<00:01:32.189> about

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
crank them about halfway down about

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.060 
crank them about halfway down about
where<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> would<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.810> were

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
where you would have it if you were

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.190 
where you would have it if you were
fishing<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.280> real<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:36.750> don't<00:01:36.900> want<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> have

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
fishing for real you don't want to have

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.660 
fishing for real you don't want to have
it<00:01:37.290> overly<00:01:37.650> cranked

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
it overly cranked

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.490 
it overly cranked
here<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.360> burn<00:01:39.540> them<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.350> sake

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
here to burn them up just for the sake

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
here to burn them up just for the sake
of<00:01:40.530> doing<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> don't<00:01:42.000> want<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> take<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
of doing so and you don't want to take a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.359 
of doing so and you don't want to take a
break<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.900> him<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.290> make<00:01:43.799> sure<00:01:43.830> it<00:01:44.009> real<00:01:44.159> easy

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
break on him and make sure it real easy

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.850 
break on him and make sure it real easy
so<00:01:44.759> I'm<00:01:44.909> gonna<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.150> free<00:01:45.540> spool<00:01:45.750> out<00:01:45.990> crank

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
so I'm gonna just free spool out crank

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.440 
so I'm gonna just free spool out crank
it<00:01:46.950> down<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> realistic<00:01:47.939> setting<00:01:48.240> this

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
it down to a realistic setting this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.929 
it down to a realistic setting this
should<00:01:48.869> go<00:01:49.080> see<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.530> happens<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.790> then

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
should go see what happens and then

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.639 
should go see what happens and then
we're<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.270> watch<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.689> rod<00:01:51.899> action<00:01:52.439> make

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
we're going to watch the rod action make

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.530 
we're going to watch the rod action make
it<00:01:52.799> banging<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.280> lot<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.360> real

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
it banging a lot and if the real

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.889 
it banging a lot and if the real
chirping<00:01:55.440> or<00:01:55.619> hiccupping<00:01:56.039> or<00:01:56.450> making<00:01:57.450> movies

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
chirping or hiccupping or making movies

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.639 
chirping or hiccupping or making movies
or<00:01:58.080> smoking<00:01:58.409> or<00:01:58.619> whatever<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.130> doing<00:01:59.190> no<00:02:00.030> no

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
or smoking or whatever it's doing no no

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.580 
or smoking or whatever it's doing no no
so<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:02.270> think<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.509> best<00:02:03.689> little<00:02:03.869> do<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.439> go

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
so I think the best little do is to go

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.870 
so I think the best little do is to go
five<00:02:05.250> week<00:02:06.020> trout<00:02:07.160> nine<00:02:08.160> or<00:02:08.399> ten<00:02:08.550> miles<00:02:08.759> an

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
five week trout nine or ten miles an

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.850 
five week trout nine or ten miles an
hour<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:09.360> we'll<00:02:09.780> do<00:02:09.869> bonefish<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
hour and then we'll do bonefish the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.390 
hour and then we'll do bonefish the
eight<00:02:11.039> wait<00:02:11.250> at<00:02:11.940> 23<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:13.200> 25<00:02:13.560> miles<00:02:13.830> an<00:02:13.950> hour<00:02:14.069> and

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
eight wait at 23 to 25 miles an hour and

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.300 
eight wait at 23 to 25 miles an hour and
then<00:02:15.330> we'll<00:02:15.450> do<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.630> unlimited<00:02:16.110> class<00:02:16.560> and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
then we'll do the unlimited class and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.630 
then we'll do the unlimited class and
kind<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.910> get<00:02:18.239> on<00:02:18.360> guess
