00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
Laurinaitis and when you look at the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.300 
Laurinaitis and when you look at the
receiving<00:01:16.570> corps<00:01:16.930> I'm<00:01:17.380> sorry<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.830> defensive

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
receiving corps I'm sorry the defensive

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.340 
receiving corps I'm sorry the defensive
backs<00:01:18.490> going<00:01:19.030> against<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.330> 49ers<00:01:19.570> receiving

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
backs going against the 49ers receiving

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.930 
backs going against the 49ers receiving
corps<00:01:20.530> they<00:01:20.740> actually<00:01:21.100> match<00:01:21.310> up<00:01:21.520> very<00:01:21.550> well

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
corps they actually match up very well

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.510 
corps they actually match up very well
so<00:01:22.570> really<00:01:23.020> it's<00:01:23.410> about<00:01:23.590> putting<00:01:23.980> the<00:01:24.100> Niners

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
so really it's about putting the Niners

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.640 
so really it's about putting the Niners
and<00:01:24.610> backed<00:01:25.090> up<00:01:25.270> situations<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:25.960> letting

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
and backed up situations and letting

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.100 
and backed up situations and letting
those<00:01:26.800> corners<00:01:27.370> play<00:01:27.910> tight<00:01:28.210> press<00:01:28.600> thus

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
those corners play tight press thus

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.050 
those corners play tight press thus
putting<00:01:29.500> pressure<00:01:29.830> on<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.310> quarterback<00:01:30.550> and

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
putting pressure on the quarterback and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.820 
putting pressure on the quarterback and
getting<00:01:31.600> Alex<00:01:31.930> meant<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.170> hold<00:01:32.290> that<00:01:32.440> football

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
getting Alex meant to hold that football

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.650 
getting Alex meant to hold that football
just<00:01:33.010> a<00:01:33.130> little<00:01:33.370> bit<00:01:33.490> too<00:01:33.610> long<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:34.060> where<00:01:34.240> you

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
just a little bit too long to where you

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.550 
just a little bit too long to where you
could<00:01:34.810> possibly<00:01:35.260> come<00:01:35.650> away<00:01:35.860> with<00:01:35.890> some<00:01:36.040> sex

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
could possibly come away with some sex

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.930 
could possibly come away with some sex
moving<00:01:38.560> over<00:01:38.680> to<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:39.010> 49ers<00:01:39.670> in<00:01:39.760> this

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
moving over to the 49ers in this

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.400 
moving over to the 49ers in this
ballgame<00:01:40.180> and<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.690> look<00:01:40.870> at<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.050> receiving

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
ballgame and you look at the receiving

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.200 
ballgame and you look at the receiving
corps<00:01:41.710> in<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.920> passing<00:01:42.340> game<00:01:42.370> as<00:01:42.730> a<00:01:42.760> whole<00:01:43.000> I

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
corps in the passing game as a whole I

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.150 
corps in the passing game as a whole I
think<00:01:43.420> that's<00:01:43.660> how<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.900> 49ers<00:01:44.500> should<00:01:44.740> open

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
think that's how the 49ers should open

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.920 
think that's how the 49ers should open
up<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.400> ball<00:01:45.610> game<00:01:45.850> we<00:01:46.270> know<00:01:46.480> they<00:01:46.630> can<00:01:46.810> run

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
up the ball game we know they can run

easier to run the football and we look

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.650 
easier to run the football and we look

at the Niners x factor I think the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.240 
at the Niners x factor I think the
nickel<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.200> dime<00:02:52.410> corners<00:02:52.860> will<00:02:53.040> be

let's look at the personnel breakdown in

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.950 
let's look at the personnel breakdown in
this<00:03:08.520> ballgame<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.000> right<00:03:09.360> now<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.600> Rams

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
this ballgame and right now the Rams

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.930 
this ballgame and right now the Rams
passing<00:03:10.560> attack<00:03:10.830> has<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.070> lot<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.580> prove<00:03:11.730> now

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
passing attack has a lot to prove now

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.670 
passing attack has a lot to prove now
they've<00:03:12.120> improved<00:03:12.480> over<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.900> last<00:03:12.990> couple<00:03:13.440> of

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.070 
they've improved over the last couple of
games<00:03:13.740> but<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> huge<00:03:15.420> test<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:15.810> the

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
games but this is a huge test for the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
game will be very close I like the 49ers

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.560 
game will be very close I like the 49ers
in<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.430> ballgame<00:03:32.670> when<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.030> look<00:03:33.270> at<00:03:33.390> their

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
in this ballgame when I look at their

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.630 
in this ballgame when I look at their
passing<00:03:34.080> attack<00:03:34.380> vs<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:34.890> Rams<00:03:35.100> passing

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
passing attack vs the Rams passing

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.460 
passing attack vs the Rams passing
attack<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.330> can<00:03:36.510> trust<00:03:36.690> San<00:03:36.930> Francisco<00:03:37.410> to

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
attack you can trust San Francisco to

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.020 
attack you can trust San Francisco to
make<00:03:37.680> plays<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.340> are<00:03:38.370> needed<00:03:38.640> in<00:03:38.940> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
make plays that are needed in the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.090 
make plays that are needed in the
passing<00:03:39.450> game<00:03:39.480> just<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.350> loosen<00:03:40.530> up<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:40.770> box

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
passing game just to loosen up that box

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.920 
passing game just to loosen up that box
in<00:03:41.310> defensively<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:42.000> think<00:03:42.360> they'll<00:03:42.540> still<00:03:42.900> be

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
in defensively I think they'll still be

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.990 
in defensively I think they'll still be
aggressive<00:03:43.680> they<00:03:43.770> can<00:03:43.920> go<00:03:44.040> for<00:03:44.370> wide<00:03:44.670> and

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
aggressive they can go for wide and

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.760 
aggressive they can go for wide and
spread<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.600> 49ers<00:03:46.050> out<00:03:46.170> but<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.320> still<00:03:46.530> think

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
spread the 49ers out but I still think

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.260 
spread the 49ers out but I still think
they<00:03:46.920> will<00:03:47.160> be<00:03:47.310> able<00:03:47.490> to<00:03:47.700> get<00:03:47.790> pressure<00:03:48.030> with

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
they will be able to get pressure with

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.940 
they will be able to get pressure with
their<00:03:48.420> front<00:03:48.720> three<00:03:49.020> so<00:03:49.500> i'll<00:03:49.650> look<00:03:49.740> for<00:03:49.920> the
