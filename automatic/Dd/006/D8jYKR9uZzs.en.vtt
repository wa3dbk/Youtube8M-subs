00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.740
 these ads could be too much of a wait for the next turn 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.359
 after strong progression in very successful withdrawal 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.380
 and per cent meanwhile we had the cetacean spot belly that they were 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.480
 two years 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.579
 so 5 2% had a boulevard to prove their deep that's it 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.410
 domination on the game of auto simulation on consoles 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.860
 what was obviously expected in theatrical form very much 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.320
 of impatience 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.320
 Saturday 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.530
 ben laden for the most important and successful ones under the name of this 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.540
 episode takes place in the hall of honor 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.940
 go on the present a car driver already met the site 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.830
 the apts in dollars and if he went much heavier in almost fifteen 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.530
 word all aspects footprint of the driving part all the cities of the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.800
 north we will talk mainly about his game simulation 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.370
 the most advanced pole the most advanced 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.500
 one side gameplay 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.010
 we find there adp finer more precise with approaches more 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.010
 measured 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.810
 the troublamours that a more realistic approach more simulation still 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.390
 than his previous Montreal 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.190
 more quickly its limits especially at the wheel 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.090
 we all find ourselves with gameplay accessible both to 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.530
 avalats put driving and what to pay more attention to 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.230
 accelerations are on sale on braking 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.690
 e but it remains quite accessible business 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.609
 two astronauts of the shuttle columbia 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.809
 in addition to more stations to better feedback we will really say 

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:44.809
 lasts longer than current ones 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.710
 no other very important point when talking about a type of this 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.690
 scale for others it's obviously the graphic part 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.690
 the graphic part is expected at the turning especially after all this is what 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.290
 who shocks me it's video of the ubs the part photo vista and it's gone on 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.750
 wants all cars in very high quality angle so obviously there for 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.210
 the viewing invest totally bluffing 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.220
 Rouen is in the race for percent to be successful with a child is 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.150
 really unruffled and she should be strong for the decors 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.640
 demobilization or even if a little bit annoying them the light effects are 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.300
 Flemish parties striking two towers at spa and moliers more realistic 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.739
 despite yet a little side the video game in the sound menu which are 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.299
 less a little bit this week 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.049
 like that and that I really have this side gold and more compared to 3 3 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.449
 me 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:34.739
 the visual even more successful 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.980
 she was also the table by all the part contained in fact that she pierces 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.250
 still improved by cons that maija has put on sale 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.859
 the last point which is against there we are a bit a bad point in not 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.289
 fear a title really simplified especially following the arrival of de 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.099
 kinect in the loss part 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.849
 yes says affirming his hole with a career it's true a little too much 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:59.599
 simplified 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.129
 a man in the world of falling out the vehicles coming from all 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.129
 characteristics so we did more than the logan in force 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.579
 such a high level of shopping consumers need to finish their 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.259
 appearance in the first three to call them to peace passes to the 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.620
 next just simply not the answers 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.980
 the sony career rock and pop console too simplified that is a little bit a 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.829
 little bit patey goes very well between the queries formulated around Roma 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.519
 despite its very long life 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.840
 go we also find some simplifications level of the ally 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.389
 with pretty disappointing that is less successful than in the previous 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.069
 episode 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.829
 more than a possible obviously 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.619
 we can not not speak actually of the lack of weather that and 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.619
 frankly a pity for the title at stake 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.620
 this format sold his soul to the devil by going to the cashier nations 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.129
 the answer is clearly not found 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.400
 strong moment it really in good shape 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.709
 always so blue are on a lot of aspects certainly the few 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.959
 simplifications especially the rear part some disappointments if the 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.049
 sides there is a weather side so absent 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.940
 we find children every year 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.920
 in great shape it becomes obvious the new reference as 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.829
 that safe destination on consoles 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.339
 with all its exceptional content 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:12.639
 the gameplay is really the pib still has a lot farther and more accurate more 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.670
 end is really more almost all levels 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.989
 besides this sect clermont ferrand 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:19.609
 automotive
