gun<00:01:22.290> damage<00:01:23.220> seemed<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.700> okay<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> put

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
gun damage seemed to be okay on it put

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.690 
gun damage seemed to be okay on it put
like<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.409> said<00:01:25.680> wasn't<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.130> using<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.549> too

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
like I said wasn't really using it too

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.219 
like I said wasn't really using it too
much<00:01:26.820> because<00:01:27.150> when<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> was<00:01:27.720> playing<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.110> was

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
much because when I was playing I was

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.690 
much because when I was playing I was
using<00:01:28.590> these<00:01:28.770> sweaty<00:01:29.040> guns<00:01:29.280> such<00:01:29.460> as<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
using these sweaty guns such as the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.789 
using these sweaty guns such as the
bowel<00:01:29.909> AK<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.659> ASM<00:01:31.110> one<00:01:31.259> trying<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.560> get<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
bowel AK and ASM one trying to get you

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.069 
bowel AK and ASM one trying to get you
guys<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.189> DNA<00:01:32.670> bomb<00:01:32.850> which<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.420> will<00:01:33.630> get<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> will

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
guys a DNA bomb which I will get I will

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.170 
guys a DNA bomb which I will get I will
get<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> DNA<00:01:34.439> amount<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:34.979> probably<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> can

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
get a DNA amount on probably I can

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.460 
get a DNA amount on probably I can
probably<00:01:36.450> go<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:36.930> all<00:01:37.110> four<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
probably go for one on all four of the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.890 
probably go for one on all four of the
maps<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.700> let's<00:01:38.880> get<00:01:38.970> into<00:01:39.119> those<00:01:39.299> formats<00:01:39.720> so

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
maps so let's get into those formats so

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.080 
maps so let's get into those formats so
let's<00:01:40.470> start<00:01:40.650> with<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> gameplay<00:01:41.100> let's

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
let's start with the gameplay let's

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.130 
let's start with the gameplay let's
start<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> map<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.659> guys<00:01:42.869> are<00:01:43.020> watching

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
start the map that you guys are watching

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.319 
start the map that you guys are watching
in<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> second<00:01:44.250> half<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> video<00:01:44.729> known<00:01:45.180> as

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
in the second half of the video known as

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.359 
in the second half of the video known as
urban<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:46.560> probably<00:01:46.799> my<00:01:46.890> favorite<00:01:47.250> map

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
urban it's probably my favorite map

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
urban it's probably my favorite map
that's<00:01:47.579> inside<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.420> map<00:01:48.630> pack<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.079> is

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that's inside of this map pack it is

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.600 
that's inside of this map pack it is
definitely<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> smallest<00:01:50.040> Matt<00:01:50.310> people<00:01:50.549> are

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
definitely the smallest Matt people are

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.429 
definitely the smallest Matt people are
comparing<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.240> nuketown<00:01:51.659> which<00:01:52.320> is

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
comparing it to nuketown which is

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.899 
comparing it to nuketown which is
interesting<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.130> didn't<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.610> new

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
interesting because I didn't think a new

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.460 
interesting because I didn't think a new
account<00:01:54.149> type<00:01:54.420> map<00:01:54.630> would<00:01:54.780> really<00:01:55.110> work<00:01:55.290> in

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
account type map would really work in

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.990 
account type map would really work in
advanced<00:01:55.740> warfare<00:01:56.159> with<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.369> exosuits<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
advanced warfare with the exosuits and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.850 
advanced warfare with the exosuits and
how<00:01:57.570> fast<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> map<00:01:58.710> but

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
how fast you can have to get the map but

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.770 
how fast you can have to get the map but
there's<00:01:59.280> enough<00:01:59.520> levels<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.329> map<00:02:00.509> where

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
there's enough levels on this map where

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.359 
there's enough levels on this map where
it<00:02:00.869> kind<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.170> works<00:02:01.469> having<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.920> exosuits<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
it kind of works having the exosuits and

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.609 
it kind of works having the exosuits and
it<00:02:02.670> does<00:02:02.820> still<00:02:03.090> feel<00:02:03.299> really<00:02:03.600> small<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:04.079> could

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it does still feel really small I could

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.440 
it does still feel really small I could
definitely<00:02:04.710> see<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.100> lot<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.430> gameplay<00:02:06.030> records

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
definitely see a lot of gameplay records

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.150 
definitely see a lot of gameplay records
being<00:02:06.659> honest<00:02:07.079> once<00:02:07.350> more<00:02:07.649> people<00:02:07.920> got<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
being honest once more people got the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.210 
being honest once more people got the
DLC<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.520> there's<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.879> lot<00:02:09.830> worse<00:02:10.830> players

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
DLC and there's a lot worse players

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.160 
DLC and there's a lot worse players
playing<00:02:11.970> these<00:02:12.180> DLC<00:02:12.720> map<00:02:12.870> packs<00:02:13.050> because

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
playing these DLC map packs because

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.820 
playing these DLC map packs because

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
in the mosh pit playlist the players are

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.600 
in the mosh pit playlist the players are
still<00:02:15.390> really<00:02:15.630> sweaty<00:02:15.990> but<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.370> come

the weekend they'll definitely be some
double<00:02:20.010> DNA's<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.700> map<00:02:20.850> in<00:02:21.030> 100<00:02:21.360> plusses

double DNA's on this map in 100 plusses

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.230 
double DNA's on this map in 100 plusses
another<00:02:23.040> map<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.400> mention<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.820> sideshow

weird like sound and design wise but

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.330 
weird like sound and design wise but
it's<00:02:45.870> pretty<00:02:46.110> cool<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.830> only<00:02:46.980> thing<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.160> the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
it's pretty cool the only thing is the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.250 
it's pretty cool the only thing is the
map<00:02:47.460> is<00:02:47.640> extremely<00:02:48.390> open<00:02:48.690> there<00:02:48.840> isn't<00:02:49.140> really

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
map is extremely open there isn't really

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.620 
map is extremely open there isn't really
a<00:02:49.380> lot<00:02:49.710> of<00:02:49.890> cover<00:02:50.130> at<00:02:50.340> all<00:02:50.580> there<00:02:51.300> are<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.450> few

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
a lot of cover at all there are a few

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.150 
a lot of cover at all there are a few
buildings<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.140> get<00:02:52.320> camping<00:02:52.709> for<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.950> but

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
buildings you get camping for the but

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.949 
buildings you get camping for the but
for<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.430> most<00:02:53.640> part<00:02:53.760> you're<00:02:54.030> really<00:02:54.540> exposed

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
for the most part you're really exposed

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.750 
for the most part you're really exposed
but<00:02:55.380> again<00:02:55.530> it's<00:02:55.680> kind<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.950> smaller<00:02:56.250> map<00:02:56.520> and

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
but again it's kind of a smaller map and

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.540 
but again it's kind of a smaller map and
I<00:02:57.750> definitely<00:02:58.350> could<00:02:58.740> see<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.920> few<00:02:59.100> game<00:02:59.370> plays

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
I definitely could see a few game plays

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.490 
I definitely could see a few game plays
on<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.880> next<00:03:00.300> type<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.570> drift<00:03:00.959> district<00:03:01.320> maps

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
on it next type is drift district maps

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.110 
on it next type is drift district maps
really<00:03:01.950> interesting<00:03:02.340> as<00:03:02.550> well<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.790> kind<00:03:03.090> of

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
really interesting as well I kind of

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.720 
really interesting as well I kind of
like<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.570> really<00:03:03.840> really<00:03:04.320> reminds<00:03:04.830> me<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.130> I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
like it it really really reminds me of I

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.430 
like it it really really reminds me of I
believe<00:03:06.209> it's<00:03:06.360> called<00:03:06.390> down<00:03:06.750> hills<00:03:07.050> from<00:03:07.320> the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
believe it's called down hills from the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.500 
believe it's called down hills from the
first<00:03:07.650> map<00:03:07.860> pack<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.310> black<00:03:08.610> ops<00:03:08.820> 2<00:03:09.060> i<00:03:09.090> believe

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
first map pack and black ops 2 i believe

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.600 
first map pack and black ops 2 i believe
which<00:03:10.020> usually<00:03:10.770> wouldn't<00:03:11.130> be<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.280> good<00:03:11.400> things

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
which usually wouldn't be a good things

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.310 
which usually wouldn't be a good things
i<00:03:11.760> wasn't<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.150> fan<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.390> map<00:03:12.660> but<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.110> seems

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
i wasn't really a fan I map but it seems

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.780 
i wasn't really a fan I map but it seems
to<00:03:13.470> work<00:03:13.680> pretty<00:03:13.950> well<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.370> game<00:03:14.580> it's

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
to work pretty well in this game it's

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.730 
to work pretty well in this game it's
not<00:03:14.940> as<00:03:15.120> big<00:03:15.510> as<00:03:15.720> downhill<00:03:16.080> was<00:03:16.230> but<00:03:16.650> the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
not as big as downhill was but the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.229 
not as big as downhill was but the
design<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.459> snow<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.730> very

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
design of it and the snow is very

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.300 
design of it and the snow is very
similar<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.810> halfway<00:03:19.530> through<00:03:19.860> around<00:03:20.160> the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
similar and halfway through around the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.820 
similar and halfway through around the
nomination<00:03:20.850> there<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.590> similar<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.709> like

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
nomination there is the similar to like

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.800 
nomination there is the similar to like
recovery<00:03:23.370> how<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.940> like<00:03:24.090> splits<00:03:24.450> off<00:03:24.570> in<00:03:24.720> a

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
recovery how it like splits off in a

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.210 
recovery how it like splits off in a
two-match<00:03:25.140> there's<00:03:25.410> like<00:03:25.530> an<00:03:25.650> avalanche<00:03:25.830> that

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
two-match there's like an avalanche that

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.940 
two-match there's like an avalanche that
comes<00:03:26.959> just<00:03:27.959> stupid<00:03:28.320> stuff<00:03:28.410> like<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.650> I've

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
comes just stupid stuff like that I've

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.500 
comes just stupid stuff like that I've
never<00:03:29.220> been<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.489> huge<00:03:29.760> fan<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:30.090> like<00:03:30.390> those

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
never been a huge fan of like those

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.199 
never been a huge fan of like those
whole<00:03:30.890> like<00:03:31.890> interactive<00:03:32.489> maps<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.090> like

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
whole like interactive maps and like

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.990 
whole like interactive maps and like
shit<00:03:33.450> like<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.810> like<00:03:34.019> unrecovered

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
shit like that and like unrecovered

shit like that and like unrecovered
switching<00:03:36.000> sides<00:03:36.239> have<00:03:36.420> never<00:03:36.570> really<00:03:36.750> been<00:03:36.870> a

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
switching sides have never really been a

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.509 
switching sides have never really been a
fan<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.350> those<00:03:37.590> kinds<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.920> gimmicks<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.370> can

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
fan of those kinds of gimmicks I can

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.340 
fan of those kinds of gimmicks I can
understand<00:03:39.000> why<00:03:39.090> they<00:03:39.480> put<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.080> in<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
understand why they put the it in the

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.990 
understand why they put the it in the
game<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:40.980> could<00:03:41.160> just<00:03:41.190> understand<00:03:41.850> who

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
game and I could just understand who

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.970 
game and I could just understand who
they're<00:03:42.209> trying<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.540> appeal<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.810> but<00:03:43.560> for<00:03:43.860> me

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
they're trying to appeal to but for me

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.440 
they're trying to appeal to but for me
personally<00:03:44.010> enjoyed<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:44.850> fan<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.120> would<00:03:45.330> prefer

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
personally enjoyed a fan I would prefer

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.229 
personally enjoyed a fan I would prefer
just<00:03:45.720> normal<00:03:46.170> maps<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:47.610> then<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.850> last<00:03:48.000> map

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
just normal maps and then the last map

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.680 
just normal maps and then the last map
to<00:03:48.390> mention<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:49.130> no<00:03:50.130> hon<00:03:50.489> there's<00:03:50.790> sideshow

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
to mention is no hon there's sideshow

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.770 
to mention is no hon there's sideshow
urban<00:03:52.590> drift<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.519> then<00:03:54.000> there's<00:03:54.180> cork<00:03:54.540> or

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
urban drift and then there's cork or

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.300 
urban drift and then there's cork or
outright<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.380> i<00:03:55.410> forgot<00:03:55.830> about<00:03:55.860> cork<00:03:56.220> is

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
outright that i forgot about cork is

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.280 
outright that i forgot about cork is
it's<00:03:56.459> probably<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:57.000> worst<00:03:57.239> map<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.690> them<00:03:58.200> all

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
it's probably the worst map of them all

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.500 
it's probably the worst map of them all
this<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.530> only<00:03:58.650> like<00:03:58.890> really<00:03:59.160> big<00:03:59.489> map<00:03:59.700> in<00:03:59.970> here

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
this is only like really big map in here

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.940 
this is only like really big map in here
there's<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.780> lot<00:04:01.019> of<00:04:01.050> different<00:04:01.440> levels<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.830> it

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
there's a lot of different levels to it

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.920 
there's a lot of different levels to it
and<00:04:02.070> just<00:04:02.130> design-wise<00:04:02.850> is<00:04:03.030> just<00:04:03.209> really<00:04:03.660> ugly

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
and just design-wise is just really ugly

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.690 
and just design-wise is just really ugly
like<00:04:04.260> it's<00:04:04.410> kind<00:04:04.590> of<00:04:04.620> bright<00:04:04.920> because<00:04:05.519> it

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
like it's kind of bright because it

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.190 
like it's kind of bright because it
takes<00:04:05.880> place<00:04:06.120> in<00:04:06.239> like<00:04:06.360> a<00:04:06.390> desert<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:07.050> don't

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
takes place in like a desert I don't

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.660 
takes place in like a desert I don't
even<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.560> couldn't<00:04:07.769> even<00:04:07.980> describe<00:04:08.130> what<00:04:08.489> kind

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
even I couldn't even describe what kind

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.220 
even I couldn't even describe what kind
of<00:04:08.700> fucking<00:04:09.000> places<00:04:09.209> takes<00:04:09.540> place<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.110> be

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
of fucking places takes place and to be

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.840 
of fucking places takes place and to be
completely<00:04:10.380> honest<00:04:10.950> might<00:04:11.459> be<00:04:11.580> from<00:04:11.700> the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
completely honest might be from the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.250 
completely honest might be from the
campaign<00:04:12.209> or<00:04:12.360> something<00:04:12.630> I<00:04:12.720> didn't<00:04:12.959> play<00:04:13.140> it

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
campaign or something I didn't play it

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.140 
campaign or something I didn't play it
but<00:04:13.440> it's<00:04:13.799> a<00:04:13.830> very<00:04:13.860> weird<00:04:14.310> location<00:04:14.940> it's<00:04:15.120> a

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
but it's a very weird location it's a

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.520 
but it's a very weird location it's a
lot<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.360> desert<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.840> Sun<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:16.169> it's<00:04:16.290> not<00:04:16.350> like

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
lot of desert and Sun so it's not like

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.170 
lot of desert and Sun so it's not like
it's<00:04:16.919> very<00:04:17.010> bright<00:04:17.400> but<00:04:17.669> like<00:04:17.850> everything

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
it's very bright but like everything

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.570 
it's very bright but like everything
else<00:04:18.359> is<00:04:18.540> like<00:04:18.690> all<00:04:18.870> rusty<00:04:19.380> metal<00:04:19.590> walls<00:04:20.250> and

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
else is like all rusty metal walls and

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.560 
else is like all rusty metal walls and
everything<00:04:20.609> like<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.030> it's<00:04:21.239> not<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.359> very

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
everything like that it's not a very

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.090 
everything like that it's not a very
appealing<00:04:21.930> map<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.410> look<00:04:22.590> at<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:22.800> my<00:04:22.890> opinion

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
appealing map to look at in my opinion

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.550 
appealing map to look at in my opinion
I'm<00:04:24.000> like<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.180> said<00:04:24.419> there's<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.600> lot<00:04:24.720> of<00:04:24.750> very

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
I'm like I said there's a lot of very

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.990 
I'm like I said there's a lot of very
there's<00:04:25.919> a<00:04:25.950> lot<00:04:26.070> of<00:04:26.100> different<00:04:26.400> levels<00:04:26.700> it's

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
there's a lot of different levels it's

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.310 
there's a lot of different levels it's
very

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
very

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.690 
very
big<00:04:27.470> there's<00:04:28.040> lot<00:04:28.130> of<00:04:28.190> places<00:04:28.370> for<00:04:28.550> people

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
big there's lot of places for people

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.840 
big there's lot of places for people
just<00:04:28.940> camp<00:04:29.450> so<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.660> wasn't<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.140> huge<00:04:30.290> fan<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.620> this

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
just camp so I wasn't a huge fan of this

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.160 
just camp so I wasn't a huge fan of this
that<00:04:31.850> map<00:04:32.030> at<00:04:32.180> all<00:04:32.330> especially<00:04:32.600> when<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.020> was

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
that map at all especially when I was

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.110 
that map at all especially when I was
playing<00:04:33.290> like<00:04:33.950> TDM<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:34.640> was<00:04:34.730> just<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.000> most

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
playing like TDM it was just the most

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.060 
playing like TDM it was just the most
slow-paced<00:04:35.720> map<00:04:35.990> which<00:04:36.530> is<00:04:36.680> weird<00:04:36.860> as<00:04:36.980> the

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
slow-paced map which is weird as the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.280 
slow-paced map which is weird as the
other<00:04:37.190> maps<00:04:37.400> are<00:04:37.670> decently<00:04:38.540> sized<00:04:38.780> of<00:04:38.960> medium

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
other maps are decently sized of medium

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.200 
other maps are decently sized of medium
to<00:04:39.440> small<00:04:39.470> maps<00:04:39.950> which<00:04:40.550> is<00:04:40.730> which<00:04:40.970> is<00:04:41.000> good

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
to small maps which is which is good

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.000 
to small maps which is which is good
that's<00:04:41.360> overall<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.200> think<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.440> reason<00:04:42.740> why<00:04:42.980> i

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
that's overall I think the reason why i

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.650 
that's overall I think the reason why i
would<00:04:43.280> say<00:04:43.490> i<00:04:43.520> would<00:04:43.640> recommend<00:04:44.180> buying<00:04:44.390> this

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
would say i would recommend buying this

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.630 
would say i would recommend buying this

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
multiplayer is the maps are small which

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.350 
multiplayer is the maps are small which
is<00:04:48.980> like<00:04:49.160> it's<00:04:49.430> not<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.550> problem<00:04:49.910> advanced

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
what they are but if you were looking

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.980 
what they are but if you were looking
for<00:04:55.550> smaller<00:04:55.850> maps<00:04:56.150> map<00:04:56.480> similar<00:04:56.780> like

for smaller maps map similar like

for smaller maps map similar like
Newtown<00:04:57.470> dome<00:04:57.860> then<00:04:58.400> this<00:04:58.550> map<00:04:58.790> pack<00:04:59.000> does

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
Newtown dome then this map pack does

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.290 
Newtown dome then this map pack does
have<00:04:59.690> them<00:04:59.870> inside<00:05:00.470> show<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.010> in<00:05:01.700> urban<00:05:02.180> and

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
have them inside show and in urban and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.230 
have them inside show and in urban and
the<00:05:03.110> other<00:05:03.380> two<00:05:03.680> are<00:05:03.710> decently<00:05:04.610> sized<00:05:04.880> course

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
the other two are decently sized course

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.360 
the other two are decently sized course
pretty<00:05:05.510> big<00:05:05.690> but<00:05:06.170> overall<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.710> maps<00:05:06.920> I<00:05:07.130> think

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
pretty big but overall the maps I think

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.470 
pretty big but overall the maps I think
in<00:05:07.520> this<00:05:07.610> map<00:05:07.790> pack<00:05:07.970> we're<00:05:08.150> actually<00:05:08.240> really

in this map pack we're actually really

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.670 
in this map pack we're actually really
good<00:05:08.660> which<00:05:08.840> is<00:05:08.960> surprising<00:05:09.410> because<00:05:09.440> I'm

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
good which is surprising because I'm

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.080 
good which is surprising because I'm
usually<00:05:09.800> not<00:05:09.980> a<00:05:10.160> fan<00:05:10.250> of<00:05:10.460> these<00:05:10.640> map<00:05:10.850> packs

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
the season pass but for the most part

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.460 
the season pass but for the most part
that<00:05:19.340> maps<00:05:19.520> just<00:05:19.790> weren't<00:05:20.030> very<00:05:20.240> good<00:05:20.470> so

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
that maps just weren't very good so

pack doesn't last very long but when a

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.980

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:20.760 
after another it does get to be very

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.300 
after another it does get to be very
very<00:07:21.030> annoying<00:07:21.740> for<00:07:22.740> the<00:07:22.800> most<00:07:22.919> part<00:07:23.010> I<00:07:23.280> think

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
very annoying for the most part I think

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.860 
very annoying for the most part I think
my<00:07:23.520> overall<00:07:23.850> views<00:07:24.090> of<00:07:24.300> these<00:07:24.479> zombies<00:07:24.750> is

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:24.870 
my overall views of these zombies is

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.450 
my overall views of these zombies is
it's<00:07:25.020> a<00:07:25.080> lot<00:07:25.229> of<00:07:25.350> fun<00:07:25.500> it's<00:07:25.770> very<00:07:26.010> fast-paced

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 
it's a lot of fun it's very fast-paced

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.010 
it's a lot of fun it's very fast-paced
compared<00:07:26.910> to<00:07:27.030> the<00:07:27.120> track<00:07:27.330> zombies<00:07:27.720> since<00:07:27.900> you

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
compared to the track zombies since you

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.330 
compared to the track zombies since you
do<00:07:28.139> have<00:07:28.169> the<00:07:28.320> exosuits<00:07:28.860> you<00:07:28.950> move<00:07:29.130> really

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 
do have the exosuits you move really

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.460 
do have the exosuits you move really
fast<00:07:29.370> and<00:07:29.820> you<00:07:30.000> can<00:07:30.150> jump<00:07:30.360> up<00:07:30.450> and<00:07:30.660> it<00:07:30.960> is<00:07:30.990> a<00:07:31.110> lot

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.470 
fast and you can jump up and it is a lot

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.680 
fast and you can jump up and it is a lot
easier<00:07:31.650> I<00:07:32.070> think<00:07:32.160> VIN<00:07:32.490> Trek<00:07:32.820> zombies<00:07:33.150> as<00:07:33.330> well

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
easier I think VIN Trek zombies as well

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.659 
easier I think VIN Trek zombies as well
because<00:07:34.410> you<00:07:34.530> can<00:07:34.830> boost<00:07:35.070> jump<00:07:35.310> so<00:07:35.460> if<00:07:35.520> you<00:07:35.580> get

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:35.669 
because you can boost jump so if you get

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:36.890 
because you can boost jump so if you get
trapped<00:07:35.850> in<00:07:36.030> a<00:07:36.090> corner<00:07:36.450> or<00:07:36.540> something<00:07:36.630> like

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:36.900 
trapped in a corner or something like

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.690 
trapped in a corner or something like
that<00:07:36.960> you<00:07:37.470> can<00:07:37.620> just<00:07:37.770> boost<00:07:37.979> jump<00:07:38.190> over<00:07:38.550> them

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:38.700 
that you can just boost jump over them

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.590 
that you can just boost jump over them
and<00:07:38.960> yeah<00:07:39.960> so<00:07:40.169> overall<00:07:40.530> very<00:07:40.770> fun<00:07:41.100> I<00:07:41.600> final

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:42.600 
and yeah so overall very fun I final

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.610
