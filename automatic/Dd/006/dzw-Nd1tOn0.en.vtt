we're gonna start on the roof and for

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.660 
we're gonna start on the roof and for
this<00:01:04.260> roof<00:01:04.500> I've<00:01:04.680> decided<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.070> use<00:01:05.339> wood

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
this roof I've decided to use wood

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.270 
this roof I've decided to use wood
because<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.330> think<00:01:06.390> mostly<00:01:07.320> um<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.980> only<00:01:08.160> time

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
because I think mostly um the only time

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.530 
because I think mostly um the only time
that<00:01:08.400> we've<00:01:08.550> used<00:01:08.700> stones<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.270> been<00:01:09.300> on<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
that we've used stones have been on the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.740 
that we've used stones have been on the
pillars<00:01:09.870> and<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.980> more<00:01:11.160> building<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.910> have

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
pillars and the more building it have

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.120 
pillars and the more building it have
been<00:01:12.930> wood<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.440> I'm<00:01:13.530> gonna<00:01:13.740> stick<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.070> that

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
been wood so I'm gonna stick with that

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.900 
been wood so I'm gonna stick with that
but<00:01:15.090> anyhow<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.010> for<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.190> roof<00:01:17.340> I'm<00:01:17.580> just

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
but anyhow so for the roof I'm just

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.280 
but anyhow so for the roof I'm just
doing<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.240> same<00:01:18.270> pattern<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.870> we've<00:01:19.110> been

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
doing the same pattern that we've been

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.760 
doing the same pattern that we've been
doing<00:01:19.620> for<00:01:20.370> a<00:01:20.700> while<00:01:21.060> now<00:01:21.390> where<00:01:21.870> we<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.500> do

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
doing for a while now where we just do

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.330 
doing for a while now where we just do
over<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.970> delete<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.200> continue<00:01:26.070> around

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
over up delete it and continue around

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.950 
over up delete it and continue around
until<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.940> get<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> circular<00:01:27.780> pattern

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
until you get like a circular pattern

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.230 
until you get like a circular pattern
where<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.380> peaks<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.980> top<00:01:29.160> so<00:01:29.940> I'm<00:01:30.150> gonna

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
where it peaks at the top so I'm gonna

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.360 
where it peaks at the top so I'm gonna
continue<00:01:30.450> with<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.590> one<00:01:31.740> tricky

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
continue with that but the one tricky

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.530 
continue with that but the one tricky
thing<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.760> you<00:01:32.820> might<00:01:33.030> run<00:01:33.150> into<00:01:33.390> issues

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
thing that you might run into issues

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.690 
thing that you might run into issues
with<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.080> roof<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.500> because<00:01:35.370> we're<00:01:35.550> building

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
with this roof is because we're building

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.980 
with this roof is because we're building
right<00:01:35.970> off<00:01:36.120> of<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.330> pillar<00:01:36.570> there's<00:01:36.870> gonna

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
right off of this pillar there's gonna

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.900 
right off of this pillar there's gonna

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
tendency to want to go over and fill it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.440 
tendency to want to go over and fill it
in<00:01:40.950> all<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> way<00:01:41.580> from<00:01:41.610> over<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.330> or

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
in all the way from over here or

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.330 
in all the way from over here or
something<00:01:42.870> and<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.800> make<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.160> that

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
something and you know make it like that

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.490 
something and you know make it like that
and<00:01:44.550> but<00:01:44.730> you<00:01:45.000> shouldn't<00:01:45.330> do<00:01:45.510> that<00:01:45.660> I<00:01:45.990> mean<00:01:46.440> if

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and but you shouldn't do that I mean if

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.000 
and but you shouldn't do that I mean if
you<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.800> want<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.580> I<00:01:48.320> wouldn't<00:01:49.320> do<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.440> so

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
you can want but I wouldn't do that so

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.420 
you can want but I wouldn't do that so
I'm<00:01:50.370> making<00:01:51.330> it<00:01:51.540> more<00:01:51.690> like<00:01:51.870> this<00:01:52.260> and<00:01:52.590> also

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
I'm making it more like this and also

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.830 
I'm making it more like this and also
again<00:01:53.909> when<00:01:54.120> you're<00:01:54.210> filling<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> walls

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
again when you're filling in the walls

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.300 
again when you're filling in the walls
which<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.440> haven't<00:01:55.590> done<00:01:55.740> yet<00:01:55.830> because<00:01:56.220> I

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
which I haven't done yet because I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.250 
which I haven't done yet because I
wanted<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.580> show<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:58.020> want<00:01:58.230> to

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
line like this right here I mean we

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.700 
line like this right here I mean we
already<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> connecting<00:02:04.260> pathway<00:02:04.650> from

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
already have a connecting pathway from

already have a connecting pathway from
the<00:02:04.920> core<00:02:05.190> air<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.580> so<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.790> doesn't<00:02:05.940> look

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
the core air to this so it doesn't look

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.719 
the core air to this so it doesn't look
like<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.330> massive<00:02:06.600> wall<00:02:07.129> it's<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.340> blocking

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
like a massive wall it's just blocking

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.720 
like a massive wall it's just blocking
your<00:02:08.849> way<00:02:08.909> but<00:02:09.780> um<00:02:10.019> yeah<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.129> I'm<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.700> to

small thing to note is that when I came
to<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:25.240> last<00:02:25.480> bit<00:02:25.750> right<00:02:25.960> here

to this last bit right here
I<00:02:26.500> didn't<00:02:27.490> stack<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.150> up<00:02:28.330> like<00:02:28.930> this<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.950> make
