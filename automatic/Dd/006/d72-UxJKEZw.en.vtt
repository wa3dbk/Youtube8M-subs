00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi guys and welcome to this 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.690
 extra video a more serious video than 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.919
 as usual because I wanted to talk to you about 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.550
 something that gave me a lot 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.410
 annoyance that happened these days 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.299
 then we tell you that you know this for 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.719
 avoid that the same happens also to 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.869
 you 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.779
 in practice I found myself active in a 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.359
 iPhone subscription that I didn't have 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.119
 minimally required but now I'll explain 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.970
 a little the story of what happened 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.349
 then they downloaded a simple game 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.140
 from the app store 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.210
 as surely you will know in games 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.710
 sometimes developers a lot 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.960
 often free games 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.969
 developers put up banners 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.870
 advertising that allow him to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.670
 receive benin in earnings and so on 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.510
 earn something with theirs 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.219
 application 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.530
 surely also many of you will be 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.539
 Sometimes you click on 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.579
 these advertising banners by mistake 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.190
 maybe clicking on the screen but 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.649
 lightly clicking that under one goes to 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.500
 click on these good though if you are 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.920
 explain how it happened to me and I have 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.350
 clicked on on a banner by mistake of 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.229
 Puss I had noticed and I was 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.030
 redirected to a website on safari 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.909
 naturally I closed immediately before that 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.630
 the advertising would open or at least that 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.430
 but we thought it was shortly after me 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.860
 I see a message coming with written 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.210
 congratulations to the activated shift 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.820
 subscription for 5 euros per week if wow 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.549
 really nice congratulations me 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.490
 this subscription of the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.430
 cabbage from 5 euros so 5 is a serious one 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.390
 they went immediately and of course not 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.990
 deactivated immediately was like one 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.060
 which was also useless on 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.329
 on today's smartphones it was just one 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.100
 something totally useless for example now 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.630
 I don't know very well what mine was doing 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.820
 peers are going to inform about 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.100
 internet and it has happened to others 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.320
 always with this banner thing I have 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.820
 even seen a service to the hyenas of 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.610
 one that had happened to him the same 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.679
 identical what these services are 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.890
 these subscriptions that allow you to 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.580
 you can download images too 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:20.750
 find free and paid web 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.260
 at 5 to a week which which one 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.390
 normal person would make a subscription 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.970
 no one like this in fact 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.150
 kind of companies that put this kind 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.980
 of advertising it does on purpose for that is yes 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.260
 based only on the mistakes of the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.630
 people who instead of clicking a little more 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.299
 above click a little box below on these 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.850
 banner and so the subscription is activated 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.769
 without it clicking then I accept o 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.480
 any other kind of thing no 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.299
 find a message suddenly 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.070
 without knowing anything a message 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.660
 in which it is written that there has been 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.609
 activated this subscription 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.220
 so guys, I wanted to tell you to do 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.200
 be very careful of avoiding 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.420
 click on these banners if you don't know 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.630
 good where it shows because if you don't 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.420
 found with a 5 euro subscription 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.250
 so totally useless throw away gods 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.970
 money as it happened we tried to 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.700
 contact to try to contact but it is 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.069
 was therefore almost useless then 5 euros 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.380
 bye bye now this done this 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.269
 video because these companies do 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.109
 that kind of thing must die that is 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.630
 they do n't have to not exist because 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.639
 so rely on cheating people with 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.100
 a well with a subscription that one does not 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.560
 it is absolutely useless for me it is not 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.350
 absolutely right said this i wanted 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.200
 just tell you this and then 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.269
 be very careful with the banners you 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.870
 click be careful because if not 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:50.090
 you could see 5 euros just like it is 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.100
 happened to me and nothing I wanted here all 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.720
 tell you to share this video and to 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.829
 show it to our friends so 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.680
 such that as few people as possible run into 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.720
 this in this mistake I made 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.060
 so that these companies fail 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.949
 because they don't lie about being there because 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.130
 cheating people is absolutely not 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:13.250
 correct then said this i'm sorry 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.049
 to have made this kind of video not 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.840
 I know if I will make others on Christmas, but there 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.269
 I wanted to tell all of you why 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.970
 probably if you are enrolled in 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.949
 channel because you will have a smartphone where 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.720
 play then it could happen to you too 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.300
 you to play the application see 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.160
 a banner and therefore be very careful 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.080
 where sins said this i would say that 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.410
 everything and we see each other next 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.410
 video
