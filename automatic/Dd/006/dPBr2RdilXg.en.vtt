00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
those are all signs leading up to a bite

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.730

that<00:01:53.400> most<00:01:53.640> people<00:01:53.970> miss<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:55.200> their<00:01:55.530> hand

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
that most people miss because their hand

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.609 
that most people miss because their hand
isn't<00:01:55.950> traveling<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:56.610> slow<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:57.030> mine<00:01:57.409> so<00:01:58.409> for

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
isn't traveling as slow as mine so for

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.080 
isn't traveling as slow as mine so for
instance<00:01:58.950> they'll<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.280> go<00:01:59.430> right<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
instance they'll just go right up to the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.719 
instance they'll just go right up to the
cage<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.510> their<00:02:00.630> bird<00:02:00.840> will<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:02.070> all<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.610> those

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
cage and their bird will do all of those

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.760 
cage and their bird will do all of those
same<00:02:03.060> things<00:02:03.330> but<00:02:03.689> much<00:02:03.869> faster<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.470> people

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
same things but much faster and people

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.380 
same things but much faster and people
miss<00:02:05.010> it<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.340> I'll<00:02:05.760> say<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:05.970> they're<00:02:06.210> but

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
miss it and I'll say that they're but

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.149 
miss it and I'll say that they're but
their<00:02:06.689> bird<00:02:06.869> fit<00:02:07.110> them<00:02:07.290> for<00:02:07.560> no<00:02:07.650> reason<00:02:08.039> and

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
their bird fit them for no reason and

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.149 
their bird fit them for no reason and
didn't<00:02:08.429> show<00:02:08.580> any<00:02:08.819> signs<00:02:08.849> when<00:02:09.390> actually

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
didn't show any signs when actually

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:14.330 
didn't show any signs when actually
birds<00:02:11.159> are<00:02:11.430> full<00:02:11.939> of<00:02:12.120> signs<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.500> hopefully

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
birds are full of signs and so hopefully

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.360 
birds are full of signs and so hopefully
you<00:02:14.730> are<00:02:14.819> able<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:15.560> see<00:02:16.560> all<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.920> those<00:02:17.069> just

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
you are able to see all of those just

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.619 
you are able to see all of those just
