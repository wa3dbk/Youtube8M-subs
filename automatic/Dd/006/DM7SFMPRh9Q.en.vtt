00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
here we see the gates of azulon I think

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.480 
here we see the gates of azulon I think
they're<00:00:20.490> called<00:00:21.320> but<00:00:22.320> they're<00:00:22.500> there<00:00:22.949> they're

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
they're called but they're there they're

they're called but they're there they're
quite<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> good<00:00:23.910> scale<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> map<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.500> so

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
quite a good scale to what the map is so

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.650 
quite a good scale to what the map is so
this<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.460> like<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.789> only<00:00:27.029> part<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.539> the

yep so we'd see some to see the stairs
going<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.850> capital<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:55.230> doesn't

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
going up to the capital it doesn't

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.170 
going up to the capital it doesn't
actually<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.949> look<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.100> properly<00:00:56.699> what

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
actually really look like properly what

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.150 
actually really look like properly what
it<00:00:57.390> does<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.289> series<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.920> kind<00:00:59.129> of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
it does in the series but it's kind of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.189 
it does in the series but it's kind of
hard<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.340> replicate<00:00:59.730> something<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.149> huge<00:01:00.449> so

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
hard to replicate something that huge so

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.709 
hard to replicate something that huge so
the<00:01:01.890> builders<00:01:02.239> próxima<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the builders próxima and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.950 
the builders próxima and
lucifer<00:01:04.470> build<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.280> place<00:01:05.810> they've<00:01:06.810> done<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
lucifer build this place they've done a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.870 
lucifer build this place they've done a
real<00:01:07.110> good<00:01:07.140> job<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.729> right

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
real good job so if we see on the right

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.820 
real good job so if we see on the right
here<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> tavern<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.650> not

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
obviously it's floating right now

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.929 
obviously it's floating right now
because<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.570> ground<00:01:13.229> isn't<00:01:13.470> done<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:13.939> yeah

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939

there's about thirty something and we
want<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> encourage<00:01:24.479> people<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.840> live

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
want to encourage people to live

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.020 
want to encourage people to live
together<00:01:25.970> which<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.090> gonna<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.420> possible

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
together which is gonna be possible

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.730 
together which is gonna be possible
it'll<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> bit<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.570> cheaper<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.200> stuff<00:01:31.470> to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it'll be a bit like cheaper and stuff to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.700 
it'll be a bit like cheaper and stuff to
live<00:01:32.130> together<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.960> two<00:01:34.020> people<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.530> house

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
live together so two people in the house

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.580 
live together so two people in the house
is<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.659> better<00:01:36.659> than<00:01:36.930> will<00:01:37.200> having<00:01:37.439> one

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
is you know better than will having one

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590 
is you know better than will having one
on<00:01:37.680> their<00:01:37.799> own<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.640> theoretically<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.390> can

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
on their own so theoretically this can

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.170 
on their own so theoretically this can
hold<00:01:39.720> almost<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.170> hundred<00:01:40.290> maybe<00:01:41.119> because<00:01:42.119> he

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
hold almost a hundred maybe because he

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
hold almost a hundred maybe because he
forgot<00:01:42.390> 30<00:01:42.630> something<00:01:43.110> thumbs<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.500> by<00:01:43.590> two<00:01:43.649> or

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
forgot 30 something thumbs up by two or

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.469 
forgot 30 something thumbs up by two or
three<00:01:43.939> sorted<00:01:45.049> really<00:01:46.640> now<00:01:47.640> there's<00:01:48.420> just

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
three sorted really now there's just

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.969 
three sorted really now there's just
like<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> few<00:01:48.930> tea<00:01:49.290> shops<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.740> stuff<00:01:49.829> around

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
like a few tea shops and stuff around

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.130 
like a few tea shops and stuff around
