00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.060
 want 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.460
 hello dear hungry sizzling the sun 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.140
 we are just about to and what is there 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.840
 more refreshing than a beautiful colorful one 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.000
 fruit plate and if so, too 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.010
 class looks like hostesses 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.890
 and host also pumping 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.570
 so that he will follow me on instagram 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.940
 almost every morning with one 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.950
 fruit plate photo depending annoyed or 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.000
 happy but not always I go 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.130
 of course, such effort 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.650
 I think this fruit plate is here 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.420
 pretty successful and we'll see 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.690
 the preparation is really not 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.800
 dramatically we need it 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:54.360
 honey melon a piece of watermelon one 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.760
 red apple an orange and there still 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.890
 some not too big fruits we are there 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.890
 still see you will serve to fill 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.430
 and he needs a bit of a tool 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.680
 also at least a sharp one for it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.829
 knife better a sharp knife and 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.220
 then a fruit knife and a ball 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:16.020
 Cookie cutter the fruit next to it 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.020
 cookie cutter may or may not be 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.659
 could just as well stand out for 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.830
 use cookies 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.500
 we start with the hardest part 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.080
 you want to get out of orange peel 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.180
 We cut fruit baskets 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.729
 first from orange a two to three 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.220
 centimeter thick slice off in this 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.110
 we are now stuck in an odd number 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.340
 I spit just pointed 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.229
 you can also do something else 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.100
 take and I have new here 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.590
 decided 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.390
 to distribute these evenly 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.850
 I have to start in the organic 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.170
 three shashlik skewers stuck so 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.460
 they are about 1 isosceles 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.890
 triangle 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.260
 and then in the interstices with the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.200
 about the same distance two in each case 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.520
 more bargains spread and voila 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.350
 The first step would be done now 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.229
 we look at this or another orange 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.539
 and cut the shell and west with 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.880
 a sharp fruit knife spiral 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.830
 over the entire industry across a 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.230
 The knife so start the orange 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.440
 Turn and hold the knife while doing so 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.680
 what a strip about 5 to 8 mm wider 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.090
 This strip of paint is created 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.810
 then with a sharp knife 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.459
 from the orange peel off this one 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.530
 strip is also nice and flexible 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.530
 Be sure that if possible 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.830
 not so much of the world cut off 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.830
 becomes 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.870
 and when we're done with that 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.370
 Orange vests look like a mummy, though 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.350
 we have our stripes 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.060
 this one will now be prepared 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.190
 baskets rack broken 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.200
 we start inside quarreling around 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.880
 the egg does not lead girls around them 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.799
 then back inside and and that 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.989
 turn around again and so on 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.430
 We moved all the time the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.450
 requires a bit of skill and is 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.549
 also a bit of the body 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.500
 but as you can see, it works 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.970
 in between times the strip ever 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.260
 push down a bit and also 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.510
 if he should leave it is 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.200
 no problem at all again 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.200
 new approaches 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.430
 put the end inside and ours 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.790
 basket is finished my chess player 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.050
 are too long so just cut it if it is 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.210
 So far , you have that 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.550
 complicated already managed now to 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.610
 and honigmelone the Kugl cookie cutter 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.240
 we sting as the name implies 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.240
 copious google 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.220
 many many churches and these 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.640
 we arrange only in grapes for myself 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.770
 a plate to a grape 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.940
 shape and a second or one 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.950
 I would also like a third layer 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.750
 put it on when it's done with 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.460
 Decorate leaves are so good now 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.250
 I have like me on the back 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.960
 there is a grapevine in my balcony 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.180
 the leaves no problem but it 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.920
 also many many others like themselves 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.270
 for example pumpkin leaves or even 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.740
 the green of many flowers 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.040
 Well that looks pretty pretty 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.200
 from now on to the apples a very simple one 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.480
 But technology like the really great to me 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.270
 So take a red if possible 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.520
 apple and cuts big parts left 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.860
 and on the right side of the housing, past the apple 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.750
 Now the apple pieces from both sides 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.030
 a cut so that we afterwards 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.640
 a big wedge-shaped piece out 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:39.430
 can solve what is on it and 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:41.470
 cuts it in turn wedge-shaped and 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.630
 think the whole thing is repeated again 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.240
 the pieces then moves staggered arranges 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.610
 At the end it looks like I'm decorative 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.870
 and made easy and with one 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.410
 The fourth cut will be like that 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.580
 Only the honey melon look like that 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.220
 This one we cut a few pieces 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.200
 uniqa out next to the trade probst 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.720
 cookie cutter but as I said you can you 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.640
 because even biscuit cook and take 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.020
 he as stars, hearts or take owls 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.090
 is completely up to you 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.370
 it's only about him being one 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.530
 have some nicely shaped salary pieces 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.270
 in this we do now anyway and 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.910
 I decorate here with one 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.360
 basil branch and with a board 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.010
 flushed 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.170
 but you can also do other things 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.930
 take and with that we have everything 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.000
 prepared and thus now the 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.590
 fruit plate finished the grape he lies 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.330
 already after that we will put on the self 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.970
 tinkered organic fruit basket 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.700
 , the apple slices on the rey BE REDUCED 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.910
 plate and decorate a bit with 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.350
 the melon piece 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.350
 and now comes yet the fruit of the 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.070
 use in my case so 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.720
 gooseberry acid and sweet cake 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.620
 i mean that a fruit plate that you 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.290
 really let see 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.670
 By the way that probst basket can be 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.310
 of course also wonderful with grapefruit 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.960
 or lemon zest I make wishes 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.300
 Have fun making yourself 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.120
 let the fruit snails right 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.500
 Enjoy your meal 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.080
 however, if he has a fruit plate altogether 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.330
 to design differently or melon 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.370
 rather in combination with feta eat 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.450
 I would like to have a look 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.640
 put these videos in 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.030
 you still have to say until the 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.030
 next time 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.949
 m
