tours<00:04:59.090> so<00:04:59.780> that's<00:04:59.960> why<00:05:00.200> they<00:05:00.380> are<00:05:00.500> very

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
tours so that's why they are very

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.640 
tours so that's why they are very
successful<00:05:00.970> when<00:05:01.970> they<00:05:02.000> work<00:05:02.440> in<00:05:03.440> the

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
successful when they work in the

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.460 
successful when they work in the
industry<00:05:04.190> later<00:05:04.460> after<00:05:05.060> they<00:05:05.210> graduate<00:05:05.660> as<00:05:05.960> a

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
industry later after they graduate as a

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.950 
industry later after they graduate as a
graduate<00:05:06.950> students<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.580> have<00:05:07.880> any<00:05:08.150> chances<00:05:08.780> to

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
graduate students I have any chances to

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.050 
graduate students I have any chances to
work<00:05:09.110> with<00:05:09.410> industries<00:05:10.310> especially<00:05:10.610> those

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
work with industries especially those

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.660 
work with industries especially those
famous<00:05:11.300> electronic<00:05:12.020> industry<00:05:12.530> so<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.310> is<00:05:13.460> very

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
famous electronic industry so it is very

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.070 
famous electronic industry so it is very
good<00:05:13.880> opportunity<00:05:14.450> for<00:05:14.480> me<00:05:14.690> to<00:05:14.780> work<00:05:15.050> with

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
good opportunity for me to work with

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.350 
good opportunity for me to work with
them<00:05:15.350> actually<00:05:16.190> before<00:05:16.610> going<00:05:17.060> into<00:05:17.210> the

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
them actually before going into the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.020 
them actually before going into the
companies<00:05:17.930> this<00:05:18.290> Nanofab<00:05:18.890> Center<00:05:19.520> has<00:05:19.730> many

companies this Nanofab Center has many

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.910 
companies this Nanofab Center has many
multi<00:05:20.450> million<00:05:20.780> dollars<00:05:21.110> equipment<00:05:21.620> to

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
multi million dollars equipment to

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.430 
multi million dollars equipment to
fabricate<00:05:22.820> devices<00:05:23.420> that<00:05:23.600> are<00:05:23.720> really<00:05:24.080> small

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
fabricate devices that are really small

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.970 
fabricate devices that are really small
and<00:05:24.770> very<00:05:25.070> scaled<00:05:25.460> down<00:05:25.790> to<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.420> almost

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
and very scaled down to the almost

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.830 
and very scaled down to the almost
state-of-the-art<00:05:27.980> technology<00:05:28.760> in<00:05:29.240> case<00:05:29.570> the

state-of-the-art technology in case the

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.390 
state-of-the-art technology in case the
one<00:05:30.110> of<00:05:30.230> the<00:05:30.320> great<00:05:30.500> opportunities<00:05:31.100> is<00:05:31.370> that

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
one of the great opportunities is that

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.700 
one of the great opportunities is that
you<00:05:31.760> actually<00:05:32.090> be<00:05:32.450> able<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.840> take<00:05:33.080> courses<00:05:33.350> and

you actually be able to take courses and

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.040 
you actually be able to take courses and
then<00:05:33.860> also<00:05:34.250> do<00:05:34.400> lab<00:05:34.670> work<00:05:34.700> so<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.510> courses<00:05:35.900> you

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
then also do lab work so the courses you

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.710 
then also do lab work so the courses you
take<00:05:36.470> you<00:05:36.710> will<00:05:36.950> actually<00:05:37.340> be<00:05:37.430> able<00:05:37.520> to<00:05:37.720> see

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
take you will actually be able to see

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.480 
take you will actually be able to see
the<00:05:38.930> stuff<00:05:39.140> right<00:05:39.560> in<00:05:39.740> your<00:05:39.860> lab<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.280> day

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
the stuff right in your lab the day

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.580 
the stuff right in your lab the day
after<00:05:40.850> maybe<00:05:41.060> so<00:05:41.450> that's<00:05:41.870> a<00:05:41.960> really<00:05:42.350> great

Christ in my thinking KAIST also should

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.320 
Christ in my thinking KAIST also should
I<00:05:50.000> stand<00:05:50.360> for<00:05:50.600> knowledge<00:05:51.110> creation
