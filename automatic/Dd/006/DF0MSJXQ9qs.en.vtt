Mouse's through the end of the obstacles

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
Mouse's through the end of the obstacles
but<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> same<00:01:36.420> time<00:01:36.630> you're<00:01:36.810> also<00:01:36.960> going

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
but at the same time you're also going

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.230 
but at the same time you're also going
to<00:01:37.259> help<00:01:37.409> them<00:01:37.650> reach<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.100> blue<00:01:38.310> crystals<00:01:38.790> so

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
to help them reach the blue crystals so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.819 
to help them reach the blue crystals so
that<00:01:39.390> way<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.689> scientists<00:01:40.200> may<00:01:40.320> continued

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that way the scientists may continued

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.219 
that way the scientists may continued
his<00:01:40.860> experiments<00:01:41.579> now<00:01:42.329> at<00:01:42.479> first<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.930> game<00:01:43.110> is

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
his experiments now at first the game is

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.420 
his experiments now at first the game is
going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.439> seem<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.189> pretty

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
going to seem like it's going pretty

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.550 
going to seem like it's going pretty
easy<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.600> progress<00:01:45.810> further<00:01:46.229> along

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
easy but as you progress further along

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.440 
easy but as you progress further along
the<00:01:47.070> game<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> provide<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.119> with

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the game is going to provide you with

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.810 
the game is going to provide you with
many<00:01:48.720> challenges<00:01:49.380> along<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.829> way<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.670> what's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
many challenges along the way and what's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.310 
many challenges along the way and what's
nice<00:01:51.000> about<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.450> blocks<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.990> actually

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
nice about the blocks that actually

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.560 
nice about the blocks that actually
gives<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> nice<00:01:52.860> reminder<00:01:53.310> app<00:01:53.640> Tetris<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
gives you a nice reminder app Tetris the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.359 
gives you a nice reminder app Tetris the
way<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.869> blocks<00:01:55.140> are<00:01:55.290> shaped<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.130> there's

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
way the blocks are shaped so there's

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.010 
way the blocks are shaped so there's
actually<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> really<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.180> lot<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.540> thinking<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
actually a really a lot of thinking a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.749 
actually a really a lot of thinking a
lot<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.500> course<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.040> encounter<00:01:59.250> some

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
lot and of course you do encounter some

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.429 
lot and of course you do encounter some
enemies<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.390> obstacles<00:02:00.540> throughout<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> way

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
enemies and obstacles throughout the way

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.200 
enemies and obstacles throughout the way
so<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.009> really<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.520> put<00:02:02.759> your<00:02:02.880> mind

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
so you really have to put your mind

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.670 
so you really have to put your mind
through<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.509> test<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.140> what's<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> nice

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
through the test and what's a nice

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.039 
through the test and what's a nice
feature<00:02:05.009> about<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.850> sometimes<00:02:06.750> when<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
feature about this is sometimes when you

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.199 
feature about this is sometimes when you
make<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> mistake<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:08.340> other<00:02:08.580> games<00:02:08.970> may

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
make a mistake you know other games may

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.639 
make a mistake you know other games may
have<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.899> start<00:02:10.110> completely<00:02:10.500> over

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
have you have to start completely over

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.949 
have you have to start completely over
but<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.520> one<00:02:11.730> does<00:02:11.940> feature<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.330> nice<00:02:12.629> back

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
but this one does feature a nice back

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.340 
but this one does feature a nice back
but

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
but

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.350 
but
so<00:02:13.650> if<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:13.890> think<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.340> made<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.580> mistake<00:02:14.670> you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
so if you think you made a mistake you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.210 
so if you think you made a mistake you
know<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.720> one<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.110> blocks<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.770> can<00:02:16.950> easily

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
know on one of the blocks you can easily

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.880 
know on one of the blocks you can easily
push<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.970> back<00:02:18.270> button<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.720> go<00:02:18.900> back<00:02:19.050> one<00:02:19.710> step

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
push the back button to go back one step

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.160 
push the back button to go back one step
on<00:02:20.340> what<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.610> did<00:02:20.790> before<00:02:20.940> instead<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.900> having

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
on what you did before instead of having

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.290 
on what you did before instead of having
to<00:02:22.380> start<00:02:22.740> completely<00:02:23.160> over<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.060> nice

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
to start completely over so it's a nice

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.540 
to start completely over so it's a nice
way<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.600> kind<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.230> tweak<00:02:25.830> around<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.220> settings

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
way to kind of tweak around the settings

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.220 
way to kind of tweak around the settings
it's<00:02:26.700> okay<00:02:27.000> maybe<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:27.450> worked<00:02:27.750> out<00:02:27.930> maybe

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
it's okay maybe this worked out maybe

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.320 
it's okay maybe this worked out maybe
this<00:02:28.590> didn't<00:02:28.950> work<00:02:29.070> out<00:02:29.280> or<00:02:29.730> maybe<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:30.150> found

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
this didn't work out or maybe you found

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.910 
this didn't work out or maybe you found
another<00:02:30.540> way<00:02:30.960> so<00:02:31.020> instead<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.560> having<00:02:31.800> to

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
another way so instead of having to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.530 
another way so instead of having to
start<00:02:32.190> over<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.730> could<00:02:32.880> just<00:02:33.060> go<00:02:33.180> back<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.420> few

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
start over you could just go back a few

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.140 
start over you could just go back a few
notches<00:02:33.920> simple<00:02:34.920> as<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.040> or<00:02:35.460> if<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.850> really

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
notches simple as that or if you really

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.940 
notches simple as that or if you really
wanted<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.540> start<00:02:36.810> completely<00:02:37.260> over<00:02:37.410> then<00:02:37.860> you

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
wanted to start completely over then you

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.860 
wanted to start completely over then you
could<00:02:38.100> easily<00:02:38.250> redo<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.940> whole<00:02:38.970> thing<00:02:39.360> your

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
could easily redo the whole thing your

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.970 
could easily redo the whole thing your
course<00:02:40.170> you're<00:02:40.320> also<00:02:40.440> going<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.680> get<00:02:40.830> some

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
course you're also going to get some

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.620 
course you're also going to get some
items<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.490> help<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.760> along<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.060> way<00:02:42.210> like

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
items to help you along the way like

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.180 
items to help you along the way like
eventually<00:02:43.020> there<00:02:43.290> Don<00:02:43.680> you're<00:02:43.920> going<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.100> get

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
eventually there Don you're going to get

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.130 
eventually there Don you're going to get
these<00:02:44.310> bombs<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.420> could<00:02:45.570> blow<00:02:45.750> up<00:02:45.840> little

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
these bombs but you could blow up little

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.570 
these bombs but you could blow up little
obstacles<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:46.980> kind<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.220> have<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.400> like

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
obstacles and you kind of have to like

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.580 
obstacles and you kind of have to like
lower<00:02:48.060> levels<00:02:48.540> basically<00:02:48.990> there's<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.290> lot<00:02:49.560> of

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
lower levels basically there's a lot of

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.530 
lower levels basically there's a lot of
strategy<00:02:50.100> involved<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.790> what<00:02:51.180> I'm<00:02:51.300> trying<00:02:51.510> to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
strategy involved is what I'm trying to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.870 
strategy involved is what I'm trying to
say<00:02:51.630> here<00:02:52.080> but<00:02:52.230> overall<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.340> gameplay<00:02:53.700> is

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
say here but overall the gameplay is

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.700 
say here but overall the gameplay is
pretty<00:02:53.970> well<00:02:54.300> solid<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.930> really<00:02:55.290> enjoyable

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
pretty well solid and really enjoyable

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.250 
pretty well solid and really enjoyable
as<00:02:56.090> for<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.180> sound<00:02:57.390> design<00:02:57.690> overall<00:02:58.050> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
as for the sound design overall the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.690 
as for the sound design overall the
sound<00:02:58.440> isn't<00:02:58.650> too<00:02:58.950> bad<00:02:59.160> there's<00:02:59.400> actually
