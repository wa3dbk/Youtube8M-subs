00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
here wouldn't spin so that had led me

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.410 
here wouldn't spin so that had led me
that<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.020> had<00:00:22.140> fallen<00:00:22.380> off<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:23.120> little<00:00:24.120> gear<00:00:24.330> in

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
that it had fallen off a little gear in

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.630 
that it had fallen off a little gear in
here<00:00:24.530> which<00:00:25.530> it<00:00:25.650> didn't<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.130> fine<00:00:26.370> it's<00:00:26.550> nice

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
here which it didn't it's fine it's nice

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.580 
here which it didn't it's fine it's nice
and<00:00:26.880> taut<00:00:27.380> take<00:00:28.380> off<00:00:28.530> the<00:00:28.680> flywheel<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:30.590> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
and taut take off the flywheel and the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.740 
and taut take off the flywheel and the
key<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:33.620> done

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
key is just done

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.740 
key is just done
so<00:00:36.560> that<00:00:36.680> needs<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:36.890> be<00:00:37.010> replaced<00:00:37.340> I<00:00:37.880> choose<00:00:38.510> my

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
so that needs to be replaced I choose my

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.910 
so that needs to be replaced I choose my
sentry<00:00:39.380> pneumatic<00:00:39.740> air<00:00:39.830> hammer<00:00:41.620> to<00:00:42.620> take<00:00:42.770> off

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
sentry pneumatic air hammer to take off

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.620 
sentry pneumatic air hammer to take off
the<00:00:43.040> clutch<00:00:43.250> assembly<00:00:43.300> that<00:00:44.300> works<00:00:44.480> really

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
the clutch assembly that works really

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:52.240 
the clutch assembly that works really
would<00:00:46.420> so

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.650 

clutch<00:00:52.520> assembly<00:00:53.290> but<00:00:54.290> um<00:00:55.030> so<00:00:56.030> yeah<00:00:56.180> it's<00:00:56.360> a<00:00:56.420> 30

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
clutch assembly but um so yeah it's a 30

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.460 
clutch assembly but um so yeah it's a 30
cc<00:00:57.790> four-stroke<00:01:00.160> pretty<00:01:01.160> complicated<00:01:01.580> but

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
cc four-stroke pretty complicated but

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.630 
cc four-stroke pretty complicated but
little<00:01:03.470> spark<00:01:03.860> plug<00:01:04.070> for<00:01:04.280> this<00:01:04.430> thing<00:01:04.580> this

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
little spark plug for this thing this

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.370 
little spark plug for this thing this
thing<00:01:04.790> this<00:01:05.000> basswood<00:01:05.780> me<00:01:05.960> this<00:01:06.110> thing<00:01:06.260> is

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
thing this basswood me this thing is

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.640 
thing this basswood me this thing is
tiny<00:01:08.530> compared<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:11.230> spark<00:01:12.230> plug<00:01:12.260> that<00:01:12.530> the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
tiny compared to a spark plug that the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.970 
tiny compared to a spark plug that the
echo<00:01:12.920> takes<00:01:14.590> there's<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.650> big<00:01:15.800> little

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
echo takes there's a big little

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
echo takes there's a big little
difference<00:01:16.280> there<00:01:16.780> but<00:01:17.780> uh<00:01:18.460> yes<00:01:19.460> I'll<00:01:19.820> figure

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
difference there but uh yes I'll figure

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.910 
difference there but uh yes I'll figure
it<00:01:20.120> out<00:01:20.770> five<00:01:21.770> wheels<00:01:21.950> like<00:01:22.130> eighteen<00:01:22.610> bucks

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
it out five wheels like eighteen bucks

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.200 
it out five wheels like eighteen bucks
get<00:01:24.920> that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.179 

I<00:01:27.299> had<00:01:28.110> taken<00:01:28.409> off<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
I had taken off the

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.190 
I had taken off the
the

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.600 
the
oil<00:01:32.770> pan<00:01:33.100> thing<00:01:33.430> here<00:01:33.760> and<00:01:35.460> you're<00:01:36.460> doing

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
pretty good she was overfilled on the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.880 
pretty good she was overfilled on the
oil<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:39.280> he<00:01:39.700> had<00:01:39.970> nothing<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:40.360> do<00:01:40.510> with<00:01:40.890> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
in two days after Colin so through a

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.170 
in two days after Colin so through a
good<00:02:11.440> company<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:13.080> yeah<00:02:14.080> she's<00:02:14.880> she<00:02:15.880> turning

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
good company and yeah she's she turning

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.420 
good company and yeah she's she turning
you<00:02:16.600> know<00:02:16.930> she<00:02:16.989> working<00:02:17.530> just<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.190> flywheel

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
you know she working just that flywheel

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.740 
you know she working just that flywheel
key<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.930> slipping<00:02:20.290> on<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:21.420> shaft<00:02:22.420> they're

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
key it's slipping on the shaft they're

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.040 
key it's slipping on the shaft they're
not<00:02:23.200> grabbing<00:02:23.560> anything<00:02:24.810> northeast<00:02:25.810> flow

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
not grabbing anything northeast flow

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.320 
not grabbing anything northeast flow
Keys<00:02:26.440> grab<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:27.660> bright<00:02:28.660> they're<00:02:29.110> looking<00:02:30.040> there

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.339 

so<00:02:33.810> that's<00:02:33.960> interesting

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.380 

yeah<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.219> that<00:02:37.370> would<00:02:37.489> cause<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:38.060> slip

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
yeah so that would cause that to slip

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.449 
yeah so that would cause that to slip
especially<00:02:39.349> under<00:02:39.560> compression<00:02:39.920> loads<00:02:40.249> I'm

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
especially under compression loads I'm

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.030 
especially under compression loads I'm
going<00:02:40.609> to<00:02:40.670> piss<00:02:40.790> in<00:02:40.879> with<00:02:40.999> Annie<00:02:41.150> return<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.810> we

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
going to piss in with Annie return so we
