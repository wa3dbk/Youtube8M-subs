00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
replace steam heating and this is where

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.069 
replace steam heating and this is where
we<00:00:50.309> stopped<00:00:51.710> it<00:00:52.999> you<00:00:53.999> know<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.239> go<00:00:54.449> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
we stopped it you know you can go you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.069 
we stopped it you know you can go you
can<00:00:55.109> go<00:00:55.789> repiping<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.909> whole<00:00:57.089> house<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.899> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
can go repiping the whole house but you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.369 
can go repiping the whole house but you
have<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.319> question<00:00:58.530> at<00:00:59.129> what<00:00:59.370> expense<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
have to question at what expense so the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.200 
have to question at what expense so the
contract<00:01:01.890> was<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.129> replace<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> boiler<00:01:02.940> not

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
contract was to replace the boiler not

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
contract was to replace the boiler not

all the heating pipes throughout the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
all the heating pipes throughout the
house<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:07.380> boiler<00:01:07.770> has<00:01:08.009> a<00:01:09.170> McDonald

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.170 
cutoff or a fan and a can in our
circumstance<00:02:51.780> we<00:02:51.959> added<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.290> fan<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.650> again

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180

it doesn't knock and unseen again you

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.569 
it doesn't knock and unseen again you
have<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:35.870> pitch<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:37.049> properly<00:03:37.440> for<00:03:38.220> instance

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
have to pitch it properly for instance

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.449 
have to pitch it properly for instance
as<00:03:38.729> I<00:03:38.819> come<00:03:39.000> out<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.359> header

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
as I come out of this header

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.339 
as I come out of this header
once<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.639> they're<00:03:42.180> combined<00:03:42.629> together<00:03:42.840> this

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
once the they're combined together this

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.649 
once the they're combined together this
is<00:03:43.500> actually<00:03:43.829> pitching<00:03:44.220> down<00:03:44.639> this<00:03:44.940> way<00:03:45.150> very

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
is actually pitching down this way very

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.780 
is actually pitching down this way very
slightly<00:03:46.019> so<00:03:46.379> that<00:03:46.409> way<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.680> get<00:03:46.949> dry<00:03:47.250> steam<00:03:47.519> up

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
slightly so that way I get dry steam up

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.110 
slightly so that way I get dry steam up
out<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.329> this<00:03:48.419> tee<00:03:48.659> which<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.049> turned<00:03:49.290> up<00:03:49.440> and

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
out of this tee which is turned up and

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.330 
out of this tee which is turned up and
headed<00:03:51.120> up<00:03:51.209> here<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:52.769> always<00:03:52.889> want<00:03:53.159> to<00:03:53.190> keep

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
headed up here you always want to keep

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.909 
headed up here you always want to keep
the<00:03:53.519> steam<00:03:53.940> as<00:03:54.150> dry<00:03:54.359> as<00:03:54.540> possible<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:57.919> it's

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
the steam as dry as possible and it's

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.679 
the steam as dry as possible and it's
always<00:03:59.220> worked<00:03:59.430> for<00:03:59.519> me<00:03:59.639> I<00:03:59.760> always<00:04:00.120> think<00:04:00.569> of

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
always worked for me I always think of

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.349 
always worked for me I always think of
steam<00:04:01.229> piping<00:04:01.590> just<00:04:01.709> drain<00:04:02.040> piping<00:04:02.489> because

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
steam piping just drain piping because

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.360 
steam piping just drain piping because
that's<00:04:03.540> basically<00:04:03.900> what<00:04:04.139> it<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.409> you<00:04:04.769> in<00:04:05.129> order

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
that's basically what it is you in order

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.670 
that's basically what it is you in order
to<00:04:05.489> keep<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:05.849> steam<00:04:06.750> dry<00:04:07.049> you<00:04:07.109> have<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.500> pitch

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
to keep the steam dry you have to pitch

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.569 
to keep the steam dry you have to pitch
the<00:04:07.859> mains<00:04:08.040> like<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.310> drain<00:04:09.650> so<00:04:13.340> that's<00:04:14.340> hot

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
the mains like a drain so that's hot

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.839 
the mains like a drain so that's hot
that's<00:04:14.819> my<00:04:15.599> mindset<00:04:15.840> has<00:04:16.409> been<00:04:16.650> for<00:04:16.979> 24<00:04:17.639> years

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
that's my mindset has been for 24 years

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.599 
that's my mindset has been for 24 years
and<00:04:18.060> it's<00:04:18.750> worked<00:04:18.989> for<00:04:19.079> me<00:04:19.310> if<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.459> have<00:04:20.579> a

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
and it's worked for me if you have a

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.320 
and it's worked for me if you have a
better<00:04:20.849> way<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.570> works<00:04:21.930> for<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.169> good<00:04:22.380> luck

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
better way that works for you good luck

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.170 
better way that works for you good luck
so<00:04:24.889> that's<00:04:25.889> pretty<00:04:26.099> much<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.490> here's<00:04:26.669> a<00:04:26.729> fire

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
so that's pretty much it here's a fire

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.740 
so that's pretty much it here's a fire
Manek<00:04:27.509> switch<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:29.220> that's<00:04:30.090> our<00:04:30.270> oil<00:04:30.449> tank

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
Manek switch and that's our oil tank

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.370 
Manek switch and that's our oil tank
right<00:04:30.960> there

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
right there

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.379 
right there
I<00:04:31.410> haven't<00:04:32.280> finished<00:04:32.430> cementing<00:04:33.000> this<00:04:33.120> line

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
I haven't finished cementing this line

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.800 
I haven't finished cementing this line
I'm<00:04:33.690> about<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.020> do<00:04:34.139> that<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:36.630> know<00:04:36.690> we

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
I'm about to do that and you know we

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.120 
I'm about to do that and you know we
always<00:04:36.960> replace<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.500> oil<00:04:37.650> line<00:04:37.860> when<00:04:38.039> we

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
always replace the oil line when we

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.270 
always replace the oil line when we
replace<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.550> boiler<00:04:38.880> on<00:04:39.360> oil<00:04:39.949> and<00:04:40.949> that's<00:04:41.100> it

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
replace the boiler on oil and that's it

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.930 
replace the boiler on oil and that's it
I<00:04:41.370> hope<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.639> enjoyed<00:04:41.910> my<00:04:41.940> videos<00:04:42.330> thank<00:04:42.810> you
