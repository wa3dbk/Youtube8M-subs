00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619

actually but uh all of these blocks are
like<00:01:48.829> fake<00:01:49.250> I<00:01:49.490> guess<00:01:49.789> they're<00:01:50.420> all<00:01:50.450> centered

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
like fake I guess they're all centered

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.109 
like fake I guess they're all centered
around<00:01:50.930> this<00:01:51.200> one<00:01:51.619> block<00:01:52.039> that<00:01:52.789> you<00:01:52.880> can<00:01:53.000> see

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
around this one block that you can see

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.459 
around this one block that you can see
outlined<00:01:53.479> right<00:01:53.630> here<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.079> rest<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.350> it

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
outlined right here and the rest of it

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.830 
outlined right here and the rest of it
is<00:01:54.619> just<00:01:54.799> a<00:01:54.859> projection<00:01:55.340> upwards<00:01:55.969> so<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:56.659> if

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
is just a projection upwards so that if

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.929 
is just a projection upwards so that if
you<00:01:56.960> stop<00:01:57.229> actually<00:01:57.799> looking<00:01:58.219> at<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.700> part

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
you stop actually looking at the part

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.779 
you stop actually looking at the part
where<00:01:58.969> this<00:01:59.210> core<00:01:59.509> block<00:01:59.750> is<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:01.490> entire

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
where this core block is the entire

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.090 
where this core block is the entire
projection<00:02:02.359> will<00:02:02.630> disappear<00:02:03.170> so<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:03.950> means

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
projection will disappear so that means

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.919 
projection will disappear so that means
like<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:04.460> can<00:02:04.579> go<00:02:05.060> inside<00:02:05.240> of<00:02:05.509> it<00:02:05.750> and

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
like you can go inside of it and

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.499 
like you can go inside of it and
everything<00:02:06.409> in<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.090> it's<00:02:08.090> kind<00:02:08.210> of<00:02:08.300> cool
