00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.839
 And then it's okay, I'll call it's just me. 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.530
 I'll post a video for you spoke there 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.530
 over the xbox 360 rolling river in with 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.880
 maxprint steering wheel the steering wheel very good 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.340
 he has a 270 degree turn there 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.769
 also has your feedback is all style 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.189
 Shopping that vibrates is paying better. 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.560
 realism there put to us players there 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.180
 all rubberized steering wheel also has a 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.340
 exchange has butterfly is also good 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.800
 also depending on the game if you played a 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.210
 much more realistic thing 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.890
 his own piece is also well 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.890
 Tough, I also spent the end 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.969
 he is very resistant 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:01:08.220
 I really liked the good pedals too. 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:01:10.080
 and it's hard you plug in the put 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.420
 on here 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.970
 you put the pedal here is not a 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:21.840
 problem that puts him on the pedal 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.750
 Just connect and you can play without it. 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.510
 also if you want to continue talking 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.600
 about law his car has a 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:34.290
 sequential grow below 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.940
 football's it also has a thing is 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.580
 very important there every time I go 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.070
 start playing with him always leave 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.420
 it centralized you get it is 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.040
 only here will be the central point to 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.520
 he will start from this. 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:54.680
 The way it's done over the internet 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.680
 stop focusing on a problem 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:16.400
 quite enough attention some things 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.400
 always take the initiative and run after 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.370
 of 200 but I found it on the market in the 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:53.420
 value of 350 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.220
 good if a panel symbol anyway 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.819
 the joséé steering wheel that is placed in the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.519
 east 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.420
 Here's how with a page 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:17.000
 ventilation and leblon well a good so 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.739
 The gameplay is very strong. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.900
 so in the future I want to post a 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.090
 video and playing I played some games 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.750

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.849
