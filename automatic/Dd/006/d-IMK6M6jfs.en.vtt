that's sketchy so count it before you're
showing<00:01:12.990> them<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> trick<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.650> they<00:01:13.799> cannot

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
showing them the trick and they cannot

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.940 
showing them the trick and they cannot
see<00:01:14.490> you're<00:01:15.090> counting<00:01:15.479> 10<00:01:15.689> cards<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.710> just

10 and 18 that's even so you could do 10
12<00:01:31.470> 14<00:01:32.009> 16<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:32.909> 18<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:34.320> say<00:01:34.710> let's<00:01:35.369> just

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
12 14 16 or 18 and they say let's just

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
12 14 16 or 18 and they say let's just
say<00:01:35.820> ma<00:01:36.509> 12<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.890> 1<00:01:38.490> 2<00:01:39.210> 3<00:01:40.079> 4<00:01:40.860> 5<00:01:41.460> 6<00:01:42.240> 7<00:01:42.960> 8<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:48.350> 12

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
say ma 12 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 12

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380 
say ma 12 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 12
cards<00:01:49.619> all<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.640> count<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.909> 12

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
cards all you have to just count to 12

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.280 
cards all you have to just count to 12
cards<00:01:51.689> then<00:01:52.430> more<00:01:53.430> than<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.720> very

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
cards then more than that this is very

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.190 
cards then more than that this is very
small<00:01:55.619> trick<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.729> say<00:01:56.969> ok<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.490> 1<00:01:59.490> +<00:01:59.700> 2<00:01:59.939> 1<00:02:00.840> 2

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
small trick then you say ok so 1 + 2 1 2

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.270 
small trick then you say ok so 1 + 2 1 2
that<00:02:01.530> looks<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.829> 12

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
that looks like 12

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.190 
that looks like 12
so<00:02:02.490> 1<00:02:02.670> plus<00:02:02.880> 2<00:02:02.909> equals<00:02:03.450> 3<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.930> 1<00:02:04.250> 2<00:02:05.250> that's<00:02:06.200> your

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
so 1 plus 2 equals 3 so 1 2 that's your

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.190 
so 1 plus 2 equals 3 so 1 2 that's your
card<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.799> look<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.780> ten<00:02:10.020> of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
card and look what it is it's the ten of

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.440 
card and look what it is it's the ten of
spades<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:12.060> say<00:02:12.239> ok

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
spades so you can say ok

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.910 
spades so you can say ok
