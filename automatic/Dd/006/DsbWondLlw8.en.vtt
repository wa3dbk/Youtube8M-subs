an<00:00:16.529> observer<00:00:16.980> indian<00:00:17.190> defence<00:00:19.670> which<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.850> have

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
an observer indian defence which I have

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.820 
an observer indian defence which I have
some<00:00:21.600> experience<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:22.260> well<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.800> is

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
some experience with well this is

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.410 
some experience with well this is
actually<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.369> Otori<00:00:23.670> attack<00:00:24.090> by<00:00:24.750> white

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.750 

so<00:00:30.080> it's<00:00:30.290> not<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:30.470> real<00:00:30.770> user<00:00:31.340> indian<00:00:31.640> defence

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
so it's not a real user indian defence

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.780 
so it's not a real user indian defence
and<00:00:32.630> now<00:00:33.470> i<00:00:33.500> think<00:00:33.620> i<00:00:34.010> will<00:00:34.310> set<00:00:34.489> up<00:00:34.580> by

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
and now i think i will set up by

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.049 
and now i think i will set up by
formation<00:00:35.780> my<00:00:36.650> hedgehog<00:00:37.130> formation<00:00:37.670> which<00:00:37.880> is

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
formation my hedgehog formation which is

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.049 
formation my hedgehog formation which is
ones<00:00:38.989> on<00:00:39.140> d66<00:00:39.830> wanna<00:00:40.760> be<00:00:41.000> six<00:00:41.300> fish<00:00:41.630> grumpy<00:00:43.059> 7-7

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
ones on d66 wanna be six fish grumpy 7-7

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.660 
ones on d66 wanna be six fish grumpy 7-7
etc

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.960 

which<00:00:48.269> should<00:00:48.780> give<00:00:48.929> that<00:00:49.140> quite<00:00:49.410> good<00:00:49.589> play

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.940 

we<00:00:56.600> have<00:00:56.720> to<00:00:56.840> play<00:00:56.990> rather<00:00:57.200> fast<00:00:57.530> in<00:00:57.800> this

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
we have to play rather fast in this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.190 
we have to play rather fast in this
because<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.970> is<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.150> three<00:00:59.450> minute<00:00:59.690> game<00:00:59.900> and

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
because it is a three minute game and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.910 
because it is a three minute game and
and<00:01:02.980> just<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.430> put<00:01:04.610> it<00:01:04.760> put<00:01:05.059> it<00:01:05.120> in<00:01:05.239> perspective

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
and just to put it put it in perspective

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.560 
and just to put it put it in perspective
five-minute<00:01:06.920> games<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:07.400> probably<00:01:08.090> much

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
five-minute games that probably much

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.170 
five-minute games that probably much
slower<00:01:09.160> there's<00:01:10.160> much<00:01:10.370> more<00:01:10.550> strategy<00:01:11.000> in<00:01:11.090> the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
slower there's much more strategy in the

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.330 
slower there's much more strategy in the
five<00:01:11.360> minute<00:01:11.630> game<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:11.960> in<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.830> one<00:01:13.010> minute

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
five minute game and in the one minute

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.900 
five minute game and in the one minute
game<00:01:13.490> it's<00:01:13.970> i<00:01:14.380> think<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.190> mainly<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.700> time

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
game it's i think it is mainly a time

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.000 
game it's i think it is mainly a time
scramble<00:01:17.420> whether<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:18.260> very<00:01:18.500> best<00:01:18.770> players

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
scramble whether the very best players

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.980 
scramble whether the very best players
can<00:01:19.280> put<00:01:19.490> in<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.760> lot<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.060> strategy<00:01:20.630> for<00:01:20.840> one

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
can put in a lot of strategy for one

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.140 
can put in a lot of strategy for one
mini<00:01:21.170> games<00:01:24.160> yeah<00:01:25.160> my<00:01:25.400> opponents<00:01:25.760> offering

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:48.460 

1235

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.800 

okay<00:01:49.160> you<00:01:49.550> can<00:01:49.670> see<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.210> black<00:01:50.390> position

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
okay you can see that the black position

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.290 
okay you can see that the black position
is<00:01:50.930> rather<00:01:51.080> sod<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:52.000> hopefully<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:53.030> will<00:01:53.180> be

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
is rather sod and hopefully I will be

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.620 
is rather sod and hopefully I will be
able<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:54.290> weather<00:01:54.590> against<00:01:55.310> this<00:01:55.430> attack<00:01:55.820> that

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
able to weather against this attack that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:38.840 
able to weather against this attack that
what<00:01:56.930> is<00:01:57.080> trying<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.880> get<00:01:58.880> through

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.420 

I<00:02:38.940> think<00:02:39.600> my<00:02:39.720> eventual<00:02:40.050> plan<00:02:40.410> here<00:02:40.800> will<00:02:40.950> be<00:02:41.190> 2

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
I think my eventual plan here will be 2

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.540 
I think my eventual plan here will be 2
again<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.420> break<00:02:42.660> b<00:02:42.930> 52<00:02:43.170> b<00:02:43.530> 4<00:02:43.800> which<00:02:44.310> would

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
again the break b 52 b 4 which would

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:55.360 
again the break b 52 b 4 which would
free<00:02:44.880> up<00:02:45.000> my<00:02:45.120> pieces

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.280 

not<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.060> pin<00:02:56.330> his<00:02:56.480> rook

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.000 

open<00:03:04.189> up<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.430> position<00:03:04.819> like<00:03:04.969> this

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
open up the position like this

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.399 

and<00:03:07.459> his<00:03:07.700> rookie<00:03:07.970> still<00:03:08.209> pincer<00:03:08.689> I<00:03:08.870> think<00:03:09.200> he

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
and his rookie still pincer I think he

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:16.860 
and his rookie still pincer I think he
really<00:03:09.709> wants<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:09.980> play<00:03:10.129> rook<00:03:10.310> g3

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.479 

and<00:03:17.470> now<00:03:17.590> we're<00:03:17.739> starting<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.069> get<00:03:18.159> down<00:03:18.310> to

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
and now we're starting to get down to

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.339 
and now we're starting to get down to
one<00:03:18.640> minute<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.330> will<00:03:19.540> really<00:03:20.049> I<00:03:20.230> think

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
one minute and this will really I think

00:03:20.349 --> 00:04:15.700 
one minute and this will really I think
this<00:03:20.769> might<00:03:20.830> end<00:03:21.069> up<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.580> time<00:03:21.760> scramble

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.470 

and<00:04:16.280> that<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.610> couldn't<00:04:16.940> take<00:04:17.030> that<00:04:17.060> point

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
and that I couldn't take that point

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:43.070 
and that I couldn't take that point
because<00:04:17.630> while<00:04:17.960> at<00:04:18.080> brook<00:04:18.260> h3<00:04:18.710> checkmate

should have been looked taking more care
of<00:06:34.160> his<00:06:34.790> time<00:06:36.910> I'll<00:06:37.910> just<00:06:38.120> a<00:06:38.270> note<00:06:38.450> you<00:06:39.320> may

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
of his time I'll just a note you may

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.350

have<00:06:39.590> seen<00:06:39.800> red<00:06:40.280> arrows<00:06:40.670> on<00:06:40.910> the<00:06:40.940> board<00:06:41.240> before

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
have seen red arrows on the board before

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.230

that<00:06:42.260> is<00:06:42.410> a<00:06:42.620> technique<00:06:43.250> known<00:06:43.310> as<00:06:43.520> pre<00:06:44.000> move

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
that is a technique known as pre move

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.860 
that is a technique known as pre move
which<00:06:45.200> allows<00:06:45.590> me<00:06:45.620> to<00:06:46.480> play<00:06:47.480> my<00:06:47.690> move

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
which allows me to play my move

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.570 
which allows me to play my move
automatically<00:06:48.530> no<00:06:48.770> matter<00:06:48.950> what<00:06:49.190> my<00:06:49.370> opponent

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
automatically no matter what my opponent

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.390 
automatically no matter what my opponent
plays<00:06:50.440> actually<00:06:51.440> I'm<00:06:51.500> not<00:06:51.650> sure<00:06:51.800> if<00:06:51.920> I<00:06:52.010> used<00:06:52.250> it

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
plays actually I'm not sure if I used it
