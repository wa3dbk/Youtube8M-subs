manager and the personal directory well
for<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.840> we'll<00:03:13.049> need<00:03:13.079> to<00:03:13.319> create<00:03:13.650> an<00:03:13.769> XML

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
for that we'll need to create an XML

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.030 
for that we'll need to create an XML
file<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.700> it's<00:03:15.359> really<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.900> lot<00:03:16.500> easier<00:03:16.890> than

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
file and it's really a lot easier than

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.090 
file and it's really a lot easier than
it<00:03:17.190> sounds

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
it sounds

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.789 
it sounds
let's<00:03:20.100> go<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.340> system<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.799> enterprise

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
let's go to system and enterprise

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.670 
let's go to system and enterprise
parameters<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:28.019> we're<00:03:28.170> going<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.350> find<00:03:28.590> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
parameters and we're going to find the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:36.530 
parameters and we're going to find the
URL<00:03:29.069> directories<00:03:30.109> parameter<00:03:35.150> okay

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
URL directories parameter okay

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.500 
URL directories parameter okay
let's<00:03:37.380> copy<00:03:37.709> this<00:03:37.920> URL<00:03:41.030> open<00:03:42.030> up<00:03:42.150> another

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
let's copy this URL open up another

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.599 
let's copy this URL open up another
window<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.590> paste<00:03:43.889> that<00:03:44.160> in<00:03:45.620> okay<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.489> this

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
window and paste that in okay so this

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.770 
window and paste that in okay so this
gives<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.510> layout<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:50.569> phone<00:03:51.569> menu

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
gives you the the layout of a phone menu

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.620 
gives you the the layout of a phone menu
and<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.859> is<00:03:53.010> what<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.819> behind<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.359> scenes

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
and this is what is behind the scenes

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.180 
and this is what is behind the scenes
for<00:03:54.870> your<00:03:55.019> personal<00:03:55.350> directory<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:55.980> your
