00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.190 

the<00:01:05.070> fan<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.970> actually<00:01:06.479> digging<00:01:06.720> into<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the fan is actually digging into the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.440 
the fan is actually digging into the
condenser<00:01:07.549> well<00:01:08.549> whatever<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.030> called<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
condenser well whatever that is called a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.149 
condenser well whatever that is called a
no<00:01:10.350> no<00:01:11.330> this<00:01:12.330> there's<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.260> screw<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> guess<00:01:13.979> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
no no this there's a screw I guess it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.609 
no no this there's a screw I guess it
keeps<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.549> further<00:01:15.119> away<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.259> it's

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
keeps it further away but it's it's it's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.130 
keeps it further away but it's it's it's
loose<00:01:16.950> or<00:01:17.189> something<00:01:17.689> maybe<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.840> tighten

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
loose or something maybe if I tighten

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
loose or something maybe if I tighten
those<00:01:19.229> screws<00:01:19.380> it'll<00:01:19.740> do<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.159> it's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
those screws it'll do it and it's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.080 
those screws it'll do it and it's
hitting<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:23.310> won't<00:01:23.580> run<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.060> that

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
hitting and so it won't run like that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.039 
hitting and so it won't run like that
obviously<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.710> decided<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.100> had<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.280> open<00:01:26.369> it

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
obviously so I decided I had to open it

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.429 
obviously so I decided I had to open it
and<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.890> got<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.159> open<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:30.200> let's<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.350> in

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and so I got it open here let's go in

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.700 
and so I got it open here let's go in
that<00:01:31.530> window<00:01:31.890> what<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> fan<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:33.140> I'm<00:01:34.140> very<00:01:34.259> mad

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that window what a fan is I'm very mad

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.649 
that window what a fan is I'm very mad
that<00:01:35.070> they<00:01:35.579> much<00:01:35.700> yourself<00:01:36.000> such<00:01:36.150> an<00:01:36.270> inferior

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
that they much yourself such an inferior

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.420 
that they much yourself such an inferior
product<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:38.490> they<00:01:38.850> don't<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.119> returns

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.180 

so<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.240> need<00:01:42.660> to<00:01:42.750> figure<00:01:42.900> out<00:01:43.020> why<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.410> is<00:01:43.830> this

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
so I need to figure out why this is this

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.210 
so I need to figure out why this is this
way<00:01:44.960> tighten<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:46.470> then<00:01:46.620> put<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.190> back

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
way tighten it up and then put it back

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.130 
way tighten it up and then put it back
together<00:01:47.460> also<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.300> noticed<00:01:48.480> there's<00:01:48.780> there's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
together also I noticed there's there's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.460 
together also I noticed there's there's

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
this this pile of like some type of glue

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.170 
this this pile of like some type of glue
looks<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.620> a<00:01:52.650> few<00:01:52.950> actually<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.550> don't<00:01:54.090> know
