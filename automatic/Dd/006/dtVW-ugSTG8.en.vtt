but I don't think they benefit too much

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.460 
but I don't think they benefit too much
if<00:02:36.850> they're<00:02:37.060> sitting<00:02:37.690> on<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.840> chair<00:02:38.110> waiting

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
if they're sitting on a chair waiting

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.770 
if they're sitting on a chair waiting
for<00:02:38.710> you<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.920> finish<00:02:39.100> shopping<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:40.390> yeah<00:02:40.540> they

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
for you to finish shopping so yeah they

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.780 
for you to finish shopping so yeah they
don't<00:02:40.870> have<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.140> wait<00:02:41.320> as<00:02:41.380> long<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.250> figured

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
don't have to wait as long but I figured

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.480 
don't have to wait as long but I figured
the<00:02:43.270> best<00:02:43.300> way<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.780> start<00:02:44.290> communicating<00:02:44.800> and

the best way to start communicating and
finding<00:02:46.060> some<00:02:46.300> common<00:02:46.510> ground<00:02:46.990> but<00:02:47.200> if<00:02:47.350> you

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
finding some common ground but if you

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.290
