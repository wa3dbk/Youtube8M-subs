00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
really make it for the bike very

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.650 
really make it for the bike very
specifically<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:03.000> see<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.359> here

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
specifically as you can see right here

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.020 
specifically as you can see right here
there<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:06.140> slight<00:01:07.250> bent<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.729> allow<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
there is a slight bent to allow the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.980 
there is a slight bent to allow the
lever<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.320> foot<00:01:10.680> brake<00:01:11.270> for<00:01:12.270> motion<00:01:12.780> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
lever of the foot brake for motion and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.440 
lever of the foot brake for motion and
then<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> plate<00:01:14.549> welded<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.180> here

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
then they have a plate welded on here

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.179 
then they have a plate welded on here
that<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.380> designed<00:01:17.159> for<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.580> Honda's<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.979> fit

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
that is designed for a Honda's to fit

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.149 
that is designed for a Honda's to fit
exactly<00:01:20.630> an<00:01:21.630> existing<00:01:22.409> bolt<00:01:22.650> pattern<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
exactly an existing bolt pattern and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.219 
exactly an existing bolt pattern and
they've<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:23.520> provide<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.000> longer<00:01:24.900> bolts

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
they've really provide the longer bolts

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.740 
they've really provide the longer bolts
to<00:01:25.350> compensate<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> plate<00:01:26.400> thickness

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
to compensate for the plate thickness

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.510 
to compensate for the plate thickness
with<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> razor<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.439> exactly<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> same

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
with the razor it's exactly the same

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.940 
with the razor it's exactly the same
although<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.299> need<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.590> metal<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
although the need for the metal is

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.219 
although the need for the metal is
slightly<00:01:32.189> different<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.090> they<00:01:33.270> customize

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
slightly different and so they customize

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.920 
slightly different and so they customize
it<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> bike<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.400> really<00:01:35.810> have<00:01:36.810> in

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
it for the bike that you really have in

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.520 
it for the bike that you really have in
mind<00:01:37.140> putting<00:01:37.500> these<00:01:37.590> training<00:01:37.979> wheels<00:01:38.220> on

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
mind putting these training wheels on

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.870 
mind putting these training wheels on
the<00:01:40.530> bike<00:01:40.710> still<00:01:41.009> fits<00:01:41.280> through<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> regular

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the bike still fits through a regular

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.399 
the bike still fits through a regular
door<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.360> think<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.750> was<00:01:42.899> important<00:01:43.350> because

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
door I think that was important because

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.080 
door I think that was important because
it<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.860> Christmas<00:01:44.280> present<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:45.000> the
