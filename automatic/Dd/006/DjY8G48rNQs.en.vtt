00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.040
 of sprinkled and that it does not parmesan to go 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.509
 see thanks to the hours companion kitchens 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.049
 it's super simple and it's really 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.350
 very convenient 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.430
 look at I open my kitchen companion I 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.630
 put in my chopping knife and I 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.199
 will put my shallots mathis pods 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.189
 garlic and look I'm just that's it 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.380
 just to get it inside 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.610
 of cooking companion I will cut in 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.530
 three but two green pearls 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:41.610
 here he wants to put them in the bowl of 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.260
 my companion hockey kitchen from 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.219
 there I am a nice trickle of olive oil 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.940
 that's the equivalent of the price of a beautiful 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.180
 soup spoon 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.410
 I close my kitchen companion and I 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.270
 go on the program and you'll see from 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.960
 very very simple way we be speed 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:04.199
 2 one is the temperature at 90 degrees and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.559
 we will simmer for five 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.780
 minutes 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.650
 it's been five minutes of the symbiote and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.930
 now we will put a smaller 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.409
 impulse to mix grind a whole 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.430
 little bit vegetables 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:19.200
 that's more than enough 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:23.280
 okay we'll add a little bit here 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.080
 orange peel to give a little 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.549
 orange scent and to your set and you 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.570
 really see that it's to see 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.820
 really make creative recipes 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.049
 with the companion kitchen here admits a 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.500
 little bit of making the recipe you 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.570
 like i'm going to squeeze the juice of a half 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.409
 orange and I would like to add in the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.650
 asparagus we add the small juice 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.650
 orange 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.299
 we will add the chicken broth 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.299
 or vegetables 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.429
 that's the broth and half we 're going to salt 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.539
 slightly but be careful with the 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.909
 broth because sometimes it is a 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.039
 little bit already these areas and we're going 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.750
 add a little spice of pepper 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.189
 Espelette or freshly ground pepper 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.750
 we close the cap is here you go 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.920
 see is a program that is very nice 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.450
 we have a program here without regret and 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.680
 I lowered cooking time there I put 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.060
 just just 20 minutes because 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.260
 for green asparagus it's largely 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.030
 sufficient 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.830
 it's gone while my velvety 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.299
 of sprinkled quid in cooking companion I 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.819
 go make the parmesan cream 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:32.709
 you need a whole fresh cream well 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:35.860
 well cold and we go luxurious and 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.819
 to make a whipped cream 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.019
 which is really great and that 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.459
 program is that at the end of the program 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.140
 soup sanix alone 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.790
 there's nothing more to do this beep is the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.660
 soup is priest watching it serves in 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.319
 soothing effect we have a soup 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.910
 perfectly mix and I can tell you 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.769
 that promised exasperates I do not know if 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.209
 easy that it gmac and whipped cream 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.269
 my whipped cream by players 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.620
 add my parmesan I do not want to add 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.859
 of salt because Parmesan and 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.170
 quite salty a nice pinch 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:05.020
 of Espelette pepper 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.790
 I stir 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.320
 the little cream of parmesan little shitty 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.060
 it was a little like a cream 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.080
 chantilly room and that's it is ready 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.360
 and here I will serve my drunk 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.410
 green asparagus with my little cream of 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.790
 parmesan I would say it's 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.900
 really delicious so now 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.900
 It's yours
