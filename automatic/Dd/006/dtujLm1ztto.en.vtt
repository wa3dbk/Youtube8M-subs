00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
let's see how it sounds great

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.160 
let's see how it sounds great
it's<00:02:21.640> not<00:02:21.880> likely<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.239> go<00:02:22.390> triple<00:02:22.630> platinum

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
it's not likely to go triple platinum
