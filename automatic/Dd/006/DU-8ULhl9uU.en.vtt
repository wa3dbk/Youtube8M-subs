00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:02.600
 hi to my belyaev evgenia service center 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.749
 for the negligent a.ru today we will make a replacement 

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:09.820
 thermal paste on mac mini 2012 2013 release 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.209
 remove the cover and the amount of 3 screws 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:16.129
 which cost 6 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.159
 fan 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.519
 motherboard 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.539
 remember the location of the screws 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.880
 and when reassembling do not confuse where what 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.550
 time was screwed up neatly 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.559
 until we reach we are just making 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.630
 fan 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.230
 and with the help of the plastic spa world 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.650
 plastic spatula 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.650
 and what the Crimea connectors calves works fee 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.420
 further screwdriver which 106 window than 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.590
 the only one that fixes the defense 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.880
 cooling system 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.900
 nor remember this meeting further 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.690
 it's pretty hard to deliver protection 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.350
 push the finger attacks as I often complain 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.130
 and recoverable 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.130
 applying some effort 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.270
 then four stages are disabled 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.740
 bargaining 108 which 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.820
 at the same time to the new phase 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.220
 remember the location 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.510
 rifle when reassembling do not confuse 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.600
 also pay attention to how 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.190
 Wi-Fi antenna 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.440
 now stopped at don 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.470
 before extracting it, pay attention 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.009
 to 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.909
 for marriage assembly in the same way its 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.060
 to put 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.909
 gently lift not 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.530
 we get it 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.690
 and sang we need camera accountability 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.000
 and as by cable and there drunk 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.640
 wai dress connects directly 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.420
 fay 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.299
 airport 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.250
 in other words 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 so it just turns off 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.360
 now unscrew the fixing bandage 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 eight 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.720
 next we need reporting connector 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.590
 hard drive cables 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.180
 she connector 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.130
 she cable that connects 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.030
 infrared port and light bulb 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.019
 accordingly dress 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.019
 then came to the memory 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:26.300
 or disabled only Tomsk 6 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.300
 that hold the motherboard 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.529
 after that we need tong 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.529
 screwdriver 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.469
 a special hole this one 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:41.599
 here we deliver 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.359
 Kiev so gradually 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.199
 so here is a bit of movement extract 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.569
 main board from under these holes 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.499
 look carefully at what 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.050
 have he left no screwdriver 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.509
 it can be clearly seen 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.650
 then using tweezers disable 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.399
 Power Supply 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.189
 and now we can completely heal 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.189
 fee 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.739
 but the fee is notified 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.790
 I have such a rubber nakladochka 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.479
 flew out 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.699
 from section 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.519
 Well, where is the power supply connected to it now? 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.399
 I will show how to put back because 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:20.939
 very often crashes 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.799
 And this problem most likely you can 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.299
 arise 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.249
 that's the way she needs her brother 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.249
 put no other 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.900
 Further, however, two screws bargaining 106 of which 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.759
 century speaker 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.759
 they are under the tutelage 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.780
 gluing 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.890
 Well, you can stick it right here so that 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.029
 then do not lose 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:49.029
 and here are these two screws thick 6 unscrew 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.809
 not for a moment connected to it 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:52.979
 motherboard 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.669
 so the speaker right away the laptop drive far 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.439
 I don’t need to just side by side 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.599
 take a plastic sponge and a meal 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.599
 honorable connector here is the board 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:08.229
 after that we will need to twist 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.419
 dick then torso 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.950
 3 8 which is mounted cooling systems and 1.6 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.209
 too, which is attached to the topic of storage 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.979
 general replacement of thermal grease on it 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.229
 stocks are quite complicated 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.349
 the task is never done that 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.330
 difficulties may arise 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.110
 so the action is very neat 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.300
 everyday 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.900
 actions adhere to 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.569
 say seven times measure once 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.219
 cut off 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:50.149
 that we do not harm the horn us 

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:53.400
 very often bring these devices after 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.930
 self replacement attempts 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.080
 thermal paste or attempts 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.770
 self install 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.960
 additional create disk 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.990
 quite pitiable 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.590
 the consequences therefore take the time either 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.590
 better trust the professionals 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.360
 here turned off 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.210
 tons of cops that attach the system 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.080
 cooling and now do not need to carefully 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.330
 just move 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.069
 so here in the side 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.999
 notice how it was installed 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:22.960
 what about back stopping 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.379
 no problems 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:28.669
 Well, actually check all the parcels 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.559
 I've seen quite a bit like 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.250
 protect these crystal 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.389
 it is the pasta system that’s the little boy 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.020
 here I will not show well 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.620
 just a few words to clean 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.620
 crystal and oil thermal grease 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.449
 thank you for your attention belyaev and smarter 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:47.239
 all the best to you
