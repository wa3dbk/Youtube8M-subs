00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.290
At the beginning of human history God and
man were together.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.520
Peace and joy reigned.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.400
Then man broke God’s law.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.720
On the same day Adam and Eve sinned, God announced
some of the far-reaching consequences of their sin.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.500
To the woman He said,
“With pain you will give birth to children.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.660
Your desire will be for your husband, and
he will rule over you.” (Genesis 3:16)

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.880
Before sin entered the scene,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.100
Eve rejoiced in her husband’s selfless love and care,
but now their sin-contaminated natures would

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.090
add strife and pain to the joys of marriage.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.880
Next, God told the man,
“Cursed is the ground because of you;

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.940
through painful toil you will eat of it all the days
of your life.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.220
It will produce thorns and thistles for you....

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.820
By the sweat of your brow you will eat your
food until you return to the ground,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.440
since from it you were taken;

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.160
for dust you are and to dust you will return.” (Genesis 3:17-19)

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.840
Because of their sin,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.440
Adam and Eve had lost dominion over the earth.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:49.420
Their world would now include thorns, pain,
sadness, sickness, and death.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.540
Some of us are so accustomed to such misery
that we accept it as normal.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.340
But was it in God’s original design for
a fragrant rosebush to have vicious thorns?

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.880
Or for the wonder of childbirth to include
intense pain?

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.080
Or for those created in God’s image to grow old and die?

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.240
No.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.349
God did not design the original creation to
fight against itself.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.820
It was because
of man’s sin that the earth came under God’s curse.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.220
Mankind had sinned and mankind must die.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.580
The law of sin and death required it.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.260
Death is separation.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.960
Sin produces three terrible separations:

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.580
1. Spiritual Death: Man’s spirit separated
from God.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:51.540
2. Physical Death: Man’s spirit and soul separated
from his body—and from his loved ones.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:01.580
3. Eternal Death: Man’s spirit, soul, and body
forever separated from God—in the Lake of Fire.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.860
Man had no way to save himself from the curse of sin.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.320
Was there any hope?
