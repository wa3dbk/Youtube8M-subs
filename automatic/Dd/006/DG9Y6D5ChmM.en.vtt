00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
panel fence as you can see there what

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.529 
panel fence as you can see there what
happens<00:00:21.150> our<00:00:21.270> guys<00:00:21.420> will<00:00:21.689> set<00:00:21.930> out<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.380> fence

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
happens our guys will set out the fence

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.839 
happens our guys will set out the fence
with<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> string<00:00:24.900> line<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.560> Mark<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.220> spacings

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
with a string line and Mark the spacings

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.160 
with a string line and Mark the spacings
these<00:00:27.119> panels<00:00:27.660> come<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:29.150> 23<00:00:30.150> 60<00:00:30.660> millimeter

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
these panels come in 23 60 millimeter

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.670 
these panels come in 23 60 millimeter
spacing<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.009> 2.36<00:00:32.880> meters<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:34.020> mark<00:00:34.320> them<00:00:34.559> out

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
spacing so 2.36 meters you mark them out

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.060 
spacing so 2.36 meters you mark them out
on<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> ground<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.460> guys<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:35.940> go<00:00:36.120> along<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
on the ground the guys will go along and

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.010 
on the ground the guys will go along and
drill<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.100> those<00:00:38.520> holes<00:00:38.879> prior<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.750> I'll<00:00:39.809> just

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
drill all those holes prior so I'll just

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.000 
drill all those holes prior so I'll just
pan<00:00:40.260> along<00:00:40.530> there

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
pan along there

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.799 
pan along there
they've<00:00:41.219> started<00:00:41.520> concreting<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.540> end

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
they've started concreting in this end

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.410 
they've started concreting in this end
obviously<00:00:43.730> they'll<00:00:44.730> drill<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> holes

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
obviously they'll drill all the holes

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.660 
obviously they'll drill all the holes
there's<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.320> bobcat<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> they<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.430> with

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
there's a bobcat that they do that with

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.630 
there's a bobcat that they do that with
I'll<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.360> take<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> walk<00:00:49.020> along<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.460> as<00:00:50.460> you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
I'll just take a walk along here as you

I'll just take a walk along here as you
can<00:00:50.670> see<00:00:50.789> there<00:00:51.239> though<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.629> hand<00:00:51.870> mix<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
can see there though they hand mix the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410 
can see there though they hand mix the
concrete<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:52.980> space<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.059> posts

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
concrete and they space the the posts

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.180 
concrete and they space the the posts
out<00:00:54.539> using<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.930> bottom<00:00:55.230> rails<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:56.010> their

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
out using the bottom rails to get their

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.369 
out using the bottom rails to get their
spacings<00:00:56.699> right<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.870> they<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.140> start

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
spacings right and then they just start

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.200 
spacings right and then they just start
concreting<00:00:58.949> them<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.190> using<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> string<00:01:00.000> line

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
concreting them in using the string line

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.939 
concreting them in using the string line
as<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> height<00:01:00.660> datum<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.680> they've<00:01:01.800> got<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
as a height datum and they've got a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.100 
as a height datum and they've got a
dumpy<00:01:02.309> level<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.699> helps<00:01:03.329> set<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.750> up<00:01:03.780> there

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
dumpy level that helps set that up there

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.719 
dumpy level that helps set that up there
which<00:01:04.320> I'll<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.619> pan<00:01:04.860> straight<00:01:05.159> past<00:01:05.460> there

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
which I'll just pan straight past there

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.340 
which I'll just pan straight past there
as<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.330> that's<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> level<00:01:07.080> that

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
as you can see that's the level that

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.500 
as you can see that's the level that
it's<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.250> fence<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.760> right

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it's a fence all right

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
it's a fence all right

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
you a look at that in a minute they have

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
you a look at that in a minute they have
a<00:01:45.320> have<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.770> sand<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> stone<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
a have the sand and stone you know in a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
a have the sand and stone you know in a
trailer<00:01:49.350> load<00:01:49.500> mix<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.340> trailer<00:01:50.759> they

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
trailer load mix on the trailer they

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.450 
trailer load mix on the trailer they
then<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.630> put<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.960> into<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:53.960> into<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
then just put that into the into the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.030 
then just put that into the into the
mixer<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.610> mix<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.030> by<00:01:57.270> hand<00:01:57.770> they<00:01:58.770> say

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
mixer and mix that up by hand they say

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.910 
mixer and mix that up by hand they say
they<00:01:59.159> use<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.630> bigger<00:02:00.630> post<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.229> cause<00:02:01.439> for

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
they use a bigger post on the cause for

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.350 
they use a bigger post on the cause for
this<00:02:02.189> instance<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.759> might<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:03.060> swinging<00:02:03.329> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
this instance we might be swinging a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.510 
this instance we might be swinging a
gate<00:02:03.600> off<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.110> that's<00:02:05.070> why<00:02:05.189> there's<00:02:05.369> not

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
gate off it so that's why there's not

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.150 
gate off it so that's why there's not
one<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.119> very<00:02:06.360> corner<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:07.160> whose

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
one just in that very corner there whose

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.270 
one just in that very corner there whose
they<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.429> see<00:02:08.610> they're<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.360> set<00:02:09.660> out<00:02:09.690> just

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
they can see they're all set out just

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.990 
they can see they're all set out just
dug<00:02:11.280> spacings<00:02:12.239> worked<00:02:12.450> out<00:02:12.690> ready<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.080> go

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
dug spacings worked out ready to go

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.170 
dug spacings worked out ready to go
and<00:02:14.260> they<00:02:15.260> then<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:15.620> come<00:02:15.800> back<00:02:15.830> along<00:02:16.340> doing

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
and they then just come back along doing

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.640 
and they then just come back along doing
the<00:02:17.330> concreting<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:17.990> I'll<00:02:18.050> just<00:02:18.200> pan<00:02:18.440> back

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
the concreting so I'll just pan back

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.710 
the concreting so I'll just pan back
around<00:02:18.980> there<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:19.430> go<00:02:20.030> back<00:02:20.270> over<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.630> have

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
around there just go back over and have

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.090 
around there just go back over and have
another<00:02:20.930> quick<00:02:21.170> look<00:02:21.290> at<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.530> process<00:02:21.950> of

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
another quick look at the process of

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.250 
another quick look at the process of
them<00:02:22.250> doing<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:23.090> concreting<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:26.050> then<00:02:27.050> we'll

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
them doing the concreting and then we'll

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.650 
them doing the concreting and then we'll
go<00:02:27.920> from<00:02:28.070> there<00:02:28.190> I'll<00:02:28.820> just<00:02:29.060> move<00:02:29.270> back<00:02:29.480> up
