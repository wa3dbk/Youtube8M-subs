00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
it it does have tannins in it so you do

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.749 
it it does have tannins in it so you do
need<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.970> soak<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.450> soak<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.110> about

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
need to soak it I soak this for about

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.120 
need to soak it I soak this for about
two<00:01:47.759> months<00:01:47.970> or<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.530> actually<00:01:49.530> maybe<00:01:49.829> even

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
two months or so actually maybe even

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.149 
two months or so actually maybe even
three<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.079> every<00:01:52.079> week<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.409> would<00:01:52.470> take<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.950> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
three and every week I would take it and

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.550 
three and every week I would take it and
change<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.450> water<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.930> put<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.409> big

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
change the water just put it in a big

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.990 
change the water just put it in a big
bucket<00:01:55.979> let<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> soak

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
bucket let it soak

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.240 
bucket let it soak
and<00:01:58.630> actually<00:01:58.780> I<00:01:58.990> kind<00:01:59.230> of<00:01:59.260> like<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.590> color<00:01:59.800> of
