00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.200
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.633
 If you have seen our episodes 

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:17.700
 I already know how to give the cannon a shot and who is shooting the target. 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.600
 However, we want everyone to learn better skills. 

00:00:21.067 --> 00:00:23.933
 So we decided to make a series of videos. 

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:25.467
 Introduce the gameplay in more detail 

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:29.000
 Today's theme is armor penetration 

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:33.800
 When an enemy chariot appears in the sight 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.567
 You have to decide where to shoot 

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:37.400
 You need to consider this... 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.067
 Shell type and armor penetration 

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:42.267
 And the armor thickness and angle of the enemy vehicle 

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:45.433
 You don't have to write down all the data of the chariot 

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.533
 Dynamic systems automatically display those... 

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:50.100
 Hard to penetrate, this is very helpful in battle 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.000
 This system is very simple 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.600
 If the armor is shown in red 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.167
 It means that it cannot penetrate 

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:57.000
 Even if you aim at those tiny weak parts, you canâ€™t penetrate. 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.400
 The front armor protection of many chariots is very sophisticated 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.667
 The turret armor is usually thicker than the body armor. 

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:05.333
 So you need to wrap around the side or back of the enemy chariot 

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.033
 Use "automatic aiming" to follow the aiming position 

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.033
 And hit the target very easily 

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.067
 If you like to manually adjust the aiming direction 

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:16.467
 You can turn off the Auto Aiming feature in the Settings menu. 

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:20.500
 There are four types of shells: armor-piercing projectiles (AP) 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.033
 Anti-war vehicle high explosive bomb (HEAT) 

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.633
 Hard core armor-piercing projectile (APCR) and high explosive projectile (HE) 

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.800
 Armor-piercing bullets have general... 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.833
 Armor penetration and damage 

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.167
 Anti-war vehicle high explosive bomb 

00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:32.433
 And hard core armor 

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.867
 The damage caused is the same as the armor-piercing projectile. 

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:35.467
 But their armor penetration is better 

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:37.667
 High explosives cause the highest damage 

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:39.267
 But the armor penetration is very low 

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:41.267
 Therefore, it is usually exploded outside the chariot 

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.600
 Can only play a small part of the potential damage 

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:48.033
 Let's take a closer look at the situation after shooting. 

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:51.300
 When a shell hits an enemy chariot, it begins to calculate 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.333
 If the value of penetration 

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:55.400
 Greater than the shell at a specific angle 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.600
 The value of the thickness of the armor 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.033
 Then the shell will penetrate the armor and cause damage to the tank. 

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.033
 And will fly into the car 

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:04.233
 And cause damage to the various components of the chariot 

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:08.467
 If the armor is too thick, it will not penetrate. 

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:10.767
 In this case, armor-piercing and anti-combat high-explosive bombs 

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:14.333
 And hard core armor-piercing bullets will disappear 

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.667
 High-explosive bombs will explode on armor 

00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:19.733
 It is still possible to cause damage to the chariot and its components. 

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:21.300
 But the damage is lower at this time. 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.267
 Sometimes, shells may hit armor at very flat angles. 

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:25.967
 At this point, there will be a jump 

00:02:26.067 --> 00:02:28.033
 And may hit other parts of the same chariot 

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:31.700
 Then the armor penetration will be calculated again in the usual way. 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.167
 After the second jump, the shell disappeared. 

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:36.433
 Cannonballs cannot hit other chariots after jumping 

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:39.133
 Can't penetrate multiple chariots at once 

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:41.867
 High-explosive bombs will not jump at all 

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:43.133
 So much now 

00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:44.733
 In the next few episodes, we will tell you something interesting... 

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:47.267
 Important game features 

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:48.267
 Please leave your comments in the forum 

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:51.600
 And comments, goodbye!
