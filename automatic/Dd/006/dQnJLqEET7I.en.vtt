00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 play against them already directing with 15 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.350
 25 20 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.360
 he's been playing with five line all his 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:16.789
 life because it's going to change the gold cup 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:20.340
 because this alignment to see 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.890
 guillermo ochoa yes by right out there 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.740
 which as central 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.609
 more or evidently dark brown already 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.609
 he is not dark but there 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:37.770
 osvaldo for the left sector miguel 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.440
 layun talking about line of 4 line of 3 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.089
 the Basque rooster to the clear logical center 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.730
 André saved by left tower 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:49.079
 will travel by right and forward 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.610
 giovanni chicharito and candle to see what bad 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.409
 you see that team to see 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.020
 forget about schemes that more 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:58.190
 mild is the best talent that the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.140
 Mexican there is a substitute oribe peralta 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.629
 noting saints jonathan two saints and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.670
 by someone else for the right sector the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.670
 that you want to avoid a need 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.360
 gerardo because in conclusion when 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.920
 he wants to bet like but because I will lose 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.140
 against guatemala does not have the damn and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.759
 of any one match for is more 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.900
 easy to have no idea the six of 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.100
 ahead of how to play together 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.680
 and look without because the americans zealand 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.060
 to the emergency situation that 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.030
 analyzed the people who knew their 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.400
 system this team that went to brazil 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.440
 knows the system miguel does not know the 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.360
 perfection why he sent to Santiago ay 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.950
 If those words of Miguel Herrera, I 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.840
 I have to send to Santiago, which is 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.360
 be perfectly my system not like the 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.680
 of America's Cup remember also now 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.450
 because the changes there are no players 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.610
 within the selection selection or there will be 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.310
 a player who says he hears miguel you know that 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.720
 we do not settle, you think that having the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.509
 to say something to me, image or 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.800
 neither God hears us will have to 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.560
 start listening or you started 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.569
 learn to listen to Miguel would not fill the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.640
 modification does not come from the divine 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.970
 providence evidently because someone 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.230
 He already said he hears Miguel or we do not adapt 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.709
 to see flames is that they sign football the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.549
 theme is Saturday's game was a 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.959
 line of 5 aja where my appreciation 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.940
 does not contain a contention here we are 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.980
 talking about a natural containment and you 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.450
 correct that first failure but 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.580
 would remove a central and we will also 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.560
 this additional central has been injured 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.250
 owner will be I the only thing I say is that 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.930
 today what 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.210
 he said what what I understand said to 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.230
 see in the training that I did 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.270
 I started with a line of five 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.550
 but he said why and the truth is that 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.530
 balloons were reaching the 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.200
 front he said yes in his 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.459
 interspersed then change to a 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.890
 442 line did not put the three forward 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.750
 this is the safest thing is that neither is it 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.260
 that the rehearsed is not what to say 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.840
 something I'm asking you to play with a 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.860
 4-4-2 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.260
 giovanni 25 good the same this that 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.230
 There is a little bit left over here 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.450
 when the ball has the opponent but 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.010
 there are only two characters in the 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.870
 selection that are going to do that one rafa 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.900
 martínez diego reyes and the other diego 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.390
 kings and then it 's a pretty team 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.090
 most offensive having two was the 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.000
 sides one that comes out to support the cock 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.670
 you're going to also see against but you 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.560
 we give to choose who you put against 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.299
 honduras a yasser corona a miguel 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.720
 Herrera not the ones that put buap wolves 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.590
 It's worth 2 pp 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.630
 the first game against Cuba is the 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.200
 rival to win 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.720
 it's not chili like the gold cup makes 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.940
 generous starts in the second round 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.640
 being generous because they could not 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.170
 say that they are semifinals that starts at 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.290
 final is to say until the fifth game 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.810
 they do not know if you're seeing 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.370
 I think Costa Rica and Honduras are going 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.020
 to also be a rival but do with your 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.900
 jump the crossroad not for that but 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.050
 then start giving him a chance when 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.030
 less in the fourth game at least 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.220
 which in theory would now win 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.070
 transit against honduras works 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.959
 Miguel wins it or takes a match like this 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.150
 you will have to play the entire gold cup and 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.730
 I would not have to come any more 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.150
 modification of miguel herrera after 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.730
 it is the joke is to win to please what 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.470
 we know is a stubborn technician like all 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.290
 the coaches I do not know one single 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.390
 that he does not die with his and that he does not 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.020
 always take something original for 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.020
 according to your vision
