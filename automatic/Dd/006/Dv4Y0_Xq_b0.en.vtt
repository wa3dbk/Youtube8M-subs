00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:12.609
 I in different entities 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.349
 she said ten years ago 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.759
 caring for the line of internationalization of companies 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.539
 outside screen 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.619
 well first we are both the group the cadets and this video more or 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.050
 least we're going to prove it to Locke in programming the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.329
 show of 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.330
 of the operation of the prolegomena everything 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.950
 which we as a group had to live 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.250
 the pocket or the explorer robot 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.200
 the first the theme the famous 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.400
 is the state programming 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.630
 As you can see everything we introduce in a 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.750
 which is repeated externally that is to say that it dictated to evil but to have an end 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.800
 within the is not a condition of the motion sensor 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.640
 which specify what an object is at a distance less than 20 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.750
 centimeters 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.430
 they were true 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.740
 so if a false or if you do not find any type will move towards 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.920
 in front of 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 in an unlimited way as we need in this engine 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.680
 otherwise it remains the same as the true one is 50 object a distance 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.200
 less than 20 centimeters between this motor 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.200
 what he does is stopping the old 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.880
 and then play a sound that is chicken dt 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.830
 which wants to be detected object 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.080
 then we enter a color condition 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.840
 in this specific condition next mode 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.230
 is going to return peladero without the red color 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.860
 the plan will save 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.300
 I went to finger back false 50 any of the other colors 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.010
 if I live from true or so if at the moment of the motion sensor 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.420
 find an object and the color sensor 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.020
 in percent account 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.780
 It has a red color 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.459
 they detect red color 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.239
 we enter this engine which specifies active in three lots in the central motorbike 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.949
 in central motorcycles hegel 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:18.939
 that's why the promoter that is played activates the trigger 12 aces of 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.329
 notation equivalent to three shots 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.329
 that is, 70 red color the roel lego 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.909
 will be interviewed 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.909
 otherwise another color condition enters 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.659
 which physical and psychic 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.640
 Kiev to return lose or yes 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.709
 the consensus of camarillo rouge 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.709
 was going to return fake 50 or any other color 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:42.559
 josé a 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:47.369
 who yes at the moment that the motion sensor considers a gesture 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.369
 and color display detected yellow a yellow color 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.949
 then we enter this engine which specifies 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.299
 the ego is going to be two shots 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.879
 which equals 1 points 5 1 points and 3 5 rocks and years 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.510
 otherwise fiftyish and and I love mind 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.809
 detect 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.479
 an object 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:12.259
 percent and the shock with the right detect any other color that are not 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.199
 members with yellow 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.199
 then the robot is going to be a shot that sneaks a rotation 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.469
 after this we enter a side 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.469
 the specific grandon values ​​between 0 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.189
 that is, if alone, no less than the seedling will generate 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.169
 and which is connected to a validation look 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.299
 the imminent 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.480
 in the north mons is not specified 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.299
 default 3 1 or bad to give or do 1 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.199
 so if the ran where it becomes true 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:47.199
 dvd 1 sorry 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.729
 enter the conditions given to the part above 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:56.089
 which we specify an engine that makes the robot turn like this has done before a 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.170
 second and then play a sound called 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.179
 crying 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:05.199
 so also if the randon generates the number zero 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.979
 then it is recognized as false 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.609
 which the specific amount that will come a second step from the left 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.069
 and then play the sound 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.169
 of crying 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.190
 now this is a whole cycle aa these variations run again and again and 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:26.139
 again infinitely 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.840
 i this way we can 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.500
 have a program of we can the tomatito shot 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.680
 as we show it 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.819
 right now 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.639
 well how can you observe the toledo has a motion sensor for 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.129
 veto objects 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.569
 so also with his charger implemented for the balls 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.330
 Take into account a color sensor to determine the action to be taken 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.969
 so it also has three engines which funds for raids 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:59.899
 i the central engine by the way but p'al trigger 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.320
 cooper observes our lego function of the fundamental parts the parties 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.819
 basic for 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.729
 The idea is to carry out your training 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:10.570
 i 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.570
 now we will see it in action 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:16.550
 bankia 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.830
 the actress 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.830
 on the other hand 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.770
 eleven 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.059
 the actress 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.449
 on the other hand 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:29.260
 eleven 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.550
 the actress 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.550
 on the other hand 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:38.450
 eleven 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.729
 the actress 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.729
 on the other hand 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.669
 11h 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.669
 on the other hand lópez 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:57.819
 11 order 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.619
 on the other hand lópez 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:03.719
 11 finally 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:06.719
 on the other hand lópez 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.029
 on the other hand 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:14.029
 11 the actress 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.180
 on the other hand lópez 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:20.639
 eleven 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.020
 the actress 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.020
 on the other hand 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.749
 11 the actress 

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:44.749
 on the other hand lópez 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.100
 eleven 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.249
 the actress 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:49.539
 on the other hand
