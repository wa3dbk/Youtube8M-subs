00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.200
 today I am here with my 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.060
 Frank partner and we will explain 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.740
 a little bit about the shots and 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.830
 movements of cameras that can be 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.210
 perform at the time of making a shot 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.150
 we must take into account several 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.330
 aspects the first of them is the 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.520
 framing but they fit well is 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.619
 delimit in a square or rectangle 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.829
 around the image and choose that 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.829
 enters and that there is no child the second 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.839
 aspect is the air that is the space 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.059
 empty that can be found on 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:44.140
 below or to the sides of the person or persons 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.909
 that are being taken there are several 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.609
 rules to be able to frame a 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:50.920
 person the first of them is to locate 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:54.010
 the subject's eyes two thirds of the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.260
 screen and the second is to locate the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.870
 half of the box the nose of the character 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.389
 another advice is that when you follow 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.250
 a person should leave a bit of 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:05.220
 air in front of her 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.680
 taking into account these elements 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.860
 we'll start with the basic shots the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.350
 pan is a totally open shot and it 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.510
 used to show landscapes or environments 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.780
 Thank you 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.770
 the new sun is a location shot a 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.860
 little more closed the pulse is a shot 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.040
 of the whole body 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.070
 the medium blogspot is a shot that 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.770
 Worthy the head towards the knees 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.560
 minishop is a shot that is made of 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.760
 the head to the waist or the waist 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.580
 towards the feet the normal close up goes 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.850
 from the taste to the head the 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.340
 Prosoft covers only the face the 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.860
 bicycles shop is a specific shot of 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.070
 one of the body parts can be 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.430
 the arms a leg or a hand 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.979
 and the extreme shop is the most closed outlet 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.100
 this shows very specific details 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.070
 of the body as a wound a cut or 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.709
 some imperfection in the face when 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.970
 We take two people called to 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.340
 show and when they are three is called prison 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.709
 the lover shoulders shot is behind 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.260
 of a person's shoulder and this one 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.310
 shows what is in front of 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.160
 she and the genital is a totally takes 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.790
 vertical when we take objects 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.070
 it's called tyson in commercials it 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.530
 uses the product whose objective 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.900
 principal is to sell a product and 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.480
 there may be a human presence in 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.790
 these cases the pays is also used 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.020
 back in which all the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.020
 products of an alien 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.760
 the first ones that we're going to see are about 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.670
 the axis these are made only 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.340
 on the axis of the camera itself in this 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.709
 case of the triple the first is the bread 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.250
 wright in which we move our camera 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:08.130
 to the right but only the 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:13.290
 camera and the bread we do the opposite 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.800
 obviously to the left 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.480
 we have a way bread the way bread is 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.890
 similar to the previous ones the only thing that 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.840
 it differs is that it is a movement 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.670
 much faster to give an effect of 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.890
 swept in the image and made of this 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.590
 way this is here with your subject and if 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.060
 I would like to take the front the only thing 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.450
 what I do is mode my camera shape 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.450
 fast 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.030
 now there are other types of movements 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.420
 that these can already be done in a 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.360
 tripiÃ© in an idle or on a crane in this 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.040
 case I have a tripod with dolly the 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.890
 which allows me to move my camera 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.520
 freely throughout the floor and the first 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.010
 what we are going to see is the travel white 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.530
 I am here 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.800
 and I move to the right 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.400
 and the guy otherwise 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.860
 obviously to the left there is a 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.460
 movement that is called dolin me 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.420
 encounter far from the subject 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:17.570
 and moving an idol and I'm getting closer to 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.000
 he this is a movement also he 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.470
 performed many times with the king and his 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.690
 reverse shape that is backwards 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.690
 obviously it's called allies 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.740
 there are movements that are made only 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.500
 with the lens of the camera the summit is 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.830
 try to make an approach in the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.440
 zoom back a distance is made and in the 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.800
 focus and focus something that is 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.000
 out of focus and in focus out blur 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.000
 something focused
