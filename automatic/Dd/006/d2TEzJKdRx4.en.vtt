00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.550
 in our schedule was a game 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.260
 I always have the iss unit in there very much 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.210
 looked forward to it then noticed 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.170
 that I am direct but not right 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.880
 had it set is called unity 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.880
 that's not it unfortunately not 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.809
 yes it was not only now 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.160
 unit but there were four men 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.730
 at the same time somehow access 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.730
 with us it was only 21 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.949
 corp played and what do I say wait 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.299
 actually good so it is very much 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.579
 nice that one has but already 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.740
 trailer seen me a bit 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.970
 it was quite different 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.899
 thus controls even walls 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.580
 climb up that is again 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.110
 much more dynamic so you are 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.420
 relatively fast up the power now 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.460
 So flip up three times or yes 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.369
 Already on top of the roof but the fights 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.750
 are much more exhausting and me 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.280
 could also generally like this 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.149
 feeling so if you go an edge ran 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.110
 It usually has that I still 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.460
 you just have to go down 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.630
 press a button for it so I have 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.399
 the feeling they have everywhere 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.750
 that's an element why they are 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.470
 I'm completely complicating that 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.069
 Roger that 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.479
 yes yes what's called when where it's more complicated 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.250
 but think better is just synonymous with 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.710
 the skill tree and the whole 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.659
 equipment so you can endlessly many 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.819
 I have 200 things he could have said 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.929
 you get dressed like that and dressing 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.369
 so on the see all very 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.390
 different and you can then 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.520
 I also do not want to say that now 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.470
 just crawl but I pull myself 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.239
 Plate armor and take an ax 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.220
 with so there are actually axes and 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:56.679
 lances and such and that I find quite 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.940
 funny I think there is also you can 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.470
 you also clothes battlefield 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.450
 put on and then or a tank on 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.250
 and then you have then through Paris 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.899
 so I know had already come 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.920
 I had already thought that because you 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.660
 I watch because so stupid 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.500
 now he's coming up with some 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.819
 joke well but that's how we are 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.830
 we must be too if eric and 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.620
 because he stupid jokes for the channel 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.640
 we have to do a little bit of maneuvering 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.989
 I want to get it somewhere 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.180
 If you have not yet reached the 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.220
 a stupid saying over here others 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.560
 Maybe videos therefore only unit here 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.580
 look 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.810
 maybe what else would find me 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.810
 very happy that would be nice
