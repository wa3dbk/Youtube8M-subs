behind it so I hope it sticks around for

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.010 
behind it so I hope it sticks around for
a<00:00:45.059> while<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.450> who<00:00:45.600> would<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.780> thought<00:00:45.870> it

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
a while and who would have thought it

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.270 
a while and who would have thought it
would<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.200> come<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:46.440> Michigan<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.100> not<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
would have come at Michigan and not a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310 
would have come at Michigan and not a
road<00:00:47.489> course<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.809> how<00:00:48.960> much<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
road course for you so how much have the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.439 
road course for you so how much have the
tires<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.829> new<00:00:49.950> tires<00:00:50.190> change<00:00:50.579> your<00:00:51.120> setup

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
tires the new tires change your setup

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.360 
tires the new tires change your setup
and<00:00:51.629> how<00:00:51.780> fast<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.260> car<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.860> think<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and how fast your car is I think it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.189 
and how fast your car is I think it
changed<00:00:53.699> everybody<00:00:54.000> set<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:54.300> quite<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> lot<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
changed everybody set up quite a lot a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.369 
changed everybody set up quite a lot a
lot<00:00:55.680> freer<00:00:56.030> for<00:00:57.030> sure<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.570> less<00:00:57.809> grip<00:00:58.109> less

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
lot freer for sure and less grip less

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.290 
lot freer for sure and less grip less
stability<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.460> were<00:00:59.850> trying<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
stability so we were trying to get the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.549 
stability so we were trying to get the
rear<00:01:00.449> end<00:01:00.629> hucked<00:01:00.809> up<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.020> little<00:01:01.140> bit<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.410> us

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
rear end hucked up a little bit for us

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.770 
rear end hucked up a little bit for us
yesterday<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.309> yesterday's<00:01:02.730> practice<00:01:02.969> we

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
yesterday in yesterday's practice we

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.420 
yesterday in yesterday's practice we
started<00:01:04.110> cycle<00:01:04.439> some<00:01:04.559> tires<00:01:04.739> too<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.040> think

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
started cycle some tires too I think

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.890 
started cycle some tires too I think
cycles<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.150> tires<00:01:06.330> gonna<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.689> really

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
cycles on tires gonna be really

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.929 
cycles on tires gonna be really
important<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:08.130> know<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.369> tires<00:01:08.610> are<00:01:08.760> so

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
important here you know the tires are so

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.850 
important here you know the tires are so
hard<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.110> know<00:01:10.200> they<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.590> better

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
hard that you know they just get better

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.859 
hard that you know they just get better
