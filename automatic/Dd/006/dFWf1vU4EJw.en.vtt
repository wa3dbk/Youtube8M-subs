00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.130
 Hello, I am often asked about 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.099
 how fast can you lose weight and here I am 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.230
 immediately responding that quick weight loss is 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.210
 does not mean proper weight loss is not 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.109
 means healthy weight loss is not 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.029
 It means that you will help your body. 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.369
 thus if you lose weight quickly for example 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.279
 through some hunger strike or exhausting 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.650
 workouts i.e. slimming should be 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.170
 healthy weight loss should be helpful 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.630
 for the whole body and here it is very 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.630
 it is important to switch to proper nutrition then 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.890
 there is to understand what is proper nutrition 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.100
 there must be some 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.320
 workouts but again not immediately 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.750
 run and swing press gradually need 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.510
 prepare your body by some kind of reinforced 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.420
 loads and beyond that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.559
 necessarily cleansing and here it is just 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.960
 many are the question they are right 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.719
 eat they are engaged they are cleaned and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.640
 their weight stands still 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.409
 all the weight doesn't go away they all do 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.200
 correct wrong lose weight but weight 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.630
 it is worth it is necessary to understand that you 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.560
 when you exercise your muscles grow too 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.280
 and maybe your weight is gone 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.170
 not so noticeable to you but noticeable for 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.320
 your body that is leaving this fat 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.220
 but muscles grow and here is sure 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.750
 you need to measure your volumes to do measurements 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.229
 that is, you can weigh each 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.079
 day but do not measure your volumes while 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.360
 your volumes will change ie your 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.990
 muscle mass will increase fat will 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.750
 leave 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.119
 here my students often write to me about 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.060
 that they are surprised that when they 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.880
 their weight is weighed the same but when 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.729
 they measure their volumes are surprised 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.270
 how much their volumes have changed 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.579
 waist in chest thighs meaning weight 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.680
 remains the same volume goes away therefore 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.090
 it is very important not only to be weighed but 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.509
 measure your volumes 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.719
 so the most important thing is to understand what 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.040
 and the point is not to lose weight quickly 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.869
 lose weight 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.490
 to lose weight properly helping your 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.950
 body get rid of toxins 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.260
 however, after this, do not dial a new one 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.790
