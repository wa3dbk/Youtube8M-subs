00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.760
 in this video a number of questions will be answered about the start and the 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.760
 participation in drug research 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.130
 a research protocol must be written before that research starts 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.870
 in the big concert among others wrote what the purpose of a it 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.010
 Investigation The drug is investigating whether the subjects are being intimidated 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.249
 and which actions are performed 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.699
 the protocol is filed where all sorts of agencies including the medical 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.010
 ethical review committee 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.110
 and only if they give their approval to the authorities may the investigation say 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.110
 they 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.500
 if they have given their approval but investigation may have started 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.730
 participants their after his brother 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.630
 if a test subject indicates that he or she is interested in a concert by 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.110
 information interview at the port research center 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.570
 during that conversation doctors give very comprehensive information about it 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.570
 research and all information about investigate and get the test subjects 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.540
 also get along that he or she can read at home just as well and read it 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.540
 may also discuss with your own doctor 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.750
 if the subjects closes to participate in a container 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.750
 research center to have a forum the first vision during the first visit 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.880
 the first written permission statement is signed 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.100
 in the end, the test subjects actually lead to having all the information 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.020
 delivered 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.070
 release and voluntary participation 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.650
 but that she is signed both by the doctors pastor the test subjects can 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.560
 start the investigation 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.430
 sit during the first four 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.260
 that is being looked at 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.120
 the person's health and whether the person also complies with all services 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.120
 prices of products research 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.390
 and our suspicious acts means that the subjects are at the end of the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.310
 day back home the test subjects do not have to stay overnight but it 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.070
 may be that the test subjects have to go to the center several times 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.070
 come for a day treatment 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.509
 In an investigation with an internal recording, the test subjects would be following it today 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.989
 research center and the test subjects should also 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.369
 spend the night 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.019
 and what the test subjects intend to take 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.160
 thatcher is assigned to the existing test in writing 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.909
 but eating and drinking is always fun 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.019
 all the data from the test subjects that are analyzed always happens 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.409
 all a new device are only worked with patient with a knife and a 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.909
 hammer to enjoy in use 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.620
 but this analysis looks at possible side effects and the effect of 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.689
 the method 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.670
 the results of those analyzes that are submitted to all authorities 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.269
 where the study has been approved 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.040
 and if these results have been viewed by the authorities and now too 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.510
 approved and can continue with the next research phase
