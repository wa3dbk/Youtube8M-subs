00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.490 
but what I've experienced so far is that
it's<00:02:06.240> pretty<00:02:06.509> solid<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.290> very

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
it's pretty solid and it's a very

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.559 
it's pretty solid and it's a very
reliable<00:02:07.770> piece<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.369> software<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.330> do<00:02:09.450> have

reliable piece of software but I do have
a<00:02:09.599> few<00:02:09.840> issues<00:02:09.989> with<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.470> though<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.830> one

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
a few issues with it though and one

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.010 
a few issues with it though and one
thing<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.550> aesthetic<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.810> what

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
thing is aesthetic and it's that what

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.760 
thing is aesthetic and it's that what
under

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
under

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.510 
Google Nexus 5 name you can see that you
have<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.170> bunch<00:02:16.320> of<00:02:16.410> different<00:02:16.680> icons<00:02:16.830> for<00:02:17.310> apps

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
have a bunch of different icons for apps

have a bunch of different icons for apps
SMS<00:02:18.240> music<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.750> stuff<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.290> those<00:02:19.950> apps

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
SMS music and stuff like that those apps

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.420 
SMS music and stuff like that those apps
are<00:02:20.490> actually<00:02:20.700> iOS<00:02:21.420> icons<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:23.220> really

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
are actually iOS icons and that really

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.890 
are actually iOS icons and that really
doesn't<00:02:23.700> make<00:02:23.760> sense<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:24.150> me<00:02:24.240> this<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.660> mobile

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
doesn't make sense to me this is mobile

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.170 
doesn't make sense to me this is mobile
go<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:25.530> Android<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.610> would<00:02:26.850> think<00:02:27.030> that

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
go for Android and so I would think that

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.360 
go for Android and so I would think that
for<00:02:27.480> an<00:02:27.570> Android<00:02:27.960> application<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.340> a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
for an Android application for like a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.310 
for an Android application for like a
program<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.300> would<00:02:30.420> have<00:02:30.570> icons<00:02:31.080> that

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
program you would have icons that

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.320 
program you would have icons that
correspond<00:02:31.830> with<00:02:31.860> Android<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.610> honestly<00:02:33.240> I

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
correspond with Android and honestly I

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.300 
correspond with Android and honestly I
think<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.080> just<00:02:34.200> kind<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.500> sloppy<00:02:34.800> it's

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
think this is just kind of sloppy it's

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.770 
think this is just kind of sloppy it's
not<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.490> deal<00:02:35.760> breaker<00:02:36.000> or<00:02:36.240> anything<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.630> can

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
not a deal breaker or anything you can

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.810 
not a deal breaker or anything you can
still<00:02:36.990> use<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.320> program<00:02:37.710> just<00:02:37.890> fine<00:02:38.160> but<00:02:38.700> it's

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
still use the program just fine but it's

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.100 
still use the program just fine but it's
just<00:02:38.970> something<00:02:39.210> that<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:39.390> noticed<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:39.990> it's

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
just something that I noticed and it's

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.920 
just something that I noticed and it's
just<00:02:40.320> like<00:02:40.560> really<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.670> have<00:02:41.790> iOS<00:02:42.060> icons<00:02:42.660> but

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
just like really you have iOS icons but

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.750 
just like really you have iOS icons but
this<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.260> software<00:02:43.950> for<00:02:44.130> Android<00:02:44.490> and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
another issue that I've kind of noticed

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.960 
another issue that I've kind of noticed
that<00:02:46.740> really<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.040> an<00:02:47.160> issue<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.670> just<00:02:47.700> more

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
goes up and down I think they're having

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.270 
goes up and down I think they're having
a<00:04:00.600> sale<00:04:00.780> right<00:04:00.959> now<00:04:01.020> it's<00:04:01.290> right<00:04:01.470> around<00:04:01.620> 24

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
bucks but I think it's usually a little

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.660 
bucks but I think it's usually a little
bit<00:04:03.570> more<00:04:03.810> than<00:04:03.990> that<00:04:04.110> but<00:04:04.890> I'm<00:04:05.250> not<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.580> type

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
bit more than that but I'm not the type

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.280 
bit more than that but I'm not the type
of<00:04:05.730> person<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.090> use<00:04:06.240> it<00:04:06.420> so<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.660> really<00:04:07.020> want<00:04:07.230> to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
of person to use it so I really want to

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.350 
of person to use it so I really want to
consider<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.680> worth<00:04:07.950> worth<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.670> price<00:04:08.880> for<00:04:09.209> me

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
consider it worth worth the price for me

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.790 
consider it worth worth the price for me
