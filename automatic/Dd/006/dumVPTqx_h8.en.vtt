you just there's nothing quite to equate
it<00:00:33.230> to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.760

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
you can see all of these foundations

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.550

this part of the tsunami if they were in
this<00:00:57.750> area<00:00:58.200> more<00:00:58.500> than<00:00:58.650> likely<00:01:00.920> absolutely

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that from the direction here the the

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
tsunami came up right through here and

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.240

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
you can see that it was high enough to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.370

to visit a few more of these farms today
and<00:02:43.040> see<00:02:43.280> if<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:43.489> can<00:02:43.640> come<00:02:43.790> up<00:02:43.850> with<00:02:44.120> a

and see if we can come up with a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.030 
and see if we can come up with a
strategy<00:02:44.450> if<00:02:44.989> this<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.320> something<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.709> will

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
strategy if this is something that will

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.860 
strategy if this is something that will
be<00:02:46.190> able<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.519> help<00:02:46.640> out<00:02:46.880> with<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.630> just

we<00:02:54.060> cannot<00:02:54.480> allow<00:02:54.630> these<00:02:54.960> animals<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.620> suffer

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.030 

this<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.660> Fukushima<00:03:07.170> wildlife

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040

this is the Fukushima wildlife
rehabilitation<00:03:08.310> center<00:03:13.970> what<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.090> see

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
rehabilitation center what you see

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.690 
rehabilitation center what you see
behind<00:03:15.420> me<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:16.500> one<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.980> aviaries<00:03:17.520> that

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
behind me is one of the aviaries that

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.820 
behind me is one of the aviaries that
was<00:03:17.850> damaged<00:03:18.300> from<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.840> earthquake<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.680> can

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
was damaged from the earthquake you can

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.130 
was damaged from the earthquake you can
see<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.310> mast<00:03:20.550> was<00:03:21.360> damaged<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:21.990> the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
see that the mast was damaged and the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.440 
see that the mast was damaged and the
net<00:03:22.350> came<00:03:22.620> down<00:03:22.890> this<00:03:23.580> is<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> rehabilitation

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
net came down this is a rehabilitation

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.720 
net came down this is a rehabilitation
area<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.320> they<00:03:25.440> use<00:03:25.590> for<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.890> owl<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
area that they use for the owl and the

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.510 
area that they use for the owl and the
Falcon<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.380> just<00:03:28.710> one<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.130> the

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
Falcon so this is just one of the

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.220 
Falcon so this is just one of the
structures<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.150> was<00:03:30.480> damaged<00:03:30.870> because<00:03:31.050> of

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
structures that was damaged because of

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.550 
structures that was damaged because of
the<00:03:31.410> earthquake<00:03:33.050> you<00:03:34.050> know<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.170> think<00:03:34.290> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
the earthquake you know I think the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.810 
the earthquake you know I think the
biggest<00:03:34.650> thing<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.010> we're<00:03:35.250> concerned<00:03:35.550> about

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
biggest thing that we're concerned about

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.310 
biggest thing that we're concerned about
is<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.150> when<00:03:36.300> you<00:03:36.390> have<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.630> tsunami<00:03:37.110> and

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
is that when you have a tsunami and

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.050 
is that when you have a tsunami and
earthquake<00:03:37.710> of<00:03:38.160> this<00:03:38.310> magnitude<00:03:38.670> there's

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
earthquake of this magnitude there's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.270 
earthquake of this magnitude there's
going<00:03:39.210> to<00:03:39.270> be<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.390> loss<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.810> habitat<00:03:40.280> even

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
going to be a loss of habitat even

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.310 
going to be a loss of habitat even
though<00:03:41.400> we're<00:03:41.550> not<00:03:41.580> seeing<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.330> strong<00:03:42.720> influx

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
though we're not seeing a strong influx

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.110 
though we're not seeing a strong influx
now<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.830> wildlife<00:03:44.310> what<00:03:44.580> we<00:03:44.670> have<00:03:44.760> seen<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
now of wildlife what we have seen in the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.650 
now of wildlife what we have seen in the
past<00:03:45.300> is<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.900> as<00:03:46.080> these<00:03:46.830> weeks<00:03:47.130> go<00:03:47.370> on<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.910> as

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
past is that as these weeks go on and as

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.030 
past is that as these weeks go on and as
people<00:03:48.840> start<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.380> get<00:03:49.500> back<00:03:49.650> into<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.010> area

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
people start to get back into the area

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.030 
people start to get back into the area
they'll<00:03:50.520> either<00:03:50.700> find<00:03:51.090> injured<00:03:52.080> wildlife<00:03:52.470> or

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
they'll either find injured wildlife or

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.740 
they'll either find injured wildlife or
they'll<00:03:53.250> find<00:03:53.490> wildlife<00:03:53.850> that<00:03:54.030> no<00:03:54.180> longer<00:03:54.540> are

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
they'll find wildlife that no longer are

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.500 
they'll find wildlife that no longer are
able<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.440> exist<00:03:56.040> in<00:03:56.160> their<00:03:56.310> habitat<00:03:56.480> so<00:03:57.480> I

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
able to exist in their habitat so I

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.930 
able to exist in their habitat so I
suspect<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.410> toshio<00:03:59.250> will<00:03:59.520> start<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.910> see

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
suspect that toshio will start to see

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.030 
suspect that toshio will start to see
more<00:04:00.450> animals<00:04:01.170> being<00:04:01.380> brought<00:04:01.680> into<00:04:01.860> the

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
center and we want to make sure that we

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.840 
center and we want to make sure that we
have<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.200> plan<00:04:04.470> in<00:04:04.650> place<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.460> that<00:04:05.490> if<00:04:05.670> they<00:04:05.790> do

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
have a plan in place so that if they do

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.400 
have a plan in place so that if they do
