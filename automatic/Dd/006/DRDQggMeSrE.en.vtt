00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.390 
Iowa again had a question the PK
predator<00:03:12.510> looks<00:03:12.720> great<00:03:12.990> for<00:03:13.140> casting<00:03:13.770> but<00:03:14.250> how

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
predator looks great for casting but how

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.370 
predator looks great for casting but how
is<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.790> action<00:03:15.210> when<00:03:15.330> vertically<00:03:15.840> jig<00:03:16.140> well

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
is the action when vertically jig well

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.380 
is the action when vertically jig well
believe<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.770> or<00:03:16.830> not<00:03:16.980> Paul<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.850> predator<00:03:18.240> was

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
believe it or not Paul the predator was

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.480 
believe it or not Paul the predator was
actually<00:03:18.840> developed<00:03:19.020> for<00:03:19.680> vertical<00:03:20.220> jigging

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
actually developed for vertical jigging

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.210 
actually developed for vertical jigging
it's<00:03:20.730> just<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.030> fact<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.420> we<00:03:22.410> thought<00:03:22.950> hey

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
it's just the fact that we thought hey

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.210 
it's just the fact that we thought hey
it<00:03:23.580> looks<00:03:23.730> good<00:03:24.000> casting<00:03:24.570> too<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:25.380> it's

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
it looks good casting too and so it's

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.430 
it looks good casting too and so it's
deadly<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:26.820> both<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.270> cast<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.810> retrieve<00:03:28.170> and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
deadly in both the cast and retrieve and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.790 
deadly in both the cast and retrieve and
also<00:03:29.090> prostaff<00:03:30.090> like<00:03:30.750> myself<00:03:30.959> have<00:03:31.320> used<00:03:31.590> it

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
also prostaff like myself have used it

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.699 
also prostaff like myself have used it
to<00:03:32.300> you<00:03:33.300> know<00:03:33.390> put<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.840> trout<00:03:34.110> stream<00:03:34.140> and

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
to you know put it in a trout stream and

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.520 
to you know put it in a trout stream and
pop<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.730> current<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.660> results<00:03:37.410> for

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
pop it in the current the results for

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.280 
pop it in the current the results for
rainbows<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.430> browns<00:03:38.780> are<00:03:39.780> pretty

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
rainbows and browns are pretty

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.380 
rainbows and browns are pretty
ridiculous<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.280> jigging<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.240> lure

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
ridiculous so jigging this lure

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.820 
ridiculous so jigging this lure
vertically<00:03:42.930> though<00:03:43.080> has<00:03:43.290> always<00:03:43.650> been<00:03:43.770> the

vertically though has always been the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.060 
vertically though has always been the
the<00:03:44.459> reason<00:03:44.720> creating<00:03:45.720> more<00:03:45.900> flash<00:03:46.290> this

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
the reason creating more flash this

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.210 
the reason creating more flash this
pineapple<00:03:47.520> hammer<00:03:48.240> if<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.600> can<00:03:48.750> see<00:03:48.990> that<00:03:49.220> is

pineapple hammer if you can see that is

attractant and the blade design was

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.290 
attractant and the blade design was
created<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.650> bounce<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.160> lure<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.730> produce

created the bounce to lure and produce

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.780 
created the bounce to lure and produce
more<00:03:58.050> audible<00:03:58.380> sound<00:03:58.830> while<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.340> body<00:03:59.550> of<00:03:59.730> the

and drop and create a quick change of
direction<00:04:04.770> which<00:04:05.220> simulates<00:04:05.550> more<00:04:06.330> strikes
