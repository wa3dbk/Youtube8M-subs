00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.610

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.530
 11 today is super huge hug the 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.500
 people who are watching me on the day of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.690
 today this is going to be a dedicated video for 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.180
 valentine where I'll fix 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.689
 step by step since I get out of the shower 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.939
 until this moment this ship is 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.189
 perfect for something casual but it has 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.040
 followed during the day a lunch for 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.900
 freire cinema go to a park and the 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.340
 I recommend for the day and if there is something left 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.340
 at night I will make another 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.089
 I just got out of the shower and first thing 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.019
 What I'm going to do is apply a cream 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:46.930
 moisturizer on my face and another cream a 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:50.550
 little more powerful in my arms and in the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.550
 area of ​​my neck 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.500
 but my hair is here without 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.620
 no knot and then I'm going to start 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.759
 Dry it with my dryer before starting 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.759
 to do my makeup 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.770
 The first thing I should do is apply a bonus 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.600
 to close my pores and then the base 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.040
 that in this case I will be 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.040
 applying with my fingers 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.600
 decided to use a concealer only one tone 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:35.270
 Lighter my skin color and fit 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.759
 triangular below my eyes I'm going 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.759
 to apply with the help of a brochita 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.229
 also apply a little bit in the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.150
 eyelids and this will erase completely 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.060
 the fatigue 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.900
 with loose powder I'm going to seal what 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.900
 I did previous 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.290
 with a bronzer I will add shadows 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.320
 in my face and then we will use blush to 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:10.380
 add a little color this weitz 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.380
 cosmetics is my favorite at the moment 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.900
 I'm going to make up and fill my eyebrows 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.810
 using the anastasia products of 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.960
 drink liquids your products are the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.040
 better for eyebrows so down below them 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.040
 I'm going to leave the link 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.240
 but my eyes I will make use of the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.070
 palette vice 2 and I'll start with this 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.070
 pink on the entire eyelid 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.790
 with dark brown I will add the 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.400
 depth to my eyes 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.739
 try to join them with the pink that 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.540
 we apply previously and we blur 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.540
 everything very well 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.140
 I will use a more powerful pink for our 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.500
 lacrimal and the bottom part of our 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.209
 eyes with a skin-colored eyeliner 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.209
 to delineate inside 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.030
 We will use a liquid eyeliner and we will 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.000
 try to make the line finite 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.490
 possible and super close to our 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.190
 tabs 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.160
 with a gel eyeliner and help from a 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.160
 brush let's make the cat's tail 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.260
 then we go to the mascara and we're going to apply 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.240
 enough mascara because in that look 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.690
 natural we will not use tabs 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.690
 false 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:56.060
 remember that you also have to apply 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.060
 first on the tabs below 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.750
 I will apply a little illuminator to 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.069
 Give that natural light and shine to your face 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.500
 I will now give my lips with a 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.800
 super moisturizing paint that has a 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.020
 little pink and apply a 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.260
 spray so that my makeup lasts all 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.260
 the day 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.430
 and we take off the bathrobe us 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.620
 we put on our dress and we finish 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.979
 give the final touches to our 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.979
 hair 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.880
 after it is already legal and without 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.460
 no wrinkle even by the part 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:43.350
 from behind I'm going to put my rings 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.960
 great and it's time to smell rich 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.990
 I'm sure we all want to smell 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.580

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.550
 valentine 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.979
 if you are going to wear a dress or a skirt 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.729
 do not forget to apply cream so your 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.759
 legs do not look dry and we're already
