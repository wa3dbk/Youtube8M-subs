00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
with a G C and the e and the reason is

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.719 
with a G C and the e and the reason is
now<00:01:35.930> we<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.409> go<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> C<00:01:38.250> here<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
now we can just go up to the C here and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.319 
now we can just go up to the C here and
keep<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.270> there

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
keep it there

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.250 
keep it there
