00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
nights at Freddy's coming to console and

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.720 
nights at Freddy's coming to console and
before<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:07.980> think<00:00:08.189> know<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.610> should

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
before you think know that it should

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.669 
before you think know that it should
only<00:00:08.820> be<00:00:09.059> on<00:00:09.090> PC<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.080> then<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.410> know<00:00:10.500> that's

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
only be on PC and then you know that's

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.080 
only be on PC and then you know that's
where<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:10.920> should<00:00:10.950> stay<00:00:11.070> that's<00:00:11.580> where<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.969> was

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
where it should stay that's where it was

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.379 
where it should stay that's where it was
born<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.799> think<00:00:13.799> it's<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.670> know<00:00:14.700> good<00:00:15.030> idea<00:00:15.240> to

born I think it's you know good idea to

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.650 
born I think it's you know good idea to
go<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.690> look<00:00:15.780> at<00:00:15.900> Minecraft<00:00:17.000> another<00:00:18.000> largely

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
go and look at Minecraft another largely

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.750 
go and look at Minecraft another largely
successful<00:00:19.170> game<00:00:19.529> with<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> large<00:00:20.130> following

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
successful game with a large following

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.730 
successful game with a large following
and<00:00:20.939> say<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.630> know<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:22.080> minecraft<00:00:22.380> was

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
and say that you know that minecraft was

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.950 
and say that you know that minecraft was
on<00:00:22.859> PC<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.519> first<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:24.600> was<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.779> two

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
on PC for the first what was it two

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.710 
on PC for the first what was it two
years<00:00:25.350> or<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.099> then<00:00:26.269> finally<00:00:27.269> came<00:00:27.480> you

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
years or so and then finally came you

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.779 
years or so and then finally came you
know<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.900> all<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.680> every<00:00:29.310> console

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
know to all that to every console

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.450 
know to all that to every console
basically<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.650> think<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.160> know<00:00:32.279> that's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
basically and I think you know that's

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.819 
basically and I think you know that's
always<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.030> good<00:00:33.360> idea<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
always a good idea now I know that the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.370 
always a good idea now I know that the
controls<00:00:35.370> might<00:00:35.670> seem<00:00:36.059> kind<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.600> impractical

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
controls might seem kind of impractical

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.030 
controls might seem kind of impractical
or

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
or

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.040 
or
you<00:00:38.579> know<00:00:38.700> you'd<00:00:38.790> say<00:00:38.940> how<00:00:39.149> do<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.300> how<00:00:39.989> are

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you know you'd say how do you how are

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.270 
you know you'd say how do you how are
you<00:00:40.110> going<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> do<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> controller<00:00:40.980> well<00:00:41.250> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
you going to do with a controller well I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.190 
you going to do with a controller well I
figure<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.270> least<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.660> five<00:00:42.870> nights<00:00:43.050> at

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200

cameras you just could press X and then

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.760 
cameras you just could press X and then
use<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.450> know<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.780> toggle<00:01:10.200> sticks<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:10.650> use

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
use at you know the toggle sticks or use

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.380 
use at you know the toggle sticks or use
the<00:01:10.860> directional<00:01:11.369> pads<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.909> select<00:01:12.210> which

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the directional pads to select which

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.280 
the directional pads to select which
camera<00:01:12.689> you'd<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> go<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:15.080> there's<00:01:16.080> lots

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
camera you'd like to go to there's lots

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.130 
camera you'd like to go to there's lots
of<00:01:16.439> ways<00:01:16.619> obviously<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.850> could<00:01:18.140> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
of ways obviously that they could you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.749 
of ways obviously that they could you
know<00:01:19.170> change<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.830> for<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> consoles<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
know change it for on the consoles to

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.039 
know change it for on the consoles to
make<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> little<00:01:21.060> more<00:01:21.180> difficult<00:01:21.450> also

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
make it a little more difficult also

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.719 
make it a little more difficult also
think<00:01:22.350> about<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.770> fact<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.130> there's<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.520> lot

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
think about the fact that there's a lot

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.789 
think about the fact that there's a lot
of<00:01:23.820> people<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.150> exclusively<00:01:24.840> play<00:01:25.170> consoles

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
of people that exclusively play consoles

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.640 
of people that exclusively play consoles
just<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.460> also<00:01:26.670> there's<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> lot<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.060> younger

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
just and also there's a lot of younger

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.760 
just and also there's a lot of younger
kids<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.540> want<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.720> play<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> game<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.650> then

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
kids that want to play the game and then

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.440 
kids that want to play the game and then
they<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> go<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.460> know<00:01:32.700> download<00:01:33.119> steam

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
they have to go you know download steam

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.990 
they have to go you know download steam
on<00:01:33.750> their<00:01:33.869> dad's<00:01:34.500> laptop<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.490> then<00:01:35.700> play<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
on their dad's laptop and then play it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.370 
on their dad's laptop and then play it
on<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.659> like<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.990> know<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.140> think

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
on that so it's like you know I think

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.109 
on that so it's like you know I think
I'm<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.530> little<00:01:37.950> more<00:01:38.100> practical<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:38.939> least

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
I'm a little more practical to at least

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.179 
I'm a little more practical to at least
have<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.479> available<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:40.140> consoles<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.860> oh

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
have it available on consoles and oh
