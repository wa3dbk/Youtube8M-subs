black morel and it's in the more chela
Kanaka<00:00:16.680> complex<00:00:17.130> Konica<00:00:17.580> because<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.000> got<00:00:18.150> a

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
Kanaka complex Konica because it's got a

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.349 
Kanaka complex Konica because it's got a
sharp<00:00:18.630> point<00:00:18.900> here<00:00:19.109> I'm<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.460> bed<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:21.000> morels

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
sharp point here I'm in a bed of morels

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.990 
sharp point here I'm in a bed of morels
that<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:22.020> coming<00:00:22.289> up<00:00:22.410> from<00:00:22.760> mycelium<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.910> we

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
that are coming up from mycelium that we

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.359 
that are coming up from mycelium that we
planted<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.410> mycelium<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:25.949> planted

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
planted and the mycelium was planted

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.140 
planted and the mycelium was planted
into<00:00:26.599> this<00:00:27.599> gravel<00:00:28.349> cardboard<00:00:29.279> sawdust<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
into this gravel cardboard sawdust and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.110 
into this gravel cardboard sawdust and
gypsum<00:00:31.109> bed<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:32.040> now<00:00:32.250> we've<00:00:32.489> had<00:00:32.579> morels<00:00:32.910> come

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
gypsum bed and now we've had morels come

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.790 
gypsum bed and now we've had morels come
up<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> past<00:00:33.600> month<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.290> around<00:00:34.680> this

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
up for the past month all around this

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.600 
up for the past month all around this
bed<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:36.530> they've<00:00:37.530> been<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:38.219> for<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.579> long

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
bed and they've been going for a long

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.160 
bed and they've been going for a long
time<00:00:39.000> now<00:00:39.180> because<00:00:39.420> we're<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.719> forest<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
time now because we're in the forest a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.950 
time now because we're in the forest a
lot<00:00:40.290> more<00:00:40.440> shade<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:41.239> but<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.360> legitimate

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
lot more shade here but a legitimate

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.319 
lot more shade here but a legitimate
question<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:44.250> these<00:00:44.700> indeed<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> same

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
question is are these indeed the same

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.240 
question is are these indeed the same
morels<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.899> planted<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:47.129> know

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
morels that we planted and you know

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400 
morels that we planted and you know
that's<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.760> very<00:00:47.910> good<00:00:48.390> question<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.899> we

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
that's a very good question and we

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.549 
that's a very good question and we
sought<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:50.160> answer<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:51.239> question<00:00:51.600> by<00:00:52.079> taking

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
sought to answer that question by taking

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.040 
sought to answer that question by taking
a<00:00:52.649> culture<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.699> took<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.910> culture<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
a culture and we took a culture of the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.040 
a culture and we took a culture of the
morels<00:00:55.379> earlier<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:57.000> few<00:00:57.360> weeks<00:00:57.570> ago<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
morels earlier on a few weeks ago and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.889 
morels earlier on a few weeks ago and
from<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> base<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.489> stem<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.570> grew<00:01:00.780> it

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
from the base of the stem and we grew it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.290 
from the base of the stem and we grew it
out<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.379> petri<00:01:01.590> dish<00:01:01.820> along<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
out in a petri dish along with the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.250 
out in a petri dish along with the
original<00:01:03.870> culture<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> mycelium<00:01:06.020> was<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
original culture that the mycelium was I

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.170 
original culture that the mycelium was I
came<00:01:07.560> from<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:08.010> made<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> spawn<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.729> we

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
came from that made the spawn that we

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.530 
came from that made the spawn that we
put<00:01:09.420> into<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.869> bed<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.380> October<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
put into this bed in October and so the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.260 
put into this bed in October and so the
culture<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> new<00:01:14.070> mushroom<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
culture from the new mushroom with a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.789 
culture from the new mushroom with a
culture<00:01:15.689> from<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> my<00:01:16.140> Sicilian<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.650> put

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
culture from the my Sicilian that we put

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.170 
culture from the my Sicilian that we put
into<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> bed<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.549> grew<00:01:17.820> together

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
into the bed and they grew together

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.899 
into the bed and they grew together
seamlessly<00:01:18.920> now<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> very<00:01:20.430> important

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
seamlessly now this is very important

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.870 
seamlessly now this is very important
because<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> art<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.140> mycology<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:23.670> look

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
because in the art of mycology you look

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.460 
because in the art of mycology you look
at<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> bottom<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> petri<00:01:24.990> dish<00:01:25.200> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
at the bottom of the petri dish and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.940 
at the bottom of the petri dish and
there's<00:01:26.220> no<00:01:26.990> barrier<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.200> resistance<00:01:28.740> or

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
there's no barrier of resistance or

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.510 
there's no barrier of resistance or
antagonism<00:01:29.520> or<00:01:29.790> incompatibility<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.250> so

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
antagonism or incompatibility now and so

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.700 
antagonism or incompatibility now and so
this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.030> called<00:01:33.210> same<00:01:33.450> cell<00:01:33.750> fusion<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
this is called same cell fusion it's the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.580 
this is called same cell fusion it's the
same<00:01:34.979> organism<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:36.060> came<00:01:36.329> together<00:01:36.540> now<00:01:37.439> in

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
same organism it came together now in

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.969 
same organism it came together now in
contrast<00:01:38.119> here<00:01:39.119> are<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.689> another<00:01:40.590> Morel

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
contrast here are is another Morel

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.420 
contrast here are is another Morel
strain<00:01:41.750> from<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.810> laboratory<00:01:43.409> which<00:01:43.770> was<00:01:44.250> not

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
strain from the laboratory which was not

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.730 
strain from the laboratory which was not
compatible<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.930> line<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.560> demarcation

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
compatible and that line of demarcation

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.580 
compatible and that line of demarcation
you<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.610> there<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.450> line<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.869> inhibition<00:01:49.409> or

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
you see there is a line of inhibition or

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.649 
you see there is a line of inhibition or
antagonism<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.490> they're<00:01:51.030> both<00:01:51.329> producing

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
antagonism and they're both producing

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.480 
antagonism and they're both producing
enzymes<00:01:52.170> are<00:01:52.409> not<00:01:52.560> compatible<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.340> they're

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
enzymes are not compatible so they're

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.980 
enzymes are not compatible so they're
fighting<00:01:53.700> each<00:01:53.909> other<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.720> there's<00:01:54.899> an

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
fighting each other so there's an

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.950 
fighting each other so there's an
oxidative<00:01:55.380> stress<00:01:55.649> reaction<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.490> that

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
oxidative stress reaction and that

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.050 
oxidative stress reaction and that
coloration<00:01:57.960> shows<00:01:58.649> definitively<00:01:59.399> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
coloration shows definitively that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.910 
coloration shows definitively that
that's<00:02:00.509> other<00:02:00.869> strain<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.469> not<00:02:01.649> compatible

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
that's other strain is not compatible

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.160 
that's other strain is not compatible
with<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.670> not<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.939> same<00:02:03.119> strain<00:02:03.479> but

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
with this one is not the same strain but

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.499 
with this one is not the same strain but
in<00:02:04.290> contrast<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.759> fact<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.329> this

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
in contrast the fact that we have this

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.050 
in contrast the fact that we have this
one<00:02:06.780> growing<00:02:07.290> together<00:02:07.500> seamlessly<00:02:08.060> shows

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
one growing together seamlessly shows

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.550 
one growing together seamlessly shows
that<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> two<00:02:09.539> strains<00:02:09.869> are<00:02:10.020> indeed<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> same

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
that the two strains are indeed the same

that the two strains are indeed the same
which<00:02:11.129> means<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.489> Morel<00:02:11.849> came<00:02:12.270> from<00:02:12.390> the
