well<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.680> definitely<00:00:50.520> plan<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.969> i<00:00:51.180> guess<00:00:51.629> our

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
well we definitely plan to i guess our

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.010 
well we definitely plan to i guess our
goal<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.399> slow<00:00:53.399> growth<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.750> grow

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
goal is to slow growth and grow

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.479 
goal is to slow growth and grow
something<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.649> build<00:00:55.890> something<00:00:56.309> that's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
something and build something that's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.639 
something and build something that's
sustainable<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:57.660> had<00:00:57.840> been<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.230> easy<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
sustainable it had been really easy to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.779 
sustainable it had been really easy to
just<00:00:58.829> go<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.430> trade<00:01:00.390> guys<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.170> move

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
just go out here and trade guys and move

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.759 
just go out here and trade guys and move
core<00:01:02.789> pieces<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:03.510> other<00:01:03.629> pieces<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.199> that's

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
core pieces for other pieces but that's

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.980 
core pieces for other pieces but that's
not<00:01:04.890> our<00:01:05.129> goal<00:01:05.519> our<00:01:05.760> goal<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.299> develop<00:01:06.600> our

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
not our goal our goal is to develop our

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.530 
not our goal our goal is to develop our
guys<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.560> think<00:01:08.159> we've<00:01:08.400> steadily<00:01:08.880> done<00:01:09.330> that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
guys I think we've steadily done that

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.440 
guys I think we've steadily done that
over<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.869> last<00:01:10.020> few<00:01:10.290> years<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.119> it's<00:01:12.119> going

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
over the last few years and it's going

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.580 
over the last few years and it's going
in<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> right<00:01:12.780> direction<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.350> got<00:01:13.500> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
in the right direction we got to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.800 
in the right direction we got to
continue<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:15.060> know<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.420> got<00:01:15.659> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
continue to do that you know we got a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.510 
continue to do that you know we got a
little<00:01:15.990> ahead<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.229> ourselves<00:01:16.380> last<00:01:16.860> year<00:01:17.189> in

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
little ahead of ourselves last year in

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.350 
little ahead of ourselves last year in
making<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.270> playoffs<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:20.090> we<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.240> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
making the playoffs and so but we got to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.929 
making the playoffs and so but we got to
continue<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.930> growth<00:01:22.430> those<00:01:23.430> areas<00:01:23.909> where

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
continue that growth those areas where

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.200 
continue that growth those areas where
guys<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> lot<00:01:24.930> better<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.700> with

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
guys can get a lot better and so with

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.179 
guys can get a lot better and so with
that<00:01:27.420> done<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:28.080> think<00:01:28.170> we'll<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:28.890> where

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that done I think we'll be going where

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.460 
that done I think we'll be going where
we<00:01:29.340> need<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:30.000> coach<00:01:30.270> James<00:01:30.689> before<00:01:30.990> what

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
we need to be if coach James before what

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.469 
we need to be if coach James before what
do<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.799> about<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.159> man<00:01:32.579> what<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.299> want

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
do you like about a man what do you want

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
do you like about a man what do you want
to<00:01:33.570> work<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:33.990> his<00:01:34.259> toughness<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:35.040> think<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
to work on his toughness I think the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.219 
to work on his toughness I think the
wheel<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.119> his<00:01:36.299> toughness<00:01:36.540> we<00:01:36.840> need<00:01:37.079> his

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
wheel of his toughness we need his

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.210 
wheel of his toughness we need his
toughness<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:38.130> 69<00:01:38.759> bulk<00:01:39.270> frame<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:40.770> guard<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
toughness the 69 bulk frame to guard the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.240 
toughness the 69 bulk frame to guard the
Joe<00:01:41.430> Johnson's<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> guard<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.509> Carmelo's<00:01:43.250> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
Joe Johnson's the guard to Carmelo's the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.710 
Joe Johnson's the guard to Carmelo's the
number<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.700> thing<00:01:44.909> with<00:01:45.090> James<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.540> we've

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
number one thing with James and we've

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.260 
number one thing with James and we've
had<00:01:45.869> long<00:01:46.320> discussions<00:01:46.530> about<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.670> his

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
had long discussions about that is his
