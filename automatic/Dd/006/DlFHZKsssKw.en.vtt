 channel to check all the videos 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:37.370
 that I have for your benefit guys this 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.030
 it's a new video for minecraft and here 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.030
 let's start 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:01.309
 ok guys let's continue with what is 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:05.449
 you need our server we are going to create a 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.960
 server external permanent permanent 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:14.830
 physical that this process can do 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.830
 from your command and the ios system 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.200
 from your pc there is no problem what 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.869
 what are we going to do if we are in pc is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:32.159
 that we are going to open what the cmd is 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.820
 the ok prompt we go on 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.820
 to accept 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.220
 in the cmb they will put what is ipconfig 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.250
 this command as you see appears many 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.600
 things but what we are going to use is 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.320
 up to the top that is where it says 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.820
 gateway can finish this is 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.700
 which we are going to use to enter the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.270
 configuration of our router 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.619
 If you want to copy it, I do not know 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:16.580
 what is yours at the most favorable 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:19.810
 since they look for their router ip in 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.440
 internet me later 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.660
 I'll give you a page later 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.500
 that you can see soccer ok 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:33.010
 here he already asks me what is the name of 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.650
 username and password on my behalf 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.260
 user is admin 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.540
 and the password obviously I can not 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.730
 tell you 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.709
 If you are not going to come to my house and tied 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.359
 balear not no 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:52.450
 ok well I will explain what is my 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.300
 router password let's say start 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.560
 session 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.400
 As you can see I have entered what is 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.430
 Router configuration 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:11.100
 this is a swift go the theme of the group the 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:14.880
 have bow roof and adsl round ok for 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.310
 configure what services are like 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.910
 I for example have this option where 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.250
 says advance this top 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:28.790
 where I'm going to configure my server 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:32.480
 then in a fiction of nobody but 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.540
 although I got alain were nothing ok guys 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.930
 as you can see here I have a server already 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.720
 created then we can give it 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.840
 where it says 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.980
 obviously all the routers are going to be 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.680
 different ok now we're going here to 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.870
 this list where the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.120
 microcycle can select me 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.020
 I will select hosting 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.380
 lenin and I will put mcp as reference 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.780
 guys this part is not that important 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:13.340
 but good now we're going to what it is 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:18.120
 ip address there as you can notice and c1 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:22.320
 92.1 68.1 point 2 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.710
 that's the ip address of my 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.710
 phone 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:36.570
 but when I added what is for the 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:39.810
 server only seems to me 1 92.1 68.1 point 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.570
 I do not appear yet 2 I have it 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.470
 you go to add then we go 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:50.150
 where it says external 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:57.080
 be ok ok there you have to do it 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:05:00.290
 you guys ok they put and as always 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.140
 I've told you I do not know if it's from the 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:08.360
 said but for the heads of minecraft 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:11.810
 and it uses 11 91 32 then we give it in 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.760
 accept changes and ready and as I do not want 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.400
 believe it because alfaro for being good with 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:25.100
 this server I'm not going to wheel ok guys 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:29.030
 let's move on to 10 in ok guys 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.270
 let's continue in the main clear that 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.129
 we get into any world that 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.459
 you want 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:40.039
 so that your friends can enter as 

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:43.069
 I told them in the beginning that I was going 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:45.919
 to put the page so they could see the ip 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:48.080
 from your router that idea that I'm going to 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.689
 show later is the one that will 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.669
 give your friends you nothing more to 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:55.639
 enter any world like that if 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:59.209
 you were playing by yourself then you go 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:05.059
 to see that ip them swing it ok 

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:07.249
 you only prepare the world nothing more in 

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:10.309
 this moment I do not have anyone to play with 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:12.949
 and server therefore I will be alone to 

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:16.879
 rays to see to see what I am better than 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:19.519
 chuck norris to the divine good we 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.939
 let the 10 options mined here 

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:24.649
 where from the local server multiplayer 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:26.750
 this usually fine off but 

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:32.170
 you are going to light it 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.170
 ok guys and we 're going out 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.490
 we continue with what is 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.870
 in the google browser or any 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.700
 that they have let's go into this 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.700
 address that they leave in the 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:54.320

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:01.750

 of the video and here I put them here on it 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:08.040
 in own notes now that they achieve it 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.040
