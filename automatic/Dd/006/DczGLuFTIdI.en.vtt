 what would b warm up time so that you had 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.940
 the blessing is constantly the work of all 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.470
 rounds of power movsar so that it works 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.310
 so chi juice some of our teams 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.050
 worked them under this balance cleans 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.050
 balance and dust together mts too 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.700
 helps u to remove the balance they 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.239
 work together but if you want 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.489
 add bots to buy a team without 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.030

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.510

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.910
 restrictions on grenades played 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.360
 trajectory one that showed trajectories 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.910
 the grenade came off the impact that the bullets showed 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.120

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.579
 he has to work himself either to buy 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.579
 either prescribe these commands yourself 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:31.330
 Well, if you need to lead such 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:34.010
