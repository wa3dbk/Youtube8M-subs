00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.750
 the result is really very similar 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.480
 see in this ring on the tones of the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.580
 rose 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.780
 this is yet another type of 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.690
 button assembly to create the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.480
 upper part of the ring in this 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.970
 case I had a face neither very big e 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.670
 then decorated it with two more buttons 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.289
 small of different color that I have set 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.140
 passing the thread in two of the holes 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.870
 of the largest button 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.660
 this giving a third nuance tone 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.480
 at the base of the ring to tune it 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.500
 better with the buttons that used as 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.880
 decoration and then to exploit the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.450
 two more holes 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:57.430
 the big button I entered the 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.590
 swarovski crystals in a copper wire e 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.840
 I put them through these two points 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:08.080
 after which I fixed to the base that 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:13.410
 I had already done previously with the 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.410
 thread coming out of the two small buttons 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.530
 and this is the result obtained now 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.410
 we will go to see the realization of a 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.660
 pendant with buttons the frame of 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.940
 this fund is the same as I have 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.670
 used to make the necklace with i 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.700
 flowers succeeded only in that one 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.900
 necklace I set between them three of 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.650
 these elements in the shape of a circle 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.360
 now I'm using the technique of 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.570
 marbling that is used for 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.720
 decorate nails to make nail art 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.490
 and in this case I decided to 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.140
 use it to decorate buttons 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.140
 white in mother-of-pearl 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.759
 after pouring water into a 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:04.810
 plastic cup I went to 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.420
 superimpose different item of enamels in 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.320
 different colors 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:15.970
 and contrasting between them and after ho 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.670
 tried to get different effects of 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.060
 marbling that I saw the numerous 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.650
 online video 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.110
 I must say that I did several tests 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.990
 before getting the results you are 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.900
 seeing why not all the glazes that 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.810
 I had spread in the water in the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.270
 same way 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.170
 and then it took some time for 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.900
 understand how to do these lines with lo 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.790
 toothpicks over the glaze without 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.950
 pull it completely away from the water in 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.530
 In reality, the proceedings broke a lot 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.840
 simple just take a little 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.840
 hand and do some experiments 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.250
 I found this technique on gods 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.360
 buttons of different colors 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.349
 but what makes it the most absolute is 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.019
 objectively the color button 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.239
 clear 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.400
 this is because smarts are not 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.980
 completely covering with just one 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.870
 passed and then you always go to see 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.900
 the background color of the dark buttons for 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.629
 this other metal button instead I have 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.269
 used a green enamel on the whole 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.489
 button and after it has dried it is 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.970
 gone to remove part of the enamel 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.430
 with sandpaper together in 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.790
 this way highlighted more 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.760
 drawing that was in relief on the button 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.760
 in any case, I protected all the votes 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.040
 buttons with 12 pass polish 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.440
 transparent 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.819
 but now we come to the assembly for 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.549
 pendant to fix the different buttons 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.010
 at the base of the pendant I used the 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.250
 same technique I used for 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.250
 rings 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:17.480
 I then inserted rings on a wire 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.640
 of a thickness of 0 6 mm and then ho 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.600
 fixed this thread with 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.790
 windings has a round base that 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.350
 always comes from some earrings I have 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:33.650
 disassembled long ago with the end of 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.760
 thread coming out after testing 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:41.600
 the first button I went to fix 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.600
 the subsequent sequences of buttons for 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.000
 decorate these buttons or used 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:52.100
 at the top of the beads 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.870
 or swarovski the thread that has 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:00.730
 used has a thickness of 0 6 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:03.250
 m after inserting all the buttons 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.040
 main as top decoration of 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.730
 this pendant I went to fix the 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.160
 round metal foil on the back 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:15.070
 this the mine had only a hole 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.040
 in the upper part and therefore I am 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.230
 due to create another hole for 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.930
 fasten it at the bottom of the 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.110
 pendant I created the other hole 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.920
 using an awl to vote for 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.710
 pearls intimate and beating it superiorly 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.400
 with pliers but you can do the same 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.520
 more easily with a nail and a nail 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:44.889
 hammer or with a drill 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:48.849
 l fixing this the lead on the back 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:52.389
 I get a cleaner job and I am 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:55.330
 sure that none of the wires turning 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.970
 around the base of the pendant will go to 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.690
 scratch the person's neck 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.060
 will wear this tondolo however it can 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.400
 also make this type of pendant 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.750
 without using the foil base 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.069
 lower metal however you have to do 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.590
 pay special attention and return 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.430
 always the wire inside the 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.000
 processing 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.729
 just to prevent the creation of 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.620
 annoying spikes when 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:27.699
 you go to wear the jewel 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.520
 through the two holes I created 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:33.699
 on the lamina I always fixed with the 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:37.000
 06 thread the foil at the base of the 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:40.270
 pendant and then with a thread 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.759
 thinner or further corato le 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:46.419
 parts of the circle remained uncovered 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:48.870
 with crystals of different sizes 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:51.729
 of light blue color 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.930
 I hope this video can be there 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:55.810
 useful for 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.400
 Radiation that you enjoyed appearance 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.530
 to your comments 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.979
 and usually see you at the next video 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.979
 bye Bye
