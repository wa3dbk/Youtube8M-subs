00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.390
 of soccer the samba the caipirinha or the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.390
 carnivals 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.440
 but also this great country and bordering 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.020
 with virtually every country 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.570
 South American countries have a very 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.970
 singular mix of colonial styles 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.310

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.320
 great of the world as are sao paulo and 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.290
 Rio de Janeiro 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.930
 both old capitals of the country because 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.870
 curiously brasilia a city of 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 barely 35 years he snatched that position 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.580
 in the 60s 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.080
 the idea of building a new capital 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.860
 in the interior of the country it goes back to 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.710
 19th century but it is in 1960 when 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.540
 inaugurates brasilia thanks to the impulse 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.060
 given by the president juscelino 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.850
 kubitschek to promote colonization 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.220

 nation of a capital and seat of government 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.230
 totally new central and this 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.690
 way would end the dispute between 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.770

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.770
 janeiro and sao paulo 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.680
 the design of the capital was the work of 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.810
 pike coast who built it on a 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.880
 base in the form of an airplane that points to the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.219

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.890
 founded in March 1565 by stadiums of 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.410
 sap is famous for its characteristics 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.990
 geographic and urban, since being 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.820

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.760
 that sometimes the width of the city is 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.410

 It is characterized by its mansions 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.520

 Greater city of Brazil and the hemisphere 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.070
 south

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.850
 country politician 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.340
 his profile has been transformed from a 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.699
 industrial territory to a metropolis 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.979
 commercial services and technology a 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.520
 varying from highly populated regions 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:04.660

 horizontal and very low density 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.139
 through these streets we can find everything

 or the known and numerous favelas today 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.380
 the architectural differences are not 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.110
 only conditioned by history 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.150
 but currently the diversity of 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.639
 the buildings is also determined 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.449
 by the social class to which they belong 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.449
 its owner
