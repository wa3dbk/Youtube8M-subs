choose none if you don't want to use the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.810 
choose none if you don't want to use the
security<00:03:14.480> feature<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:16.070> lift<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.490> default

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
security feature and lift the default

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.360 
security feature and lift the default
port<00:03:17.030> 11<00:03:17.810> 111<00:03:19.209> 110<00:03:20.209> now<00:03:21.200> slow<00:03:21.440> down<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:22.040> you

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
port 11 111 110 now slow down and you

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.000 
port 11 111 110 now slow down and you
can<00:03:22.520> use<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.209> drop<00:03:23.420> box<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.840> choose<00:03:24.290> whether

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
can use this drop box to choose whether

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.560

you<00:03:25.190> want<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.490> delete<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:25.760> from<00:03:25.910> your<00:03:26.000> inbox<00:03:26.480> or

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
you want to delete it from your inbox or

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.030 
you want to delete it from your inbox or
not<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.709> if<00:03:27.860> you<00:03:27.980> choose<00:03:28.160> never<00:03:28.430> then<00:03:29.410> then<00:03:30.410> an

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
not so if you choose never then then an

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.970 
not so if you choose never then then an
email<00:03:31.190> will<00:03:31.490> be<00:03:31.610> never<00:03:31.850> deleted<00:03:32.390> from<00:03:32.540> your

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
email will be never deleted from your

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.750 
email will be never deleted from your
email<00:03:33.980> server<00:03:34.250> then<00:03:34.790> just<00:03:35.120> tap<00:03:35.450> on<00:03:35.480> next<00:03:39.760> okay

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
email server then just tap on next okay

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.330 
email server then just tap on next okay
so<00:03:40.910> this<00:03:41.300> is<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.570> outgoing<00:03:41.920> server<00:03:42.920> settings

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
so this is the outgoing server settings

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.590 
so this is the outgoing server settings
so<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:43.700> can<00:03:43.790> see<00:03:43.970> here's<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.209> outgoing

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
so you can see here's the outgoing

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.310 
so you can see here's the outgoing
server<00:03:44.810> settings<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:46.100> put<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:48.550> mail<00:03:50.110> top<00:03:51.110> rata

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
server settings so put in mail top rata

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.830 
server settings so put in mail top rata
changes<00:03:51.740> and<00:03:51.920> continue<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:52.640> so<00:03:53.180> instead<00:03:53.630> of<00:03:53.690> I

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
changes and continue so so instead of I

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.540 
changes and continue so so instead of I
teach<00:03:54.020> angles<00:03:54.350> don't<00:03:54.440> come<00:03:54.650> here<00:03:54.770> you<00:03:54.950> you

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
teach angles don't come here you you

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.480 
teach angles don't come here you you
will<00:03:55.700> put<00:03:55.880> in<00:03:55.970> your<00:03:56.390> domain<00:03:56.840> address<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:58.100> then

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
will put in your domain address and then

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.300 
will put in your domain address and then
again<00:03:58.760> security<00:03:59.330> tab<00:03:59.510> is<00:03:59.690> none<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.140> for<00:04:01.070> port

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
again security tab is none and for port

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.400 
again security tab is none and for port
number<00:04:01.640> we<00:04:02.300> go<00:04:02.480> back<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:03.020> the<00:04:03.140> other<00:04:03.230> screen

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
number we go back to the other screen

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.830 
number we go back to the other screen
and<00:04:03.709> see<00:04:03.830> what's<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.100> port<00:04:04.310> number<00:04:04.600> so<00:04:05.600> here

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
and see what's the port number so here

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.500 
and see what's the port number so here
you<00:04:05.900> can<00:04:05.989> see<00:04:06.140> out<00:04:06.320> going<00:04:06.920> mail<00:04:07.040> server<00:04:07.489> is<00:04:07.640> 26

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
you can see out going mail server is 26

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.530 
you can see out going mail server is 26
so<00:04:08.720> we<00:04:09.590> go<00:04:09.739> back<00:04:09.770> in<00:04:10.160> here<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.610> we<00:04:10.940> will<00:04:11.150> put<00:04:11.420> in

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
so we go back in here and we will put in

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.400 
so we go back in here and we will put in
port<00:04:11.930> 26<00:04:12.489> instead<00:04:13.489> of<00:04:13.930> 587<00:04:14.930> so<00:04:15.590> part<00:04:15.860> 26<00:04:16.160> and

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
port 26 instead of 587 so part 26 and

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.659 
port 26 instead of 587 so part 26 and
make<00:04:18.410> sure<00:04:18.560> you<00:04:18.680> say<00:04:18.830> require<00:04:19.250> sign<00:04:19.489> is
