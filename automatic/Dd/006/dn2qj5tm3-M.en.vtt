00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.160 

let's<00:00:05.880> look<00:00:06.000> at<00:00:06.149> the<00:00:06.240> second<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.019> third

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
let's look at the second of the third

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.850 
let's look at the second of the third
walk<00:00:07.410> sorry<00:00:07.680> on<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.209> short<00:00:09.209> list<00:00:09.270> today

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
walk sorry on the short list today

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:19.830 
walk sorry on the short list today
that's<00:00:10.860> Bernard<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:12.269> 350

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.890 

so<00:00:20.530> it<00:00:20.710> looks<00:00:21.040> like<00:00:21.760> it<00:00:22.120> can<00:00:22.360> cope<00:00:22.660> with

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
so it looks like it can cope with

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
so it looks like it can cope with
varying<00:00:23.890> ground<00:00:24.850> conditions<00:00:25.480> and<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.740> also

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
varying ground conditions and it also

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:38.490 
varying ground conditions and it also
looks<00:00:31.559> yeah<00:00:32.559> might<00:00:33.309> be<00:00:33.340> a<00:00:33.489> question<00:00:33.610> mark<00:00:37.500> by

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
looks yeah might be a question mark by

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.210 
looks yeah might be a question mark by
jumping<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.989> performance<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.710> let's<00:00:44.920> just

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
jumping of performance so let's just

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.970 
jumping of performance so let's just
have<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.400> closer<00:00:45.970> look<00:00:46.300> that's<00:00:47.110> interested<00:00:47.800> I

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
have a closer look that's interested I

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.299 
have a closer look that's interested I
have<00:00:48.910> a<00:00:48.970> Nashua<00:00:49.390> hunt<00:00:49.600> not<00:00:50.199> sure<00:00:50.440> that<00:00:50.470> when

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
have a Nashua hunt not sure that when

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.880 
have a Nashua hunt not sure that when
mushroom<00:00:51.760> when<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.090> Darby<00:00:52.710> you'd<00:00:53.710> be

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
mushroom when the Darby you'd be

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.700 
mushroom when the Darby you'd be
expecting<00:00:54.420> horses<00:00:55.420> to<00:00:55.540> be<00:00:55.660> running<00:00:55.930> over<00:00:56.290> and

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
expecting horses to be running over and

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.370 
expecting horses to be running over and
who<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.100> chomps<00:00:57.489> bread<00:00:57.730> from<00:00:58.170> Derby<00:00:59.170> winner

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
who the chomps bread from Derby winner

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.580 
who the chomps bread from Derby winner
yeah<00:01:02.380> it's<00:01:02.680> looking<00:01:02.860> I<00:01:03.280> pulled<00:01:03.610> up<00:01:04.590> four

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
yeah it's looking I pulled up four

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.760 
yeah it's looking I pulled up four
months<00:01:05.950> ago<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:07.360> they<00:01:07.509> had<00:01:07.660> been<00:01:08.500> off<00:01:08.619> the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
months ago but they had been off the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.420 
months ago but they had been off the
track<00:01:09.009> 45<00:01:09.280> minutes<00:01:09.729> prior<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.060> that<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.530> around

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
track 45 minutes prior to that so around

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.990 
track 45 minutes prior to that so around
this<00:01:12.610> time<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.119> year<00:01:14.430> previously<00:01:15.430> its<00:01:15.700> run

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
this time of the year previously its run

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.350 
this time of the year previously its run
some<00:01:16.720> fair<00:01:17.020> races<00:01:19.050> still<00:01:20.050> lightly<00:01:20.320> lightly

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
some fair races still lightly lightly

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.359 
some fair races still lightly lightly
tried<00:01:22.360> over<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.869> bigger<00:01:23.560> obstacles<00:01:24.190> with

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
tried over the bigger obstacles with

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.910 
tried over the bigger obstacles with
only<00:01:24.520> six<00:01:24.850> runs<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.590> there<00:01:26.740> might<00:01:26.860> be

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
only six runs so there might be

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.510 
only six runs so there might be
potential<00:01:27.399> and<00:01:27.670> see<00:01:27.850> if<00:01:27.910> there's<00:01:28.060> any<00:01:28.270> quotes

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.510 

jump<00:01:34.240> well<00:01:34.770> potentially<00:01:35.770> has<00:01:35.979> a<00:01:36.009> problem<00:01:36.369> with

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
jump well potentially has a problem with

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.800 
jump well potentially has a problem with
its<00:01:39.520> jumping<00:01:40.439> let's<00:01:41.439> see<00:01:41.770> that<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.420> novices

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
its jumping let's see that so novices

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.660 
its jumping let's see that so novices
handicap<00:01:43.990> chase<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.829> looks<00:01:48.159> as<00:01:48.340> if<00:01:48.369> it's

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
handicap chase so it looks as if it's

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.200 
handicap chase so it looks as if it's
got<00:01:48.909> potential<00:01:49.329> and<00:01:50.250> it's<00:01:51.250> significant<00:01:52.119> that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
got potential and it's significant that

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.529 
got potential and it's significant that
the<00:01:52.539> horse<00:01:52.719> is<00:01:53.819> considerably<00:01:54.819> lowering<00:01:55.270> price

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
the horse is considerably lowering price

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.080 
the horse is considerably lowering price
and<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:57.189> would<00:01:57.310> appear<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.640> whole<00:01:57.880> southern

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
and it would appear the whole southern

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.230 
and it would appear the whole southern
let's<00:01:58.990> just<00:01:59.229> click<00:01:59.409> on<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.679> trainer<00:02:00.240> there's

as though further with suits looks as if

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.069 
as though further with suits looks as if
it<00:02:41.200> didn't<00:02:41.530> suit<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:42.160> quicker<00:02:43.060> ground<00:02:43.450> last

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
it didn't suit the quicker ground last

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.750 
it didn't suit the quicker ground last
time<00:02:44.380> aids<00:02:45.750> but<00:02:46.799> those<00:02:47.799> indications<00:02:48.310> there

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
time aids but those indications there

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.780

that<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.510> potential<00:02:50.200> also<00:02:51.160> kim<00:02:51.370> baileys

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
that this potential also kim baileys

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.990 
that this potential also kim baileys
quite<00:02:52.120> well<00:02:52.329> known<00:02:52.359> for<00:02:53.040> not<00:02:54.040> over<00:02:54.370> taxing<00:02:54.850> his

triplets two miles seven in fact nearly
three<00:03:23.560> miles<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:25.560> given<00:03:26.560> its<00:03:26.739> style<00:03:27.160> of

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
some three bets so far on most days i'd

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.469 
some three bets so far on most days i'd
be<00:03:41.500> lucky<00:03:41.620> if<00:03:41.889> i<00:03:41.949> came<00:03:42.190> up<00:03:42.340> with<00:03:42.489> one<00:03:42.729> that<00:03:43.359> i
