00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:12.240
 here heating greenhouses have done very much 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:18.800
 just look takes two barrels 200 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:23.640
 liter we have them one to another 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.400
 made welded taken here such 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.420
 long tube with a slope 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.940
 she goes but apparently she goes here 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.399
 approximately there 30 centimeters from the floor 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.649
 here is how we solved this question 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.550
 very all just see we are here 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.309
 open here put them like this 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.329
 lock 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:56.449
 cut again here you see the barrel we 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:01.230
 here was the side of the barrel but let's say we 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:05.339
 grinder cut at the valves here 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.740
 so hung up here 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:17.479
 such a lance left roughly speaking and here is my 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:23.540
 how mother how we do opens and 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:28.790
 here is such a hooked 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:32.360
 very simple without any and here on and already 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:37.829
 throw down without any breaks without anything 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:41.130
 here we just throw firewood they go bankrupt 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.350
 if we need me here at first she's so 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.119
 then we burn in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.170
 here 2 or here we put some supporter 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.259
 fur coats were 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:57.570
 and all the whole whole procedure and the whole 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:00.340
 wisdom heating in a greenhouse here's how 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.800
 how does it work 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:10.009
 screwed to these racks screwed 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:15.520
 steel wire this pipe with this 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:21.980
 sides we made putty with a liner outlet and 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:26.860
 it went on here butt and she went on 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.160
 access to the center to the center of the greenhouse here 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:36.700
 central greenhouse rack 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.700
 I showed it and now it comes out
