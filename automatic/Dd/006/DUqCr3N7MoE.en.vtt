 You have 72 new posts 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.733
 Hi Bob. Where are you. 

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.733
 Do not forget that we have a meeting in 10 minutes 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.333
 See you then. 

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:07.499
 So guys, let's get started. 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.866
 Let's start by discussing the new software platform that was introduced ... 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.566
 As you can see by key indicators 

00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:28.566
 we need to better interact with customers next time 

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:34.432
 Yes, it seems to me 13 font size a bit too much for tips 

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:38.799
 I think you need to return to the original size of 12 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.100
 So what are you thinking about, Bob? 

00:04:05.966 --> 00:04:09.966
 Aah, hmmm, that sounds good. 

00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:15.532
 Great job Bob. Think it over again tomorrow 

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:43.599
 Hi Bob. 

00:04:44.466 --> 00:04:47.132
 I would like to discuss the quality of your work. 

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:48.999
 Why don't you go to my office. 

00:04:57.866 --> 00:04:59.532
 Please have a seat. 

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:08.433
 You see, Bob. The company can not be better than its weakest link 

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:13.766
 I have to admit that .... 

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:20.199
 Do you even listen to what I'm saying? 

00:05:23.066 --> 00:05:24.632
 Shortly speaking 

00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:26.832
 Well 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.033
 You're fired 

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.899
 Freedom! 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.266
 You see, this whole idea of ​​work for some reason simply does not work.
