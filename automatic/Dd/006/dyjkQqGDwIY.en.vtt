00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
when you're injured it's not my first

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
time this is Ania did many times so I

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.080 
time this is Ania did many times so I
can't<00:04:55.220> that<00:04:55.370> I<00:04:55.490> get<00:04:55.670> used<00:04:56.000> but<00:04:56.350> it's<00:04:57.350> a<00:04:57.920> bit<00:04:58.700> a

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
can't that I get used but it's a bit a

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.590 
can't that I get used but it's a bit a
bad<00:04:59.480> bad<00:04:59.690> time<00:04:59.960> for<00:04:59.990> me<00:05:00.350> right<00:05:00.560> now<00:05:00.730> but<00:05:01.730> that's

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
bad bad time for me right now but that's

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.590 
bad bad time for me right now but that's
why<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:02.870> know<00:05:03.110> this<00:05:03.470> type<00:05:03.680> of<00:05:03.920> image<00:05:04.600> remember

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
why you know this type of image remember

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.100 
why you know this type of image remember
that

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
that

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.920 
that
football<00:05:07.040> is<00:05:07.220> not<00:05:07.510> everything<00:05:08.510> you've<00:05:08.750> got

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
football is not everything you've got

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.680 
football is not everything you've got
some<00:05:09.160> hard<00:05:10.160> things<00:05:10.430> in<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.670> world<00:05:10.880> so<00:05:11.180> my

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
some hard things in the world so my

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.680 
some hard things in the world so my
injury<00:05:11.960> is<00:05:12.140> nothing<00:05:12.470> compared<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:12.950> so

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
injury is nothing compared to that so

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.810 
injury is nothing compared to that so
hopefully<00:05:14.690> everything<00:05:15.080> will<00:05:15.740> be<00:05:15.950> settling

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
hopefully everything will be settling

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.670 
hopefully everything will be settling
quickly<00:05:17.420> and<00:05:17.630> we'll<00:05:18.020> come<00:05:18.200> back<00:05:18.230> on<00:05:18.440> a<00:05:18.470> pitch

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
quickly and we'll come back on a pitch

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.000 
quickly and we'll come back on a pitch
as<00:05:18.860> strong<00:05:19.100> as<00:05:19.310> I<00:05:19.520> can
