00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.500
 hello and welcome to lausanner 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.980
 ground forces with me the oliver haake 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.220
 i am the thorsten lucassen so looks 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.019
 that we have in the closed beta of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.550
 Wolf Hanna first rounds with the tank 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.589
 filmed and want to give you these impressions 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.999
 imagine now though no technical 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.070
 we were just a storm 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.079
 protected three i believe execution f 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.700
 or I'm glad you said that 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.530
 we would have the comments below that 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.530
 video again overflow with due is 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.820
 enough to have no idea and so on 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.200
 had an accident with a tree and there 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.060
 you can already see such a few small ones 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.040
 limitation from the closed beta in the 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.150
 we are currently playing 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.400
 it does not work all the same 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.020
 you might expect it 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.820
 Bushes can be overcome 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.500
 but even larger trees are already 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.600
 sometimes a strong obstacle 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.360
 I'll tell you that and even get you now 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.160
 still realistic that such a tree 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.570
 if you are so slow with this 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.610
 Storm gun arrives now also not 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.280
 can do whatever you want here 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.329
 Now it is noticeable similar to ward 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.840
 Let's start pretty much 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:16.110
 quite a bit the rust is crumbling 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.030
 is quite dreadful and intimate wants 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.370
 with the vehicle will come all the more 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.750
 that a bit pimping and back on 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.600
 bring the current status but 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.950
 to begin 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 one does with a patzer of purchased 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.520
 So which by the way are very charming, the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.200
 to shake up was also surprised how 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.180
 many upgrade options are tanks 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.800
 offers baleno socal without clear spots 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.600
 are you the engine but that's it too 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.159
 already significantly more and of course 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.000
 Also a bit taunus worth here 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.790
 improve 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.409
 I think that's sexy, I think 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.090
 also the engine hit we just 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.450
 have received flames as you can see 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.520
 beat out the device and it's over 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.869
 that's what ratzfatz often does 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.520
 by one with a hit and then 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.049
 It's over depending on where you open 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.400
 You can see this little help too 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.530
 now fall under the black 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.330
 Suddenly times as a small white xs 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.880
 is sometimes green or red green 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.369
 said what is called green opponent in 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.900
 Range and armor can be at the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.549
 to be beaten red 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.080
 accordingly the opponent was in 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.840
 reach can also be taken 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.030
 but not through and therefore also 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.750
 that's how it works 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.080
 ixs is also shifting in height 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.370
 because everything shot so the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.560
 Tank grenade takes a ballistic 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.930
 turn and the farther away the target 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.880
 the higher you have to aim for yet 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.040
 Further goal help the number 620 there 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.200
 above is the distance and we will 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.790
 see you later also at 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.890
 enemy tanks or at all 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.660
 Then the armor stronger 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.390
 a corresponding location is displayed 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.610
 in millimeters practically yes very much 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.870
 practically is not a real simulation 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.120
 Furthermore, there was the second world war 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.400
 Of course not there , it was appreciated 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.050
 as the commander of the tank protect 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.310
 the right shooter and I there one more 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.959
 have as together on the thumb 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.239
 Spotted what we saw there and there 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.160
 the average was taken yes there was 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.310
 there are still optical targets that help on that 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.050
 a kind of scissors telescope exist 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.260
 lay as far apart as possible 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.130
 both binoculars and if that then 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.800
 then converged and then has it 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.090
 screwed when the converged then 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.100
 you had the right distance 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.390
 found out portmonee but not after 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.920
 I can be seen just as when I was from 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.360
 the aviation meet a bit 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.080
 hurt and the crisis too 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.090
 points etc 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.640
 but of course he has everything now 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.930
 helped here we see now because that 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.780
 is the real joke and verve 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.180
 ana &amp; anda in wolfener braun forces das 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.040
 Combined battle from tanks 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.519
 aircraft and in the distant future 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.470
 then someday also ships who what 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.850
 Incidentally , I find it very sexy 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.160
 fighting area of ​​the tank is 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.600
 comparatively small in relation to 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.310
 take what you have the aircraft because 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.549
 if you look like that and the map is 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.579
 about as big as the competition 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.799
 world of tanks brings me about 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.690
 now on the square meter but that 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.010
 Aviation area is much larger that 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.180
 Panzer fighting area can be seen with the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.739
 vehicle but not left 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.329
 if you aviator however already because 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.220
 there are the strategic goals you can 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.600
 there can bomb and thus there is 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.459
 then enough space at times 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.690
 dodge 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.209
 This is also about the tactical 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.010
 Opportunities since it is in the early stages 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.840
 the beta is now one 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.970
 access to an attack tank and a 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.919
 Handful biplane in front of the 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.560
 Bombing seen the goal is one 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.380
 heavy tank the bombs have him like that 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.729
 not there it was over too late 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.180
 pulled up the bombs do not have to 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.530
 beat 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.880
 the shops probably as a hit 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.320
 draw as you have seen with the 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.600
 Machine guns can be against such a 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.820
 armored vehicle records highest later 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.350
 with 20 mm has cannons as millimeter 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.000
 then from behind in light tank now 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.400
 in reality already or from above 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.310
 through the tower hatch that is 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.760
 currently not so represented 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.169
 even with the b 410 150 millimeters 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.580
 cannon also skin by light 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.250
 Panzer not by that is a balance 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.660
 in the shoe I suspect that will too 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.400
 stay that way because are the tanks 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.480
 the food is still really eaten here 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.770
 briefly in the picture at kv 1 heavily armored 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.880
 have caught but from the side 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.260
 caught and the tank 4f of the htl vfc 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.340
 I think that's the one already has 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.980
 a decent big-caliber cannon 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.810
 75 centimeters but long long tube 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.160
 speak high estuary I no 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.630
 equal high impact 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.190
 that's how I see it, too 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.340
 already simulated the sq is actually 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.510
 here in this game I think so too 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.030
 in some areas I find that 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.889
 Panzer driving way already good 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.460
 implemented but a few things you have to 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.720
 of course still early beta she 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.340
 the whole thing now develops about it 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.060
 Of course, we will open you up in the future 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.060
 keep up to date
