red circuits being the advanced circuits
are<00:00:15.480> pretty<00:00:16.199> important<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> late-game

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
are pretty important for the late-game

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.099 
are pretty important for the late-game
stuff<00:00:17.520> lots<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.240> things<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.510> use<00:00:18.750> them<00:00:18.960> and

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
stuff lots of things you use them and

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.040 
stuff lots of things you use them and
they're<00:00:19.590> quite<00:00:19.770> complicated<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.520> make<00:00:21.050> when

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
they're quite complicated to make when

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.480 
they're quite complicated to make when
you<00:00:22.140> get<00:00:22.289> used<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.680> though<00:00:22.830> they<00:00:23.189> become

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
you get used to it though they become

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.470 
you get used to it though they become
quite<00:00:23.730> easy<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.380> you<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.369> last<00:00:27.150> couple<00:00:27.330> of

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
quite easy so you in the last couple of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.089 
quite easy so you in the last couple of
episodes<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:28.050> talked<00:00:28.260> about<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:29.010> know

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
episodes we talked about you know

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.700 
episodes we talked about you know
automating<00:00:29.929> electronic<00:00:30.929> circuits<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:31.590> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
automating electronic circuits which you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.639 
automating electronic circuits which you
should<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.040> under<00:00:32.279> control<00:00:32.430> by<00:00:32.759> now<00:00:33.350> them<00:00:34.350> of

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
should have under control by now them of

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.440 
should have under control by now them of
course<00:00:35.160> taking<00:00:35.550> an<00:00:35.610> iron<00:00:35.730> plate<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
course taking an iron plate in just a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.720 
course taking an iron plate in just a
copper<00:00:36.630> cable<00:00:36.989> now<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.010> my<00:00:38.219> crappy

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
copper cable now this is my crappy

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.220 
copper cable now this is my crappy
factory<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.180> I've<00:00:39.270> got<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:39.930> it's

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
factory that I've got going it's it's

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.740 
factory that I've got going it's it's
not<00:00:40.829> very<00:00:41.280> good<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:41.820> it'll<00:00:42.480> do<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> trick<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
not very good but it'll do the trick and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.630 
not very good but it'll do the trick and
while<00:00:45.750> we're<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.140> learning<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.399> just

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
while we're just learning I can just

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.630 
while we're just learning I can just
demonstrate<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.829> way<00:00:49.829> things<00:00:50.160> should<00:00:50.430> work

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
demonstrate the way things should work

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.119 
demonstrate the way things should work
and<00:00:50.879> then<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:52.020> take<00:00:52.410> them<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.680> improve

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and then you can take them and improve

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.189 
and then you can take them and improve
upon<00:00:53.280> them<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.730> make<00:00:53.879> good<00:00:54.480> designs<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.079> your

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
upon them and make good designs of your

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.279 
upon them and make good designs of your
own<00:00:55.760> now<00:00:56.760> before<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.449> go<00:00:57.570> too<00:00:57.629> far<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.140> gonna

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
own now before we go too far I'm gonna

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.650 
own now before we go too far I'm gonna
need<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> few<00:00:58.890> more<00:00:59.190> transport<00:00:59.730> belts<00:00:59.879> which<00:01:00.480> we

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
need a few more transport belts which we

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.160 
need a few more transport belts which we
have<00:01:00.750> over<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:02.420> conveniently<00:01:03.420> boxed<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.840> for

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
have over here conveniently boxed up for

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.060 
have over here conveniently boxed up for
our<00:01:06.740> player<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.860> pick<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:08.450> now<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:10.409> make<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.799> red

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
our player to pick up now to make a red

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.710 
our player to pick up now to make a red
circuit<00:01:11.549> what<00:01:11.939> we're<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> need<00:01:12.420> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
circuit what we're going to need is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.230 
circuit what we're going to need is
plastic<00:01:13.530> bars<00:01:13.770> electronic<00:01:14.670> circuits<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
plastic bars electronic circuits and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.410 
plastic bars electronic circuits and
copper<00:01:15.900> cable<00:01:16.310> now<00:01:17.310> we're<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:17.970> making<00:01:18.240> copper

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
copper cable now we're not making copper

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.899 
copper cable now we're not making copper
cable<00:01:18.840> anywhere<00:01:19.229> yet<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:20.040> let's<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.460> here

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
cable anywhere yet so let's do that here

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.899 
cable anywhere yet so let's do that here
so<00:01:21.119> what<00:01:22.049> we'll<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.530> well<00:01:22.740> place<00:01:23.040> down<00:01:23.310> just

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
so what we'll do is well place down just

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.450 
so what we'll do is well place down just
an<00:01:24.210> assembly<00:01:24.509> machine<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.680> we'll<00:01:25.860> ask<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
an assembly machine and we'll ask it to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.390 
an assembly machine and we'll ask it to
create<00:01:26.850> copper<00:01:27.060> cable<00:01:27.509> we'll<00:01:28.290> put<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.009> fast

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
create copper cable we'll put in a fast

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.050 
create copper cable we'll put in a fast
input<00:01:30.140> copper<00:01:31.140> cable<00:01:31.530> machines<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.759> use

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
input copper cable machines really use

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.410 
input copper cable machines really use
the<00:01:33.270> resources<00:01:33.750> very<00:01:34.380> very<00:01:34.590> fast<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.329> it<00:01:36.329> will

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the resources very very fast and it will

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.840 
the resources very very fast and it will
start<00:01:36.600> doing<00:01:36.900> its<00:01:37.049> thing<00:01:37.200> now<00:01:37.460> right<00:01:38.460> next<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
start doing its thing now right next to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.080 
start doing its thing now right next to
it<00:01:38.880> we're<00:01:39.479> gonna<00:01:39.570> make<00:01:39.840> our<00:01:40.229> red<00:01:41.159> factory<00:01:41.610> our

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
it we're gonna make our red factory our

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.749 
it we're gonna make our red factory our
red<00:01:42.299> circuit<00:01:42.630> factory<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:44.009> what<00:01:44.159> we'll<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.490> is

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
red circuit factory now what we'll do is

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.850 
red circuit factory now what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:46.909> couple<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.119> inserters<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.770> it's

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
we'll have a couple of inserters so it's

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.539 
we'll have a couple of inserters so it's
going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> take<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.640> coil<00:01:51.240> from<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
going to take the coil from the

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.870 
going to take the coil from the
assembler<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.790> place<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.420> straight<00:01:54.689> into<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
assembler and place it straight into the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.660 
assembler and place it straight into the
red<00:01:56.880> circuit<00:01:57.299> assembler<00:01:58.310> we're<00:01:59.310> gonna<00:01:59.430> place

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
red circuit assembler we're gonna place

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.240 
red circuit assembler we're gonna place
some<00:02:00.000> other<00:02:00.960> things<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.009> like

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
some other things like this and like

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.700 
some other things like this and like
this<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:03.540> we're<00:02:03.689> gonna<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.409> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
this and then we're gonna have just a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.700 
this and then we're gonna have just a
normal<00:02:04.920> output<00:02:05.840> now<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.020> looks<00:02:07.200> calm<00:02:07.439> very

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
normal output now this looks calm very

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.710 
normal output now this looks calm very
complicated<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.580> trust<00:02:08.819> me<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.179> not<00:02:09.420> as<00:02:09.539> bad

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
complicated but trust me it's not as bad

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.250 
complicated but trust me it's not as bad
as<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.110> seems

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
as it seems

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.110 
as it seems
you<00:02:11.950> just<00:02:12.159> need<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.489> focus<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.150> get<00:02:13.480> each<00:02:15.120> each

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
you just need to focus and get each each

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.309 
you just need to focus and get each each
area<00:02:18.000> or<00:02:19.000> each<00:02:19.209> part<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.689> build<00:02:19.959> under

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
area or each part of the build under

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.530 
area or each part of the build under
control<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.400> can<00:02:21.489> see<00:02:21.790> here<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.299> I've<00:02:22.480> got

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
control so I can see here that I've got

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.420 
control so I can see here that I've got
electronic<00:02:23.200> circuits<00:02:23.590> right<00:02:23.860> I'll<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:24.099> take

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
electronic circuits right I'll just take

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.039 
electronic circuits right I'll just take
them<00:02:24.579> from<00:02:24.760> here<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.269> put<00:02:25.450> them<00:02:25.569> here<00:02:25.750> so

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
them from here and put them here so

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.430 
them from here and put them here so
that's<00:02:26.230> done<00:02:26.470> tick<00:02:26.890> I've<00:02:27.280> got<00:02:28.209> my<00:02:28.440> copper

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
that's done tick I've got my copper

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.140 
that's done tick I've got my copper
cables<00:02:29.829> being<00:02:30.010> built<00:02:30.310> right<00:02:30.579> here<00:02:30.909> and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
cables being built right here and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.759 
cables being built right here and
they're<00:02:31.629> going<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.840> direct<00:02:32.140> insert<00:02:32.440> into<00:02:32.650> the

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
they're going to direct insert into the

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.860 
they're going to direct insert into the
factory<00:02:33.129> so<00:02:33.340> we<00:02:33.400> can<00:02:33.549> give<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.849> a<00:02:33.879> ticket<00:02:34.299> the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
factory so we can give that a ticket the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.780 
factory so we can give that a ticket the
last<00:02:35.110> thing<00:02:35.319> we're<00:02:35.440> going<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.620> need<00:02:35.829> is<00:02:36.069> the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
last thing we're going to need is the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.630 
last thing we're going to need is the
plastic<00:02:37.150> bars<00:02:37.569> now<00:02:38.560> they're<00:02:38.709> over<00:02:38.859> here<00:02:39.010> so

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
plastic bars now they're over here so

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.599 
plastic bars now they're over here so
let's<00:02:39.819> run<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.180> get<00:02:40.329> them<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:42.220> we'll<00:02:42.489> just

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
let's run and get them and we'll just

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.780 
let's run and get them and we'll just
plumb<00:02:42.849> these<00:02:43.060> into<00:02:43.329> the<00:02:43.420> factory<00:02:44.549> I'll<00:02:45.549> get

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
plumb these into the factory I'll get

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.930 
plumb these into the factory I'll get
them<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.150> come<00:02:46.329> down<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:50.790> just<00:02:51.790> like

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
them to come down like this just like

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.930 
them to come down like this just like
that

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
that

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.730 
that
now<00:02:54.570> we'll<00:02:54.720> get<00:02:54.840> everything<00:02:55.080> working<00:02:55.440> with<00:02:55.710> a

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
now we'll get everything working with a

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.630 
now we'll get everything working with a
bit<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:55.920> power<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.960> that's<00:02:57.980> read<00:02:58.980> circuits

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
bit of power and that's read circuits

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.640 
bit of power and that's read circuits
