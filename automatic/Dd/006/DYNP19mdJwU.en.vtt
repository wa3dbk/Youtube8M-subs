00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.530
 hello to all the wood in the garden is 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
 ideal but with time and tarnishes 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.520
 then there is a solution used to 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.049
 the origin to treat sleepers from 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.969
 railroad and pole it's 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.389
 the autoclave how is this 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.520
 treatment 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.140
 what are its response limits in the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.140
 French pioneer of autoclave wood 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.320
 autoclave wood has been treated 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.180
 which protects him from the aggressions of the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.790
 insects or mushrooms for example 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.100
 its life span of about 20 years as 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.400
 this fence part buried in the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:48.239
 ground 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:49.920
 look at the wood has not been altered there 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.140
 There are several levels of performance 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.720
 autoclave class iii for woods 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.430
 weathered but shelter and 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.379
 class 4 for outdoor woods 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.379
 and in contact with the ground 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.830
 an autoclave candy does not require any 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.840
 maintenance because it is rot-proof 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.300
 but with time the color of 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.840
 treatment can disappear and the wood 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.370
 little gray then there is saturator 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.840
 help razors that allow the woods 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.840
 to maintain its original color 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.600
 hello jeans so how do you recognize 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.460
 a quality autocad wood then everything 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.960
 First you must check the direction it 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.670
 must be bread 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.410
 and especially with a proportion 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.930
 important daubie knows who is cadre of 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.400
 most of the French woods by 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.440
 compared to northern wood so the trial 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.550
 if you have to dry the wood well 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.040
 remove all the water that is contained in 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.270
 wood in order to replace it with a 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.340
 product treatment that will guarantee 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.780
 the efficiency of the material then precisely 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.830
 in gardening there are differences in 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.180
 sizable price 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.619
 is it precisely a manufacturer a 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.990
 distributor is not tempted to 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.440
 outclass its autoclave wood for better 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.420
 sell it 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.400
 yes there are manufacturers who are tempted 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.080
 to use species outside the 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.430
 bread like spruce or while they do not 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.860
 do not respect the process of 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.399
 treatment or who do not use them 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.380
 good products 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.480
 then is the autoclave process 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.860
 is ecological yes completely the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.330
 autoclave treatment fits in 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.280
 our sustainable development approach 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.750
 it allows the use of French wood 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.040
 for outdoor use only 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.190
 only exotic woods allowed 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.190
 before 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.440
 so here we are in the cabin of 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.150
 piloting the bread arrives in the series 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.180
 Corsican is recovered for the 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.610
 potting or mulching 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.860
 very high performance machines if the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.319
 log the wood is then dried 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.319
 planed then direction the autoclave 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.910
 so that's the autoclaves are in 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.650
 makes big tubes under pressure that 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.840
 allow the best penetration of 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.910
 produced in the wood first of all one 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.010
 creates a vacuum in the autoclave so 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.750
 to extract the water from the wood and 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.180
 fill with preservatives 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.370
 then we put the pressure in this 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.900
 auto club to speed up and 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.180
 to optimize product penetration 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.170
 in the wood is now the wood is 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.060
 treated to the heart of the autoclave wood 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.110
 in our garden is this a risk for 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.390
 the plants around 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.190
 well no, absolutely no since the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.610
 principal constituent used and 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.170
 copper 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.210
 as in the Bordeaux mixture by 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.750
 example and its action is reinforced by 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.520
 biodegradable molecules 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.020
 with a million cubic meters of wood 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.760
 autoclave sold each year 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.800
 France the wood remains a value 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.200
 safe and durable in the garden with 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.300
 the autoclave your amenities are well 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.600
 protected and still have beautiful days of 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.490
 sale 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.490
 so now to you set the scene
