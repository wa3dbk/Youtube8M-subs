00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
not as good as the one that came with

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.580 
not as good as the one that came with
the<00:01:53.030> Samsung<00:01:53.270> Focus<00:01:53.689> if<00:01:53.990> I<00:01:54.049> just<00:01:54.259> had<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.469> do<00:01:54.560> a

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
the Samsung Focus if I just had to do a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.490 
the Samsung Focus if I just had to do a
little<00:01:54.829> comparison<00:01:55.270> but<00:01:56.270> they<00:01:56.990> look<00:01:57.170> okay

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
little comparison but they look okay

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.440 
little comparison but they look okay
these<00:01:58.250> are<00:01:58.369> probably<00:01:58.670> going<00:01:58.819> to<00:01:58.909> be<00:01:58.969> cheap<00:01:59.270> and

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
these are probably going to be cheap and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.940 
these are probably going to be cheap and
I<00:01:59.899> don't<00:02:00.079> think<00:02:00.229> people<00:02:00.380> are<00:02:00.590> really<00:02:00.619> going<00:02:00.890> to

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
I don't think people are really going to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.240 
I don't think people are really going to
use<00:02:01.130> these<00:02:01.310> but<00:02:02.090> that's<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:02.509> case<00:02:02.659> with<00:02:02.869> most

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
use these but that's the case with most

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.039 
use these but that's the case with most
headsets<00:02:04.250> that<00:02:04.369> come<00:02:04.610> included<00:02:04.759> with<00:02:05.060> mobile
