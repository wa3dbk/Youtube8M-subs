00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
mbm pass was updated and I think

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.300 
mbm pass was updated and I think
yesterday<00:00:21.119> up<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.900> version<00:00:22.080> 1<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.890> anyone

yesterday up to version 1 so anyone
follow<00:00:23.550> my<00:00:23.760> old<00:00:23.939> video<00:00:24.240> guide<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:25.170> getting<00:00:25.410> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
follow my old video guide for getting a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.620 
follow my old video guide for getting a
couple<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.859> errors<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:27.269> thought<00:00:27.420> I'd

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
couple of errors so I just thought I'd

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.230 
couple of errors so I just thought I'd
updated<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.260> reflect<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.769> changes<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.970> if<00:00:30.119> you

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
updated to reflect the changes so if you

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.759 
updated to reflect the changes so if you
check<00:00:30.480> out<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> home<00:00:31.080> pass<00:00:31.289> hope<00:00:31.560> I've

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
check out the home pass hope I've

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.160 
check out the home pass hope I've
updated<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.520> old<00:00:32.669> version<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:34.020> new

versions<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.800> old<00:00:34.950> version<00:00:35.340> runs<00:00:35.910> fine<00:00:36.180> with

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
versions the old version runs fine with

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.080 
versions the old version runs fine with
the<00:00:36.870> video<00:00:37.230> guides<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.649> previously<00:00:37.980> done<00:00:38.370> but

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the video guides I previously done but

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.160 
the video guides I previously done but
the<00:00:39.180> new<00:00:39.300> version<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:39.899> we'll<00:00:40.079> be

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the new version is the one we'll be

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.959 
the new version is the one we'll be
doing<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.559> today<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.700> I've<00:00:41.850> already

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
doing you today so I've already

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.630 
doing you today so I've already
downloaded<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.230> I've<00:00:43.980> already<00:00:44.160> extracted

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
downloaded it and I've already extracted

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.970 
downloaded it and I've already extracted
it<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> folder<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.110> opened<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.469> CMD

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
it into a folder here and opened up CMD

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.700 
it into a folder here and opened up CMD
with<00:00:47.309> admin<00:00:47.670> privileges<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:49.140> all<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.530> need<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
with admin privileges so all you need to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.880 
with admin privileges so all you need to
do<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.420> to<00:00:51.420> get<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.660> running<00:00:52.050> basically<00:00:52.680> what

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
do is to get it running basically what

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.400 
do is to get it running basically what
you<00:00:52.949> did<00:00:53.100> before<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.699> type<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.140> NBA<00:00:55.140> home

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you did before so you type in NBA home

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.439 
you did before so you type in NBA home
pass<00:00:55.910> dot<00:00:56.910> exe<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.840> base<00:00:58.800> 2<00:00:59.219> 5<00:00:59.460> 6<00:00:59.730> or<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.210> can

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
pass dot exe then base 2 5 6 or you can

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.150 
pass dot exe then base 2 5 6 or you can
use<00:01:00.690> base<00:01:00.930> 16<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.739> want<00:01:01.890> mac<00:01:02.039> addresses

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
use base 16 and you want mac addresses

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
use base 16 and you want mac addresses
you<00:01:02.520> wanna<00:01:02.670> use<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.660> where<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.930> differs

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you wanna use but where it differs

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.280 
you wanna use but where it differs
you've<00:01:04.439> got<00:01:04.559> type<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.040> txt<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.840> takes<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you've got type in txt as it takes the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.719 
you've got type in txt as it takes the
MAC<00:01:07.409> addresses<00:01:07.439> from<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> tips<00:01:08.369> why<00:01:08.549> you've

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
MAC addresses from the tips why you've

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.920 
MAC addresses from the tips why you've
got<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.270> can<00:01:09.330> actually<00:01:09.510> set<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:09.869> your

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
got this you can actually set up your

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.630 
got this you can actually set up your
own<00:01:10.049> MAC<00:01:10.409> addresses<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.490> want

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
own MAC addresses if you really want

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.789 
own MAC addresses if you really want
team<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.150> kind<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.360> cool<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.780> didn't<00:01:13.710> do

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
team just kind of cool you didn't do

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.350 
team just kind of cool you didn't do
space<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.729> option<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.060> shuffle

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
space now you have the option to shuffle

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.820 
space now you have the option to shuffle
and<00:01:15.600> lap<00:01:15.720> addresses<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.320> run<00:01:16.470> them<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.680> order

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and lap addresses or run them in order

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.820 
and lap addresses or run them in order
so<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.820> go<00:01:17.939> put<00:01:18.090> true<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.540> shuffle<00:01:18.780> them<00:01:19.110> then

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
so just go put true to shuffle them then

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.530 
so just go put true to shuffle them then
just<00:01:19.860> space<00:01:20.570> 300<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.229> how<00:01:22.380> long<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
just space 300 this is how long the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
just space 300 this is how long the
software<00:01:24.540> will<00:01:24.689> run<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.049> MAC<00:01:25.229> address<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.799> so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
software will run the MAC address for so

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.070 
software will run the MAC address for so
I'll<00:01:26.850> run<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.210> 300<00:01:27.600> seconds<00:01:27.900> before

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
I'll run it for 300 seconds before

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.160 
I'll run it for 300 seconds before
changing<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.740> MAC<00:01:28.890> address<00:01:29.270> then<00:01:30.270> 30<00:01:30.630> that's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
changing the MAC address then 30 that's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.960 
changing the MAC address then 30 that's
to<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> connection<00:01:32.250> delay<00:01:32.729> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
to do with the connection delay and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.060 
to do with the connection delay and
there's<00:01:33.960> probably<00:01:34.259> best<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.500> leave<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.009> on

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
there's probably best just leave it on

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.539 
there's probably best just leave it on
32<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.790> honest<00:01:36.000> then<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:36.930> press<00:01:37.110> ENTER<00:01:37.590> and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
32 be honest then just press ENTER and

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.260 
32 be honest then just press ENTER and
then<00:01:38.729> I'll<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.000> run<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.720> normally<00:01:39.869> does

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
then I'll just run as it normally does

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.850 
then I'll just run as it normally does
saying<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.420> got<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> shuffle<00:01:43.049> list<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.530> true
