00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.260 

crossbar<00:03:49.090> here<00:03:51.000> then<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.180> also<00:03:53.880> want<00:03:54.880> to<00:03:54.940> idle

crossbar here then you also want to idle

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.630 
crossbar here then you also want to idle
side<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.290> rail<00:03:56.530> here<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.220> side<00:03:57.460> of<00:03:57.490> the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
side of the rail here the side of the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.210 
side of the rail here the side of the
breaking<00:03:58.090> log<00:03:58.320> just<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.530> little<00:03:59.800> bit<00:04:00.160> there<00:04:02.220> all

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
breaking log just a little bit there all

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.370 
breaking log just a little bit there all
right<00:04:03.400> so<00:04:03.670> now<00:04:04.030> you're<00:04:04.330> whole<00:04:04.570> all<00:04:04.900> of<00:04:05.110> the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
right so now you're whole all of the

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.510 
right so now you're whole all of the
real<00:04:05.620> is<00:04:05.830> lubricated<00:04:06.160> here<00:04:07.110> so<00:04:08.130> thing<00:04:09.130> that

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
real is lubricated here so thing that

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.180 
real is lubricated here so thing that
you<00:04:09.580> want<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.790> do<00:04:09.940> now<00:04:10.240> is<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:11.800> want<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:11.980> take

you want to do now is you want to take

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.560 
you want to do now is you want to take
it<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.580> start<00:04:12.880> putting<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.240> back<00:04:13.390> together

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
it to start putting it back together

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.110 
it to start putting it back together
actually<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.350> best<00:04:14.500> way<00:04:14.740> to<00:04:14.800> do<00:04:15.040> that<00:04:15.120> let's

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
actually the best way to do that let's

into place make sure it's nice and tight
and<00:04:26.320> just<00:04:27.100> slide<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.730> back<00:04:27.850> in<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:29.650> just<00:04:29.710> slide

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
and just slide it back in and just slide

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.920 
and just slide it back in and just slide
your<00:04:30.130> root<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.580> your<00:04:30.700> side<00:04:31.180> plate<00:04:31.450> back<00:04:31.660> into

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
your root of your side plate back into

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.500

place<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:32.940> good<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.030> go<00:04:36.150> see<00:04:37.150> it's<00:04:37.270> pretty

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
place and good to go see it's pretty
