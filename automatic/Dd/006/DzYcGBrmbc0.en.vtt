yeah anyways all my dimples I had to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.430 
yeah anyways all my dimples I had to
take<00:00:47.520> them<00:00:47.670> out<00:00:47.760> because<00:00:47.969> they<00:00:48.450> were<00:00:48.510> pierced

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
incorrectly I guess and they just would

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.740 
incorrectly I guess and they just would
never<00:00:51.960> heal<00:00:52.260> properly<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.610> removed<00:00:54.420> them
