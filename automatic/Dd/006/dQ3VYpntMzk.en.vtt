to<00:00:27.210> see<00:00:27.619> how<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.650> works<00:00:28.920> with<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.880> a

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
to see how it works with the in a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.510 
to see how it works with the in a
motorized<00:00:30.449> engine<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.099> one<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.340> from

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
motorized engine so this one is from

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.290 
motorized engine so this one is from
Brio<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.860> model<00:00:35.399> number<00:00:35.610> three<00:00:35.820> three<00:00:36.000> five

on the standard wooden rails so this one

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.000 
on the standard wooden rails so this one
has<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:49.050> three

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010

has a three
I<00:00:50.070> mean<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.910> weigh<00:00:51.649> actions<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:52.829> go<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.430> you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
I mean to weigh actions I can go of you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.630 
I mean to weigh actions I can go of you
know<00:00:54.270> front<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.260> back<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> cast<00:00:56.399> three

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
know front and back so I cast three

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.279 
know front and back so I cast three
buttons<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.600> one<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:58.199> the

front this is to turn off turn off the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.770 
front this is to turn off turn off the
engine<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:01.949> goes<00:01:02.250> back<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.210> then

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
engine and this one goes back and then

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.320 
engine and this one goes back and then
that<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.199> yeah<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.489> actually<00:01:05.729> show<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
actual actual train but yeah it takes

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.950 
actual actual train but yeah it takes
two<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:10.229> play<00:01:10.409> batteries<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.400> pretty<00:01:11.670> um

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
two to play batteries it's pretty um

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.719 
two to play batteries it's pretty um
it's<00:01:12.960> not<00:01:13.110> super<00:01:13.560> fast<00:01:13.979> or<00:01:14.159> anything<00:01:14.369> it's

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
it's pretty slow but it looks good so

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.660 
it's pretty slow but it looks good so
let's<00:01:18.210> go<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.720> unbox<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.470> then<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:20.580> can

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
let's go and unbox it and then we can

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.940 
let's go and unbox it and then we can
take<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> look

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
crib so the bad the battery is hard here

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.260

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
batteries so I like how they left this

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.140 
batteries so I like how they left this
like<00:02:13.890> kind<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:15.030> know<00:02:15.060> free<00:02:16.820> hanging<00:02:17.820> so
