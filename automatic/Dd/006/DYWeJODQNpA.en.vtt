00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
can't do that but then that would have

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.730 
can't do that but then that would have
been<00:01:05.390> my<00:01:05.510> reaction<00:01:05.990> but<00:01:06.110> then<00:01:06.260> I<00:01:06.290> think<00:01:06.500> after

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
been my reaction but then I think after

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.410 
been my reaction but then I think after
Chris<00:01:07.250> was<00:01:07.460> like<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.700> think<00:01:07.760> it's<00:01:08.000> very<00:01:08.210> unique

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
Chris was like I think it's very unique

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.660 
Chris was like I think it's very unique
gave<00:01:08.810> us<00:01:08.960> he<00:01:09.530> was<00:01:09.619> like<00:01:09.740> sportsmanship<00:01:10.310> and

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
gave us he was like sportsmanship and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.920 
gave us he was like sportsmanship and
that's<00:01:10.790> really<00:01:10.940> important<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.540> I<00:01:11.720> think

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
that's really important and I think

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.420 
that's really important and I think
everyone<00:01:12.229> kind<00:01:12.350> of<00:01:12.500> saw<00:01:12.650> that<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.100> I<00:01:13.190> think

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
everyone kind of saw that and I think

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.219 
everyone kind of saw that and I think
that's<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:13.790> cool<00:01:13.820> like<00:01:14.210> such<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.420> turnaround

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
that's so cool like such a turnaround

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.620 
that's so cool like such a turnaround
especially<00:01:16.100> for<00:01:16.220> Emily<00:01:16.550> who<00:01:16.729> like<00:01:16.940> we've<00:01:17.420> seen
