 extension of tabs and do not believe that 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.260
 it's about false eyelashes but going 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.539
 placing one by one so that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.890
 They look natural and long-lasting that 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.840
 It seems that they are ours as 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.550
 Outside hair but put the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.430

 al and thank you thank you girls today is a 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.129
 process I did not think it was the intention 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.230
 of people who thought I do not know I do not 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.180
 I imagine how good it is to see the day 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.030
 it is told that the point we owe in the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.800
 flat lengthen the tab and it 's account 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.820
 that you put them like that in the part of in 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.820
 medium 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.399
 I wish I could sugar an eye that already 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.570
 I have done do the times and one already has 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.660
 this one already has and this one does not have the ones 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.000
 canvas because I do not know you can not see 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.860
 exactly this is the secret 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.830
 always or compete because you leave them 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.500
 a month and a half they last you little 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.170
 little try not to put on mask 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.670
 tabs because you do not need it and what 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.950
 happens is that for example today is 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.520
 staff towards the time they put the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.150
 extension on the tab as they are curves 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.690
 laughter or I do not need to curl 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.070
 the nor anything then is very easy 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.140
 then it will stay put 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.990
 wake up as if you were makeup 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.440
 divine and it's the food again 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.869
 then nothing else is to take your 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.380
 tell the tab sometimes that tab 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.910
 by dexterity of a pelito that apply the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.930
 glue that is the and lunada and then 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.300
 you apply it for example with tweezers or 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.049
 it opens the space so that it does not 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.210
 cross 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.579
 on the skin if it's a procedure it 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.909
 paste on the mouth tab on the other 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.860
 eyelash do not mistreat you eye there are other 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.470
 and tabs that are in a 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.050
 many years that come by group the 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.180
 glue is very aggressive and will come 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.269
 against your lashes and with all this 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.780
 technique is different and the truth is that 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.580
 they look very natural and when you 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.549
 fall that little eyelash will not fall yours 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.280
 also not for nothing at all or be 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.830
 it really is very light the glue 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.760
 but also tough because it resists 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.489
 to water like that exactly and it looks very 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.700
 natural about all that is the point no 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.799
 it is natural I hope to have itself 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.079
 how to focus and the base stopping I go 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.390
 balance of teaching is the clearing of 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.060
 eyelashes that I have to all of 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.780
 sizes not if the control room that the 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.849
 of the tail more more this blindly 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.540
 there they look and the last thing is how 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.700
 encapsulate 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.760
 with longer tails these are the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.030
 more short cuts that's how you put bills 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.810
 per eye 50 approximately as there is my 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.150
 account so then you apply this is the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.450
 encapsulated which is like the last thing that 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.439
 apply true good would see my model and 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.400
 you can curl them with a router 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:29.340
 like this one that is like hot and it's like 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.379
 a pincer for the eyelashes what a barbarian 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.590
 and then you can lift them a little 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.590
 plus 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:47.680
 and not anymore because it's not so it's not 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:51.510
 it really warms up little by little and 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.510
 has as well as several 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.470
 to my model sorry 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:20.870
 and we open our eyes and I want 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:23.120
 Naturals does not look like they want to 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.160
 very nice and demands the very beautiful the 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.440
 model but please see one eye and another 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.020
 so it's something else 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.150
 one seems to be makeup 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.370
 exactly if you see that having more 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.220
 effect tab like that three 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.740
 eyeliner and really well what 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.050
 The only thing it does is enhance the look that 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.840
 is then take I loved it good me 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.880
 I changed if you suddenly notice too 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.700
 the ironed eyebrow that we're going to talk about in 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.460
 the next eyebrow ironing and you can 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.030
 put paint even on those if you have 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.540
 the very very clear tab leaves ideas and 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.540
 already these lists 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.430
 if the dialogue to see and also talk about 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.970
 that the strip 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.640
 and also the room guesses menezes 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.190
 beautiful two flight and I do not come 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.410
 confident knowing that we could lose 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.820
 dared the combo we can leave not of 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.090
 be spending so much time in the 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:23.260
 arranged the crying so money that I 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.260
 I'm still good
