00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.900
 when 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.580
 hello how welcome are you but friend 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.750
 puntocom i am ricardo cayuela today 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.330
 we're going to be talking about how 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.250
 synchronize an audio when we record a 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.710
 music video we know that when 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.390
 we recorded a music video on the set 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.860
 We have a reference audio so that 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.140
 the singer can do his 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.180
 interpretation the best possible but that 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.860
 audio that we have on the set is not the 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.110
 final audio that we will be using 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.779
 the final audio will provide a 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.820
 sound engineer and the quality that 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.800
 has that audio is very good so that 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.000
 is the audio that we would use in this 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.590
 case let's synchronize two cameras in 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.929
 set with that audio that the engineer 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.140
 of sound will provide us if I give double 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:49.719
 click we see that I have double click camera 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.719
 camera sees and this is the audio 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.699
 on-line 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.809
 but in the studio audio that I want 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.809
 that they notice that so much camera 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.970
 I'll camera you like camera once 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.140
 Both video files have as 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.120
 reference the audio channel 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.590
 if you have the audio channel recorded in 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.760
 the video much better and much easier 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.860
 synchronization 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.300
 so let's start I'm going to 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.190
 select all the wrapped files 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.200
 here I have only two cameras but if 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.270
 you had four five six seven or eight 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.400
 cameras could also do it so 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.710
 select all cameras 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.780
 together, select the audio that 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.240
 you want to end the audio that you 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.730
 provided the recording studio to a king 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.550
 click create multi camera shorts and cons 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.620
 and this will create a new sequence 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.140
 where are you going to mix these three 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.710
 files and take care of the cost I want to create 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.710
 a meaningful name I'll call you 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.710
 interpretation 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.960
 process the synchronization 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.340
 I'm going to select the sign is point 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.430
 Audio 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.260
 then handy falling down sequence I'm going to 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.870
 look for the one that corresponds in this case 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.360
 it was recorded with no one is given we look for the 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.030
 which corresponds in format that you 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.580
 recorded to select this I'm not interested 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.340
 process the files a new bing if 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.550
 get all the stereo cameras and 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.770
 script game click and here then 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.930
 begins the process of joining both 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.480
 files so I created a new one 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.360
 sequence where it is combined so much 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.380
 these two cameras like audio audio 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.330
 that we are using for the video 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.900
 musical if I want to preview what re 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.670
 click 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.319
 or not 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.620
 in opening timeline 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.840
 and automatically if you notice I have 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.480
 the two cameras in conjunction with the audio 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.819
 from the studio and both the audio that 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.819
 has camera as camera sees the display 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.010
 I also have the audio to put myself 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.530
 I want to delete that audio so I'm going to 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.040
 select the camera is set with 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.440
 audio clicks a link selects the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.700
 I delete the camera I do the same with camera 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.220
 go 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.849
 a link selected camera audio see 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.849
 balloon 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.300
 you already have the three files 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.040
 synchronized here camera there is camera 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.670
 are synchronized to the studio audio 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.850
 in the genius of premier team fans 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.410
 that is the premier genius but that 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.850
 now what if I wanted to then 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.560
 use the multi view camera to 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.630
 then edit and be changing between 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.460
 camera camera the camera sees there is a 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.790
 easiest way they have to be 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.790
 here you sail selecting and deleting 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.080
 and they have to be doing that through 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.790
 of the sequence a lot more way 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.260
 easy 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.360
 the easiest time is to select the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.490
 sequence that they have created I make a rail 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.239
 click 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.049
 music or is franklin 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:09.040
 this new sequence can be called 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:12.989
 interpretation 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.989
 to the final you want to call 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.700
 I'm double click automatically you see 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.799
 that creates me a video channel where 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.160
 in this video channel is combined 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.920
 both camera and camera sees that it creates me 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.150
 33 audio files 3 audio channel yes 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.150
 I support what everything can see 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.000
 we 're going to see that I only have 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:41.229
 audio signal on the channel on channel 1 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.620
 from my channel 2 and channel 3 sequence 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.050
 I do not have a signal because I do not have a signal 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.350
 because how do you think the sequence is new 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.550
 based on this 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.630
 because in this we had deleted since the 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.920
 channel 3 that were the audios 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.930
 corresponding to the different cameras 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.510
 therefore that's why you do not see 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.460
 here sign with no interest to erase what 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.190
 is the case and then have those channels 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.890
 there will continue an annoying selected 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.220
 erase selected erase selected a 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.810
 both link in the have selected ok 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.250
 now what if you want to be 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.080
 switching between cameras between cameras 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.080
 how do you do you need then 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.360
 have the multi that view me 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.990
 As you activated it click here a button 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.250
 edited selection and multichannel view click and 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.440
 he dragged another and goes every town has 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.310
 active and do not see what is active what 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.150
 jockey jeou clip automatically you 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.770
 if displays 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.910
 you are seeing the two cameras now 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.290
 same as if you had 456 you 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.990
 then see that the screen is divided 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.880
 in 4 or in 5 in six depending on 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.220
 types of how many cameras do you have in 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.970
 the sequence and if I'm interested in being 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:55.230
 changing simply I give it play and it's 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.230
 as easy as creating 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.860
 and when I surf if you look 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.860
 I automatically made the cuts 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:11.139
 cut 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.790
 cut 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:17.380
 cut 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:19.660
 and blows so it's that easy to do 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.890
 multicamera view this you could 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.350
 use also if you have a 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.870
 production where they have two three four 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.790
 cameras simultaneously recording and 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.230
 you need to synchronize it candle and instead of 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.880
 to be 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.600
 making the cuts you manuel 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.470
 you simply synchronize them create 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.630
 a new sequence of that 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.400
 synchronization and it starts simply with 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.890
 the multi camera view up the changing 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.900
 of the / camera and it's much easier than 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.220
 they are doing it to manuel I hope that 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.290
