00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.980
 speaking staff there in two films that 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:19.539
 come back so brutal 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.359
 we are here today with a video about the 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.670
 mini game kraft ville they 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.750
 made 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.759
 if you want to download it it's cow on the site 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.860
 kraft leland that will have it all 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:37.600
 explaining her all explaining to a 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:41.949
 video if you want to download the mini game 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:47.949
 band avaya on their website and vector a 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:54.899
 company so I'm here to talk about 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:59.769
 What I found of the two mini games and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.469
 which gives more gives more conditions 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:08.080
 I think the purpose of the draft lÃ¢ndia 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:12.610
 It's what the game was about. 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:18.009
 who do not have enough money to 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:22.479
 buy a playstation 4 11 mobile phone 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:28.380
 g1 xbox mouse and keyboard by rizzo those 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:32.590
 who are there to buy it they can 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.149
 buy they can can play there and 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:41.680
 buy then the time you go 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:45.969
 playing collecting by giving money with 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:51.729
 This and you can buy a moto gp for 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:57.009
 100k a general strike for playstation 80k 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:02:02.350
 4 for a kaka a xbox the year for 90 here 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:08.020
 mouse and the reserve keyboard 80 ends up being 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.160
 the vip for 30k so I think in this 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.140
 no one will not have 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.240
 it is inequality, because I think that 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.830
 Time to play, you can buy 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.260
 things 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:27.470
 things come to you like x 148 g8 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.370
 box we all arrived so I think one 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.740
 the punishment has already had a super good idea of 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.720
 do that 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:42.470
 even people who have told you not 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:47.650
 You can buy something from this. 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:51.590
 then playing with a money player 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.380
 or you buy but then I wanted to talk 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:03.290
 which also which I think gives 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:06.860
 more money is the hide-and-seek then 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:13.370
 every player you're hiding and 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:22.100
 You think them and it's killing you and you. 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:26.000
 ends up winning by 1 1 with the dep 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.990
 to 10 and as you can see is what is more 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.550
 played right 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:40.900
 op hide hides from there comes the such has 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:52.130
 football has several different genres of 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:04:02.030
 games but also yesterday that has a map 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:07.160
 blink bomb num in a game 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:10.520
 in the game what else is I know which one 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.980
 the map that is needed there bomb also the 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.200
 that stop the use of 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:20.810
 soothing 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:29.750
 I found it well, but here it gives more 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:31.120
 I think at least you become a 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:42.100
 block 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:42.100
 Then you find the players. 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.539
 hide here 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.199
 never climb higher because 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.650
 Are you going to start hiding here? 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:22.010
 then there I will turn a block of sand 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.740
 No, I will not have a sandstone. 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.960
 call me hide here guys 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:31.960
 Finding it right, right? 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.960
 Let's hide, she's seeing the phone. 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:41.660
 I'll soon look like the metal I killed 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:44.210
 livina and livina block of the new time killed 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:50.900
 Why do they think they're hiding their car? 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:53.030
 photo of him and I thought he did not 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:58.490
 I was very upset so I went 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:06:02.930
 death will kill you right? 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:14.060
 I'm going to debate the ways you have to go. 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:16.780
 finding one of the players had a fondness 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.780
 that he knows 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:44.650
 It was also more play to play. 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:48.430
 fashion pretty little as you go 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:51.849
 formatting but I think that's it 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:55.780
 Just for you guys, I found none. 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:07:03.460
 video on youtube that was not the 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:06.039
 kraft llandia showing the mini game 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:12.370
 I decided to show why it's an idea. 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:16.900
 super good super good kraft me 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:23.560
 I decided to show you understood why 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:26.969
 or not everyone wants to win 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.969
 a playstation 4 is not 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:34.539
