00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.890
 [Music] 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.990
 ah 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.970
 with a luxurious and traditional ceremony 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.890
 which it has been kept for centuries 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.060
 Queen Elizabeth II gave her speech 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.310
 annual opening of the parliament 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.950
 British with whom he established 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.529
 government plans for this year in the 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.830
 center of the legislative agenda highlighted 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.020
 the intention to stop immigration 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.759
 mike weightman my government will present a 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.800
 bill that will reform the system 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.240
 of immigration from britain the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.100
 bill will ensure that it 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.140
 attract to this country the people who 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.329
 contribute and those who do not go away 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.070
 they do it for many this approach comes 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.079
 as a reaction to the increase in 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.600
 popularity of the nationalist party and 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.460
 far right and ukip but many 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.899
 consider that immigrants who 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.090
 they mostly work and pay 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.370
 taxes are being used as 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.859
 scapegoat before the problems 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.239
 cheap eggs, we are very 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.160
 disappointed with what has been announced 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.379
 because this is going to repress the 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.750
 immigrants limit the services as 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.310
 health and legal assistance also feeds 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.260
 discrimination by the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.200
 society so I do not see what the 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.640
 benefit for the country with all this 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.220
 suppress immigration will be one of the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.580
 priorities in the legislative agenda 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.530
 british 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.480
 year for many this turned out 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.060
 disappointing criticize that the most 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.040
 worrying is what was not included in 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.440
 the speech of the queen measures 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.780
 concrete to boost growth 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.730
 economic for the party leader 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.290
 Natal Green and Bennett issues that are 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.630
 crucial for the ordinary citizen not 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.370
 were included in the speech whats 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.990
 missing is what was not included in 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.550
 the agenda was an economic plan that 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.140
 move the country away from the measures 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.630
 austerity that have proven to be 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.400
 devastating and a complete failure we 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.630
 He talked about investing in what is necessary 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.600
 as environmental protection 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.850
 renewable energy transportation or services 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.340
 public those are the things that the country 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.630
 desperately needs in another area 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.580
 the queen assured that her government 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.160
 will provide security to territories of 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.300
 overseas as the Falkland Islands which 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.119
 it was interpreted as a message 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.040
 challenging to argentina that keeps the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.110
 diplomatic claim of the territory 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.580
 this year the speech also had the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.730
 presence of prince carlos that no 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.290
 attended the ceremony since 1996 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.060
 the heir will also be his 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.070
 representative at the forthcoming meeting of 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.080
 the commonwealth what has been perceived 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.420
 as the beginning of the transition while 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.849
 the queen proportionally reduces her 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.010
 as a result of his advanced age 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.010
