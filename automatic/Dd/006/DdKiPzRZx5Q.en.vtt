temperature<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> little<00:00:43.710> bit<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.100> very<00:00:44.879> very

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
temperature a little bit so very very

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700 
temperature a little bit so very very

lots<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.920> enthusiast<00:00:47.460> level<00:00:48.210> stuff<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.690> we'll

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
lots of enthusiast level stuff and we'll

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.439 
lots of enthusiast level stuff and we'll
jump<00:00:49.170> right<00:00:49.230> into<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.559> starting<00:00:50.010> off<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
jump right into it starting off with the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.959 
jump right into it starting off with the
CPU<00:00:51.780> socket<00:00:52.230> now<00:00:52.289> obviously<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.010> an<00:00:53.640> 11

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
CPU socket now obviously this is an 11

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.270 
CPU socket now obviously this is an 11
56<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:54.780> Linfield<00:00:55.170> Intel<00:00:55.500> processors<00:00:56.100> i

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
56 is your Linfield Intel processors i

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.060 
56 is your Linfield Intel processors i
5s<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.059> i<00:00:57.120> 7s<00:00:57.539> your<00:00:57.629> 750<00:00:58.140> s<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.260> your<00:00:58.379> 860<00:00:58.920> s

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
5s and i 7s your 750 s in your 860 s

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.709 
5s and i 7s your 750 s in your 860 s
basically<00:00:59.910> we're<00:01:00.000> getting<00:01:00.149> an<00:01:00.210> i-5<00:01:00.539> it's

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
basically we're getting an i-5 it's

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.380 
basically we're getting an i-5 it's
gonna<00:01:00.840> fit<00:01:01.020> no<00:01:01.109> problem<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.530> i7<00:01:02.370> will<00:01:03.030> work<00:01:03.239> in

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
gonna fit no problem and i7 will work in

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
gonna fit no problem and i7 will work in
here<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.629> make<00:01:03.719> sure<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> socket<00:01:04.379> 1156

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
here to make sure it's the socket 1156

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.120 
here to make sure it's the socket 1156
now<00:01:05.640> from<00:01:06.090> x58<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:06.840> did<00:01:06.990> lose<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.380> qpi<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
now from x58 we did lose the qpi and the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.950 
now from x58 we did lose the qpi and the
triple<00:01:08.369> channel<00:01:08.490> memory<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.720> honestly

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
triple channel memory but to be honestly

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320 
triple channel memory but to be honestly
that<00:01:10.080> doesn't<00:01:10.530> really<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.890> much<00:01:11.090> as<00:01:12.090> far<00:01:12.240> as

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that doesn't really do much as far as

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.539 
that doesn't really do much as far as
performance<00:01:12.630> goes<00:01:12.720> now<00:01:12.990> they're<00:01:13.140> getting<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
performance goes now they're getting the

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.950 
performance goes now they're getting the

there's only 16 lanes in total but on
this<00:01:29.400> board<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.790> come<00:01:29.939> down<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
this board if you come down here a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.179 
this board if you come down here a
little<00:01:30.450> bit<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.619> will<00:01:31.799> see<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.100> do

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
little bit you do will see that you do

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.999 
little bit you do will see that you do
have<00:01:32.310> two<00:01:32.520> PCI<00:01:33.210> Express<00:01:33.420> x16<00:01:33.810> 2.0<00:01:34.439> slots<00:01:34.829> right

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
have two PCI Express x16 2.0 slots right

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.069 
have two PCI Express x16 2.0 slots right
there<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.450> SLI<00:01:36.869> or<00:01:36.900> crossfire

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
there and if you do SLI or crossfire

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.100 
there and if you do SLI or crossfire
which<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.130> both<00:01:38.310> they<00:01:38.549> will<00:01:38.790> split<00:01:39.180> x8

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
which you can do both they will split x8

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.830 
which you can do both they will split x8
x8<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:41.040> x16<00:01:41.610> will<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.880> split<00:01:42.090> into<00:01:42.210> x8<00:01:42.570> x8

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
x8 so your x16 will be split into x8 x8

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.050 
x8 so your x16 will be split into x8 x8
it'll<00:01:43.049> by<00:01:43.170> 4k<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.700> will<00:01:44.820> give<00:01:44.970> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
it'll by 4k and then that will give you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.090 
it'll by 4k and then that will give you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the ability to do SLI was just as much

already<00:01:48.509> down<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.290> might<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:49.590> well<00:01:49.619> talked

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
already down here I might as well talked

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.109 
already down here I might as well talked
a<00:01:49.920> little<00:01:50.009> bit<00:01:50.159> about<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.520> rest<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.790> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
a little bit about the rest of it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.130 
a little bit about the rest of it
you<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.509> three<00:01:51.720> PCI<00:01:52.020> Express<00:01:52.520> x1<00:01:53.840> 2.0<00:01:54.840> right

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you have three PCI Express x1 2.0 right

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.190 
you have three PCI Express x1 2.0 right
there<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.219> two<00:01:57.149> PC<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.570> down<00:01:57.869> here

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
there and you have a two PC is down here

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.679 
there and you have a two PC is down here
so<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:59.009> throw<00:01:59.280> some<00:01:59.570> relics

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
so you can throw some relics

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.170 
so you can throw some relics
on<00:02:00.960> these<00:02:01.409> maybe<00:02:01.710> some<00:02:01.950> TV<00:02:02.399> tuner<00:02:02.670> cards<00:02:03.030> or
