00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
thought it was going to be by putting

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.400 
thought it was going to be by putting
the<00:02:08.640> eyeshadow<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.509> over<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.989> top<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
the eyeshadow on over the top of the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.260 
the eyeshadow on over the top of the
eyeliner<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> make<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.940> stay<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.120> a

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
eyeliner it's going to make it stay on a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.230 
eyeliner it's going to make it stay on a
lot<00:02:12.450> longer

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
lot longer

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.390
