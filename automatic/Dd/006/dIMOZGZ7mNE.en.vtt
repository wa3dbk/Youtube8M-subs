 Today frown 17 following the Cuckoo's eponymous Korean as eoku 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:16.199
 Let's take a look at the box in front of you . 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.949
 I got it in front of me, and it looks like three houses. 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.029
 If you can open it, it's a good watch. 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.029
 Abdominal abdomen distribution 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:33.350
 I like to alert you to a manual ticket. 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:37.070

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.320

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.320
 It's just like a normal c .

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.799
 In general, other smart watches have a screen that needs to be charged tomorrow. 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:07.189
 This is just a generic type of ion battery into the furniture for about a year . 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:11.060
 Even if this Bluetooth battery is dead, 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:14.570
 In the analog era, the most moving thing is the longer you can see the time. 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.290
 So it should be just a thick expression 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.840
 Did you can connect depending on the key trends, so the sputter's iPhone app 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.460
 If you are close to the Bluetooth connection 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.570

 I do not know when the letter came to 9 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:17.050
 I can not write a sentence. 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.120
 I do not know how to do this. 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.930

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.750
 And I can only do this. 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.320

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:04.730
 Please press the car mat key. 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:10.310
 If you use it, you'll cross it . 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:15.440
 I can not find the phone, and the other progress l got a camera 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:18.890
 But that's not the camera is blocked just the touch of grunge to the water fall 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:23.450
 Get in the app and get the camera . 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:27.200
 So you can press the command key to take a picture . 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.100
 You can take a picture by putting it in a different place and holding it a little far away 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.090
 That's it. 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:37.190

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.970
 Yeah, I mean jumping. 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:54.440

 Battery problems Battery problems itjyo ssikeun almost every day, or rather one 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.200
 Depending on the usage pattern, 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:04.610
 It's a little annoying to actually do that about the clock itself. 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:08.200
 Anyway , I have to listen carefully and receive a letter. 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:13.040
