00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
ways like the defining point was

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.440 
ways like the defining point was
probably<00:03:41.110> emotion<00:03:41.620> when<00:03:42.030> they<00:03:43.030> actually<00:03:43.300> got

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
probably emotion when they actually got

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.080 
probably emotion when they actually got
