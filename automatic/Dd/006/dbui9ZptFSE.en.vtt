00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
fabric friendly one of the reasons why

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.289 
fabric friendly one of the reasons why
it<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.380> comfortable<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.979> wear<00:01:52.220> is<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:53.150> does

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
it is so comfortable to wear is it does

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.539 
it is so comfortable to wear is it does
stretch<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:54.049> that<00:01:54.229> stretching<00:01:54.979> allows

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
stretch and that stretching allows

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.030 
stretch and that stretching allows
movement<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.200> doesn't<00:01:57.710> have<00:01:57.860> that

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
movement and so you doesn't have that

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.429 
movement and so you doesn't have that
restrictive<00:01:58.610> feeling<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.270> also<00:02:00.140> it's

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
restrictive feeling and also it's

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.960 
restrictive feeling and also it's
