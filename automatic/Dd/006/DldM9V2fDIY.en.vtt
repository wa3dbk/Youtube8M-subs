gas mileage as well I will show you how
to<00:00:22.090> increase<00:00:22.390> your<00:00:22.510> temperature<00:00:23.349> in<00:00:23.529> your

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
to increase your temperature in your

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.029 
to increase your temperature in your
saloon<00:00:24.279> it<00:00:25.000> is<00:00:25.240> easily<00:00:25.689> done<00:00:26.080> and<00:00:26.320> I<00:00:26.769> will<00:00:26.830> show

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
saloon it is easily done and I will show

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.519 
saloon it is easily done and I will show
you<00:00:27.070> how<00:00:27.250> to<00:00:27.310> do<00:00:27.490> usually<00:00:28.359> it's<00:00:28.990> necessary<00:00:29.410> if

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
you how to do usually it's necessary if

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.280 
you how to do usually it's necessary if
you<00:00:29.650> see<00:00:29.859> this<00:00:30.130> little<00:00:30.480> instrument<00:00:31.480> if<00:00:32.110> it

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
you see this little instrument if it

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.020 
you see this little instrument if it
shows<00:00:32.560> that<00:00:32.800> arrangement<00:00:33.460> school<00:00:33.820> and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
shows that arrangement school and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.090 
shows that arrangement school and
probably<00:00:34.390> inside<00:00:34.690> your<00:00:34.870> car<00:00:35.200> also<00:00:35.680> the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
probably inside your car also the

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.060 
probably inside your car also the
temperature<00:00:37.030> will<00:00:37.239> be<00:00:37.270> very<00:00:37.690> low<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.230> if<00:00:38.860> also

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
temperature will be very low and if also

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.709 
temperature will be very low and if also
it'll<00:00:39.430> be<00:00:39.550> below<00:00:39.730> freezing<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:40.329> I<00:00:40.420> believe

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
it'll be below freezing and I believe

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.720 
it'll be below freezing and I believe
inside<00:00:41.050> as<00:00:41.590> well<00:00:41.829> you'll<00:00:41.980> have<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.489> same

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
inside as well you'll have the same

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.270 
inside as well you'll have the same
temperature<00:00:43.000> and<00:00:44.820> that's<00:00:45.820> well<00:00:46.000> you<00:00:46.780> will

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
temperature and that's well you will

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.549 
temperature and that's well you will
consume<00:00:48.280> more<00:00:48.609> this<00:00:49.359> fuel<00:00:49.629> not<00:00:49.930> exactly<00:00:50.289> you

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
consume more this fuel not exactly you

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.549 
consume more this fuel not exactly you
but<00:00:50.739> your<00:00:50.890> car<00:00:51.160> so<00:00:51.730> let's<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:53.050> outside<00:00:53.260> now

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
but your car so let's go outside now

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.139 
but your car so let's go outside now
I'll<00:00:53.620> show<00:00:53.859> you<00:00:53.890> how<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.280> do<00:00:54.579> something<00:00:55.000> very

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
I'll show you how to do something very

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.470 
I'll show you how to do something very
easy<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:56.590> know<00:00:57.399> resolve<00:00:57.789> these<00:00:57.940> two<00:00:58.180> problems

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
easy to know resolve these two problems

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.509 
easy to know resolve these two problems
so<00:00:59.320> usually<00:01:00.160> just<00:01:00.519> an<00:01:00.760> old<00:01:01.239> cardboard<00:01:01.840> or<00:01:02.519> just

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
so usually just an old cardboard or just

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:11.120 
so usually just an old cardboard or just
take<00:01:03.699> some<00:01:03.940> old<00:01:04.120> cardboard<00:01:04.510> box<00:01:08.520> duct<00:01:09.520> tape<00:01:09.759> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
take some old cardboard box duct tape so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.760 
take some old cardboard box duct tape so
just<00:01:12.130> like<00:01:12.400> flatten<00:01:13.150> it<00:01:13.299> I<00:01:13.509> don't<00:01:13.990> know<00:01:14.110> you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
just like flatten it I don't know you

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.270 
just like flatten it I don't know you
have<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:14.950> do<00:01:15.220> it<00:01:15.400> with<00:01:15.790> your<00:01:15.970> radiator<00:01:16.600> size<00:01:17.280> so

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
have to do it with your radiator size so

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.969 
have to do it with your radiator size so
you<00:01:19.150> can<00:01:19.420> partly<00:01:20.020> or<00:01:20.259> fully<00:01:20.290> block<00:01:20.770> your

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
you can partly or fully block your

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.170 
you can partly or fully block your
radiator<00:01:21.579> from<00:01:22.049> any<00:01:23.049> cold<00:01:23.350> air<00:01:23.560> flow<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.310> just

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
radiator from any cold air flow so just

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.590 
radiator from any cold air flow so just
take<00:01:25.450> part

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.360 

like<00:01:29.600> this<00:01:32.230> it's<00:01:33.230> also<00:01:33.440> necessary<00:01:33.860> this<00:01:34.310> is

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
like this it's also necessary this is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.210 
like this it's also necessary this is
beautiful<00:01:35.000> down<00:01:35.150> on<00:01:35.330> to<00:01:35.450> mother<00:01:35.630> well<00:01:36.380> well

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
beautiful down on to mother well well

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.760 
beautiful down on to mother well well
then<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.820> next<00:01:38.150> two<00:01:38.270> just<00:01:38.540> added<00:01:39.260> between

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
then you the next two just added between

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.460 
then you the next two just added between
this<00:01:40.010> radiator<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:41.000> there<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:41.750> small<00:01:42.200> space

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
this radiator and there is a small space

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.590 
this radiator and there is a small space
so<00:01:43.900> depends<00:01:44.900> how<00:01:45.350> how<00:01:46.070> fully<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:47.150> will<00:01:47.330> block

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
so depends how how fully it will block

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.590 
so depends how how fully it will block
this<00:01:47.780> radiator<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:49.220> pool<00:01:50.000> aid<00:01:50.180> your

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
this radiator that pool aid your

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.300 
this radiator that pool aid your
temperature<00:01:51.080> will<00:01:51.230> increase<00:01:51.320> if<00:01:52.250> you

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
temperature will increase if you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.850 
temperature will increase if you
willfully<00:01:52.760> block<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.300> then<00:01:53.510> probably<00:01:53.960> you

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
willfully block it then probably you

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.150 
willfully block it then probably you
know<00:01:55.040> heat<00:01:55.910> your<00:01:56.870> car<00:01:57.080> a<00:01:57.110> lot<00:01:57.380> more<00:01:57.620> and<00:01:57.950> your

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
know heat your car a lot more and your

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.580 
know heat your car a lot more and your
mileage<00:01:58.370> will<00:01:58.550> also<00:01:59.210> your<00:01:59.810> gas<00:02:00.050> mileage<00:02:00.260> will

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
mileage will also your gas mileage will

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.020 
mileage will also your gas mileage will
increase<00:02:00.980> what's<00:02:01.760> good<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.060> bad<00:02:02.810> sign<00:02:03.500> that

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
increase what's good and bad sign that

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.690 
increase what's good and bad sign that
where<00:02:05.030> we<00:02:05.210> will<00:02:05.300> get<00:02:05.980> warmer<00:02:06.980> or<00:02:07.010> I<00:02:07.400> know

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
where we will get warmer or I know

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.300 
where we will get warmer or I know
anything<00:02:08.570> else<00:02:08.750> we<00:02:09.530> might<00:02:09.710> overheat<00:02:10.220> the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
anything else we might overheat the

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.130 
anything else we might overheat the
engine<00:02:10.340> but<00:02:10.790> it<00:02:11.270> shouldn't<00:02:11.600> happen<00:02:11.720> in<00:02:11.990> winter

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
engine but it shouldn't happen in winter

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.750 
engine but it shouldn't happen in winter
so<00:02:12.560> well<00:02:13.370> just<00:02:14.030> push<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.480> exam<00:02:15.760> scoreboard

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
so well just push the exam scoreboard

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.340 
so well just push the exam scoreboard
and<00:02:17.540> then<00:02:17.780> just<00:02:18.110> like<00:02:19.120> you

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
and then just like you

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.330 
and then just like you
this<00:02:22.350> duct<00:02:22.680> tape<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:24.740> taken<00:02:25.740> on<00:02:25.920> two<00:02:26.100> pieces

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
this duct tape just taken on two pieces

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.800 
this duct tape just taken on two pieces
of<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.030> stick<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.440> right<00:02:29.250> away<00:02:29.810> so

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810

of it and stick it so it right away so
hey<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:31.860> see<00:02:32.100> how<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.430> can<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:33.150> put<00:02:33.780> it

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
hey you can see how you can like put it

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.480 
hey you can see how you can like put it
in<00:02:33.990> place<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:34.740> not<00:02:34.860> moving<00:02:35.070> anywhere

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
in place so it's not moving anywhere

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.030 
in place so it's not moving anywhere
this<00:02:35.700> cardboard<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.960> can<00:02:36.990> easily<00:02:37.590> like

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
this cardboard you can easily like

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.150 
this cardboard you can easily like
attach<00:02:38.460> it<00:02:38.700> with<00:02:38.910> duct<00:02:39.870> tape<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.380> up<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:41.040> this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
attach it with duct tape and up to this

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.420 
attach it with duct tape and up to this
upper<00:02:42.090> hose<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:43.260> will<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.500> course<00:02:43.560> heat<00:02:44.010> up<00:02:44.190> but

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
upper hose it will of course heat up but

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.950 
upper hose it will of course heat up but
it<00:02:44.610> won't<00:02:45.180> light<00:02:46.170> up<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.920> duct<00:02:47.220> tape<00:02:47.460> as<00:02:47.730> well

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
it won't light up this duct tape as well

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.440 
it won't light up this duct tape as well
it's<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:49.110> nice<00:02:49.230> connection<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:50.040> middle<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:51.210> it's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
it's a nice connection in middle so it's

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.140 
it's a nice connection in middle so it's
not<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:51.900> I'm<00:02:52.170> moving<00:02:52.320> besides<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.700> can<00:02:53.880> just

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
not like I'm moving besides you can just

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.960 
not like I'm moving besides you can just
and<00:02:54.600> another<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.560> duct-tape<00:02:55.920> patch<00:02:56.460> to<00:02:56.820> this

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
and another this duct-tape patch to this

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.450 
and another this duct-tape patch to this
side<00:02:57.270> where<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.690> little<00:02:57.840> host<00:02:58.460> expansion

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
side where the little host expansion

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.660 
side where the little host expansion
tank<00:02:59.870> you<00:03:00.870> can<00:03:00.930> see<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:02.100> course<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.490> car

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
tank you can see and of course the car

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.760 
tank you can see and of course the car
both<00:03:02.820> sides<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:04.050> enough<00:03:04.320> with<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> two

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
both sides so it's enough with the two

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.830 
both sides so it's enough with the two
points<00:03:05.160> where<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.460> holding<00:03:05.880> because<00:03:06.030> of

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
points where it's holding because of

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.510 
points where it's holding because of
course<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.230> will<00:03:07.350> be<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> little<00:03:07.740> bit<00:03:08.010> runaway

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
course it will be a little bit runaway

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.210 
course it will be a little bit runaway
it<00:03:08.910> won't<00:03:09.150> get<00:03:09.330> loose<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:10.140> well<00:03:10.410> if<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:11.010> will

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
it won't get loose and well if you will

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.700 
it won't get loose and well if you will
just<00:03:11.490> sticker<00:03:11.820> this<00:03:12.270> carbon<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.470> will

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
just sticker this carbon it will

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.850 
just sticker this carbon it will
increase<00:03:14.430> your<00:03:14.490> car<00:03:15.120> saloon<00:03:15.990> temperature<00:03:16.620> as

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
increase your car saloon temperature as

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.730 
increase your car saloon temperature as
well<00:03:17.100> your<00:03:18.000> gas<00:03:18.210> mileage<00:03:18.450> rather<00:03:19.200> easy<00:03:19.410> thing

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
well your gas mileage rather easy thing

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.730 
well your gas mileage rather easy thing
and<00:03:19.950> very<00:03:20.280> efficient<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.660> only<00:03:22.140> cons<00:03:22.500> for

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
and very efficient the only cons for

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.120 
and very efficient the only cons for
this<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.160> like<00:03:23.430> well<00:03:24.300> if<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.350> like<00:03:25.590> drive<00:03:25.830> fast

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
this is like well if you like drive fast

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.240 
this is like well if you like drive fast
then<00:03:26.460> you're<00:03:26.700> aerodynamic<00:03:27.480> mind<00:03:27.840> just<00:03:28.320> reduce

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
then you're aerodynamic mind just reduce

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.760 
then you're aerodynamic mind just reduce
and<00:03:29.490> change<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.910> little<00:03:30.000> bit<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.600> well<00:03:31.440> your

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
and change a little bit and well your

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.610 
and change a little bit and well your
stability<00:03:32.700> might<00:03:33.300> be<00:03:33.510> affected<00:03:34.050> as<00:03:34.170> well<00:03:34.200> and

stability might be affected as well and

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.560 
stability might be affected as well and
of<00:03:35.400> course<00:03:35.670> if<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.910> weather<00:03:36.090> will<00:03:36.360> turn

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
of course if the weather will turn

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.080 
of course if the weather will turn
hotter<00:03:37.470> than<00:03:37.860> this<00:03:38.250> will<00:03:38.430> cause<00:03:38.730> some

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
hotter than this will cause some

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.240 
hotter than this will cause some
problems<00:03:39.480> with<00:03:40.170> cooling<00:03:40.590> us<00:03:40.710> also<00:03:40.890> don't

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
problems with cooling us also don't

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.370 
problems with cooling us also don't

is how I increased my engine temperature
as<00:03:50.670> well<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:51.180> such<00:03:51.390> a<00:03:51.420> way<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.660> increased<00:03:52.230> its

as well in such a way I increased its

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.090 
as well in such a way I increased its
gas<00:03:53.670> mileage<00:03:54.210> and<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.870> course<00:03:55.140> increase<00:03:55.890> my

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
gas mileage and of course increase my

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.700 
gas mileage and of course increase my
oven<00:03:56.550> timer<00:03:56.760> as<00:03:57.000> well<00:03:57.210> with<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.540> 480<00:03:58.320> fixed

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
much cardboard both cost I actually got

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.700 
much cardboard both cost I actually got
