I<00:00:52.230> mean<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.039> doesn't<00:00:53.399> qualify<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> car

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
I mean that doesn't qualify it as a car

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.750 
I mean that doesn't qualify it as a car
but<00:00:55.170> throughout<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> whole<00:00:55.980> car<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.550> build

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
but throughout the whole car the build

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.360 
but throughout the whole car the build
quality<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.920> even<00:00:58.920> though<00:00:59.160> there's

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
quality is there and even though there's

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.950 
quality is there and even though there's
some<00:00:59.609> sections<00:01:00.120> where<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> plastic<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
some sections where the plastic is a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.270 
some sections where the plastic is a
little<00:01:01.020> bit<00:01:01.350> shitty<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:01.829> maybe<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
little bit shitty like maybe on the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.289 
little bit shitty like maybe on the
steering<00:01:02.520> wheel<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.899> car<00:01:04.199> does<00:01:04.680> feel

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
steering wheel here the car does feel

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.380 
steering wheel here the car does feel
better<00:01:06.299> quality<00:01:07.310> now<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> six-speed

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
better quality now this is the six-speed
