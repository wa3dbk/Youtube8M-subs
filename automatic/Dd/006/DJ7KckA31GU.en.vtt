00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.670
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.010
 for the third part in my rubric vegan 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.570
 In pregnancy yesterday I have 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.250
 yes already on the subject of connective tissue 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.290
 spoken and I have to first 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.060
 Thank you for the numerous 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.340
 Love comments still tips against 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.860
 heartburn and that the aasee li na 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.870
 they have the recipe to their so-called 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.899
 Granny reproduced and pineapple juice 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.579
 and healing earth or remembered what 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.769
 Unfortunately I made the mistake 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.180
 have too much about body care 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.620
 I am actually much too 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.359
 little comment on how we got from 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.510
 can do more for them 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.429
 i have a bit with msn and with 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.829
 Kieselde but that was actually too 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.809
 little and that's why there are in this 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.969
 Addendum and thank you as I said for this 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.609
 prescription from your grandma so the league 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.059
 aldiana that brought me to it 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.760
 The pineapple has a great one once 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.970
 switzerland finally put on life 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.290
 that is very special in the heart of 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.000
 Pineapples actually contain what we do 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.920
 always cut it off so leave it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.750
 actually in there or when they talk 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.480
 could my tip could 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.370
 my tip fades the whole thing in the mixer 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.090
 and and drinking is a fresh pineapple 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.530
 is super healthy rich in vitamins and give 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.690
 this is what we are talking about here 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.730
 protein enzymes both of them enough 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.880
 and we need a white-splitting one 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.250
 enzymes because we can from the female 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.840
 body can produce collagen itself 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.120
 but for that we need enough 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.220
 sleep very important so melatonin 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.660
 Production is important here 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.240
 I on another video 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.680
 So you have to sleep a lot and 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.710
 but you have also the body that 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.870
 so that he can also do so 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.340
 is even cola the hag to ask and 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.050
 we only need three for that 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.300
 important amino acids speak 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.070
 protein building blocks and a vegan one 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.770
 a lot of green stuff that I go from it 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.670
 that you enough on the user and too wet 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.580
 or just enough in the gate where fits 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.050
 Say soy lupine and so on and we 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.970
 need vitamin c 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.160
 that is very important and we 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.280
 need 31 blocks that is broken up 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.080
 my note look exactly 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.330
 proline and stand systems is 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.940
 unbelievable also we strike yesterday 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.340
 shocks often msm so in terms of sulfur 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.410
 is very very important now the three out 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.870
 these three amino acids and vitamin c 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.960
 The body can build up collagen at night 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.420
 and even the team fiber this 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.220
 tissue also support and nice 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.750
 side effect or happiness hormones become 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.600
 that's why we mostly see it 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.010
 always somehow younger in the morning 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.900
 during the day you can see 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.160
 proverbially old sometime in the evening 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.230
 one will offer 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.800
 Do you know how you look really old and 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.970
 there you can do something about it and one 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.980
 Ultimate tip is it too 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.040
 delicious midnight snack just a 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.590
 piece of calthof I stand incredibly 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.690
 emanate from the edeka smoked and 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.640
 then it takes so 30 grams and promotes 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.470
 with lemon and it velvet this lemon 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.860
 that flesh you together and 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.080
 From this combination, the body can 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.280
 make super collagen and important 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.080
 is from the 35th 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.050
 we just do not have another year of life 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.640
 this gastric acid production and that's why 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.000
 this trick is also with the pineapple 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.959
 or just with the lemon incredible 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.080
 helpful because they are just split 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.910
 Enzymes acid in lemons 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.370
 lemon helps to split protein and 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.980
 just different here and again completely 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.570
 good tip also protects against varicose veins 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.400
 Often it is so close to pregnancy 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.950
 that you just too much through that 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.530
 weight and just too much pressure in the 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.600
 Venen then that comes to varicose and 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.980
 Of course that's just a lot 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.120
 Unattractive thing that you can not 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.210
 just cover up like that 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.460
 with make-up well so come on something 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.930
 on the subject of movement please exaggerate it 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.220
 there was not one before too 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.870
 little sport junkie 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.540
 that does not have to be anymore 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.040
 because it's enough 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.630
 Walks might be a good idea 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.890
 pregnancy judas which one too 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.840
 I think that's it, too 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.489
 great for breathing, you learn too 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.390
 in birth preparation times 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.000
 to breathe properly 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.890
 but I think that we are right now 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.600
 anyway, in the middle of yoga, our middle 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.820
 especially our joints 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.950
 Bank slices swirl so it comes 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.810
 Everything very close to the limits of 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.610
 that's easy for me 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.890
 stretchen and a bit too 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.120
 come to rest 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.270
 as I said, so finds a mean thing 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.490
 also regarding the food 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.110
 you may of course and for the sake of God 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.200
 to feast and enjoy 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.790
 just not that you son jan den 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.850
 error does I mean clearly the fries 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.640
 and cola are also vegan but you should 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.080
 Of course, pay attention and balanced 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.520
 to eat fresh so mainly 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.620
 fresh things there you can really 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.840
 feast and enjoy please count now 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.280
 No calories but convulsive 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.380
 Also not to say the mistake friends 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.910
 formed that made i know nine 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.620
 months full throttle and that was not 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.140
 vegan and that's right too 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.780
 had problems with the fabric too 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.460
 the weight and of course then very much 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.500
 sad because that back to back 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.570
 It's very, very difficult to get 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.080
 once when it is uprooted it is it 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.260
 cracked 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.689
 Of course, the redness away but me 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.189
 If you have something please let me believe 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:34.719
 know but I believe to 100 percent 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:36.909
 There is no possibility then good 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:39.249
 if you wish what my 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.809
 next topic I shall be like that again 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:42.489
 a bit on nutritional supplements 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:44.229
 make my own vita mine I think 

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:47.519
 precaution is important as twelve 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:49.989
 maybe calcium magnesium 

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:51.909
