00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.180
 hello everyone welcome a new 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.760
 times on the chain ann win we are 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.459
 very happy to have 400 subscribers 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.160
 it's really great and thank you 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.960
 enormously it's completely unexpected 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.060
 and on this occasion to celebrate it's this 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.380
 little birthday we asked you 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.630
 your opinion you were asked what 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.770
 video will make you happy and on youtube 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.480
 com on facebook what came out 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.700
 it's the bedtime tutorial you see 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.129
 two months so that's what I tell you 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.420
 propose to do today with them 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.550
 so before you start the tutorial 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.600
 proper i just wanted you 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.930
 give some tips for 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.040
 optimize the success of this round all 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.960
 first you have to know that it's the lot 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.890
 it's a long and difficult exercise 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.280
 do not get discouraged 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.329
 it can take months but years 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.059
 it's an exercise based on trust 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.070
 and bedtime is still a 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.970
 opposition in which the year genera 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.060
 bhl 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.580
 it takes so much for to agree to do 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.050
 that for you so do not be discouraged 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.590
 that's the key word 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.660
 then there is the way of the facility that 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.610
 is to put us swimming before the 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.630
 sleep because we see on the knees 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.980
 they get tired he gets tired they get 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.530
 get tired and he will end up lying down 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.090
 I do not like this technique clearly 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.670
 I know a little barbaric a little 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.780
 little brutal it can even be dangerous 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.730
 because one of them fights because 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.420
 he can hurt himself by falling all this 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.770
 so I do not recommend this this 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.270
 technical and I will rather you 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.970
 advise it's lucky the longest 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.440
 certainly but this one softer be 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.540
 so finally this technique 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.420
 the first step very first step 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.810
 it's about spending time with your 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.830
 hate to loans to observe it and when 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.150
 you see he's about to get 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.369
 bedtime when he goes of course the father his 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.080
 bathtub that are scratching all told him 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.259
 the code you chose in layer 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.910
 you or recline and lie down 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.920
 go to bed until you 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.030
 go to bed and congratulate him as if 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.130
 you have in the country for real to you 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.840
 here and it must be repeated several 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.580
 After many times as possible as soon as 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.380
 you see who goes to bed at about 10 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.050
 then the code like that of cold to the liver 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.760
 he will integrate it and he will understand he 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.060
 is he going to associate the word and the fact is 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.530
 sleep 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.179
 so once this step has been 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.830
 performed several times it is necessary to put 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.600
 all the chances on your side in 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.360
 doing a few simple things 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.239
 it's better to do it already 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.769
 because it's nice and warm so the 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.600
 tendency to roll over to cool off 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.860
 then because there are flies so 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.860
 there we tend to roll for the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.180
 to hunt and then the earth is 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.430
 dry and friable and that's what he 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.280
 prefers it's really the season and this 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.019
 couple most so wait summer and in 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.850
 more is the season in general we are 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.709
 we are no longer there we are no longer with them 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.420
 could spend several days in a row 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.430
 and like that the exercise that needs 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.709
 to be repeated gently but long 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.709
 and did that rather summer 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.120
 you can also if you find 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.050
 that it is useful ledoux at home I 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.730
 did not want to do that and it's not 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.290
 mandatory but if you think that 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.790
 can help you make the so maybe 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.380
 not entirely except in the case of 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.310
 really big heat for work 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.560
 but shower him the members the passage 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.270
 of straps things like that and then 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.030
 actually it's going to make him leave 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.260
 run to dry and if you do not 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.060
 not want to touch also does not 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.980
 pretty hot yes just do it 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.290
 a good big for wise it be very 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.730
 clean and that he has only one desire 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.500
 to get dirty again because 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.480
 that's the goal anyway 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.890
 you have to repaint the bathtub 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.220
 preferred tran me that is a place 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.720
 where he is accustomed Willem roll as 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.100
 that they will feel confident he is going 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.480
 associate the place is what he does 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.620
 so usually it will be easier for 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.220
 him to assimilate what you are in 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.760
 to ask them 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.650
 and finally try to do this exercise 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.090
 earlier in the day ie 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.390
 what in the late afternoon and early in 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.830
 evening 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.190
 because it's time for predators 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.640
 and sailor lula did not appreciate me too much 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.350
 to get clogged 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.660
 because so that's a position in 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.800
 which he enumerated bhl and try to 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.330
 do that maybe after a session of 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.770
 work where he transpired for example 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.370
 because to take off the sweat and for 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.440
 to do good 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.730
 he will want to roll here 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.440
 I approached all the little tips that 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.420
 I wanted to give you before attacking 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.160
 earlier to be the best prepared 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.590
 possible before this turn and now we 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.909
 will go around itself 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.969
 I start in just not 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.739
 bring back the scrambles in his bathtub 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:13.870
 then I will exercise very light 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.519
 pressures on the loin and at the same time 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.739
 I'm going to rub the only one with my hand 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.410
 while saying the code I chose 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.729
 that is to say, you sleep until you 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.889
 that she gives in and that she lowers her head 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.060
 and of which she is not 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.740
 considers that she managed the first 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.840
 step so game the reward all of 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.250
 following by congratulating her especially if she 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.750
 resists my little pressures are there 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.699
 the stake loose everything immediately 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.080
 it is important not to point it and if 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.490
 you really have trouble making him 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.919
 lower their heads to what they understand 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.479
 what you want do not insist do 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.740
 to him rather take a little tour before 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.530
 to go back to the bathtub 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.710
 to start from scratch 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.419
 so again is you recommend 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.919
 tells you the code by scratching on the floor 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.370
 and by exerting little pressure on 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.320
 the loin 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.759
 here and you can stop there 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.539
 for a first step it's already a 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.669
 big step forward 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.160
 have him do this several times 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.930
 put your nose on the ground and when he 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.479
 seems to be in control of it well 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.639
 reward is a treat and it is 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.139
 leave it there or so if you 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.479
 feel good with you you can 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.280
 continue and here the second step is okay 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.229
 to be looking for the signs that he is going 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.280
 give you for example he can 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.889
 start going round in circles 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.139
 and for that you always have to have the 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.780
 lug quite flexible and always follow him 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.220
 do not do it in this case 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.389
 there because he knows better than you or 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.639
 does he want to roll so 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.759
 he will take you there then he goes 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.449
 rub the tip of his nose on the floor 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.909
 then he will wag his tail 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.199
 madly 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:37.780
 he can also start yawning at 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.240
 repetition and finally scribbles she has 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.669
 a bit exclusive but to which I have the right to 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.940
 every shot is this one is the shot 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.940
 of head 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.259
 when you 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.460
 sign there is that you are on the 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.979
 good way it's about it's about 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.639
 to roll so we continue to rub 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.500
 the ground by repeating the code word and 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.270
 encourage him and after a while that 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.770
 can be after five minutes if 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.189
 pay the trick right away or after 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.409
 one year 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:08.110
 but after a while he'll get 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.000
 bedtime especially at the slightest sign of 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.009
 gathering did not move anymore let 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.669
 stop him from moving stop 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:18.460
 talk and let it lie down and there we 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.560
 weeps for joy we shout we leap we are 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.750
 happy but above all but especially 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.560
 do not forget reward is very very 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.560
 very very strong 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.440
 do not be surprised maybe 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.790
 start it will roll one or two times 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.400
 and get up immediately 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.990
 it's normal it will not stay from the first 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.330
 blow half an hour with voice 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.280
 do you hug that will come small to 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.230
 small as is the fact that he is lying 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.790
 completely on the side or things 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.550
 like this finally after it's an exercise to 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:49.250
 to refine the fact that they lie down is 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.720
 that a first step finally 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.430
 everyone how I learned to get 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.960
 seasoned bed then boils like 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.370
 for jumping it's not the 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.290
 everything a universal method
