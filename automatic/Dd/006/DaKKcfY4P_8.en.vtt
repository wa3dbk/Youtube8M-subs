strong bonds with our animal friends and
for<00:00:16.199> some<00:00:16.350> reason<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.770> leads<00:00:17.070> us<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.400> believe

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
for some reason that leads us to believe

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.550 
for some reason that leads us to believe
that<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.970> can<00:00:18.119> understand<00:00:18.750> every<00:00:19.199> single

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
that we can understand every single

that we can understand every single
thing<00:00:19.770> that's<00:00:19.890> going<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.490> their<00:00:20.609> heads<00:00:20.850> the

thing that's going on in their heads the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.359 
thing that's going on in their heads the

purr<00:00:23.760> sits<00:00:24.300> loving<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:26.160> not<00:00:26.340> everything<00:00:26.970> is

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
purr sits loving but not everything is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.240 
purr sits loving but not everything is
all<00:00:27.480> rainbows<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.230> butterflies<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
all rainbows and butterflies in the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.040 
all rainbows and butterflies in the
animal<00:00:29.640> kingdom<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.300> we're<00:00:30.449> getting<00:00:30.750> into<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
animal kingdom so we're getting into the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.940 
animal kingdom so we're getting into the
nitty-gritty<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.619> why<00:00:32.009> cats<00:00:32.460> actually<00:00:32.759> meow

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
nitty-gritty of why cats actually meow

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.590 
nitty-gritty of why cats actually meow
so<00:00:34.950> one<00:00:35.190> reason<00:00:35.399> could<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.180> they're

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
so one reason could be that they're

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.330 
so one reason could be that they're
they're<00:00:36.899> happy<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.920> possibility

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
they're happy it's a it's a possibility

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.250 
they're happy it's a it's a possibility
but<00:00:38.550> there<00:00:38.670> are<00:00:38.820> also<00:00:38.940> also<00:00:39.719> are<00:00:39.870> some<00:00:40.050> other

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
but there are also also are some other

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.590 
but there are also also are some other
ideas<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.920> why<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.399> might<00:00:41.610> do<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:41.910> some

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
ideas of why they might do this some

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.060 
ideas of why they might do this some
cats<00:00:42.809> also<00:00:42.989> purr<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:43.680> they're<00:00:43.860> hungry

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
injured or frightened and most

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.479 
injured or frightened and most
surprisingly<00:00:46.350> purring<00:00:46.860> frequencies<00:00:47.370> have

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
surprisingly purring frequencies have

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.250 
surprisingly purring frequencies have
been<00:00:47.550> shown<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.120> stimulate<00:00:48.690> bone

been shown to stimulate bone

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
been shown to stimulate bone
regeneration<00:00:49.879> that's<00:00:51.920> ridiculous

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360

not send cats in space I get them a
little<00:02:06.600> tiny<00:02:06.990> space<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.680> think<00:02:08.099> there's<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
little tiny space I think there's a

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.390 
little tiny space I think there's a
blockbuster<00:02:09.030> out<00:02:09.840> of

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
blockbuster out of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.050 
blockbuster out of
Hollywood<00:02:11.400> here<00:02:11.640> we<00:02:11.700> come<00:02:12.150> cat<00:02:12.930> little<00:02:13.290> face

Hollywood here we come cat little face

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.090 
Hollywood here we come cat little face
uh<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.600> think<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.140> would<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.260> awesome

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
uh I think that would be awesome

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.920 
uh I think that would be awesome
chasing<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.910> mouse<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.360> like<00:02:18.480> bow<00:02:18.690> uh<00:02:20.660> yeah<00:02:21.690> I

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
chasing a mouse in like bow uh yeah I

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.199 
chasing a mouse in like bow uh yeah I
wonder<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.319> but<00:02:22.590> like<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.819> there<00:02:24.000> anything

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
wonder it but like so is there anything

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.570 
wonder it but like so is there anything
special<00:02:25.080> about<00:02:25.290> /<00:02:25.650> therapy<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.280> actually

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
special about / therapy that actually

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.100 
special about / therapy that actually
requires<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.240> cat<00:02:27.900> no<00:02:28.380> mic<00:02:29.600> does<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:30.780> do<00:02:30.990> you

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
requires a cat no mic does that do you

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.320 
requires a cat no mic does that do you
feel<00:02:31.320> bony<00:02:31.650> now<00:02:32.000> no<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.030> feel<00:02:33.270> very

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
feel bony now no I feel very

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.130 
feel bony now no I feel very
uncomfortable

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
uncomfortable

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.699 
uncomfortable
oh<00:02:34.260> yeah<00:02:35.150> no<00:02:36.150> but<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.600> there's<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:37.350> just<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
oh yeah no but so there's it's just the

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.760 
oh yeah no but so there's it's just the
same<00:02:38.420> vibrations<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.380> way<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.680> the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
same vibrations and the way that the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.320 
same vibrations and the way that the
frequency<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.610> could<00:02:41.910> do<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.090> to

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
frequency is so you could do it to

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.540 
frequency is so you could do it to
yourself<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.870> could<00:02:43.170> apply<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.560> yeah<00:02:43.920> so

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
yourself so you could apply it yeah so

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.210 
yourself so you could apply it yeah so
so<00:02:44.880> this<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.360> totally<00:02:46.260> removed<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:46.800> talking

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
so this is totally removed for talking

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.100 
so this is totally removed for talking
about<00:02:47.310> um<00:02:47.790> but<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.540> high<00:02:48.660> school<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.930> did

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
about um but in high school I did

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.560 
about um but in high school I did
research<00:02:49.440> on<00:02:49.650> these<00:02:49.739> frogs<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.400> had<00:02:51.150> could

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
research on these frogs that had could

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.600 
research on these frogs that had could
hear<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:51.900> really<00:02:52.230> high<00:02:52.440> frequencies<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.519> we

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
hear in really high frequencies so we

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.580 
hear in really high frequencies so we
used<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.970> dissect<00:02:54.120> their<00:02:54.720> inner<00:02:54.900> ear<00:02:55.140> lobes<00:02:55.410> I

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
used to dissect their inner ear lobes I

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.290 
used to dissect their inner ear lobes I
was<00:02:55.709> such<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.920> nerd<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.310> high<00:02:56.340> school<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.850> we

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
was such a nerd in high school and we

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.870 
was such a nerd in high school and we
were<00:02:57.450> trying<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.810> find<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.440> mean<00:02:58.620> yeah<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.610> that's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
were trying to find I mean yeah I that's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.009 
were trying to find I mean yeah I that's
why<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.150> bad<00:03:00.300> vision<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:00.720> it's<00:03:00.840> always<00:03:00.930> a

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
why I have bad vision so it's always a

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.900 
why I have bad vision so it's always a
matter<00:03:01.260> scope<00:03:01.590> but<00:03:01.980> yes<00:03:02.190> we<00:03:02.370> were<00:03:02.430> dissecting

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
matter scope but yes we were dissecting

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.190 
matter scope but yes we were dissecting
their<00:03:03.090> fronts<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.540> their<00:03:03.630> inner<00:03:03.750> ear<00:03:03.959> lobes

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
their fronts and their inner ear lobes

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.660 
their fronts and their inner ear lobes
to<00:03:04.320> figure<00:03:04.530> out<00:03:04.650> what<00:03:04.920> made<00:03:05.160> them<00:03:05.310> be<00:03:05.430> able<00:03:05.610> to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
to figure out what made them be able to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.250 
to figure out what made them be able to
hear<00:03:05.880> these<00:03:06.030> really<00:03:06.269> high<00:03:06.420> frequencies<00:03:06.900> so

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
hear these really high frequencies so

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.900 
hear these really high frequencies so
that<00:03:07.440> we<00:03:07.560> could<00:03:07.739> apply<00:03:07.950> similar<00:03:08.400> mechanisms

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
that we could apply similar mechanisms

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.729 
that we could apply similar mechanisms
to<00:03:09.090> human<00:03:09.360> hearing<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.260> think<00:03:10.410> it's<00:03:10.680> a

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
to human hearing it so I think it's a

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.080 
to human hearing it so I think it's a
similar<00:03:10.950> thing<00:03:11.220> where<00:03:11.370> you're<00:03:11.489> five<00:03:11.700> figuring

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
similar thing where you're five figuring

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.090 
similar thing where you're five figuring
out<00:03:12.239> these<00:03:12.390> like<00:03:12.660> amazing<00:03:13.440> aspects<00:03:13.980> of

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
out these like amazing aspects of

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.340 
out these like amazing aspects of
evolution<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.450> these<00:03:15.600> cats<00:03:15.930> where<00:03:16.170> they've

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
evolution and these cats where they've

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.080 
evolution and these cats where they've
learned<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.070> vibrations<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.970> noise

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
learned that the vibrations of the noise

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.970 
learned that the vibrations of the noise
they<00:03:18.329> make<00:03:18.480> actually<00:03:18.690> build<00:03:19.470> their<00:03:19.709> bones

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
they make actually build their bones

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.190 
they make actually build their bones
back<00:03:20.220> up<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.850> then<00:03:20.940> we're<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.120> wow<00:03:21.209> how<00:03:21.989> kind

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
frequency nate Perret it might not be

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.970 
frequency nate Perret it might not be
that<00:03:48.090> magic<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.959> know<00:03:49.079> that<00:03:49.560> you're<00:03:49.769> very

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980

interested<00:03:50.430> in<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:50.549> cuz<00:03:50.760> mainly<00:03:51.239> during<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
interested in that cuz mainly during the

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.630 
interested in that cuz mainly during the
main<00:03:51.780> show<00:03:51.989> meetings<00:03:52.350> he<00:03:52.620> quite<00:03:53.070> often<00:03:53.250> purse

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640

I<00:03:53.940> don't<00:03:54.209> particularly<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.750> purr<00:03:55.019> but<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.290> do

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
I don't particularly a purr but I do

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.920

think<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.860> might<00:03:56.450> like<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.540> think<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:57.810> that

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
think that might like I think that that

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.020 
think that might like I think that that
is<00:03:58.079> startling<00:03:58.829> Lee<00:03:59.070> like<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.430> cat<00:03:59.820> like<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.570> think

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.949 

so<00:04:06.030> it's<00:04:06.150> good<00:04:06.269> so<00:04:06.420> it's<00:04:06.570> cool<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:06.780> they

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
so it's good so it's cool that they

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.270 
so it's good so it's cool that they
definitely<00:04:07.170> like<00:04:07.500> obviously<00:04:07.829> that<00:04:08.010> seems

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
definitely like obviously that seems

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.039 
definitely like obviously that seems
like<00:04:08.430> something<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.760> they<00:04:09.120> sort<00:04:09.660> of<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.870> just

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
like something that they sort of it just

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.780 
like something that they sort of it just
happened<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.739> be<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.040> case<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.549> then<00:04:11.640> was

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
happened to be the case and then was

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.880 
happened to be the case and then was
selected<00:04:12.180> for<00:04:12.359> because<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.900> cat<00:04:13.079> groups<00:04:13.650> that

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
selected for because the cat groups that

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.319 
selected for because the cat groups that
would<00:04:14.040> have<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.459> would<00:04:14.579> have<00:04:14.730> stronger<00:04:15.180> bones

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
would have it would have stronger bones

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.819 
would have it would have stronger bones
that<00:04:15.540> are<00:04:15.630> but<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:15.810> like<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.229> they<00:04:16.350> help<00:04:16.620> other

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
society I wonder though with that sort

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.119 
society I wonder though with that sort
of<00:04:25.139> therapy<00:04:25.560> how<00:04:25.740> expensive<00:04:26.069> it<00:04:26.370> is<00:04:26.460> per<00:04:26.969> cat

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:36.559 

perfect<00:04:33.650> so<00:04:34.650> that's<00:04:34.800> a<00:04:35.159> sciences<00:04:35.969> explanation

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
perfect so that's a sciences explanation

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.570 
perfect so that's a sciences explanation
for<00:04:36.719> why<00:04:36.900> your<00:04:37.110> cat<00:04:37.379> purrs<00:04:37.740> if<00:04:38.129> you<00:04:38.280> believe

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
for why your cat purrs if you believe

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.100 
for why your cat purrs if you believe
science<00:04:38.819> is<00:04:39.150> wrong<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:39.569> you<00:04:39.659> have<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:39.840> better

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
science is wrong and you have a better

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.929 
science is wrong and you have a better
alternative<00:04:40.710> explanation<00:04:41.699> for<00:04:41.789> why<00:04:41.879> you

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:41.939 
alternative explanation for why you

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.719 
alternative explanation for why you
