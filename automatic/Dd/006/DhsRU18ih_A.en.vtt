00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
large I also felt frustrated because I

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.990 
large I also felt frustrated because I
felt<00:00:54.620> that<00:00:54.830> I<00:00:54.890> needed<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.460> have<00:00:55.640> them<00:00:55.880> in

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.150 
felt that I needed to have them in
chronological<00:00:56.180> order<00:00:56.810> and<00:00:57.200> that<00:00:57.770> drove<00:00:57.980> me

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
chronological order and that drove me

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.550 
chronological order and that drove me
crazy<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:58.820> what's<00:00:59.330> nice<00:00:59.510> is<00:00:59.810> that<00:00:59.840> Emery<00:01:00.440> was

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
crazy so what's nice is that Emery was

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.950 
crazy so what's nice is that Emery was

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
I kind of know roughly I'm going ahead

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.840 
I kind of know roughly I'm going ahead
and<00:02:59.260> filling<00:02:59.590> those<00:02:59.739> in<00:02:59.980> but<00:03:00.580> like<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.790> said

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
and filling those in but like I said

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.000 
and filling those in but like I said
before<00:03:01.000> no<00:03:01.480> pressure<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.590> can<00:03:02.739> do<00:03:02.860> this

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
before no pressure you can do this

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.190 
before no pressure you can do this
however<00:03:03.190> you'd<00:03:03.700> like<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:04.269> think<00:03:04.630> it's<00:03:04.930> awesome

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
however you'd like I think it's awesome

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.490

to<00:03:05.650> be<00:03:05.769> able<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.250> have<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.299> system<00:03:07.840> where<00:03:08.049> at

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
to be able to have a system where at

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.979 
to be able to have a system where at
least<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.829> know<00:03:08.860> where<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:09.730> look<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.209> now<00:03:10.840> that

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
least I know where to look and now that

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.330 
least I know where to look and now that
I'm<00:03:11.079> thinking<00:03:11.260> about<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:11.860> would<00:03:12.220> have

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
I'm thinking about it I would have

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.949 
I'm thinking about it I would have
probably<00:03:12.610> wanted<00:03:13.510> these<00:03:13.660> in<00:03:13.810> alphabetical

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
probably wanted these in alphabetical

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.410 
probably wanted these in alphabetical
order<00:03:14.530> but<00:03:15.100> it's<00:03:15.250> not<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.850> big<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.209> deal<00:03:16.390> to

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
order but it's not that big of a deal to

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.819 
order but it's not that big of a deal to
me<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.930> would<00:03:17.860> suggest<00:03:18.670> if<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:19.570> are<00:03:19.870> putting

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
me I would suggest if you are putting

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.220 
me I would suggest if you are putting
them<00:03:20.980> in<00:03:21.130> rainbow<00:03:22.090> order<00:03:22.269> as<00:03:22.750> far<00:03:22.810> as<00:03:23.110> the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
them in rainbow order as far as the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.680 
them in rainbow order as far as the
folders<00:03:23.680> go<00:03:23.890> like<00:03:24.100> we<00:03:24.370> did<00:03:24.579> then<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.540> could

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
folders go like we did then you could

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.750 
folders go like we did then you could
perhaps<00:03:25.900> alphabetize<00:03:26.890> them<00:03:27.070> as<00:03:27.250> well<00:03:27.430> but

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
perhaps alphabetize them as well but

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.910 
perhaps alphabetize them as well but
it's<00:03:28.360> another<00:03:28.600> one<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:28.840> those<00:03:28.930> things<00:03:29.620> that

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
it's another one of those things that

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.199 
it's another one of those things that
you<00:03:30.340> don't<00:03:30.430> want<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.670> put<00:03:30.760> too<00:03:30.880> much<00:03:30.970> pressure

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
you don't want to put too much pressure

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.330 
you don't want to put too much pressure
on<00:03:31.329> yourself<00:03:31.450> do<00:03:32.230> find<00:03:32.799> what<00:03:32.920> works<00:03:33.040> for<00:03:33.190> you
