from what I've been reading I am going

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.640 
from what I've been reading I am going
to<00:02:08.580> attempt<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:10.459> in<00:02:11.630> this<00:02:12.630> area<00:02:13.140> where<00:02:13.500> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
to attempt to in this area where the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.820 
to attempt to in this area where the
Cato<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.280> growing<00:02:14.849> I'm<00:02:15.660> going<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.200> attempt<00:02:16.680> to

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
Cato is growing I'm going to attempt to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.370 
Cato is growing I'm going to attempt to
add<00:02:17.519> some<00:02:17.940> live<00:02:18.180> sand<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.910> as<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.690> further

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
add some live sand so as to further

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.790 
add some live sand so as to further
increase<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:26.160> natural<00:02:26.910> biological

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
increase the natural biological

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.479 
increase the natural biological
filtering<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.840> hopefully<00:02:30.840> keep<00:02:31.500> my<00:02:31.800> nitrates

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
filtering and hopefully keep my nitrates

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.990 
filtering and hopefully keep my nitrates
or<00:02:32.760> get<00:02:33.150> my<00:02:33.360> nitrates<00:02:34.310> down<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.610> where<00:02:35.819> they

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
or get my nitrates down to where they

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.190 
or get my nitrates down to where they
should<00:02:36.030> be<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.900> consistent<00:02:37.709> basis<00:02:40.700> also<00:02:41.700> I

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
should be on a consistent basis also I

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:55.039 
should be on a consistent basis also I
have<00:02:44.900> ordered<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:47.750> new<00:02:50.930> swc<00:02:51.930> cone<00:02:52.920> skimmer<00:02:54.049> that

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
have ordered a new swc cone skimmer that

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.309 
have ordered a new swc cone skimmer that
I<00:02:55.319> am<00:02:55.650> hoping<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.459> going<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:58.579> get<00:02:59.579> my<00:02:59.819> system<00:03:00.480> to

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
I am hoping is going to get my system to

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.610 
I am hoping is going to get my system to
where<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.650> want<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.720> for<00:03:04.819> future<00:03:05.819> growth

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
where I want it for future growth

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.420 
where I want it for future growth
because<00:03:07.620> right<00:03:07.860> now<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.780> rs80<00:03:09.780> is<00:03:10.430> not

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
because right now the rs80 is not

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.550 
because right now the rs80 is not
sufficient<00:03:12.209> enough<00:03:12.359> for<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.790> well-stocked<00:03:15.560> 90

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
sufficient enough for a well-stocked 90

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.349 
sufficient enough for a well-stocked 90
gallon<00:03:17.069> tank<00:03:18.530> okay<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:19.910> because<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:21.150> the

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
gallon tank okay so because of the

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.720 
gallon tank okay so because of the
limited<00:03:21.870> room<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.530> have<00:03:22.799> in<00:03:23.040> my<00:03:23.190> sump<00:03:23.579> I

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
limited room that I have in my sump I

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.160 
limited room that I have in my sump I
figured<00:03:24.329> that<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.930> would<00:03:25.290> be<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.930> money

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
figured that this would be and the money

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.220 
figured that this would be and the money
because<00:03:29.010> this<00:03:29.250> skimmer<00:03:29.880> was<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.299> pretty<00:03:30.630> good

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
because this skimmer was a pretty good

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.280 
because this skimmer was a pretty good
price<00:03:32.389> considering<00:03:33.389> what<00:03:33.569> you<00:03:33.690> could<00:03:33.989> play

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
price considering what you could play

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.020 
price considering what you could play
for<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.620> skimmer<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.040> I've<00:03:35.310> been<00:03:35.519> doing<00:03:35.790> some

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
for a skimmer and I've been doing some

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.449 
for a skimmer and I've been doing some
research<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:38.420> everybody<00:03:39.420> who<00:03:39.720> has<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.459> really

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
research and everybody who has it really

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.259 
research and everybody who has it really
likes<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.829> of<00:03:43.829> course<00:03:44.190> there<00:03:44.519> is<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.760> live

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
likes it of course there is the live

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.470 
likes it of course there is the live
sand<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.190> am<00:03:47.519> wanting<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.030> use<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:50.480> i

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
sand that I am wanting to use and i

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.640 
sand that I am wanting to use and i
think<00:03:51.720> i'm<00:03:51.810> going<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.019> try<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.350> because<00:03:53.250> of

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
think i'm going to try it because of

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.229 
think i'm going to try it because of
this<00:03:55.650> baffle<00:03:56.370> right<00:03:56.609> here<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:58.970> measured<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.060> and

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
this baffle right here I measured it and

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.559 
this baffle right here I measured it and
it's<00:04:00.389> about<00:04:00.690> six<00:04:01.170> inches

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
it's about six inches

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.449 
it's about six inches
so<00:04:02.870> what<00:04:03.379> I'm<00:04:03.530> thinking<00:04:03.560> is<00:04:04.099> I'm<00:04:04.249> probably

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
so what I'm thinking is I'm probably

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.569 
so what I'm thinking is I'm probably
going<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.790> try<00:04:04.969> to<00:04:04.999> give<00:04:05.329> for<00:04:05.959> maybe<00:04:06.889> four<00:04:07.310> and

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
going to try to give for maybe four and

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.489 
going to try to give for maybe four and
a<00:04:07.609> half<00:04:07.639> inches<00:04:08.269> of<00:04:08.900> live<00:04:09.530> sand<00:04:10.069> in<00:04:10.930> this<00:04:11.930> area

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:12.499 
a half inches of live sand in this area

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.479 
a half inches of live sand in this area
and<00:04:12.709> from<00:04:13.280> there<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.879> goes<00:04:14.060> back<00:04:14.540> about

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
and from there it goes back about

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.650 
and from there it goes back about
thirteen<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:16.519> a<00:04:16.759> half<00:04:16.789> inches<00:04:18.849> or<00:04:19.849> even<00:04:20.570> a

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
thirteen and a half inches or even a

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.589 
thirteen and a half inches or even a
little<00:04:20.690> bit<00:04:21.019> more<00:04:21.380> than<00:04:21.440> that<00:04:22.180> so<00:04:23.180> I'm<00:04:23.539> going

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
little bit more than that so I'm going

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.589 
little bit more than that so I'm going
to<00:04:24.050> attempt<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.530> do<00:04:24.830> that<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.520> I'm<00:04:26.360> going<00:04:26.509> to

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
to attempt to do that and I'm going to

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.020 
to attempt to do that and I'm going to
have<00:04:26.750> to<00:04:26.780> as<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.889> can<00:04:28.039> probably<00:04:28.310> see<00:04:28.610> them<00:04:28.910> and

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
have to as you can probably see them and

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.610 
have to as you can probably see them and
have<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.360> lower<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:30.280> rate<00:04:31.280> of<00:04:32.169> water<00:04:33.169> going

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
have to lower the rate of water going

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.610 
have to lower the rate of water going
through<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:34.400> up<00:04:34.669> so<00:04:35.000> it's<00:04:35.180> not<00:04:35.360> as<00:04:35.630> as<00:04:36.229> heavy

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
through this up so it's not as as heavy

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.560 
through this up so it's not as as heavy
so<00:04:36.949> it<00:04:37.099> doesn't<00:04:37.460> blow<00:04:37.699> all<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:38.960> sand<00:04:39.289> around

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
so it doesn't blow all the sand around

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.219 
so it doesn't blow all the sand around
so<00:04:41.570> that's<00:04:41.810> my<00:04:42.020> project<00:04:42.650> for<00:04:42.860> today<00:04:44.229> I'll

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
so that's my project for today I'll

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.510 
so that's my project for today I'll
probably<00:04:45.530> give<00:04:46.099> you<00:04:46.310> another<00:04:46.639> quick<00:04:47.180> little

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
probably give you another quick little

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:56.650 
probably give you another quick little
video<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:50.680> show<00:04:53.320> what<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.820> skimmer<00:04:55.820> is<00:04:55.970> doing

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
video to show what the skimmer is doing

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.330 
video to show what the skimmer is doing
as<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:58.490> starts<00:04:58.880> breaking<00:04:59.180> in<00:04:59.720> and<00:05:00.160> things<00:05:01.160> of

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
as it starts breaking in and things of

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.909 
as it starts breaking in and things of
that<00:05:01.370> nature<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:02.509> this<00:05:03.199> is<00:05:03.229> Wesley<00:05:03.710> for

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
that nature so this is Wesley for

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.130 
that nature so this is Wesley for
signing<00:05:04.370> out<00:05:04.550> and<00:05:05.830> I'll<00:05:06.830> see<00:05:06.979> you<00:05:07.099> later
