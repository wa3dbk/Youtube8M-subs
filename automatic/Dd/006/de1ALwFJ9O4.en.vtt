the years our Primrose I have come to
respect<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.530> fact<00:04:56.800> that<00:04:56.950> not<00:04:57.610> only<00:04:57.880> is<00:04:58.120> nature

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.600 
respect the fact that not only is nature
a<00:04:58.600> great<00:04:58.930> support<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.530> our<00:04:59.680> growing<00:05:00.040> system

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
a great support to our growing system

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.540
