because I think if you feel like you
take<00:05:48.250> this<00:05:48.430> one<00:05:48.669> you're<00:05:49.330> a<00:05:49.360> little<00:05:49.840> bit

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
take this one you're a little bit

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.000 
take this one you're a little bit
vulnerable<00:05:50.410> to<00:05:51.160> UM<00:05:52.110> twink<00:05:53.110> crosses<00:05:53.740> and
