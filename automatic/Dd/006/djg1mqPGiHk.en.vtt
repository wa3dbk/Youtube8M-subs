00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.610
 we put in place this guitar 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.469
 will have been the floor of a cellar for 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:18.320
 some of you think that once there are 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.320
 to remove the strings that are a little crazy 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.440
 some say that we must not cut 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.170
 because a photo that you washed then 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:30.860
 among the halos we quietly remove the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.860
 pio ii the very technical name of this 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:47.640
 definitely a little dusty you clean 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.569
 the keyboard with spots 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.859
 of various colors the small spoon 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:58.769
 light center 0 no line does not make arms 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:02.280
 can clean both the keyboard well 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:05.940
 even in long texts the key becomes 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.880
 decidedly more polished and at the keyboard 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.960
 clean has always been created in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.549
 perpendicular to the keyboard axis e 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.549
 now let's hope for some discussion 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.229
 here we find the pipe cover not 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.939
 you are a bar that serves as a trap 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.790
 adjust the handle looks we put 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:52.799
 agree and so you can clean then 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:55.729
 we see a little air today I offer costs 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.729
 little and okay 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:12.920
 so for me you don't absolve a little 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.600
 hitchhiking or lauren avoids opening up e 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.220
 now it's five minutes now 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.220
 let's take it right 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.760
 a bit in paris is so we also remove the 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.900
 patina that is above the soundboard 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:55.519
 poor view to you six days from 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:03:01.159
 excess of today we begin to put them 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.510
 things but our nature the saying pirlo 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.049
 before 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.340
 a nature is born but now it stands for it 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:21.079
 ok pratino means inside you vasco 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:27.949
 on the groove holding it and blunt 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:30.379
 the head of his teacher's children but 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:34.989
 I'm only on customer and good when 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.989
 initiative can understand them ordinary topic 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.140
 it is peculiar when it must 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.580
 put the rope because normally 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.820
 almost all put the rope like this 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.820
 pometino 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:53.170
 but there is a way to be method 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:58.960
 and do not forget life at last the rope 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:06.520
 in the inner part of the aim to do 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:10.210
 turn behind came under a bit the 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.970
 pull back he asked and he blocks them 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:18.100
 a rope makes a small year of a thing 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:22.620
 from there it does not split with a little is done 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.620
 a little draw the deal 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.090
 let's see some 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.300
 this is a bit you are a little bit of 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.300
 less because they have not been soiled 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.750
 that we do not give peace now we cut the i 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.750
 hair 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.360
 someone likes to keep them long 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:04.310
 in the other we can still play one 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:08.800
 however, it can be lowered at the bar 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.800
 among these is this curious system in 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.639
 58 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.170
 but there is the television has forgotten 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.289
 historical purpose 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.289
 when it stops 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.720
 the bombs 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.630
 because I don't do it old because I don't 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.250
 precisely then there are very few who 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.760
 they have it 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:47.570
 then we see fly coming too 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.570
 the soul within branches 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:06:04.780
 a little too pulled to miss you take 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:04.780
 the key we don't end up for we want 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:16.300
 together we put them on the nice lid 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:33.430
 are so many notes admonished while with 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.430
 this is done
