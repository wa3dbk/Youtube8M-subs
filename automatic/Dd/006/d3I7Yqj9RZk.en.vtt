00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:22.439
 Today I will tell you how to come to the 2 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:30.480
 I have recently concluded myself 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:36.420
 computer and I myself why so oh well 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:40.260
 Here now we must first go to the start then 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.469
 find a computer here you see here it is right 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:49.590
 click on it and click on these 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:55.350

 64-bit operating system and 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.700
 assessment of computer memory too well and then 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.140
 I have a gaming computer so 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.060
 how to avoid the fact that the computer itself 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.200
 turns off you need to go to the additional 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.000
 parameter here are additional parameters 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.220
 left click to find 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.110

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:31.070
 information those parameters but there is 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.750
 system failure he to the assistant 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.820
 three ticks at first are not all 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.240
 perform automatic reboot then 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.250
 there you have to uncheck like this i 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.510

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:50.530
 push the rest you touch nothing 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:54.100
 this one 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:02:02.350
 The second reason is that you can 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:03.010
 drivers can fly and sometimes can 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.369
 get out 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:12.490
