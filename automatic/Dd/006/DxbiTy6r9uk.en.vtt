working on the VB 101 in 2006 and we

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.010 
working on the VB 101 in 2006 and we
could<00:01:42.190> see<00:01:42.340> early<00:01:42.729> on<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.390> concept<00:01:43.840> was

very promising

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.420 
very promising
we<00:01:45.549> started<00:01:46.030> within<00:01:46.690> a<00:01:46.810> few<00:01:47.020> month<00:01:47.229> with<00:01:48.070> an

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
we started within a few month with an

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.080 
we started within a few month with an
ugly-looking<00:01:49.440> prototype<00:01:50.440> but<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.670> difficult

ugly-looking prototype but the difficult

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.380 
ugly-looking prototype but the difficult
part<00:01:52.300> was<00:01:52.539> to<00:01:53.110> get<00:01:53.679> an<00:01:53.950> actual<00:01:54.130> product<00:01:54.759> from

that prototype and my goal was to

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.630 
that prototype and my goal was to
