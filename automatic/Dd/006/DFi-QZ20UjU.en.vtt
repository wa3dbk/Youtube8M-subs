I had no idea how intrusive people who

just<00:02:49.980> something<00:02:50.760> something<00:02:51.600> that's<00:02:51.780> not

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
just something something that's not

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.660 
just something something that's not
allowed<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.970> one<00:02:54.720> way<00:02:54.930> around<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:56.280> to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
allowed so one way around that is to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.510 
allowed so one way around that is to
live<00:02:59.670> on<00:03:00.210> land<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:01.140> already<00:03:01.650> has<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.130> primary

live on land it already has a primary
structure<00:03:04.130> which<00:03:05.130> means<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.970> shows<00:03:06.210> up

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
structure which means that it shows up

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.020 
structure which means that it shows up
to<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:08.040> well<00:03:08.370> septic<00:03:10.190> electricity<00:03:11.190> whatever

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030

sign<00:03:12.480> up<00:03:12.720> that's<00:03:13.080> not<00:03:13.380> all<00:03:13.560> great<00:03:14.420> but<00:03:15.740> let's

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
sign up that's not all great but let's

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.040 
sign up that's not all great but let's
say<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.100> land<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.700> two<00:03:18.150> acres<00:03:19.550> then<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:21.750> could

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
say the land is two acres then you could

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.850 
say the land is two acres then you could
subdivide<00:03:22.740> it<00:03:23.630> not<00:03:24.630> legally<00:03:25.140> for<00:03:25.470> us<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.830> know

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
subdivide it not legally for us you know

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.590 
subdivide it not legally for us you know
subdivide<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.940> rent<00:03:27.870> out<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:29.760> property<00:03:30.300> and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
subdivide it rent out the property and

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.020 
subdivide it rent out the property and
you<00:03:31.350> can<00:03:31.500> live<00:03:31.680> on<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.980> other<00:03:32.160> half<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.490> the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
you can live on the other half of the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.160 
you can live on the other half of the
property<00:03:33.510> off<00:03:33.690> with<00:03:33.990> your<00:03:34.530> preferred<00:03:35.130> s

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
having the loophole option actually

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.610 
having the loophole option actually
helps<00:03:40.850> because<00:03:41.850> there<00:03:42.630> will<00:03:42.840> be<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.020> well<00:03:43.320> and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
helps because there will be a well and

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.530 
helps because there will be a well and
will<00:03:43.950> be<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.160> septic<00:03:44.670> because<00:03:45.030> there<00:03:45.330> is<00:03:45.510> a

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
will be a septic because there is a

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.380 
will be a septic because there is a
primary<00:03:46.230> structure<00:03:46.890> there<00:03:47.100> already<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.760> could

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
primary structure there already I could

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.460 
primary structure there already I could
just<00:03:48.540> hire<00:03:48.780> someone<00:03:49.200> to<00:03:49.620> tap<00:03:50.070> into<00:03:50.400> those

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
just hire someone to tap into those

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.380 
just hire someone to tap into those
utilities<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.770> be<00:03:53.310> able<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.730> use<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.209> well

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
utilities and be able to use the well

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.100 
utilities and be able to use the well
and<00:03:54.630> septic<00:03:55.410> along<00:03:55.950> with<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.280> tenant<00:03:57.770> also

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
and septic along with the tenant also

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.540 
and septic along with the tenant also
because<00:04:01.110> I'm<00:04:01.560> going<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:01.950> be<00:04:02.040> running<00:04:02.280> the

because I'm going to be running the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.180 
because I'm going to be running the
place<00:04:02.760> out<00:04:02.970> that's<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.690> level<00:04:04.050> of<00:04:04.260> income<00:04:04.530> that

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
place out that's a level of income that

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.130 
place out that's a level of income that
I<00:04:05.640> don't<00:04:06.360> have<00:04:06.450> currently<00:04:07.670> so<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:09.240> also<00:04:09.540> will

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
I don't have currently so that also will

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.449 
I don't have currently so that also will
be<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.650> benefit<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:12.209> although<00:04:12.959> it<00:04:13.830> seems<00:04:14.280> like

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
be a benefit so although it seems like

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.390 
be a benefit so although it seems like
I'm<00:04:14.640> jumping<00:04:15.150> through<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.840> hoop<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.890> make<00:04:17.220> this

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
I'm jumping through a hoop to make this

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.300 
I'm jumping through a hoop to make this
happen<00:04:17.730> in<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.450> long<00:04:18.690> run<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:19.230> think<00:04:19.290> it<00:04:19.859> will

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
happen in the long run I think it will

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.870 
happen in the long run I think it will
help<00:04:20.730> me<00:04:20.970> out<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.770> just<00:04:22.770> think<00:04:23.010> if<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.640> ever

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
help me out and just think if I ever

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.300 
help me out and just think if I ever
decide<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:25.260> know<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.410> no<00:04:25.620> longer<00:04:25.919> want<00:04:26.250> to

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
decide that you know I no longer want to

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.270 
decide that you know I no longer want to
live<00:04:26.460> in<00:04:26.520> RV<00:04:27.200> I<00:04:28.200> don't<00:04:28.590> have<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.950> renew<00:04:29.250> the

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
live in RV I don't have to renew the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.820 
live in RV I don't have to renew the
lease<00:04:29.640> and<00:04:29.940> there<00:04:30.600> is<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:31.110> property<00:04:31.740> that

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
lease and there is a property that

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.610 
lease and there is a property that
belongs<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.400> music<00:04:32.880> so<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:33.840> could<00:04:34.080> move<00:04:34.380> into

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
belongs to music so I could move into

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:42.790 
belongs to music so I could move into
that<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:35.850> it<00:04:36.300> seems<00:04:36.930> like<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.200> good<00:04:37.470> plan

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.999 

here<00:04:43.639> is<00:04:43.970> that<00:04:44.210> although<00:04:44.479> I<00:04:44.629> love<00:04:45.169> travelling

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
here is that although I love travelling

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.580 
here is that although I love travelling
in<00:04:46.220> my<00:04:46.400> eyeliner<00:04:46.849> maybe<00:04:47.599> this<00:04:47.960> little<00:04:48.139> too

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
in my eyeliner maybe this little too

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.159 
in my eyeliner maybe this little too
small<00:04:48.830> delivered<00:04:49.370> maybe<00:04:50.120> it<00:04:50.419> will<00:04:50.629> hold<00:04:50.930> up

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
small delivered maybe it will hold up

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.430 
small delivered maybe it will hold up
well<00:04:51.470> in<00:04:51.500> fair<00:04:52.159> weather<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:53.389> those<00:04:53.990> are<00:04:54.020> other

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
well in fair weather so those are other

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.920 
well in fair weather so those are other
things<00:04:54.800> that<00:04:54.919> I<00:04:55.039> have<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.460> consider<00:04:55.879> so<00:04:56.300> if<00:04:56.599> you

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
things that I have to consider so if you

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.580 
things that I have to consider so if you
checked<00:04:57.650> out<00:04:57.830> from<00:04:58.900> another<00:04:59.900> video<00:05:00.289> i<00:05:00.349> did

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
checked out from another video i did

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.180 
checked out from another video i did
recently<00:05:01.009> you'll<00:05:01.669> see<00:05:02.000> that<00:05:02.210> I<00:05:02.419> am

recently you'll see that I am

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.850 
recently you'll see that I am
researching<00:05:04.190> on<00:05:04.940> larger<00:05:05.870> living<00:05:06.139> structures

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860
