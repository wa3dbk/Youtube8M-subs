tripod you probably should not use it
somewhat<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.630> tripod<00:01:43.350> here

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
somewhat so this is the tripod here

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.060 
somewhat so this is the tripod here
kinda<00:01:44.070> deal<00:01:44.329> has<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.659> kind<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.070> handily

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
kinda deal has this kind of handily

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.039 
kinda deal has this kind of handily
thing<00:01:47.520> honestly<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.540> don't<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.960> call

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
thing honestly I don't know what to call

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.880 
thing honestly I don't know what to call
it<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.670> for<00:01:50.670> panning<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.540> tilting<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.799> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
it but for panning and tilting it's a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.510 
it but for panning and tilting it's a
fluid<00:01:53.250> head<00:01:53.520> video<00:01:54.299> tripod<00:01:55.430> fluid<00:01:56.430> is

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
fluid head video tripod fluid is

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.480 
fluid head video tripod fluid is
generally<00:01:57.030> used<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.240> video<00:01:57.740> but<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.950> think<00:01:59.430> it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
generally used for video but I think it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.310 
generally used for video but I think it

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.700 
undone just kind of see if we can get an
idea<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.420> scale

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
idea of the scale

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:24.470 
idea of the scale
of<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:14.460> tripods<00:02:15.180> height<00:02:16.020> limits<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:23.480> you're

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
of this tripods height limits so you're

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.060 
of this tripods height limits so you're
pretty<00:02:24.720> far<00:02:24.930> down<00:02:25.820> on<00:02:26.820> all<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.180> legs<00:02:28.070> they're

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
pretty far down on all the legs they're

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.380 
pretty far down on all the legs they're
not<00:02:29.190> locked<00:02:29.460> in<00:02:29.610> right<00:02:29.790> now<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.120> it'll<00:02:30.270> look

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
not locked in right now so it'll look

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.020 
not locked in right now so it'll look
really<00:02:30.570> wobbly<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:32.160> about<00:02:32.370> how<00:02:32.490> far<00:02:32.790> and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
really wobbly but it's about how far and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.170 
really wobbly but it's about how far and
to<00:02:33.570> give<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.780> an<00:02:33.840> idea<00:02:34.130> it's<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.610> far<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
to give you an idea it's that far to the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.560 
to give you an idea it's that far to the
head<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:38.220> right<00:02:38.700> five<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.330> half<00:02:39.360> feet<00:02:40.010> total

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
head so right five and a half feet total

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.270 
head so right five and a half feet total
yeah<00:02:42.570> no<00:02:42.750> tripod<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.200> unbox<00:02:43.680> things<00:02:43.920> are<00:02:44.070> a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
yeah no tripod on unbox things are a

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.940 
yeah no tripod on unbox things are a
little<00:02:44.400> bit<00:02:44.580> messy<00:02:44.940> because<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:46.680> hard<00:02:46.890> to

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
little bit messy because it's hard to

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.790 
little bit messy because it's hard to
get<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.160> all<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.520> frame<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:49.290> way<00:02:49.380> I'm<00:02:49.500> doing<00:02:49.710> my

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
get it all in frame the way I'm doing my

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.580 
get it all in frame the way I'm doing my
videos<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.760> know<00:02:51.140> still<00:02:52.140> an<00:02:52.620> unboxing

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
videos but you know still an unboxing

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.250 
videos but you know still an unboxing
nonetheless<00:02:55.590> we<00:02:58.520> go<00:02:59.520> so<00:03:00.210> yeah<00:03:00.450> that's<00:03:00.810> kind<00:03:01.170> of

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
nonetheless we go so yeah that's kind of

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.600 
nonetheless we go so yeah that's kind of
my<00:03:01.440> unboxing<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.720> kind<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.900> general<00:03:04.610> look

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
my unboxing and kind of general look

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.320

link in the description probably and

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.770 
link in the description probably and
yeah<00:03:22.230> it's<00:03:22.590> just<00:03:22.770> kind<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.010> their<00:03:23.220> compact

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
yeah it's just kind of their compact

yeah it's just kind of their compact
take<00:03:24.780> on<00:03:25.050> how<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> tripod<00:03:25.950> should<00:03:26.160> be<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:27.110> there

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
take on how a tripod should be so there

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.270 
take on how a tripod should be so there
it<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.320> i'll<00:03:28.530> probably<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.830> using<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.130> one

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
it is i'll probably be using this one

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.470 
it is i'll probably be using this one
all<00:03:29.370> my<00:03:29.520> videos<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:29.850> maybe<00:03:30.210> it'll<00:03:30.360> be<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.450> little

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
all my videos so maybe it'll be a little

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.330 
all my videos so maybe it'll be a little
more<00:03:30.690> stable<00:03:30.930> i<00:03:31.320> can<00:03:31.770> move<00:03:31.890> around<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.280> little

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
more stable i can move around a little

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.430 
more stable i can move around a little
bit<00:03:32.520> more<00:03:32.670> have<00:03:32.850> better<00:03:33.030> angles<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:34.260> yeah

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
bit more have better angles so yeah

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.900 
bit more have better angles so yeah
