and he knows more about what's going on

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.640 
and he knows more about what's going on
than<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.590> do<00:03:13.769> but<00:03:14.900> he<00:03:15.900> tells<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.500> gives

than you do but he tells you it gives
you<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:16.890> vision<00:03:17.760> ability<00:03:18.300> and<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:19.140> vision

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
you a vision ability and that vision

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.300 
you a vision ability and that vision
ability<00:03:19.830> is<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.430> 8<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.209> 16-bit<00:03:21.870> switch<00:03:22.769> that

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
ability is the 8 and 16-bit switch that

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.330 
ability is the 8 and 16-bit switch that
we're<00:03:23.459> talking<00:03:24.180> about<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.799> portal

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
we're talking about and so this portal

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.600 
we're talking about and so this portal
dimension<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:28.019> can<00:03:28.170> see<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:29.280> effect

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
dimension you can see the the effect

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.940 
dimension you can see the the effect
where<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.360> switch<00:03:30.720> between<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.350> worlds<00:03:31.769> and

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
where you switch between the worlds and

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.949 
where you switch between the worlds and
it's<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.110> see<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:35.780> inspiration<00:03:36.780> from

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
it's you can see the inspiration from

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.170 
it's you can see the inspiration from
cartridge<00:03:37.680> games<00:03:38.010> with<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.430> corruption

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
cartridge games with the corruption

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.160 
cartridge games with the corruption
glitches<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:40.080> pop<00:03:40.709> up<00:03:41.000> so<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.390> the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
glitches that pop up so the the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.229 
glitches that pop up so the the
different<00:03:43.590> worlds<00:03:44.130> are<00:03:44.280> are<00:03:45.170> parallel<00:03:46.190> so

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
different worlds are are parallel so

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.790 
different worlds are are parallel so
it's

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
it's

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.390 
it's
a<00:03:48.890> multi-dimensional<00:03:49.820> reality<00:03:50.270> and<00:03:51.400> right

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
a multi-dimensional reality and right

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.710 
a multi-dimensional reality and right
now<00:03:52.580> you<00:03:53.060> can<00:03:53.210> see<00:03:54.670> Boyd<00:03:55.670> has<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.150> ability<00:03:56.540> to

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
now you can see Boyd has the ability to

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.530 
now you can see Boyd has the ability to
switch<00:03:57.170> between<00:03:57.440> them<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:58.010> will<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.540> it

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
switch between them it will and it

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.690 
switch between them it will and it
completely<00:04:00.170> changes<00:04:00.800> how<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.340> game<00:04:01.520> plays

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
completely changes how the game plays

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.590 
completely changes how the game plays
and<00:04:02.560> all<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:04.130> enemies<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:05.030> can<00:04:05.210> see<00:04:05.360> there

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
and all the enemies you can see there

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.600 
and all the enemies you can see there
they're<00:04:05.900> affected<00:04:06.350> just<00:04:06.560> as<00:04:06.680> well<00:04:06.830> as<00:04:07.070> as<00:04:07.370> much

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
they're affected just as well as as much

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.720 
they're affected just as well as as much
as<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:07.970> are<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:08.870> in<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.290> 16-bit<00:04:10.190> world<00:04:10.580> you

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
as you are so in the 16-bit world you

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.400 
as you are so in the 16-bit world you
can<00:04:10.850> see<00:04:10.970> you've<00:04:11.270> run<00:04:11.540> faster<00:04:12.020> you<00:04:12.140> can<00:04:12.200> do

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
can see you've run faster you can do

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.280 
can see you've run faster you can do
combos<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:14.030> reasons<00:04:14.390> you<00:04:14.480> switch<00:04:14.870> between

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
combos the reasons you switch between

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.970 
combos the reasons you switch between
the<00:04:15.680> worlds<00:04:16.010> are<00:04:16.239> for<00:04:17.239> for<00:04:18.019> combat<00:04:18.470> reasons

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
the worlds are for for combat reasons

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.420 
the worlds are for for combat reasons
and<00:04:19.250> also<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:21.590> can<00:04:21.709> see<00:04:21.859> there's<00:04:22.040> there's

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
and also you can see there's there's

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.520 
and also you can see there's there's
puzzles<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:23.140> they're<00:04:24.140> dependent<00:04:24.740> on<00:04:24.890> the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
puzzles that they're dependent on the

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
puzzles that they're dependent on the
differences<00:04:27.530> in<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.830> world<00:04:28.010> so<00:04:28.310> for<00:04:28.490> example

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
differences in the world so for example

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.140 
differences in the world so for example
for<00:04:29.450> this<00:04:29.600> one<00:04:29.780> if<00:04:30.020> he<00:04:30.170> was<00:04:30.290> in<00:04:30.440> 8-bit<00:04:31.150> he

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
for this one if he was in 8-bit he

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.490 
for this one if he was in 8-bit he
wouldn't<00:04:32.390> be<00:04:32.450> fast<00:04:32.690> enough<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:32.990> make<00:04:33.200> it<00:04:33.320> over

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
wouldn't be fast enough to make it over

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:43.210 
wouldn't be fast enough to make it over
that<00:04:33.530> bridge<00:04:36.790> you<00:04:37.790> can<00:04:37.940> see<00:04:38.090> do<00:04:38.930> do<00:04:39.050> do<00:04:39.380> but<00:04:42.220> so

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
that bridge you can see do do do but so

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.140 
that bridge you can see do do do but so
when<00:04:43.790> he<00:04:43.880> switches<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:45.160> 16-bit<00:04:46.160> world<00:04:46.550> you

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
when he switches to the 16-bit world you

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.570 
when he switches to the 16-bit world you
can<00:04:47.300> see<00:04:47.450> that<00:04:47.630> he<00:04:48.500> can<00:04:48.680> run<00:04:49.190> right<00:04:49.460> across

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
can see that he can run right across

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.600 
can see that he can run right across
there<00:04:50.060> he's<00:04:50.570> get<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:50.960> other<00:04:51.050> side<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:52.520> we

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
there he's get to the other side and we

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.280 
there he's get to the other side and we
have<00:04:52.730> other<00:04:52.940> obstacles<00:04:53.600> of<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.750> game<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:54.169> can

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
have other obstacles of the game you can

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.140
