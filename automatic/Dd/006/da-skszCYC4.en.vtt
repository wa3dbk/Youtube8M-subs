00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:20.160
 not talking guys goalkeeper chem sporting 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.890
 I was quiet home, I feel good rain. 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.130
 Finished, the workout ended up finding 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.779
 Why are you waiting now to rest? 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.940
 and time and other games 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.430
 So while I was thinking, I'm going 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.489
 make a video then when I 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.160
 I'm doing nothing 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.260
 so I decided to make a video explaining 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.020
 something a lot of people ask here 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.510
 for me and for a lot of people it's so simple 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.710
 that the mechanics of the church that is the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.500
 ax 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:01.670
 So, people, explain that the next one. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.860
 brazil's attack will cause cause a bonus 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.100
 all the while giving every time you 're with 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.400
 ax will cause a bonus according to 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.409
 with your basic attack sooner 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.330
 you have more damage in yourself but also 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.720
 will cause 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.880
 and with that he will exchange his passive 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.030
 that the hits I write will cause 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.970
 that from dealing physical damage 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.299
 second every time the game is registered but 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.220
 has this ax business that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.920
 When are you with an ax that is the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.030
 that the enemy you leave he sang 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.460
 passive 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.270
 you can always see that you hit the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.110
 Axe 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.040
 you leave part of the enemy explained 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.840
 I do not think it is that this is a bonus of 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.250
 according to an attack attack 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.960
 physicist 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.979
 Now we will teach the mechanics of it okay 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.920
 got an ax 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.799
 I stand out 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.369
 Why do you think that when you have 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.570
 ax stopped he goes next door does not have 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.690
 explanation 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.750
 That's why you 're such an ax. 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.170
 is not stopped did not move 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.340
 has a chance of him falling to the side 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.319
 When I'm talking I really like 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.330
 smoking is moving me exactly to 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.879
 do not let that happen to you 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.129
 the voice stops here and goes 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.489
 oil goes up down does not have 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.620
 how to know then it does not happen 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.590
 that you lost ax 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.239
 I really like the type day attack if 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.430
 move to the side that I want 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.349
 it falls just so you will not be the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.630
 wild side 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.099
 So you're going to attack, will you move? 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.920
 attacked 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.260
 I was going down the track of hunting cuf 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.510
 Prace Machado Mark up does not have 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.430
 mystery attacked went down 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.280
 You can not expect the ax rock in the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.079
 And that's going to happen, and that's going to happen. 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.750
 wait and down 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.239
 have to strike before the ax strikes 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.500
 or at the mall with which you 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.069
 will move 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.959
 attacked was taken down from the curve to 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.329
 the right took the curve to the left 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.650
 that is why, when 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.139
 I'm talking about treme 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.269
 I always try to keep moving so I will not 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.120
 happen to the ax heel stopped and 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.410
 he fell on the kaka side and he fell to 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.660
 back to fall up understood 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.420
 it's more or less this was mechanical attacked 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:39.310
 other hand ask how it was back 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:43.329
 took the cup so far will forgive and 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.980
 I hope you have learned this 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.769
 simple mechanical drive 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.700
 which for many people is not simple and 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:55.730
 many people ask and if this video was 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.459
 Even though I'm really happy, I'm really happy. 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.230
 time now to make a better video but in 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.200
 I'm going to do tutorials on how to 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.360
 catch concert sandri and carlos 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.129
 alexandre plus some more things 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:13.069
 advanced drive as well as some 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.950
 Federal ithaca tricks is the trophy 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.019
 ax these things ahead I 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.049
 I'll do it more calmly but now it's gone. 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.720
 only this but that this explanation of here 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.949
 mechanics than training and 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.680
 this was the last facebook and if 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:33.229
 What a day that morale is and what 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.039
 from now on I'll post you can 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.900
 everything there doing the video on youtube 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:43.479
 championship that pj and etc 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.479
 I hope to have helped in the
