00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.539
 m 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.839
 hello when I signed to valÃ©rie letard coordinator the garden of the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:16.539
 concrete 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.580
 we're about to do twenty Gironde, so I'm afraid 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.910
 the association was not welcoming in a service rsa some goods 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.349
 whose beneficiaries of social minima 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.890
 and for we have to set up collective gardens inhabitants out of six have 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.199
 socially 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.330
 it's the first garden on the roof of a gymnasium 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.520
 % and everything works collectively ie everything is up to everyone 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.210
 from above but nothing is to anyone dies that's really the idea of 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.810
 collective for precisely breaking only clicks 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.630
 soon after that individualistic society allowed me that the 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.380
 people work together 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.410
 meet 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.820
 creates one-to-one links opens on the outside the finality 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.800
 is not the garden tonight but it's really percent 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.340
 it helps to improve the situation of some people they are prosecuted 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.060
 ouf oriented garden after ah it is a place of social mix in 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.350
 track locals are welcome 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.010
 so there are people too 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.810
 who live in the neighborhood who are more socially inserted and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.730
 professionally but who share moments of gardening workshops with 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.240
 groups of people oriented by social workers 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.790
 so that's it's very enriching for each other and it allows 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.350
 a certain social mix 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.350
 the garden is intercultural intergenerational 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.990
 so percent and it suits anyone so even if you have a 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.240
 train very low levels of qualification everyone has memories of 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.640
 gardening in connection with his family the children my discovering level 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.810
 teaching how plants and vegetables grow and that it was rare 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.810
 so it's a universal support is great 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.990
 we can plant organic vegetables 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.470
 that some people share then 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.800
 flowers aromatics points 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.930
 fruit trees actually in May the trees one year it's better because the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.870
 deadlines ratings could still end up doing damage and we 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.210
 we still have a gym below upstream that needs to be done 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.580
 Warning 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.060
 it's a temptation at ease so the lasagna that it's known knows that 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.790
 we will create the ground above the ground it is not good he made this announcement 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.329
 so we decided to put a box over 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.030
 and then we will create the soil with garden waste or coarse finer 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:18.919
 my youngest 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:23.929
 and in the end mature compost and we will plant directly in you go 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.519
 see lots of things flowers and vegetables 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.499
 a hodgepodge because that's what's fun and pestering it's not 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.459
 good 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.099
 it is if the future may have already sounded what the inhabitants whose 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.089
 Parisians like the other inhabitants of the cities 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:41.869
 the lack of green space wishes to become an actor also of their plots 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:43.009
 of gardens 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.539
 so actually for a few years we are witnessing a multiplication 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:47.339
 shared gardens already 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.739
 and for that to come it would be the roofs of a cloakroom and roofing and 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:50.779
 terraces
