00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Why is buying coins for doing so and 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.259
 because it 's infos dotcom has the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 better prices to be able to buy 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.140
 envelopes for the world cup and if not also 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.820
 can you use to make those equipment 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.260
 impressive in football and beijing already 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.260
 that players so pulled by price 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.220
 welcome from channel here we are a 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.600
 more time in a new video as you are 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.610
 reading the title we have a new 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.830
 custom tactic in this case is my 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.060
 custom tactic preferred green 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.980
 I did not want to thank you because 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.270
 you really collaborated a lot in 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.010
 the previous videos had said that if 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.180
 You wanted to share my tactics with 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.800
 to put the comments and 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.239
 really all of you have wanted 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.130
 to share this kind of tactics that 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.290
 I have then I have a few and what 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.760
 what I'm going to do is a miniseries 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.050
 presenting all of them really 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.100
 speaking a little of them to what 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.390
 teams will go better to what 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.790
 players we will be able to apply 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.010
 as initialist these series also and 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.780
 series with my preferred tactic really 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.610
 is the one that I use the most is always 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.560
 I carry is when I start games and I do not eat 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.750
 the fast and curious so is the one that is 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.759
 I almost always use as I tell you 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.700
 700 and peak matches won at ultimate 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.860
 team and in those 700 500 have been when 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.050
 tactical house is a tactic for 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.670
 extremely slow players of 76 from 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.759
 rhythm in the middle of the field and then 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.740
 with a great pass of 90 and pico 80 and something 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.360
 up with players like xavi 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.550
 iniesta and all these as you are seeing 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.290
 let's go to customize edit teams 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.610
 and it will give us a choice of address 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.020
 of the team where we are going to be able to do 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.770
 all this kind of things modify everything 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.200
 all everything 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.969
 and then take the ultimate in going 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.890
 to catch FC Barcelona because after 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.619
 really when it comes to selecting the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.670
 tactic will appear fc.barcelona 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.289
 default or customized and 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.549
 we will take the customized and 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.649
 we take the world's color zone to 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.850
 remember that it is the tiki taka and 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.679
 as he already told us was with players 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.840
 extremely slow but with a large 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.979
 pass and for this as they are slow not 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.780
 let's catch a game speed 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.159
 extreme or we are going to try that the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.600
 players do not leave unchecked 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.729
 crazy but you see that now football 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.350
 70 and spike up and you notice that 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.030
 the red balls are unmarked 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.679
 continually do not want that no 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.899
 we want an organized game a game 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.780
 slow or touch that are offered 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.369
 and as you see here the balls in 45 for 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.269
 down are the little red balls are going 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.209
 approaching are we always 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.890
 offering the pass so of 45 or 40 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.540
 it would be perfect that the speed of 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.799
 game will be suitable for the attributes 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.840
 that your players already know 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.120
 sinister does not have more than 75 xavi 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.440
 neither silva nor do I want to go to 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.670
 talk a little about the walk where 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.489
 you imagine that surely the more 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.569
 phase have the new 85 is to do 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.160
 many passes none of that we have to 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.110
 lower as much as possible because you see well 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.760
 now that the balls are unmarked if 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.250
 we went up 85 what they 're going 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.470
 waiting is a l a triangle something like that 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.629
 similar to the uncheck so nothing 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.549
 of that what we want is a very 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.200
 very short in plan we want little touches 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.879
 pim pam pim pam and that's why 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.680
 we need to have it in 35 and as you see 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.390
 always the players offering everything 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.590
 organized and really what is going to 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.390
 spread with this type of players in the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.250
 field now let's go to positioning 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.840
 where you see that by default our form 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.459
 free and this we do not want because 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.349
 really those played would be unchecked 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.579
 continuously and we do not want it anymore 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.500
 organized we want the players 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.239
 he is always always driving in his post 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.250
 do not move daisy a forward fernando 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.690
 midcentre centers and midfielders and 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.769
 on the contrary if we play with form 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.450
 free then maybe midfielder 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.950
 I would go to the offensive midfielder and I would be 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.840
 moving continuously now let's go 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.389
 at phase risk where you see that if it was 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.500
 we make passes at 80% for 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.329
 really the players would be 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.220
 doing pim pam pim pam touches well without 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.109
 meaning waiting for the flute to sound 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.180
 our feet fall and really can 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.829
 mark that would be perfect for a game 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.819
 totally counterattack was like 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.959
 we want to play everything 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.519
 otherwise we want our 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.780
 players always offer that they do not 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.430
 move from one side to the other that are not 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.049
 crazy about the field but always 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.909
 are well positioned we also have 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.530
 the organized positioning and we're going 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.940
 to take more advantage with a pass a 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.560
 30% good 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.630
 when talking about the center of these 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.740
 centers that we see so much in this case and 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.880
 in this alignment we are not going to 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.860
 use we are not going to abuse them anymore 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.990
 because our intention is to enter by 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.850
 the middle and try to go playing pim 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.920
 pam until you get up and can 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.210
 make the front is uncheck and 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.340
 make a hollow passat so let's go to 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.180
 put 50 and they reach us let's go to the shots 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.590
 that this is quite important 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.240
 since it has to be at your discretion 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.160
 I am a person who has a lot 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.660
 shot from outside the area shot from inside 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.370
 of those in many areas so really 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.410
 in 70 because it will also come to me very 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.360
 well if you have less then you put a 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.100
 little bit less the positioning can 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.560
 spend the same you see that organized are 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.180
 more organized in the descents are 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.440
 really the sides do not go up 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.750
 up so the same thing from the same 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.859
 it is always preferable to put organized 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.120
 that free way 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.620
 monier or as part more 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.000
 important I think that of all the 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.220
 custom tactics that we're going to 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.780
 play during the whole game here you are 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.880
 seeing that we are touching the pressure if 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.680
 we put them pretty high like 70 or 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.880
 well you see that many many of the 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.680
 deaths in this case we are already the 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.970
 blue balls you see that very many 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.920
 defenses go up and always 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.520
 they would be leaving us sold is that if 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.169
 we put 2024 1915 for our defense it 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.520
 will put back like a wall avoiding all 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.270
 those triangular elements that put us 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.830
 forever 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.690
 organized will also prevent that 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.100
 our sides go up and 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.080
 Here you will receive the same amount of the same 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.090
 beast if we put 80 up to two players 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.090
 always leaving gaps in the middle of the 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.610
 field is too aggressive pressure 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.050
 and in no custom tactic 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.210
 Then you see that if we work a little 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.220
 less until fifty fifty or so 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.040
 forty something goes one but also 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.140
 it's still risky because always 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.960
 you leave that gap there behind and then you see 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.760
 that if we put between 20 1915 our 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.260
 defense to be super static and the 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.730
 our player in this case the machine 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.200
 that I would use would accompany him towards 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.550
 back and the best and what else you 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.140
 I recommend that you all do all 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.480
 all our custom tactics 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.220
 the width of equipment and the less 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.170
 let's put our team is going to be very 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.180
 juntitos that this is also going to do that 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.980
 leave the other band totally 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.840
 discovered and we do not want either 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.030
 that's because we really want the 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.700
 player are quite open they seem 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.440
 to cover and cover the maximum possible field 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.970
 and how serving our balls 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.410
 blue go back and go aside and 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.420
 towards the other depending on the ball 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.310
 but always open and covering what 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.380
 possible maximum of the field and in the last 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.760
 we only have to put the tactic of 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.080
 defense we want to see there's one that 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.180
 puts cover the other way 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.650
 the ridiculous game because since we have 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.539
 all the flaws back is a little 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.340
 ridiculous that we use the tactic of 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.259
 out of the game as we will have to 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.150
 do it in the same goal so that 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.560
 we are worth it and it is true that 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.689
 quite risky but we have this 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.699
 that puts us cover that is perfect for 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:11.740
 as we want with us always 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.750
 accompanying and going back always 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:18.699
 defending the ball of face and not never 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:20.680
 turning our backs because if we put it right 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.509
 I said that and finally we have left 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.370
 save the tactic simply by giving it 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.139
 squared my case in the xbox was the 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.430
 default button will open this 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.840
 menu where we will be able to save 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.460
 our tactics and boston where 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.719
 you should put it in vacuum I'm going to 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.240
 subscribe it from the bayern because really 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:36.039
 it's similar so it's also the touch 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.050
 had we wrote two put in a new 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.219
 and we are totally saved and what 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.719
 only we have to do to carry 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:42.729
 the last and five is where you are seeing 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:43.960
 now that he puts fast tactics that 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.069
 let's put here you see that I carry the 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.870
 cell that is the one of the rapids and 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:48.000
 angry and then I'm going to put here 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.469
 we have done now 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.289
 default not if you do not look well 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:55.210
 Custom sides of FC Barcelona and 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:56.650
 I put it on the button in this case in 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.110
 the right you can lose it any of 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.850
 the four and then where in the field 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.680
 to be able to hit the crosshead 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.360
 down and these four are going to appear 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.770
 tactics and one of them in which we have 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.450
 created and the other one is the previous one the 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.370
 the fast and furious god takes me to 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.290
 field to give you an example 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.610
 well here we are in a match what 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.560
 I recommend is that it was more to start you 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.970
 you go down and you see that it unfolds 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.260
 a menu and where are our tactics 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.510
 customized here we have the 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.800
 barcelona la flechita to the right and 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.450
 it simply remains to tell you that 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.130
 we can really use it anywhere 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.650
 when against a friend when ultimate and 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.300
 the tactics are all saved nothing 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.890
 more that from top to bottom we 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.090
 unfolds the menu so nothing more 

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.680
 what to say or just to take advantage 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.060
 tactics as possible because 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.830
 for me it is one of the most important 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.940
 this guy as well as they were always 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.620
 We differ with your feedback 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.620
 and see you the next kids
