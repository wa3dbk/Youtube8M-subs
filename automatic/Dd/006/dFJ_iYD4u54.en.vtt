do several different things but the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.250 
do several different things but the
machine<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.580> much<00:00:39.180> more<00:00:39.390> complicated<00:00:39.810> than<00:00:40.200> a

here<00:00:49.380> now<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.280> particular<00:00:50.610> machine<00:00:51.260> has

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
here now this particular machine has

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.140 
here now this particular machine has
cards<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.490> show<00:00:53.820> us<00:00:54.120> what<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.200> need<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.620> do

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
cards that show us what we need to do

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.960 
cards that show us what we need to do
now<00:00:57.150> if<00:00:57.450> this<00:00:57.660> were<00:00:57.960> another<00:00:58.380> a<00:00:59.280> more

screen up here that might have this
information<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.479> particular

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
information on it but in this particular

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.590 
information on it but in this particular
case<00:01:07.259> we've<00:01:07.799> got<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.219> information<00:01:08.609> on<00:01:09.060> cards

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
case we've got this information on cards

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.219 
case we've got this information on cards
now<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.530> card<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.420> actually<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.539> card<00:01:12.810> for

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
now this card is actually the card for

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.959 
now this card is actually the card for
if<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.890> look<00:01:14.039> at<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> top<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.729> shows<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
if you look at the top it shows a

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.230 
if you look at the top it shows a
picture<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.409> thread<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.729> we're<00:01:17.939> trying

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
picture of the thread that we're trying

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.349 
picture of the thread that we're trying
to<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.799> now<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.859> would<00:01:20.249> look<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> picture

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
to do now we would look at the picture

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.630 
to do now we would look at the picture
and<00:01:21.390> say<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> what<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.560> want<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.979> we

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and say that is what we want and we

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
and say that is what we want and we
would<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.420> would<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:24.869> give<00:01:25.409> us<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
would have that would then give us the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.060 
would have that would then give us the
title<00:01:25.979> up<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.939> says<00:01:27.149> three<00:01:27.600> thread

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
title up here and it says three thread

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.940 
title up here and it says three thread
now<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.280> order<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.780> machine<00:01:31.649> do

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
now in order to have the machine do

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.179 
now in order to have the machine do
three<00:01:32.369> thread<00:01:32.670> surging<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:34.350> then<00:01:34.619> will<00:01:34.859> follow

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
three thread surging we then will follow

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.880 
three thread surging we then will follow
the<00:01:35.429> rules<00:01:35.700> here<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.079> stitch<00:01:37.859> length

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the rules here we have the stitch length

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.480 
the rules here we have the stitch length
would<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.909> at<00:01:39.210> 2.5<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.619> would<00:01:40.859> be<00:01:41.009> our<00:01:41.039> stitch

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
would be at 2.5 this would be our stitch

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.239 
would be at 2.5 this would be our stitch
length<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.329> SL<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.619> would<00:01:43.829> turn<00:01:44.039> that

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
length for the SL and we would turn that

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.700 
length for the SL and we would turn that
here<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.670> 2.5<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.020> probably<00:01:46.319> where<00:01:46.530> it's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
here to 2.5 which is probably where it's

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.760 
here to 2.5 which is probably where it's
at<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.899> differential<00:01:48.899> feed<00:01:49.170> which

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
at right now the differential feed which

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.849 
at right now the differential feed which
I'll<00:01:49.950> explain<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.880> moment<00:01:51.270> DF<00:01:51.929> would

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
I'll explain in just a moment DF would

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.609 
I'll explain in just a moment DF would
be<00:01:53.039> set<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:53.909> which<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.719> where<00:01:55.139> it<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.350> set

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
be set on one which is where it is set

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.639 
be set on one which is where it is set
right<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:56.149> then<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.329> come<00:01:57.539> down<00:01:57.749> here<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.319> we

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
right here then we come down here and we

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.520 
right here then we come down here and we
would<00:01:58.889> actually<00:01:59.359> remove<00:02:00.359> one<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.049> needles

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
would actually remove one of the needles

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.800 
would actually remove one of the needles
now<00:02:01.859> we<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.219> left<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.819> right<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.299> then

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
now we have left and right and then

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.889 
now we have left and right and then
corresponding<00:02:04.679> on<00:02:04.859> our<00:02:05.249> needle<00:02:06.119> head<00:02:06.389> we<00:02:06.659> have

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
corresponding on our needle head we have

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.410 
corresponding on our needle head we have
left<00:02:07.319> and<00:02:07.560> right<00:02:07.770> marked<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.340> here<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.240> we

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
left and right marked on here so we

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.480 
left and right marked on here so we
would<00:02:09.630> take<00:02:09.840> our<00:02:10.050> left<00:02:10.410> needle<00:02:10.979> would<00:02:11.250> loosen

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
would take our left needle would loosen

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.790 
would take our left needle would loosen
this<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.600> screw<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.200> we<00:02:13.590> would<00:02:13.770> remove

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
this the screw and we would remove

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.130 
this the screw and we would remove
the<00:02:15.070> needle<00:02:15.490> that<00:02:15.970> we<00:02:16.090> didn't<00:02:16.390> need<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:17.110> we

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the needle that we didn't need so we

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.600 
the needle that we didn't need so we
would<00:02:17.440> have<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.830> just<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.130> right<00:02:18.310> hand

would have the just the right hand

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.570 
would have the just the right hand
needle<00:02:18.820> now<00:02:19.810> we<00:02:19.870> would<00:02:20.200> then<00:02:20.470> remove<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.010> blue

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580

and<00:02:24.070> here's<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.580> threat<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.450> we<00:02:25.600> would

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
and here's the threat so we would

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.350 
and here's the threat so we would
completely<00:02:26.620> remove<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.310> threat<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.880> then

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
completely remove that threat and then

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.870 
completely remove that threat and then
we<00:02:28.510> would<00:02:28.750> then<00:02:29.020> have<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:30.100> red<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
we would then have the the red the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.600 
we would then have the the red the
yellow<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.600> green<00:02:31.800> now<00:02:32.800> continuing<00:02:33.490> the

it<00:02:42.910> has<00:02:43.120> numbers<00:02:43.600> this<00:02:43.900> one's<00:02:44.220> 3.7<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.400> then

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
it has numbers this one's 3.7 and then

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.880 
it has numbers this one's 3.7 and then
there<00:02:46.270> are<00:02:46.300> numbers<00:02:46.840> corresponding<00:02:47.680> with<00:02:47.830> a

there are numbers corresponding with a
little<00:02:48.220> dot<00:02:48.400> right<00:02:48.670> here<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.030> would<00:02:49.210> give<00:02:49.420> us

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
little dot right here that would give us

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.880 
little dot right here that would give us
the<00:02:50.140> adjustment<00:02:50.860> for<00:02:51.130> our<00:02:51.280> cutting<00:02:51.760> had<00:02:52.890> this

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
the adjustment for our cutting had this

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.910 
the adjustment for our cutting had this
next<00:02:54.700> little<00:02:54.850> window<00:02:55.330> shows<00:02:55.630> us<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.110> we<00:02:56.320> need

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
setup let me just explain that we have

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.370 
setup let me just explain that we have
the<00:03:38.739> differential<00:03:39.459> feed<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.720> differential

the differential feed the differential

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.750 
the differential feed the differential
feed<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.840> device<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:43.870> covers<00:03:44.770> our<00:03:44.950> feed

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
feed is a device that covers our feed

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.449 
feed is a device that covers our feed
dogs<00:03:46.030> now<00:03:46.660> our<00:03:46.900> feed<00:03:47.200> dogs<00:03:47.500> are<00:03:47.830> set<00:03:48.280> up<00:03:48.430> so

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
dogs now our feed dogs are set up so

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.729 
dogs now our feed dogs are set up so
that<00:03:48.790> we<00:03:48.970> have<00:03:49.090> front<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.810> rear<00:03:50.110> feed<00:03:50.440> dogs

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
that we have front and rear feed dogs

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.930 
that we have front and rear feed dogs
and<00:03:51.180> we<00:03:52.180> would<00:03:52.390> then<00:03:52.600> use<00:03:52.840> this<00:03:53.080> device<00:03:53.350> to

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
and we would then use this device to

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.790 
and we would then use this device to
control<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.420> speed<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.230> front<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.709> the

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
control the speed of the front and the

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.420 
control the speed of the front and the
rear<00:03:56.890> feed<00:03:57.400> dogs<00:03:57.670> if<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.780> if<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.500> fabric<00:04:00.250> that

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
rear feed dogs if the if the fabric that

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
rear feed dogs if the if the fabric that
we're<00:04:00.640> sewing<00:04:00.940> with<00:04:01.590> requires<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:04.000> different

we're sewing with requires the different

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.750 
we're sewing with requires the different
speed<00:04:04.900> would<00:04:05.230> be<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.620> stop<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.130> fabric<00:04:06.580> from

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
this control here which is our

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.120 
this control here which is our
differential<00:04:22.150> feed<00:04:22.419> would<00:04:23.169> make<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.740> the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
differential feed would make the the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.690 
differential feed would make the the
dogs<00:04:24.810> operate<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.440> feed<00:04:26.740> operate<00:04:27.490> at

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
dogs operate and the feed operate at

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.640 
dogs operate and the feed operate at
different<00:04:27.880> speeds<00:04:28.660> which<00:04:29.229> would<00:04:29.440> give<00:04:29.620> us

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
different speeds which would give us

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.640 
different speeds which would give us
that<00:04:29.919> different<00:04:30.310> effect
