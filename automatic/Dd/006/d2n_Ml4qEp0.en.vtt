controls<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:13.320> can<00:02:13.350> program<00:02:13.709> macros<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.640> work

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
controls you can program macros to work

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.000 
controls you can program macros to work
with<00:02:15.030> Crestron<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.810> other<00:02:15.990> universal<00:02:16.650> units

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
with Crestron and other universal units

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.420 
with Crestron and other universal units
so<00:02:17.940> now<00:02:18.120> we're<00:02:18.330> gonna<00:02:18.450> test<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.959> 1001<00:02:19.800> P<00:02:20.070> non

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
so now we're gonna test the 1001 P non

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.850 
so now we're gonna test the 1001 P non
swivel<00:02:21.060> unit<00:02:21.450> before<00:02:22.260> we<00:02:22.350> do<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.620> test

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
swivel unit before we do the test

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.440 
swivel unit before we do the test
there's<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.250> couple<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.700> important<00:02:24.120> things<00:02:24.300> we

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
there's a couple of important things we

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.540 
there's a couple of important things we
need<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.630> talk<00:02:24.840> about<00:02:24.900> first<00:02:25.860> ensure<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
need to talk about first ensure that the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.210 
need to talk about first ensure that the
unit<00:02:26.850> is<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.120> hard<00:02:27.510> flat<00:02:27.900> surface<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:29.040> is

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
unit is on a hard flat surface this is

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.310 
unit is on a hard flat surface this is
because<00:02:29.580> when<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.940> unit<00:02:30.269> is<00:02:30.420> actually<00:02:30.630> lifted

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
because when the unit is actually lifted

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.630 
because when the unit is actually lifted
it<00:02:31.650> becomes<00:02:32.010> top-heavy

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
it becomes top-heavy

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.120 
it becomes top-heavy
the<00:02:33.120> second<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.660> keep<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.320> safety<00:02:34.739> bar<00:02:34.920> on

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the second is keep the safety bar on

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:44.860 
the second is keep the safety bar on
throughout<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.730> entire<00:02:35.760> test

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.509 

now<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.930> first<00:02:46.319> thing<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.739> do<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.099> connect<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
now the first thing to do is connect the

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.089 
now the first thing to do is connect the
multi<00:02:47.909> pin<00:02:48.090> adapter<00:02:48.540> from<00:02:48.719> the<00:02:48.810> MFC<00:02:49.469> to<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
multi pin adapter from the MFC to the

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.580 
multi pin adapter from the MFC to the
multi<00:02:50.459> pin<00:02:50.670> adapter<00:02:51.120> from<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.359> lift<00:02:51.689> then

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
multi pin adapter from the lift then

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.879 
multi pin adapter from the lift then
plug<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.129> power<00:02:53.310> cord<00:02:53.670> into<00:02:53.939> an<00:02:54.239> outlet

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
plug the power cord into an outlet

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.530 
plug the power cord into an outlet
before<00:02:55.889> you<00:02:56.280> use<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.639> remote<00:02:56.969> you<00:02:57.239> will<00:02:57.329> use

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
before you use the remote you will use

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.869 
before you use the remote you will use
the<00:02:57.719> override<00:02:58.079> buttons<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.859> MFC<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.700> make

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879
