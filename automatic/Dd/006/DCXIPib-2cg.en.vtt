and look I think that's a great way to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.279 
and look I think that's a great way to
whether<00:00:25.499> an<00:00:25.679> app<00:00:25.829> for<00:00:26.130> soup<00:00:26.539> but<00:00:27.539> again<00:00:27.929> how

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
whether an app for soup but again how
