00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.380
 I 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.260

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.790
 happiness 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.790
 front 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.979
 need to 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.330
 like 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.020
 rumba 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:41.270
 glucose and evgeny papunaishvili and fame 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.270
 god uninterrupted ball yielding 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.700
 Natasha is already glad happily I saw that 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.000
 you are there my only to not stop the music 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.710
 yes and what is more difficult to rub or sambo in this 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.870
 time it seems to me it was rumba because 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:03.390
 already scared that something again 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.700
 do not be afraid we are with you Yegor here 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.770
 you know me always surprises you sometimes 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.870
 praise you leave the marks low sometimes 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.200
 swearing high marks you put it with something 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:20.370
 here is such as people will be connected 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.920
 launched and how are you going now I wanted 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.060
 would praise and praise 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.310
 firstly for the fact that it was very 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.920
 filled with movement in physics exactly 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.190
 in fact, those who dance know that 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.650
 sometimes things at a faster pace more 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.900
 high temp is easier to dance because 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.490
 that the turn of motion she implies 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.930
 certain amplitude with greater 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.510
 amplitudes it is impossible to dance 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.970
 because there are high but when you 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.470
 dance slow choreography and and need 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.750
 fill not only with power of confidence 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.910
 meaning but a certain kind 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.890
 sensuality you immediately see good or 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.530
 bad dancers they are checked for on 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.050
 slow pace 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.120
 if for example when we rehearsed 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.510
 musical cats we had movement in 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.370
 choreography 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.069
 here in Moscow in the Moscow version 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.060
 cat musicals director who I was 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.970
 as if we were pushing aside 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.299
 curtain arm very simple movement 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.280
 to make it easier to hold a pen 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.250
 left to right but choreographer rather 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.479
 the assistant choreographer taught us that this 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.979
 need to do as if this 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.990
 the curtain was very heavy which silhouette 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.460
 It was a great big theater curtain 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.620
 the amount of velvet is difficult 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.870
 right now you have achieved what I need 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.370
 I at least had a result 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.690
 very nice the only thing that I 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.320
 it seemed that not all at the end you have 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.080
 It happened and that's what . was not like that 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.380
 how did you come up with it and is it true or 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.600
 No , I will do everything exactly like this when you 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.600
 conceived then it would not be that we are not at all 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.780
 every 15 seconds stretched one by one 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.780
 buttons on the shirt is an opinion but this one and 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.820
 deserved it 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.949
 dexterous flowed only fasten pada but 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.490
 my father didn't even want to do some 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.500
 such a point is straight here sometimes clouds are 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:19.660
 It was 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:21.729
 I understood, yes or was Natalia such 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.650
 couples this season who first you 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.430
 tuned one way and then abruptly 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.949
 dissuaded here they are amazing 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.650
 performed the first dance and absolutely me 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:35.560
 not convinced in the second stage of freedom itself 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.080
 crane just immediately in response to your 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.039
 question I was even a little surprised 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.830
 because but rumba you would seem 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:47.110
 and dancing is not enough for me and that's it 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.669
 soft and feline by the way 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:53.380
 No wonder he remembered Egor passion was all 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.320
 you just turned a little bit 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.889
 natasha everything was all clear about including 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.310
 further on this is the fascination of this 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:05.550
 secrets very complicated indeed 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.789
 slow rhythm that requires 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:12.849
 amazing filing another plastic here 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:15.130
 and I did not see even though I was very 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.550
 love and your fan but I am amazed 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.600
 looked left again 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:22.670
 right and saw what kind of approval 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.980
 was the same this same understanding 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:28.010
 dance don't know what happened either to you 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.200
 feet do not get between swap it 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.380
 dance first then second what was 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.820
