00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
down and pull off and then it moves over
here<00:00:55.969> it's<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> same<00:00:57.390> shape<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.109> just

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
here it's the same shape but it's just

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.750 
here it's the same shape but it's just
moved<00:00:58.859> over<00:00:59.420> that's<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.719> 4th<00:01:00.989> fret<00:01:01.800> 2nd

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.520 

then<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.920> next<00:01:18.190> phrase<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:21.030> starts<00:01:22.030> open

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
then the next phrase it's starts open

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.980 
then the next phrase it's starts open
and<00:01:23.530> then<00:01:23.950> it's<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.400> same<00:01:24.610> shape<00:01:24.910> as<00:01:25.540> up<00:01:25.720> here

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
and then it's the same shape as up here

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.090 
and then it's the same shape as up here
okay<00:01:26.800> it's<00:01:27.120> down<00:01:28.120> on<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.479> second<00:01:28.870> fret<00:01:32.100> so

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
okay it's down on the second fret so

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.330 
okay it's down on the second fret so
that's<00:01:33.310> open<00:01:33.610> our<00:01:34.600> second<00:01:35.080> fret<00:01:35.440> fourth<00:01:36.130> fret

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
that's open our second fret fourth fret

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.050 
that's open our second fret fourth fret
and<00:01:37.150> then<00:01:38.020> have<00:01:38.350> hammer<00:01:38.920> on<00:01:39.190> back<00:01:39.490> down<00:01:39.760> on<00:01:39.940> the

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
and then have hammer on back down on the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:52.950 
and then have hammer on back down on the
second<00:01:44.670> back<00:01:45.670> on<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:45.940> fourth<00:01:47.009> pull<00:01:48.009> off<00:01:51.960> and

second back on the fourth pull off and

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.130 
second back on the fourth pull off and
then<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.290> thing<00:01:53.530> moves<00:01:53.979> over<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:55.140> where

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
then the thing moves over to where

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.200 
then the thing moves over to where
you're<00:01:56.410> first<00:01:56.649> started<00:01:57.190> that's<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.940> first

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
you're first started that's the first

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.270 
you're first started that's the first
string<00:01:58.479> second<00:01:58.960> fret<00:01:59.050> third<00:01:59.590> string<00:01:59.619> second

string second fret third string second

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:48.410 
string second fret third string second
fret<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.649> then<00:02:08.920> lift<00:02:09.130> off

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.020 

even<00:02:49.420> though<00:02:49.510> I'm<00:02:49.599> doing<00:02:49.629> those<00:02:50.549> I've<00:02:51.549> got<00:02:51.760> you

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
even though I'm doing those I've got you

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.190 
even though I'm doing those I've got you
know<00:02:52.150> I'm<00:02:52.480> hammering<00:02:53.019> I'm<00:02:53.590> fretting<00:02:54.400> -<00:02:55.200> two

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
know I'm hammering I'm fretting - two

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.020 
know I'm hammering I'm fretting - two
fingers<00:02:56.440> I'm<00:02:57.010> not<00:02:57.250> necessarily<00:02:57.400> playing

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
fingers I'm not necessarily playing

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.650 
fingers I'm not necessarily playing
those<00:02:58.540> all<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.959> time<00:02:59.879> but<00:03:00.879> you<00:03:01.120> know<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.420> guess

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
those all the time but you know I guess

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:11.089 
those all the time but you know I guess
it's<00:03:01.870> just<00:03:01.930> part<00:03:02.349> of<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.500> resonance<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.250> it

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.710 

and<00:03:12.099> certainly<00:03:12.340> when<00:03:12.640> on<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.120> second<00:03:13.510> phrase

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
and certainly when on the second phrase

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:29.130 
and certainly when on the second phrase
where<00:03:13.959> I<00:03:14.019> come<00:03:14.230> up<00:03:27.299> you<00:03:28.299> get<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.599> idea<00:03:28.930> I'm<00:03:29.079> not

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
where I come up you get the idea I'm not

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.180 
where I come up you get the idea I'm not
very<00:03:29.410> good<00:03:29.500> at<00:03:29.620> this<00:03:29.829> explaining<00:03:32.879> have<00:03:33.879> a<00:03:33.910> go
