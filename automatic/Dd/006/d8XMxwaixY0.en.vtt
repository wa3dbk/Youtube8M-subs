basic starting points and in future
episodes<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.599> take<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> little<00:00:28.080> bit

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
episodes we can take it a little bit

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.800 
episodes we can take it a little bit
further<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:30.060> first<00:00:30.300> thing<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.480> will<00:00:30.689> help

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
further the first thing that will help

right equipment obviously a filming
board<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.800> pretty<00:00:35.010> crucial<00:00:35.250> if<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.880> look<00:00:36.120> back

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
board is pretty crucial if you look back

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.420 
board is pretty crucial if you look back
to<00:00:36.480> episode<00:00:36.870> 17<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.800> talked<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> lot<00:00:38.190> about<00:00:38.309> that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and then the other thing that's going to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.760 
and then the other thing that's going to
help<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:41.010> fisheye<00:00:41.820> lens<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.390> your<00:00:42.420> camera<00:00:42.770> if

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
help is a fisheye lens on your camera if

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.920 
help is a fisheye lens on your camera if
you<00:00:43.920> use<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> really<00:00:44.399> wide<00:00:44.670> fisheye<00:00:45.180> lens<00:00:45.420> along

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
you use a really wide fisheye lens along

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.750 
you use a really wide fisheye lens along
with<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> cruiser<00:00:46.530> board<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:47.640> away

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
with a cruiser board you can get away

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580 
with a cruiser board you can get away
with<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.270> having<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.690> steady<00:00:48.989> hand<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
with just having a steady hand and

with just having a steady hand and
getting<00:00:50.190> really<00:00:50.399> nice<00:00:50.610> clean<00:00:51.059> tracking<00:00:51.629> shots

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
getting really nice clean tracking shots

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.860 
getting really nice clean tracking shots
another<00:00:53.460> thing<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.820> take<00:00:54.030> note<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.449> you're<00:00:54.690> not

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
another thing to take note if you're not

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.600 
another thing to take note if you're not
using<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.170> digital<00:00:55.320> SLR<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.980> using<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> camcorder

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
using a digital SLR if using a camcorder

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.119 
using a digital SLR if using a camcorder
that<00:00:57.059> has<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.690> built-in<00:00:58.230> steady<00:00:58.649> shot<00:00:58.920> feature

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
that has a built-in steady shot feature

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.369 
that has a built-in steady shot feature
when<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> put<00:01:00.300> these<00:01:00.420> fisheye<00:01:00.870> lenses<00:01:01.199> you

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
when you put these fisheye lenses you

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.229 
when you put these fisheye lenses you
typically<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.070> turn<00:01:02.309> off<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> steady

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
typically want to turn off the steady

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.020 
typically want to turn off the steady
shot<00:01:03.510> feature<00:01:04.040> because<00:01:05.040> quite<00:01:05.580> often<00:01:05.729> you'll

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
shot feature because quite often you'll

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.340 
shot feature because quite often you'll
have<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.510> bit<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.720> vignetting<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
have a little bit of vignetting in the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.070 
have a little bit of vignetting in the
camera<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> steady<00:01:08.970> shot<00:01:09.390> it's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
camera and with the steady shot it's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
camera and with the steady shot it's
going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.530> jiggling<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.280> frame<00:01:11.580> around<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
going to be jiggling the frame around to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820 
going to be jiggling the frame around to
compensate<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:12.840> your<00:01:12.990> movement<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.560> what

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
compensate for your movement and what

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.440 
compensate for your movement and what
happens<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.460> see<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> edge<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> frame

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
happens is you see the edge of the frame

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.390 
happens is you see the edge of the frame
jiggling<00:01:15.960> around<00:01:16.049> more<00:01:16.470> because<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
jiggling around more because of the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.190 
jiggling around more because of the
vignette<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.850> coming<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.900> out<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
vignette in coming in and out of the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.990 
vignette in coming in and out of the
corners<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.650> frame<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.700> actually

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
corners of the frame and that actually

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.399 
corners of the frame and that actually
can<00:01:21.150> make<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.450> look<00:01:21.600> worse<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
can make it look worse and have the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.289 
can make it look worse and have the
opposite<00:01:22.799> effect<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.520> Steadicam<00:01:23.880> that's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
opposite effect of the Steadicam that's

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.810 
opposite effect of the Steadicam that's
desired<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.130> yeah<00:01:26.130> make<00:01:26.369> sure<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.520> turn<00:01:26.790> off

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
desired so yeah make sure you turn off

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.399 
desired so yeah make sure you turn off
the<00:01:27.060> steady<00:01:27.299> shot<00:01:27.570> whenever<00:01:27.869> you're<00:01:28.200> filming

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the steady shot whenever you're filming

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.789 
the steady shot whenever you're filming
with<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.710> fisheye<00:01:29.040> lens<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.640> follow<00:01:29.880> filming

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
with a fisheye lens and follow filming

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.080 
with a fisheye lens and follow filming
so<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.009> fisheye<00:01:32.310> lens<00:01:32.520> will<00:01:32.729> give<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
so the fisheye lens will give you the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.940 
so the fisheye lens will give you the
range<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.290> action<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.740> while

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
range to get all the action in while

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.620 
range to get all the action in while
being<00:01:35.159> really<00:01:35.640> close<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.240> excitement

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
being really close to all the excitement

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.870 
being really close to all the excitement
and<00:01:37.049> give<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> smoothest<00:01:38.340> looking

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and give you the smoothest looking

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.819 
and give you the smoothest looking
tracking<00:01:39.270> shots<00:01:39.540> because<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.290> longer<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
tracking shots because the longer the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.200 
tracking shots because the longer the
lens<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.159> use<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.700> more<00:01:41.880> you're<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.150> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
lens you use the more you're going to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.899 
lens you use the more you're going to
need<00:01:42.450> additional<00:01:42.780> stabilization<00:01:43.909> whether

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
need additional stabilization whether

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.330 
need additional stabilization whether
it's<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.420> built<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.229> steady<00:01:46.680> shot<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.189> the

pretty bad rolling shutter issue as you

frame is being scanned much like a

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.870 
frame is being scanned much like a

happens<00:02:28.239> is<00:02:28.480> just<00:02:28.510> like<00:02:28.930> when<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.200> move<00:02:29.739> the

before<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.989> start<00:02:59.200> shooting<00:02:59.380> there<00:02:59.650> I

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
before you start shooting there I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.199 
before you start shooting there I
recommend<00:03:00.069> planning<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.790> out<00:03:00.910> with<00:03:01.120> the

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
recommend planning it out with the

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.910 
recommend planning it out with the
skater<00:03:01.480> so<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:01.930> know<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.319> beginning<00:03:02.709> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
skater so you know the beginning the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.320 
skater so you know the beginning the
middle<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.430> end<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.819> line<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.239> you

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
middle and the end of the line and you

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.140 
middle and the end of the line and you
can<00:03:05.200> work<00:03:05.769> around<00:03:06.069> that<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.280> plan<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.940> be<00:03:07.060> in

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
can work around that and plan to be in

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.430 
can work around that and plan to be in
the<00:03:07.269> right<00:03:07.420> place<00:03:07.660> at<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:07.930> right<00:03:07.989> time<00:03:08.410> to

the right place at the right time to

you're filming a line that starts from a

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
stationary position then you probably

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.259 
stationary position then you probably
want<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.650> practice<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.400> transition<00:03:57.940> from<00:03:58.090> the

line as you start moving everybody has a

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.690 
line as you start moving everybody has a
slightly<00:04:02.590> different<00:04:02.799> technique<00:04:03.190> for<00:04:03.549> this

slightly different technique for this

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.280 
slightly different technique for this
I've<00:04:03.940> seen<00:04:04.120> some<00:04:04.329> people<00:04:04.660> start<00:04:04.930> with<00:04:05.079> their

I've seen some people start with their

I've seen some people start with their

just to sync up with the skater
other<00:04:11.319> times<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:12.040> might<00:04:12.160> put<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.519> board<00:04:12.730> a

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
other times you might put the board a

other times you might put the board a
couple<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.209> steps<00:04:13.420> away<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.810> take<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.260> slight

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590

running step onto your board if you have

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.170 
running step onto your board if you have
to<00:04:16.870> go<00:04:16.959> faster<00:04:17.470> or<00:04:17.650> if<00:04:17.919> it's<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.370> case<00:04:18.789> of<00:04:18.820> going

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
to go faster or if it's a case of going

from zero to full speed I've even

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.780 
from zero to full speed I've even
sometimes<00:04:21.880> had<00:04:22.060> my<00:04:22.210> board<00:04:22.630> in<00:04:22.750> my<00:04:22.810> left<00:04:22.990> hand

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
sometimes had my board in my left hand

thrown<00:04:25.230> down<00:04:25.500> along<00:04:26.340> with<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.550> skater<00:04:26.850> so

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
thrown down along with the skater so

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.520 
thrown down along with the skater so
that<00:04:27.450> way<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:27.660> can<00:04:27.810> keep<00:04:27.930> up<00:04:28.140> with<00:04:28.170> them<00:04:28.380> and

that way you can keep up with them and

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.870 
that way you can keep up with them and
be<00:04:28.680> in<00:04:28.770> sync<00:04:29.070> for<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.280> first<00:04:29.520> part<00:04:29.760> of<00:04:29.790> the

keep<00:04:50.010> up<00:04:50.160> with<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.340> skater<00:04:50.670> but<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.570> actually

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
keep up with a skater but I actually

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.690 
keep up with a skater but I actually
find<00:04:52.140> that<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.620> closer<00:04:52.890> you<00:04:53.190> are<00:04:53.220> the

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
find that the closer you are the

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.220 
find that the closer you are the
smoother<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.180> looks<00:04:54.300> because<00:04:54.960> when<00:04:55.140> the

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
smoother it looks because when the

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.870 
smoother it looks because when the
skater<00:04:55.470> fills<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:55.890> frame<00:04:56.160> you<00:04:56.370> don't<00:04:56.580> have<00:04:56.760> as

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
skater fills a frame you don't have as

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.640 
skater fills a frame you don't have as
much<00:04:57.000> horizon<00:04:57.630> for<00:04:57.840> reference<00:04:58.260> that's

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
much horizon for reference that's

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.350 
much horizon for reference that's
showing<00:04:59.400> you<00:04:59.490> that<00:04:59.580> it's<00:04:59.730> shaking<00:05:00.120> I<00:05:00.180> guess

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
showing you that it's shaking I guess

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.020 
showing you that it's shaking I guess
and<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:01.770> can<00:05:01.920> look<00:05:02.040> like<00:05:02.100> a<00:05:02.250> slightly<00:05:02.670> smoother

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
and it can look like a slightly smoother

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.420 
and it can look like a slightly smoother
shot<00:05:03.380> also<00:05:04.380> you<00:05:04.470> can<00:05:04.620> even<00:05:04.740> take<00:05:04.920> it<00:05:05.040> one<00:05:05.190> step

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
shot also you can even take it one step

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.520 
shot also you can even take it one step
further<00:05:05.670> I<00:05:05.880> sometimes<00:05:06.180> find<00:05:06.600> myself<00:05:06.840> timing

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
further I sometimes find myself timing

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.890 
further I sometimes find myself timing
my<00:05:07.680> pushes<00:05:08.100> with<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:08.850> skaters<00:05:09.300> pushes<00:05:09.690> so

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
my pushes with the skaters pushes so

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.540 
my pushes with the skaters pushes so
that<00:05:10.020> any<00:05:10.170> jerky<00:05:10.650> movement<00:05:11.040> kind<00:05:11.160> of<00:05:11.310> blends

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
that any jerky movement kind of blends

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.960 
that any jerky movement kind of blends
together<00:05:11.820> with<00:05:12.180> their<00:05:12.420> their<00:05:13.080> movements<00:05:13.970> now

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
together with their their movements now

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.430 
together with their their movements now
having<00:05:15.240> said<00:05:15.420> all<00:05:15.450> that<00:05:15.570> sometimes<00:05:16.200> a<00:05:16.320> little

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
having said all that sometimes a little

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.440 
having said all that sometimes a little
shake<00:05:16.770> is<00:05:17.010> unavoidable<00:05:17.670> especially<00:05:18.300> when

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
shake is unavoidable especially when

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.690 
shake is unavoidable especially when
you're<00:05:18.570> filming<00:05:18.780> really<00:05:19.080> fast<00:05:19.440> lines<00:05:19.800> and<00:05:20.130> it

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
you're filming really fast lines and it

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.220 
you're filming really fast lines and it
can<00:05:20.790> actually<00:05:21.120> enhance<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.600> action<00:05:22.020> by

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
can actually enhance the action by

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.800 
can actually enhance the action by
emphasizing<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:22.860> speed<00:05:23.130> a<00:05:23.160> little<00:05:23.280> bit<00:05:23.490> more

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
emphasizing the speed a little bit more

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.450 
emphasizing the speed a little bit more
if<00:05:24.810> you're<00:05:25.020> filming<00:05:25.230> ledges<00:05:25.740> or<00:05:25.770> flatland

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
if you're filming ledges or flatland

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.950 
if you're filming ledges or flatland
tricks<00:05:26.640> in<00:05:27.000> the<00:05:27.060> middle<00:05:27.300> of<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.480> line<00:05:27.690> or<00:05:27.930> just

pushing<00:05:28.410> along<00:05:28.620> typically<00:05:29.190> you<00:05:29.280> want<00:05:29.370> to<00:05:29.490> have

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
pushing along typically you want to have

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.840 
pushing along typically you want to have
that<00:05:29.760> traditional<00:05:30.330> low<00:05:30.600> angle<00:05:31.200> looking<00:05:31.620> up

that traditional low angle looking up

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.280 
that traditional low angle looking up
that<00:05:32.850> can<00:05:33.030> look<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.270> best<00:05:33.450> for<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:33.780> most<00:05:33.810> part

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
that can look the best for the most part

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.140 
that can look the best for the most part
but<00:05:34.530> don't<00:05:34.980> be<00:05:35.100> afraid<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.520> experiment<00:05:35.760> with

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
but don't be afraid to experiment with

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.640 
but don't be afraid to experiment with
different<00:05:36.390> looks<00:05:36.690> of<00:05:36.930> your<00:05:37.050> own<00:05:37.170> and<00:05:37.380> come<00:05:37.560> up

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
different looks of your own and come up

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.100 
different looks of your own and come up
with<00:05:37.770> new<00:05:37.830> stuff<00:05:38.630> so<00:05:39.630> when<00:05:39.720> it<00:05:39.810> comes<00:05:39.960> to

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
with new stuff so when it comes to

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.780 
with new stuff so when it comes to
filming<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.560> end<00:05:40.710> of<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:40.950> line<00:05:41.130> again<00:05:41.640> you

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
filming the end of the line again you

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.550 
filming the end of the line again you
want<00:05:41.970> to<00:05:42.060> have<00:05:42.180> some<00:05:42.420> kind<00:05:42.600> of<00:05:42.630> a<00:05:42.750> plan<00:05:42.990> and<00:05:43.350> if

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
want to have some kind of a plan and if

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.960 
want to have some kind of a plan and if
this<00:05:43.680> means<00:05:43.890> that<00:05:44.100> the<00:05:44.220> camera<00:05:44.340> is<00:05:44.580> coming<00:05:44.850> to

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
this means that the camera is coming to

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.510 
this means that the camera is coming to
a<00:05:45.000> stop<00:05:45.420> then<00:05:46.230> you<00:05:46.680> want<00:05:46.860> to<00:05:46.890> practice<00:05:47.310> this<00:05:47.460> a

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
a stop then you want to practice this a

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.910 
a stop then you want to practice this a
little<00:05:47.790> bit<00:05:48.030> maybe<00:05:48.270> not<00:05:49.260> only<00:05:49.500> see<00:05:49.680> that<00:05:49.860> you

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
little bit maybe not only see that you

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.160 
little bit maybe not only see that you
get<00:05:50.010> a<00:05:50.070> smooth<00:05:50.460> stop<00:05:51.150> at<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.630> end<00:05:51.750> of<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:51.960> line

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
get a smooth stop at the end of the line

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.530 
get a smooth stop at the end of the line
but<00:05:52.470> also<00:05:52.670> so<00:05:53.670> you<00:05:53.730> have<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.180> composition

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
but also so you have the composition

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.030 
but also so you have the composition
figured<00:05:55.110> out<00:05:55.230> so<00:05:55.470> you<00:05:55.560> can<00:05:55.680> tell<00:05:55.890> the<00:05:56.010> whole

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
figured out so you can tell the whole

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.400 
figured out so you can tell the whole
story<00:05:56.340> at<00:05:56.670> the<00:05:56.790> end<00:05:56.910> maybe<00:05:57.270> it's<00:05:57.510> showing<00:05:58.320> how

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
story at the end maybe it's showing how

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.320 
story at the end maybe it's showing how
high<00:05:58.620> the<00:05:58.680> ledges<00:05:59.190> or<00:05:59.370> how<00:05:59.490> long<00:05:59.700> the<00:05:59.910> gap<00:06:00.120> is

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
high the ledges or how long the gap is

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.150 
high the ledges or how long the gap is
or<00:06:00.600> how<00:06:00.720> long<00:06:00.930> the<00:06:01.110> rail<00:06:01.290> is<00:06:01.530> or<00:06:01.740> whatever<00:06:01.980> the

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
or how long the rail is or whatever the

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.040 
or how long the rail is or whatever the
end<00:06:02.280> of<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.490> line<00:06:02.670> is<00:06:02.880> also<00:06:03.420> becoming<00:06:03.840> to<00:06:04.020> a

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
end of the line is also becoming to a

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.690 
end of the line is also becoming to a
complete<00:06:04.350> stop<00:06:04.620> at<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:04.920> end<00:06:05.040> of<00:06:05.160> the<00:06:05.250> line<00:06:05.430> and

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
complete stop at the end of the line and

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.890 
complete stop at the end of the line and
they're<00:06:05.850> going<00:06:06.000> to<00:06:06.090> skate<00:06:06.270> too<00:06:06.420> right<00:06:06.600> away

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
they're going to skate too right away

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.930 
they're going to skate too right away
you<00:06:07.320> can<00:06:07.530> actually<00:06:07.710> exaggerate<00:06:08.490> their<00:06:08.670> speed

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
you can actually exaggerate their speed

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.240 
you can actually exaggerate their speed
a<00:06:08.970> little<00:06:09.120> bit<00:06:09.330> especially<00:06:09.900> if<00:06:10.380> you<00:06:10.530> frame<00:06:11.100> the

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
a little bit especially if you frame the

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.370 
a little bit especially if you frame the
shot<00:06:11.280> so<00:06:11.640> they<00:06:11.760> compose<00:06:12.180> either<00:06:12.510> towards<00:06:13.080> one

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
shot so they compose either towards one

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.230 
shot so they compose either towards one
side<00:06:13.680> of<00:06:13.920> the<00:06:13.980> fisheye<00:06:14.370> or<00:06:14.640> the<00:06:14.760> other<00:06:14.880> side<00:06:15.120> of

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
side of the fisheye or the other side of

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.030 
side of the fisheye or the other side of
the<00:06:15.300> fisheye<00:06:15.660> frame<00:06:15.960> because<00:06:16.590> what<00:06:16.770> happens

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
the fisheye frame because what happens

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.010 
the fisheye frame because what happens
with<00:06:17.160> the<00:06:17.250> fisheye<00:06:17.550> lens<00:06:17.790> is<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:18.390> further

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.540 
with the fisheye lens is the further
towards<00:06:19.410> the<00:06:19.500> edge<00:06:19.620> they<00:06:19.800> get<00:06:19.980> the<00:06:20.190> smaller

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
towards the edge they get the smaller

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.180 
towards the edge they get the smaller
they<00:06:20.730> become<00:06:21.090> and<00:06:21.300> by<00:06:22.260> doing<00:06:22.440> so<00:06:22.530> it<00:06:22.740> makes<00:06:23.100> it

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
they become and by doing so it makes it

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.170 
they become and by doing so it makes it
look<00:06:23.250> like<00:06:23.520> they're<00:06:23.640> actually<00:06:23.700> going<00:06:24.030> a<00:06:24.090> lot

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
look like they're actually going a lot

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.870 
look like they're actually going a lot
faster<00:06:24.420> than<00:06:24.780> they<00:06:24.870> are<00:06:24.900> on<00:06:25.020> the<00:06:25.170> right<00:06:25.410> away

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
faster than they are on the right away

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.430 
faster than they are on the right away
when<00:06:26.880> we<00:06:26.970> first<00:06:27.210> film<00:06:27.480> this<00:06:27.600> line<00:06:27.840> I<00:06:28.140> didn't

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
when we first film this line I didn't

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.690 
when we first film this line I didn't
really<00:06:28.650> like<00:06:28.800> that<00:06:29.040> there<00:06:29.190> was<00:06:29.310> a<00:06:29.340> harsh

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
really like that there was a harsh

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.330 
really like that there was a harsh
shadow<00:06:30.060> of<00:06:30.360> my<00:06:30.600> camera

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
shadow of my camera

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.879 
shadow of my camera
the<00:06:31.430> legs<00:06:31.669> at<00:06:31.880> the<00:06:31.940> end<00:06:32.150> so<00:06:32.960> Aiden<00:06:33.530> threw<00:06:33.710> in<00:06:33.800> a

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
the legs at the end so Aiden threw in a

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:35.650 
the legs at the end so Aiden threw in a
little<00:06:33.980> hippie<00:06:34.370> hop<00:06:34.550> just<00:06:34.820> to<00:06:34.970> avoid<00:06:35.150> that<00:06:35.389> and

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
little hippie hop just to avoid that and

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:46.390 
little hippie hop just to avoid that and
make<00:06:35.990> it<00:06:36.020> a<00:06:36.169> little<00:06:36.290> bit<00:06:36.470> more<00:06:36.590> fun<00:06:45.220> if<00:06:46.220> the

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
make it a little bit more fun if the

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.890 
make it a little bit more fun if the
loan<00:06:46.580> doesn't<00:06:46.820> call<00:06:47.120> for<00:06:47.300> you<00:06:47.389> to<00:06:47.479> come<00:06:47.690> to<00:06:47.720> a

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
loan doesn't call for you to come to a

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.260 
loan doesn't call for you to come to a
complete<00:06:48.229> stop<00:06:48.710> at<00:06:48.919> the<00:06:49.040> end<00:06:49.220> then<00:06:49.790> maybe<00:06:50.180> you

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
complete stop at the end then maybe you

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.820 
complete stop at the end then maybe you
want<00:06:50.389> to<00:06:50.419> think<00:06:50.630> of<00:06:50.720> a<00:06:50.840> nice<00:06:50.990> transition<00:06:51.470> out

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
want to think of a nice transition out

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.379 
want to think of a nice transition out
from<00:06:52.070> the<00:06:52.190> line<00:06:52.370> kinda<00:06:52.910> like<00:06:53.000> we<00:06:53.120> talked<00:06:53.300> about

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:53.389 
from the line kinda like we talked about

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:54.430 
from the line kinda like we talked about
for<00:06:53.720> the<00:06:53.750> intro

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440

panning into the ground or just
something<00:06:57.800> that<00:06:57.949> will<00:06:58.160> give<00:06:58.340> the<00:06:58.580> editor<00:06:59.030> a

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
something that will give the editor a

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.550 
something that will give the editor a
little<00:06:59.300> bit<00:06:59.419> of<00:06:59.510> room<00:06:59.720> to<00:06:59.750> work<00:07:00.050> with<00:07:00.110> on<00:07:00.440> the

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 
little bit of room to work with on the

little bit of room to work with on the
cut<00:07:00.770> point<00:07:01.070> and<00:07:01.280> again<00:07:02.000> if<00:07:02.750> they<00:07:02.870> need<00:07:03.020> to<00:07:03.050> make

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:03.169 
cut point and again if they need to make

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:04.900 
cut point and again if they need to make
a<00:07:03.290> dissolve<00:07:03.710> or<00:07:03.919> a<00:07:03.950> transition<00:07:04.520> it<00:07:04.669> can<00:07:04.790> have

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:04.910 
a dissolve or a transition it can have

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.550 
a dissolve or a transition it can have
something<00:07:05.240> nice<00:07:05.389> to<00:07:05.450> fade<00:07:05.960> into<00:07:06.169> the<00:07:06.260> next

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
something nice to fade into the next

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.520 
something nice to fade into the next
shot<00:07:07.600> so<00:07:08.600> that<00:07:08.720> was<00:07:08.840> just<00:07:08.930> some<00:07:09.110> starting

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
shot so that was just some starting

a<00:07:11.900> lot<00:07:12.560> of<00:07:12.650> this<00:07:12.770> stuff<00:07:12.979> is<00:07:13.100> actually<00:07:13.220> very

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:13.669 
a lot of this stuff is actually very

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:15.790 
a lot of this stuff is actually very
instinctive<00:07:14.060> to<00:07:14.479> most<00:07:14.660> skaters<00:07:15.169> if<00:07:15.530> they've

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
instinctive to most skaters if they've

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.800 
instinctive to most skaters if they've
watched<00:07:16.040> a<00:07:16.160> lot<00:07:16.280> of<00:07:16.400> skate<00:07:16.610> videos<00:07:16.970> it's<00:07:17.720> just

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
watched a lot of skate videos it's just

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.990 
watched a lot of skate videos it's just
a<00:07:17.990> matter<00:07:18.139> of<00:07:18.350> trial<00:07:18.650> and<00:07:18.800> error<00:07:18.889> and<00:07:19.310> practice

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 
a matter of trial and error and practice

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.450 
a matter of trial and error and practice
and<00:07:20.300> just<00:07:20.330> getting<00:07:20.690> the<00:07:20.870> timing<00:07:21.470> down<00:07:21.919> the

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 
and just getting the timing down the

angles down and just generally getting a

we're going to cover this a little bit
more<00:07:28.729> extensively<00:07:29.300> and<00:07:29.570> deal<00:07:29.720> with<00:07:29.870> some<00:07:30.020> of

more extensively and deal with some of

more extensively and deal with some of

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 
lines like going through different

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.990 
lines like going through different
lighting<00:07:33.350> conditions<00:07:33.500> during<00:07:34.160> the<00:07:34.370> line<00:07:34.550> from
