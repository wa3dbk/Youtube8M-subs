a brief history on it basically the gem

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.260 
a brief history on it basically the gem
box<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.079> gem<00:00:46.379> box<00:00:46.559> update<00:00:47.070> had<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.640> minor<00:00:47.910> bug

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
box the gem box update had a minor bug

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.700 
box the gem box update had a minor bug
in<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> where<00:00:48.719> people<00:00:48.899> would<00:00:49.170> open<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> gem

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
in it where people would open the gem

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.869 
in it where people would open the gem
box<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.190> they<00:00:50.250> wouldn't<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:50.640> get

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
box and they wouldn't really get

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.410 
box and they wouldn't really get
anything

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
anything

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.680 
anything
so<00:00:52.050> basically<00:00:52.590> supercell<00:00:53.190> has<00:00:53.489> patched<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.570> up

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
so basically supercell has patched it up

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.240 
so basically supercell has patched it up
but<00:00:55.050> they<00:00:55.260> said<00:00:55.500> they<00:00:55.649> wouldn't<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.010> able<00:00:56.129> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
but they said they wouldn't be able to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.790 
but they said they wouldn't be able to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
you guys how to get the gem box so you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.070 
you guys how to get the gem box so you
guys<00:01:12.990> are<00:01:13.170> ready<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.799> when<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> comes<00:01:14.220> out

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
guys are ready for it when it comes out

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.170 
guys are ready for it when it comes out
now<00:01:16.080> basically<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.920> gem<00:01:17.159> box<00:01:17.310> acts<00:01:17.670> as<00:01:17.939> an

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
now basically the gem box acts as an

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.719 
now basically the gem box acts as an
obstacle<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.009> by

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
obstacle so you can get it just by

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.600 
obstacle so you can get it just by
clearing<00:01:21.119> trees<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.780> everything<00:01:22.409> else<00:01:22.610> so

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
clearing trees and everything else so

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.429 
clearing trees and everything else so
the<00:01:23.790> way<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.450> basically<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.110> clear

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the way to get it is basically to clear

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.010 
the way to get it is basically to clear
out<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.830> much<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.210> guys<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.750> see

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
out as much as you can you guys can see

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.450 
out as much as you can you guys can see
my<00:01:28.140> base<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.470> don't<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.710> any<00:01:28.829> obstacles<00:01:29.340> at

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
my base I don't have any obstacles at

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.850 
my base I don't have any obstacles at
the<00:01:29.549> moment<00:01:29.990> which<00:01:30.990> basically<00:01:31.500> works<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the moment which basically works the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.399 
the moment which basically works the
same<00:01:32.009> way<00:01:32.189> as<00:01:32.310> any<00:01:32.460> other<00:01:32.689> tree<00:01:33.689> Rock<00:01:34.140> or

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
same way as any other tree Rock or

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.710 
same way as any other tree Rock or
anything<00:01:34.619> else<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:35.939> clear<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.450> much<00:01:36.600> as

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
anything else you just clear as much as

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.780 
anything else you just clear as much as
you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.350> you'll<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.619> more<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.640> have

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
you can and you'll get more if you have

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.060 
you can and you'll get more if you have
it<00:01:38.909> more<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.750> more<00:01:39.900> cleared<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.409> so

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
it more if you have more cleared out so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.710 
it more if you have more cleared out so
the<00:01:41.220> gem<00:01:41.430> box<00:01:41.579> works<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> same<00:01:42.180> way<00:01:42.329> once<00:01:42.630> you

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the gem box works the same way once you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.740 
the gem box works the same way once you
have<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> lot<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.970> almost<00:01:44.970> everything<00:01:45.329> cleared

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
have a lot of almost everything cleared

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.660 
have a lot of almost everything cleared
out<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.140> probably<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> higher<00:01:47.189> percent

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
out you probably have a higher percent

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.330 
out you probably have a higher percent
chance<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.090> getting<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.570> gem<00:01:48.810> box<00:01:49.130> then<00:01:50.130> if

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
chance of getting the gem box then if

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.990 
chance of getting the gem box then if
your<00:01:50.549> base<00:01:50.759> was<00:01:51.000> cluttered<00:01:51.479> with<00:01:51.810> obstacles

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
your base was cluttered with obstacles

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.190 
your base was cluttered with obstacles
that<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.180> already<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.899> haven't

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
that you already that you haven't

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.899 
that you already that you haven't
cleared<00:01:55.380> out<00:01:55.530> yet<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.770> definitely<00:01:56.460> keep<00:01:56.729> those

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
cleared out yet so definitely keep those

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.030 
cleared out yet so definitely keep those
cleared<00:01:57.180> out<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.540> I'll<00:01:58.079> probably<00:01:58.619> post

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
cleared out and I'll probably post

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.730 
cleared out and I'll probably post
another<00:01:59.369> video<00:01:59.780> once<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.409> gem<00:02:01.590> box

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
another video once I do get the gem box

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.469 
another video once I do get the gem box
or<00:02:02.009> once<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> next<00:02:02.640> patch<00:02:02.850> comes<00:02:03.149> out<00:02:03.299> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
or once the next patch comes out and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.600 
or once the next patch comes out and
hopefully<00:02:04.110> I'll<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.040> gem<00:02:05.219> box<00:02:05.369> right

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
hopefully I'll get the gem box right

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.389 
hopefully I'll get the gem box right
away<00:02:05.640> unlike<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> Christmas<00:02:06.750> trees<00:02:07.129> not<00:02:08.129> not

to<00:02:08.550> bring<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.789> past<00:02:09.030> grievances<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
to bring up past grievances but I know a

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.990 
to bring up past grievances but I know a
lot<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.310> guys<00:02:11.370> haven't<00:02:11.760> gotten<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
lot of you guys haven't gotten the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.449 
lot of you guys haven't gotten the
Christmas<00:02:12.360> tree<00:02:12.629> myself<00:02:12.989> included

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
Christmas tree myself included

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.339 
Christmas tree myself included
but<00:02:14.849> that's<00:02:15.300> nothing<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.660> worry<00:02:15.810> about<00:02:15.870> we<00:02:16.230> got

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
but that's nothing to worry about we got

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.190 
but that's nothing to worry about we got
gems<00:02:16.620> coming<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.910> before<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.480> before<00:02:19.019> I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
gems coming so I and before I before I

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.320 
gems coming so I and before I before I
go<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.620> think<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.280> gem<00:02:20.489> box

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
go I think the gem box

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.210 
go I think the gem box
don't<00:02:22.170> don't<00:02:22.410> quote<00:02:22.530> me<00:02:22.739> on<00:02:22.769> this<00:02:22.860> but<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.160> think

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
don't don't quote me on this but I think

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.309 
don't don't quote me on this but I think
there's<00:02:23.519> about<00:02:23.730> thirty<00:02:24.150> gems<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> gem<00:02:25.080> box

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
there's about thirty gems in the gem box

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.290 
there's about thirty gems in the gem box
around<00:02:25.980> 30<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.459> it's<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.700> lot<00:02:26.849> more<00:02:27.000> than<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
around 30 so it's a lot more than the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.479 
around 30 so it's a lot more than the
normal<00:02:27.660> obstacles<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:28.800> stay<00:02:29.099> tuned<00:02:29.280> for

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
normal obstacles but I stay tuned for

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.830 
normal obstacles but I stay tuned for
that<00:02:29.519> video<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.090> I'm<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.360> post<00:02:30.569> and

that video that I'm going to post and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.150
