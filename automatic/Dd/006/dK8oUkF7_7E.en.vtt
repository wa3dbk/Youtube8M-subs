thought<00:04:44.300> that's<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.810> big<00:04:44.930> question<00:04:45.050> and<00:04:45.680> in

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
thought that's the big question and in

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.160 
thought that's the big question and in
their<00:04:45.950> house<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.730> see<00:04:47.120> stay<00:04:47.390> cool<00:04:47.690> it<00:04:47.990> means

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.130 
their house and see stay cool it means
something<00:04:48.530> and<00:04:48.590> spitting<00:04:49.010> around<00:04:49.190> uncle<00:04:50.140> he

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140
