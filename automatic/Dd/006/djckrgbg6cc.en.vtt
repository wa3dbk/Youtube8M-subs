00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
two downstairs I remember maybe three I

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.640 
two downstairs I remember maybe three I
am<00:03:22.190> not<00:03:22.490> completely<00:03:22.820> sure<00:03:23.000> but<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:24.380> is<00:03:24.440> the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
am not completely sure but this is the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.560 
am not completely sure but this is the
door<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.190> you've<00:03:25.400> used<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.790> past<00:03:26.000> number<00:03:26.270> on

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
door that you've used the past number on

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.690 
door that you've used the past number on
and<00:03:26.990> then<00:03:27.230> we'll<00:03:27.410> just<00:03:27.560> need<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:28.010> back<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.550> the

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
and then we'll just need you back to the

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.990 
and then we'll just need you back to the
room<00:03:28.940> with<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.900> battery<00:03:30.530> or<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.610> room<00:03:31.790> right

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
room with the battery or the room right

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.180 
room with the battery or the room right
next<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:32.990> yeah<00:03:33.350> it's<00:03:33.530> not<00:03:33.710> really<00:03:33.980> worth

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
next to it so yeah it's not really worth

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.460 
next to it so yeah it's not really worth
it<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.820> guess<00:03:35.420> that's<00:03:35.600> another<00:03:35.720> way<00:03:35.990> to<00:03:36.050> get<00:03:36.260> to

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
it I guess that's another way to get to

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.260 
it I guess that's another way to get to
the<00:03:36.560> battery<00:03:39.490> looking<00:03:40.490> back<00:03:40.880> at<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.150> I

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
the battery looking back at it I

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.300 
the battery looking back at it I
probably<00:03:41.510> wasn't<00:03:41.780> smart<00:03:42.350> if<00:03:42.500> I<00:03:42.620> went<00:03:42.830> this<00:03:43.100> way

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
probably wasn't smart if I went this way

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.340 
probably wasn't smart if I went this way
that<00:03:43.520> way<00:03:43.670> I<00:03:43.730> wouldn't<00:03:44.270> have<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.420> backtrack<00:03:44.840> so

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
that way I wouldn't have to backtrack so

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.210 
that way I wouldn't have to backtrack so
much<00:03:45.590> oh<00:03:45.920> well<00:03:47.350> what<00:03:48.350> can<00:03:48.590> you<00:03:48.680> do<00:03:48.860> when<00:03:49.100> you're

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
much oh well what can you do when you're

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.330 
much oh well what can you do when you're
stupid<00:03:49.670> like<00:03:50.120> me<00:03:50.860> well<00:03:51.860> if<00:03:51.950> I<00:03:52.070> didn't

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
stupid like me well if I didn't

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.620 
stupid like me well if I didn't
backtrack<00:03:52.730> down<00:03:52.910> there<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.150> probably<00:03:53.360> could

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
backtrack down there I probably could

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.880 
backtrack down there I probably could
have<00:03:53.720> shown<00:03:53.960> you<00:03:53.990> guys<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:54.410> cool<00:03:54.620> cinematic

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
have shown you guys that cool cinematic

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.130 
have shown you guys that cool cinematic
with<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.370> kitchen<00:03:55.520> so<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.150> guess<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:57.020> was<00:03:57.110> worth

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
with the kitchen so I guess it was worth

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.640 
with the kitchen so I guess it was worth
it

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
it

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.340 
it
um<00:03:58.220> on<00:03:58.640> this<00:03:58.850> table<00:03:59.120> you'll<00:03:59.450> find<00:03:59.720> more<00:03:59.870> magnum

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
um on this table you'll find more magnum

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.410 
um on this table you'll find more magnum
rounds<00:04:00.500> which<00:04:00.980> I<00:04:01.160> don't<00:04:01.340> mean<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.240> will

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
rounds which I don't mean and you will

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.140 
rounds which I don't mean and you will
find<00:04:02.980> shotgun<00:04:03.980> rounds<00:04:04.460> they<00:04:04.640> probably<00:04:04.910> have

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
find shotgun rounds they probably have

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.960
