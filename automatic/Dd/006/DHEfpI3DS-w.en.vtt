00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.490
 Hello, I want to show you today 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:14.519
 simple snap it is done from 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.519
 scrap materials as they say 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:25.599
 it is intended for carp fishing 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:29.320
 can I catch bream as a nozzle 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:33.940
 I use this tool so 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.500
 called pepper is very convenient in the end 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.490
 we should end up with something 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.890
 like hair tooling only from the most 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.380
 simple improvised means like I already 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.130
 said 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.110
 how to fit very easy to start 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:54.220
 kept on a separate piece of fishing line as 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.810
 normal lead take the right diameter 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:03.149
 fishing line or cord 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:07.320
 it doesn't matter and knit 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.240
 so first you need to wear a fishing line 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.479
 the usual 100 threshold 100 park is better to take 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.120
 as small as possible here at me 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:23.049
 now rather large is better to take 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:26.290
 Smaller further knit at the end of the line 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:29.500
 regular loop loop need 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.510
 try to tie as little as possible 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.159
 size 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:39.030
 so the gear we will have will look more 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:45.299
 of such aesthetically gradually 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.299
 we pull up do not forget to moisten 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:57.820
 the excess tip will cut so now we 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:02.460
 do here we have such here 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:09.190
 construction is now folding 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:16.770
 fishing line main above our loops twice 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:20.500
 and the resulting loop is passed through the wound 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.790
 we made a loop that happened here 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.790
 like such a stranglehold 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.840
 further tighten the stopper very close and 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.670
 now I have a real pepper at hand 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.430
 there is no such stump 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:49.170
 use as him 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:54.450
 documentation we push it into our 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:58.140
 stranglehold that made tighten and 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:02.280
 we pull up 100 park 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.280
 the result is what we did and 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.280
 Now 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:16.860
 take the hook 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:18.980
 the right size we pass the line in the ear 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.980
 hook 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:32.000
 approximately we look where to us to fix it 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:38.670
 it is necessary to wind further 5-6 times 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:43.220
 fishing line around the forearm hook and return 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.220
 the tip of the fishing line back into the eye of the hook and 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:52.620
 delay and that's what we have in the end 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:56.970
 It turns out as I said, like 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:01.520
 hair snap but fit out of that 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.590
 what is on hand literally in a minute 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.640
 maybe it looks not very nice sti 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.330
 aesthetically pleasing but trust me quite working 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.050
 rigging 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:17.900
 I successfully caught a big crucian on it 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:21.140
 and small karpikov hope this video 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.430
 it was useful and interesting to someone 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.010
 subscribe to my channel 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.100
 good luck fishing all the best to 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.100
