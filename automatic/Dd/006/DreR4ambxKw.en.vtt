00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.809
 hello florian you are up for that 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.120
 current issue with the smallest notebooks 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.520
 with mini ssds set apart four 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.740
 Devices of it tested and write in 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.320
 principle, these are the ideal second devices 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.720
 on the way why you just tested 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.270
 were mini notebooks so current 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.829
 netbook the class are small devices 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.170
 should help maxi 14 14 inches are light 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.630
 have long terms and on the go 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.860
 to own everything you need 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.170
 but if you say they are the only ones 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.489
 modern netbooks what can you do 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.960
 to do with it earlier did not go there 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.059
 I went to it much earlier, at least 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.339
 right now are almost already 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.530
 So you want to say grown up 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.089
 to look up to hd video any 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.530
 things web pages browser with flash and 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.969
 so on, no problem with that 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.920
 only with time- consuming things like that 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.359
 video editing photo editing so what in 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.039
 the direction that there is a bit now 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.870
 warmly at the devices but it only for 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.879
 Consuming media perfectly suited 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.150
 okay I have in the table times 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.880
 rummaged and seen cpu s there 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.200
 always count or something to that is 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.330
 of course, where you think anyway oje 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.550
 Of course these are the snores 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.140
 pillow but will think celeron 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.360
 is faster than an ebt in that's right 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.500
 That 's not true because there' s in the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.660
 market inc is a bit ragged 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.790
 meanwhile, however, there is a cell workload too 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.410
 we must have these devices is the atom 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.330
 inside living means the same 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.590
 Kerns in that case it was even so 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.210
 The devices of the atom had four 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.590
 rake cores and the zelda fans we 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.960
 only two of them had that 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.070
 actually the atom even faster 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:40.040
 okay that means it's not necessarily 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.660
 slower than celeron I came because I have 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.520
 somehow chance somehow to the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.810
 Definitions really recognize something 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.400
 which now the faster or 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.620
 slower is or should there still 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.700
 So the bands and zelda us with atom in the 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.830
 they have an end to life 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.090
 processor number that still exists 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.410
 with kooi inside so the 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.760
 stripped-down core processors that have 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.360
 Do not end this as you can 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.100
 recognize 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.420
 okay that means there you have to go 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.580
 Pay attention otherwise you will suddenly buy 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.830
 what and is very depressed as slow 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.880
 maybe the whole thing is the cpu 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.710
 ultimately the fastest of the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.489
 memory space is also quite close 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.959
 measured 32 gb ssds inter drin I can 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.250
 expand your memory somehow no 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.379
 that is not so the memory are 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.239
 all soldered on the motherboard and 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.830
 so is there anything so you can the 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.300
 stuck usb stick or 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.860
 Insert memory card so that works 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.720
 but at least inters up 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.370
 is not two of the devices that I 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.900
 Had two internal hard drives 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.040
 bay in there is also the state 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.210
 connection already missing where you then 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.870
 could someday close with that 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.600
 also obsolete 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.340
 ok and otherwise put the device on 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.110
 cloud storage, I have exactly the sets 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.550
 on cloud storage as three out of four 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.830
 devices also had cloud storage 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.090
 it was two times 100 gigabytes for two 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.010
 years in microsofts 23 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.080
 and that beaus device was in the committee 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.940
 own web storage service equal to 500 gb 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.560
 for two years is just as always one 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.120
 that means after two you have to do it yourself 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.710
 we pay for it then suddenly 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.940
 my netbook is more expensive or i use it 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.000
 Maybe not right now anyway 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.770
 You never know more than that 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.270
 if I say okay now that's me 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.970
 but a little too slow the whole 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.290
 or the memory question is me then 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.450
 but too short 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.190
 how much do I have to put on it 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.570
 now in the next better class too 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.970
 come and still so mobile too 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.260
 So stay tuned for in this netbook 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.610
 a processor performance to stay now 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.959
 with more space there is enough 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.220
 little more the divine law 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.959
 are going on at 200 euros 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.420
 where more expensive until we were there 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.220
 even for 250 to 300 euro gets 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.660
 you end up the same thing 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.610
 hardware plus holder with a big one 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.410
 Hard disk is a 320 or 500 gb 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.810
 that means you have memory neat 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.340
 even on the way and then 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.780
 about where to go if you have videos 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.670
 or music has where you want then 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.019
 I can start immediately and if I can 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.250
 want a fast processor 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.810
 will I have to go 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.430
 then it will be a bit more expensive 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.810
 it's also difficult to say and me 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.370
 I said I have a device in the test 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.900
 that is already 400 euro expensive but has 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.400
 just had this processor for the 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.470
 price you get already devices with 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.720
 celeron pentium today with cohen 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.070
 equipped living are still a 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.420
 a bit more computing power is there 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.220
 You could even play a game on the go 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.489
 play is still such a game 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.200
 Thing 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.910
 3d chips are synonymous not to the in 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.470
 they are not like that 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.840
 fastest mixa for HD videos range 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.950
 sometimes for google earth but 3d 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.150
 games are fun 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.150
 OK thanks
