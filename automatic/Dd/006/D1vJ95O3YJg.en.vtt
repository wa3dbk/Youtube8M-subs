00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
there and I I wanted a bag that was a

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.150 
there and I I wanted a bag that was a
little<00:03:16.630> bit<00:03:16.780> bigger<00:03:17.080> because<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.590> do<00:03:17.650> have<00:03:17.829> my

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
little bit bigger because I do have my

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.940 
little bit bigger because I do have my
gray<00:03:18.430> crossbody<00:03:18.700> bag<00:03:19.239> but<00:03:19.480> it's<00:03:19.630> suede<00:03:20.019> so<00:03:20.709> it

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
gray crossbody bag but it's suede so it

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.280 
gray crossbody bag but it's suede so it
doesn't<00:03:21.400> really<00:03:21.940> go<00:03:22.299> well<00:03:22.480> with<00:03:22.690> fancier

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
doesn't really go well with fancier

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.500 
doesn't really go well with fancier
outfit<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.340> wanted<00:03:24.640> something<00:03:24.880> similar<00:03:25.480> to

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
outfit so I wanted something similar to

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.180 
outfit so I wanted something similar to
that<00:03:25.630> like<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:25.959> little<00:03:26.170> bit<00:03:26.290> bigger<00:03:26.530> but<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.010> I

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
that like a little bit bigger but that I

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.110 
that like a little bit bigger but that I
could<00:03:27.489> dress<00:03:28.150> up<00:03:28.230> easier<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:30.130> picked<00:03:31.030> up

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
could dress up easier so I picked up

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.330 
could dress up easier so I picked up
this<00:03:31.420> one<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.930> was<00:03:32.049> originally<00:03:32.340> seventy

dollars and i got it for 40 so 30 bucks
off<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.799> thought<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.040> was<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.220> pretty<00:03:36.280> good

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
off I thought that was a pretty good

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.460 
off I thought that was a pretty good
deal<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:36.970> think<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.630> size<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:37.870> really<00:03:38.320> nice

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
deal I think the size is really nice

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.199 
deal I think the size is really nice
it's<00:03:38.769> not<00:03:38.950> too<00:03:39.250> big<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.610> doesn't<00:03:39.640> like<00:03:39.940> drown

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
it's not too big it doesn't like drown

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.520 
it's not too big it doesn't like drown
me<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.510> looks<00:03:40.660> pretty<00:03:40.750> big<00:03:41.019> on<00:03:41.140> camera

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
me it looks pretty big on camera

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.650 
me it looks pretty big on camera
actually<00:03:41.709> but<00:03:42.190> it's<00:03:42.790> really<00:03:43.000> not<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:43.540> it

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
actually but it's really not and it

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.440 
actually but it's really not and it
comes<00:03:43.870> with<00:03:43.989> a<00:03:44.260> strap<00:03:45.070> if<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.400> wanna<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:46.420> know

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
comes with a strap if you wanna you know

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.110 
comes with a strap if you wanna you know
do<00:03:46.720> cross<00:03:46.989> body<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.860> that<00:03:48.100> has<00:03:48.340> like<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.730> gold

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.259 
do cross body and that has like the gold
accents<00:03:49.930> so<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:50.350> liked<00:03:50.860> it<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.310> like<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:51.970> said<00:03:52.030> it

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
accents so I liked it and like I said it

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.840 
accents so I liked it and like I said it
didn't<00:03:52.600> look<00:03:52.750> like<00:03:52.810> I<00:03:53.200> was<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.920> know<00:03:53.950> carrying

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
didn't look like I was you know carrying

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.990 
didn't look like I was you know carrying
a<00:03:55.150> diaper<00:03:56.019> bag<00:03:56.320> because<00:03:57.160> sometimes<00:03:57.400> big<00:03:57.790> bags

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
a diaper bag because sometimes big bags

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.970 
a diaper bag because sometimes big bags
tend<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.630> look<00:03:59.019> like<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.350> and<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.590> also<00:03:59.709> fits

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
tend to look like that and it also fits

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.190 
tend to look like that and it also fits
really<00:04:00.190> nicely<00:04:00.459> under<00:04:00.790> my<00:04:00.910> arm<00:04:01.120> nice<00:04:01.750> and<00:04:01.810> snug

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
really nicely under my arm nice and snug

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.229 
really nicely under my arm nice and snug
and<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:03.040> big<00:04:03.190> enough<00:04:03.220> i<00:04:03.519> think<00:04:03.760> that<00:04:03.940> if<00:04:04.060> i

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
and it's big enough i think that if i

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.780 
and it's big enough i think that if i
want<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.230> carry<00:04:05.440> books<00:04:05.860> in<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.220> for<00:04:06.519> school<00:04:06.760> i

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
want to carry books in it for school i

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.729 
want to carry books in it for school i
think<00:04:07.090> i<00:04:07.180> can<00:04:07.239> so<00:04:07.660> we'll<00:04:08.290> see<00:04:08.410> how<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.530> goes

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
think i can so we'll see how that goes

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.770 
think i can so we'll see how that goes

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
because that's what I do and it's just

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.500 
because that's what I do and it's just
this<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.620> crewneck<00:04:36.130> sweatshirt<00:04:36.610> I<00:04:36.790> love<00:04:37.240> this

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
color it just says pink right there and

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.940 
color it just says pink right there and

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
then there's nothing on the back which I

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.770 
then there's nothing on the back which I
like<00:04:42.310> because<00:04:42.520> I<00:04:42.670> hate<00:04:42.940> when<00:04:43.090> pink<00:04:43.390> puts<00:04:43.600> like
