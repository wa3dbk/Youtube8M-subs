00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.990
 Hi guys 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.090
 today I wanted to show how to consider 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.540
 a dress for your fiancÃ© is very easy 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.080
 just need stitching by the good button is the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.410
 next you will need a 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.410
 scissors 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.210
 the needle and thread if you will make this 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:37.800
 way 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:40.320
 the fabric is light is some buttons there were 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.940
 many who are of the little hearts 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.719
 mine are in that box 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:51.649
 first you have to get your needle 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:55.260
 and pass the line 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.120
 I already passed the needle through the line and did not 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.340
 were you can do that vehicle 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:06.420
 now you have to get the cloth measuring 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.630
 his furb as already mehdi and daughters who 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.790
 You'd better get out of here. 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.170
 I already know more or less the extent to which 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.350
 The measurement is basically 32 centimeters 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.900
 of my daughter I do not know if it can be 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.450
 very different so I better be 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.630
 too lazy to understand my tape 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.630
 metric 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:47.549
 look the person already opened the tape measure 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:50.640
 a thing in a 3241 untitled but 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.100
 No one in your house is the following if you 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.329
 want to score by how easy it is for you 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.700
 make it appear better you are 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.390
 from havana but abu hashim forget my self 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.719
 in you can simply insurance is like this 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.719
 looks 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.140
 look here I want is not my insurance 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.780
 here and I'm going to do some things myself 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.319
 I 'm going, I 'm going to go the staff here 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.860
 lived here my here is so 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.190
 Then you take a pair of scissors and cut my 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.190
 It was that straight line so I cut 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.870
 in that line is so good so exactly 41 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.780
 without titles 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.280
 I have already cut this staff arm I 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.470
 I'll save 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.739
 now this is what we will cut out of 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.930
 new only the size you identify yourself 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.850
 bay, for example, that width 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.890
 and cut into that trap you want 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.170
 stay like that not if you 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.130
 you want to stay very long and let it 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.769
 same 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.860
 so you choose width that you 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.680
 want to put good size I'm going to cut 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.739
 more or less here, inspiration, second 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.450
 cut good staff got very straight 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.790
 I hope one of you that faster 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.390
 that my son and mine are also half crooked 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.459
 huh 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:15.739
 but now look at the following there is now 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:20.000
 the hot button part you button 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.709
 where will you put the button for you? 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.650
 tighten your furb 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:31.280
 Good , you're going here and preferably. 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.420
 even on the button, I'll choose one 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.030
 button 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.450
 I thought the bank would be nice 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.370
 Stay that way, I'll get a blank for me. 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.489
 First you went the next. Philip is 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.489
 good 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.190
 closing the window is fine, now it's the 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.569
 next staff you have to sew 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:57.230
 this button that reminds me of the chicken 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:00.100
 so needle then you have to get the 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.100
 my tac 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.909
 to enjoy the button you have to stay 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.370
 doing the milk zig zag in these deals 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.040
 and Sorin is good now convince I will 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.510
 to sew personal mourning is how it stayed 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.769
 the button I decided to deal with you there 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:23.070
 if you 're like this if you think you stayed 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.260
 very big is your chance to change 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.150
 Can you make it a little smaller for me? 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
 in fact this here is my candy in 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.780
 my tail 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.270
 so I did a little smaller than I think 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.199
 that I hit is a little more - fat 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.690
 that likes 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.770
 now I'll cut here to stay longer 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.440
 cute 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.000
 this is how you will get girls 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.490
 they had this personal part now if you 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.360
 infected or you use the 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.430
 buttons plus buttons or do not use the way - 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.100
 if you want to face unless 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.560
 Do you want to do so look at the 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.750
 shop front button childhood without 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.000
 Problems were beautiful, same way. 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.070
 You can also make a v neck 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.560
 a business in polka dots 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.220
 Look, here, my airmail box is going 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.220
 open for you 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:19.700
 much less here we will now see what 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.880
 It gets better 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:31.050
 here I think it looks pretty cool 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:35.010
 here the lowest index until you make an equal 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.560
 I liked it for candy but I think it's better 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:41.010
 not 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:47.430
 sincerely thought about doing a level 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:49.349
 different is good - I decided to do it 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.930
 a business- like asset is one of 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:56.669
 Good to see, it's good to do now. 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.840
 my turn and it was the following you need 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.510
 of the scissors 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.919
 You have to cut well so can not 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.720
 Being too down has to be more 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.789
 Just as I 'll show you how it's done. 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.909
 stay 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:11.220
 Guys, I look more or less like this. 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:14.280
 But I did a little too much to 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.020
 the time you do a little more to 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.510
 A little faster than mine, okay? 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.980
 but if you do a little of everything well 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.070
 because you can put some 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.710
 more to the side has no rule 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:30.950
 now I thought of putting so look what 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:33.090
 beautiful gloss radinho 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.910
 not counting finance about 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.710
 same to you for one here like that 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:42.120
 The side I have here is fine, now I go. 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:44.070
 I'm going to quit, good girls, I run. 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.230
 the seamstress and I took advantage of 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.710
 because two buttons indicate to decorate 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.730
 so look looks like this 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.670
 The other one I did 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:58.430
 now I will remember a little bit of that 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:07:02.220
 little ribbon usa accepted it moreira 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.810
 good people this is so it stayed like this 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.740
 the ribbon 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:11.150
 Now I'll show you how it is then 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.150
 that's how it got in your pocket 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:22.550
 This is a good idea for now. 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.550
 bye
