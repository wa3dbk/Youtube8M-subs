00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
that the only thing I have to do now is

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.670 
that the only thing I have to do now is
wait<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.190> harvest<00:01:11.880> time<00:01:12.120> while<00:01:12.990> watering<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
garden as it grows I would rather do

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960 
garden as it grows I would rather do
more<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.860> waiting<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.460> less<00:01:17.730> of<00:01:17.910> the
