00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.430
 then I distract a new video many 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.740
 you ask me about faith and sangoy like that 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.140
 that I thought because he did not ask 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.300
 quickie saying what I think so 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.700
 Well your interest to know my opinion 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.620
 I want to be the video I have the skin 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.240
 fat so good for it to be 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.730
 last know question and especially if 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.710
 you have oily skin if it's worth it 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.730
 keep eating like he did not make you so 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.630
 good in this video game extra that 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.340
 first, it is a very broad base and 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.980
 I use the tone c3 you are interested in 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.110
 25 equivalent dawns a little bit maybe a 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.570
 maybe higher tone 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.309
 this is the mobile pizza try 120 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.309
 milliliters and good is that well 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.360
 has a dispenser 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.540
 so now I have to clean the 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.540
 true that is already a bitch 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.240
 and we are in which it applies for a 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:59.050
 super super light coverage one aspect 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.480
 good face unifies the tone does not have 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.610
 it provides almost nothing of coverage 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.370
 It has nothing of skin and it is great to 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.860
 mix with other bases this base the 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.680
 I recommend 100% of it is dry skin and 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.060
 you are looking for a good looking base or a 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.990
 juicy respect a very natural look 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.270
 with low coverage you will go great I 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.100
 I think what I'm going to do is throw away 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.260
 this base or if it will mix with other bases 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.360
 mind by itself apply a little bit of 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.490
 concealer below and leoncio apply this 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.010
 and it's great if it's a tad more than 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.050
 I recommend that you apply with 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.310
 hands this is going to be that no 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.540
 I recommend nothing that applies it is with 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.910
 adif and blender because I think it's going to 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.530
 absorb a lot of product and it's going to 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.660
 remove coverage that you just have then 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.610
 converted leander takes away almost everything 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.790
 so good with your hands or compresses 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.400
 the best option the century 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.940
 for mental oily skin from the point of 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.490
 view not because you have to work 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.520
 very much so that more or less you 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.100
 endure or not be so bright great 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.190
 juicy and I what I do when I use 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.229
 the teacher is to apply a first apply 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.560
 a layer of haarde feels very good 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.410
 about five minutes in these sessions 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.620
 Eyebrow is what you want to do and 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.950
 then he applied another layer and then applied a 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.840
 spray fixed makeup and then what 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.340
 it still went on after a few hours 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.800
 to have to re- qualify each of two 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.260
 by three where it seems to be a base 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.240
 that so you do not want to spend has in 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.980
 this base that has to be working 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.630
 both the skin and nuanced all day 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.400
 so good you can use it yes but 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.840
 I sincerely find it a lot of work 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.450
 and it's bases that are so much better than 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.550
 is now if you have dry skin this 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.040
 It is the second 100% because it is great I 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.080
 how it did not make you mixing with other 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.970
 bases the bases that the tone is not the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.350
 mine are very bad today if they want something 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.600
 juicy 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.700
 so playing a little with that so I 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.440
 love to mix I'm going to buy it 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.630
 I can because I will not work for myself 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.080
 Too much I think a little loss of 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.790
 time I do not know I have bases that is a 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.500
 state if you're already where you work so much 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.380
 the skin is good it is true that it remains 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.540
 beautiful for photos and for videos and 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.180
 others may have is 10 yen in the shot 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.980
 of the super natural but it's almost the skin 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.650
 fat have already bound us naturally is a 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.330
 fatty finish because there is too much 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.010
 brightness not though it motivates you and that is 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.020
 because you have to go back to 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.540
 verify every two by three I've 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.810
 said a very low opening but very 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.520
 low 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.200
 to verify a little antonio this is not 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.090
 it covers practically nothing so it 's 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.400
 good to apply a fourth job over 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.020
 in the areas that you want to correct to a 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.209
 marquita a zone and so on so good 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.860
 As I say that you spend you can buy it yes 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.269
 but I had worked the stone a lot 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.319
 in finds you have to modify each 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.319
 two times three 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.590
 If you have dry skin, buy it because 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.180
 let's go a lot if you want a culture 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.819
 very low and with a juicy finish and 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.470
 natural so good I hope it's done 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.660
 ok this video is very short but it is that I 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.860
 you ask a lot so I say because I 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.019
 They make a video and explained so 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.560
 well this has liked and we see 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.560
 well moved
