00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.800 
so auto-switching if you put out of here
the<00:00:21.800> computer<00:00:22.800> which<00:00:23.130> will<00:00:23.490> change<00:00:23.910> by<00:00:24.779> itself

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
the computer which will change by itself

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.990 
the computer which will change by itself
the<00:00:25.529> player<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.070> don't<00:00:26.400> want<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.699> do<00:00:26.820> that

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the player so you don't want to do that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.800 
the player so you don't want to do that
if<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.510> want<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.960> be<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.439> little<00:00:29.130> bit<00:00:29.369> of

professional<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.080> game<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.529> I'm<00:00:31.650> just

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
professional in this game so I'm just

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.060 
professional in this game so I'm just
going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.250> select<00:00:32.610> air<00:00:32.910> balls<00:00:33.559> because<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.890> my

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
going to select air balls because in my

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.110 
going to select air balls because in my
opinion<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.579> not<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.000> best<00:00:36.170> options<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
opinion this is not the best options the

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
opinion this is not the best options the
computer<00:00:39.120> only<00:00:39.390> changes<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.320> at<00:00:40.530> an

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
computer only changes for you at an

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.880 
computer only changes for you at an
interval<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.510> another<00:00:42.930> option<00:00:43.350> here

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
interval you have another option here

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.840 
interval you have another option here
it's<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:45.090> manual<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:47.010> really

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
it's the manual one but this is really

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.760 
it's the manual one but this is really
hard<00:00:48.090> because<00:00:48.300> sometimes<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.260> do<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:49.500> have

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
hard because sometimes you do not have

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.430 
hard because sometimes you do not have
the<00:00:49.920> time<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.219> switch<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.719> defender<00:00:52.230> when

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the time to switch to the defender when

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.920 
the time to switch to the defender when
your<00:00:52.620> opponent<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.190> making<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.670> cross<00:00:53.930> so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
your opponent is making a cross so

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.549 
your opponent is making a cross so
auto-switching<00:00:55.559> move<00:00:56.309> assistance<00:00:57.559> this

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
auto-switching move assistance this

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.770 
auto-switching move assistance this
depends<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.219> lot<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.430> your<00:01:00.030> personal

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
depends a lot on your personal

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.460 
depends a lot on your personal
preference<00:01:01.850> in<00:01:02.850> my<00:01:03.000> opinion<00:01:03.449> none<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
preference in my opinion none is the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530 
preference in my opinion none is the
best<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.309> want<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:05.820> all<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
best because you want to have all the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.679 
best because you want to have all the
control<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.760> in<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.060> moment<00:01:09.420> you

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
control you have in the moment you

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.440 
control you have in the moment you
change<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.320> your<00:01:10.560> player<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:11.909> example

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
change on your player so for example

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.590 
change on your player so for example
your<00:01:13.409> opponent<00:01:14.010> MEC<00:01:14.250> makes<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.850> long<00:01:15.060> pass<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
your opponent MEC makes a long pass and

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.960 
your opponent MEC makes a long pass and
you<00:01:15.869> want<00:01:16.110> instant<00:01:16.740> control<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.490> your<00:01:17.549> player

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you want instant control on your player

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.679 
you want instant control on your player
you<00:01:18.299> don't<00:01:18.570> want<00:01:18.810> him<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.490> keep<00:01:20.490> his<00:01:21.180> movement

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
you don't want him to keep his movement

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.510 
you don't want him to keep his movement
in<00:01:21.869> another<00:01:22.140> direction<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.009> don't<00:01:23.280> want

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
in another direction so you don't want

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.410 
in another direction so you don't want
to<00:01:23.700> select<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.270> low<00:01:24.689> or<00:01:24.990> high<00:01:26.000> just<00:01:27.000> put<00:01:27.180> none

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
to select here low or high just put none

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.120 
to select here low or high just put none
passing<00:01:28.170> power<00:01:28.350> assistance<00:01:29.720> this<00:01:30.920> will<00:01:31.920> mean

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
passing power assistance this will mean

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
passing power assistance this will mean
that<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.850> computer<00:01:33.329> will<00:01:33.540> help<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that the computer will help you with the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.340 
that the computer will help you with the
power<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.189> your<00:01:35.400> pest<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.840> sometimes

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
power of your pest but this sometimes

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.240 
power of your pest but this sometimes
can<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.799> tricky<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.729> passes<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.689> go

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
can be tricky and the passes can go

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.249 
can be tricky and the passes can go
where<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.640> not<00:01:41.759> want<00:01:42.060> them<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.299> go<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.020> I

the system's assisted cross I will put

for example assisted if you cross the
ball<00:01:58.950> doesn't<00:01:59.189> matter<00:01:59.490> the<00:02:00.060> intensity<00:02:00.600> or<00:02:00.899> the

will<00:02:04.140> automatically<00:02:05.130> cross<00:02:06.000> wherever<00:02:06.570> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
will automatically cross wherever it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.430 
will automatically cross wherever it
wants<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.710> cross<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:09.209> put<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.660> manual

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
wants to cross if you put the manual

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.460 
wants to cross if you put the manual
then<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.940> too<00:02:12.450> hard<00:02:12.720> in

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
then this is too hard in

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.870 
then this is too hard in
an<00:02:13.500> important<00:02:14.070> game<00:02:14.250> because<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.670> do<00:02:14.790> not

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
an important game because you do not

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.230 
an important game because you do not
have<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.240> time<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.810> give<00:02:16.590> both<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.280> precision

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
have the time to give both the precision

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.140 
have the time to give both the precision
of<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.870> direction<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.890> intensity<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:21.120> a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
of the direction and the intensity to a

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.910 
of the direction and the intensity to a
cross<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.320> best<00:02:22.530> option<00:02:22.740> here<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.700> semi

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
cross so the best option here is semi

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.740 
cross so the best option here is semi
low<00:02:25.920> pass<00:02:26.190> assistance<00:02:26.730> I've<00:02:26.880> seen<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> lot<00:02:27.570> of

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
low pass assistance I've seen a lot of

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.070 
low pass assistance I've seen a lot of
pro<00:02:27.990> players<00:02:28.290> using<00:02:28.920> assisted<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.910> do<00:02:30.810> not

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
pro players using assisted I do not

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.700 
pro players using assisted I do not
agree<00:02:31.320> with<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:31.950> think<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.340> computer

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
agree with this I think the computer

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.330 
agree with this I think the computer
makes<00:02:34.710> two<00:02:35.100> random<00:02:35.910> passes<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.960> your<00:02:37.340> player

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
makes two random passes to your player

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.320 
makes two random passes to your player
so<00:02:38.730> here<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.210> like<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.840> use<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.320> manual<00:02:41.330> option

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
so here I like to use the manual option

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.500 
so here I like to use the manual option
this<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.140> little<00:02:43.440> bit<00:02:43.620> tricky<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:44.670> if<00:02:44.940> you

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
this is a little bit tricky but if you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.290 
this is a little bit tricky but if you
master<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.080> then<00:02:46.620> low<00:02:47.070> passes<00:02:47.580> will<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:47.940> very

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
master it then low passes will be very

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.250 
master it then low passes will be very
very<00:02:48.630> good<00:02:49.520> safe<00:02:50.520> assistance<00:02:51.260> assisted

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
very good safe assistance assisted

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.710 
very good safe assistance assisted
analog<00:02:53.220> sprint<00:02:53.550> off<00:02:53.730> or<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.720> haven't<00:02:55.140> seen

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
analog sprint off or on I haven't seen

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.720 
analog sprint off or on I haven't seen
differences<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.930> game<00:02:58.380> with<00:02:59.010> these<00:02:59.190> options

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
differences in game with these options

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.199 
differences in game with these options
so<00:03:00.170> use<00:03:01.170> whatever<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.800> want<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.190> use<00:03:02.490> off<00:03:02.700> here
