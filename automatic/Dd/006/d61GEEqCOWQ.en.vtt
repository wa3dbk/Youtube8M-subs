00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 good what happens with you with your 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.859
 computer is that they have configured the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.679
 have another configuration language on 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.410
 language if it 's Spanish I do not know if you have it 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.580
 that things appear in English or in 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.690
 Spanish 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.690
 or spanish 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.779
 what happens with this keyboard is that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.410
 it has all changed all the symbols 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:33.000
 then if these chips the key and the 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.000
 letter 2 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.440
 and the letter 2 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.230
 is going to give you 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.350
 quotes if that is what you are 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.150
 happening now with that configuration 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.150
 The chips to the g 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.440
 rice that was what I needed that did not 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.420
 it's convenient because finally nothing 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.910
 it's going to coincide and you're never going to have 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.300
 that learn all the memory then the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.650
 idea is 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.650
 we are going to close here 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.240
 in your 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.490
 on your desk that is this whole page 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.070
 below these are shown that are preferences 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.100
 of the system 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.530
 you click there you go there 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.479
 and then they appear to you there, it's like 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.610
 all the configuration of all things 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.259
 then there is the mouse screen and the 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.990
 keyboard then you're going to look there 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.590
 internal 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.590
 the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.740
 there is international 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.150
 international and want and there will 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.570
 appear this icon 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.510
 or search directly for ipec language 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:02.360
 language in text or I do not know if it appears 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.360
 just like me why long way 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.289
 and good text then there 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.119
 you enter 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.300
 there 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.350
 center 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.240
 and in input source or input sources 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.430
 I do not know how I say it in Spanish if I 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.530
 you have is going to realize that the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.080
 The language indicated is Spanish 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.270
 spanish 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.270
 what you have to do is look 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.770
 Espanyol did Spanish did 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.770
 there 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.350
 there you select it you put the east 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.390
 and then 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.990
 you remove the selection of the other 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:55.450
 then you do not want to be there anymore 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.450
 configured is now you go out 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.940
 and you can try as you want 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.400
 we focus on word and you do not have word 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.530
 still but he will send it to you and 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.530
 then now when listening to 2 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:19.670
 2 you will get rice 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:24.470
 by explaining that he will not leave anymore 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.110
 a rare manzanita and they're going to 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.250
 match all the keys then with 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.910

 leave numeral with the 4 you will leave 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.220

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.630
