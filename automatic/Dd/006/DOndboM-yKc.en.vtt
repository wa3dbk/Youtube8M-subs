00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.770
 Hello everyone, I am Arthur and this video 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.759
 will be dedicated to the house for griefers 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:15.540
 well, or rather it will be for you and we 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.460
 servers where you can not give for example 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 chests well, you can bring the territory 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.670
 for example, I played on the server where 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.289
 not admin to privatize territory 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.060
 Well, not private in the chests, that is, he 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.029
 definitely gave territory 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:35.270
 Well, more precisely, we can say where you are 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.270
 do you want and they are there you live there 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:45.570
 so here and built for example from 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.460
 this house an hour and then you can go 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.950
 say something fun but it doesn't matter 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.340
 because the territory can be taken 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.340
 to tell 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.420
 and this is how we see what it is worth 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.320
 door even if here she will not 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.420
 raking on the territory if the beads 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.860
 put a red torch then the door is not 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:14.979
 will open but we already understand why 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:17.619
 but to open it well, and to open it 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:23.610
 just need to come from here 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.610
 look so opened 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.270
 and closes on also newbie thought you 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.510
 here, too, understood it actually three 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.240
 gum 1 costs 1 straight and it turns out 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:41.040
 what is there a song on the corner and since there 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.570
 the angle is considered to be transparent 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:51.830
 it is possible to press through it from pipes 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:55.340
 push for example novice and also doors 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.340
 done here too 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.630
 here when you press the lever but then by 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.399
 standard torches 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:09.269
 and when I press the lever again I will become 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.489
 that becomes active i leave and 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.440
 activated and the door 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.340
 how to open the doors 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.130
 really open need not told on 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.849
 in fact , borat well, so let's say 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.299
 from here he did get a griffer but 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:32.540
 from here already but he sees of course the lever he 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:34.410
 on the closet on it and open down the room 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.030
 before 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.460
 there will be a transmitter well I do not know 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.350
 if she presses the wrong one for example 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.840
 on that 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.840
 then he will heal and he will suffocate 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:59.890
 actually and similarly with this lever 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:03.340
 Well to be honest it is yes it to him as 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.300
 lucky question of chance this 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:12.990
 Ansaldi lever opens there 2 and here he 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.990
 falls into this room death room 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:22.300
 there are actually three mechanisms can 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.250
 visible to the clan then find out a third for 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.840
 I begin to think that he will come here 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.340
 they want to open 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:34.210
 get this lever and who is trying to this 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:38.080
 all times and plugging it pinches everywhere 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.690
 Pistons Well, this is one because 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:46.950
 that to it was a glitch then that through the blocks 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.950
 go out there and that's how it works 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.280
 and so 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.900
 I think we'll close everything 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.090
 so 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.230
 I think that he will be first after all 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.230
 combination lock 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:15.620
 guess but here it is actually all right 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:18.380
 so it is difficult but yes can we click 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.830
 all leverage just the room opens on 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:27.960
 In fact there is such a combination of all 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.960
 oh yeah ups 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.050
 all the same if he closes and what 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.940
 he wo n't get here 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:43.200
 so you don't need a door behind you 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:47.580
 Well, now I'll show you what happened here. 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.400
 he himself opens the door as if 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.620
 see here is that the logo 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.080
 but think that there time is my room 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.780
 then he thinks and what if he goes there 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:05.850
 there will be water it's like to powder it 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:08.150
 but in the fall all kapets give him such 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.150
 thing 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.949
 on so and in fact what to get my 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.860
 This room just is not necessary at all and 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:19.500
 everything is very simple here and the same here 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:25.099
 mechanism like opening those iron 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.099
 door that is up 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.590
 and all 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.770
 Well here how to knock out is not visible at all, too 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:38.789
 there is something there is also in trance they 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:44.030
 appears and everything can go quietly 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:46.800
 and here is your destination home on the second floor 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.520
 that you can live here in bed 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.520
 location 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.510
 but Katya yes griffer can still here 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.510
 grope randomly 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.800
 although I think it is unlikely he will guess 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.800
 although if he is there like 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.130
 well no 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.260
 so thanks for watching you 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.050
