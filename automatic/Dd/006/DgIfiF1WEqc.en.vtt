00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
basics of slipping to get away from the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.589 
basics of slipping to get away from the
one<00:00:07.319> two<00:00:07.529> first<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.970> object<00:00:09.330> here<00:00:09.570> is

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
one two first so the object here is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
nice and stable they're not all over the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.349 
nice and stable they're not all over the
place<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.640> when<00:00:26.760> you're<00:00:26.880> sleeping<00:00:27.240> you're

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
not moving too far and getting yourself

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.800 
not moving too far and getting yourself
off<00:00:29.609> balance<00:00:29.849> everything<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.630> very

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
off balance everything is very

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.430 
off balance everything is very
controlled<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.040> Jason's<00:00:32.340> going<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.550> show<00:00:32.759> you

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
controlled so Jason's going to show you

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.170 
controlled so Jason's going to show you
basic<00:00:34.440> slipping<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.980> one<00:00:35.160> side<00:00:35.460> then<00:00:35.850> subject

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
basic slipping to one side then subject

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.380 
basic slipping to one side then subject
to<00:00:36.270> side<00:00:36.480> side<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.399> again<00:00:38.790> he's

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
to side side so you can see again he's

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.010 
to side side so you can see again he's
very<00:00:39.600> tight<00:00:39.989> he's<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.559> too<00:00:41.460> far<00:00:41.730> forward<00:00:42.030> he's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
very tight he's not too far forward he's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.720 
very tight he's not too far forward he's
not<00:00:43.200> ducking<00:00:43.770> he's<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.070> slipping<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.610> he's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
not ducking he's just slipping so he's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.670 
not ducking he's just slipping so he's
not<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.059> off<00:00:45.300> balance<00:00:45.690> too<00:00:46.230> far<00:00:46.440> forward

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
not going off balance too far forward

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.590 
not going off balance too far forward
over<00:00:46.980> his<00:00:47.070> front<00:00:47.250> foot<00:00:47.550> he's<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.450> too

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
over his front foot he's not going too

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
over his front foot he's not going too
far<00:00:48.840> backwards

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
far backwards

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.069 
far backwards
AHA<00:00:50.250> off<00:00:50.520> his<00:00:50.700> back<00:00:50.910> foot<00:00:51.210> he's<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.899> moving

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
AHA off his back foot he's just moving

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.720 
AHA off his back foot he's just moving
side<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.469> side<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.520> think

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
side to side what you have to think

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.939 
side to side what you have to think
about<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.120> when<00:00:54.899> someone's<00:00:55.230> punching<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.739> him

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
about is when someone's punching at him

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.459 
about is when someone's punching at him
the<00:00:56.520> closer<00:00:56.879> he<00:00:57.390> slips<00:00:57.780> through<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> person's

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
the closer he slips through the person's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.979 
the closer he slips through the person's
hands<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.699> less<00:00:59.910> distance<00:01:00.300> he<00:01:00.449> has<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.809> make

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
hands the less distance he has to make

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.219 
hands the less distance he has to make
up<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.770> counter<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.820> punch<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.750> if

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
up to counter that with that punch so if

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.789 
up to counter that with that punch so if
he<00:01:04.350> slips<00:01:04.619> too<00:01:04.799> far<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:05.880> side<00:01:06.560> wonka<00:01:07.560> had<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
he slips too far to one side wonka had a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.350 
he slips too far to one side wonka had a
body<00:01:08.070> position<00:01:08.250> he's<00:01:08.670> not<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.909> great<00:01:08.970> position

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
body position he's not in great position

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.030 
body position he's not in great position
he<00:01:09.450> can't<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:09.810> bail<00:01:09.930> he<00:01:10.080> can't<00:01:10.260> develop<00:01:10.470> torque

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
he can't do bail he can't develop torque

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.580 
he can't do bail he can't develop torque
and<00:01:11.310> power<00:01:11.340> behind<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.060> if<00:01:12.600> he<00:01:12.750> slips<00:01:13.020> there

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and power behind that if he slips there

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.859 
and power behind that if he slips there
so<00:01:13.890> he<00:01:14.040> drops<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.520> shoulder<00:01:14.790> want<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.630> back

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
so he drops that shoulder want that back

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.190 
so he drops that shoulder want that back

leg abs are tight flows through same

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.230 
leg abs are tight flows through same
room<00:01:19.560> that's<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.490> an<00:01:20.549> effective<00:01:20.820> slip

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
room that's a but an effective slip
