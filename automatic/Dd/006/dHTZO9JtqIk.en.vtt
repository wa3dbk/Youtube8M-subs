start<00:00:49.070> by<00:00:49.280> curling<00:00:49.640> them<00:00:49.820> outwards<00:00:50.240> like<00:00:50.480> this

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
start by curling them outwards like this

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.860 
start by curling them outwards like this
you<00:00:51.800> hold<00:00:52.010> each<00:00:52.250> section<00:00:52.820> for<00:00:53.060> a<00:00:53.090> few<00:00:53.300> seconds

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
and then release it for longer sections

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.710 
and then release it for longer sections
like<00:00:57.770> this<00:00:58.010> one<00:00:58.250> I<00:00:58.430> like<00:00:58.580> to<00:00:58.730> stop<00:00:59.000> towards<00:00:59.540> the

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
end but not all the way and then curl

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.000 
end but not all the way and then curl
the<00:01:01.820> top<00:01:02.059> section<00:01:02.600> like<00:01:02.750> this<00:01:02.989> hold<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:03.830> for<00:01:03.950> a

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.180 
few seconds and then pull it out a
little<00:01:05.840> bit<00:01:06.050> so<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:06.260> can<00:01:06.320> start<00:01:06.710> curling<00:01:06.950> the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
little bit so I can start curling the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.430

tip as well this way you get a complete
curl<00:01:09.680> from<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.040> top<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.520> bottom<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:15.729> then

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
curl from the top to the bottom and then

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.490 
curl from the top to the bottom and then
I'm<00:01:16.850> just<00:01:16.880> going<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.300> curl<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.720> right<00:01:17.990> section

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500

I'm just spraying some styling spray
this<00:01:49.900> way<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.259> curl<00:01:50.530> it's<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.830> lot<00:01:50.979> more

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
this way the curl it's a lot more

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.950 
this way the curl it's a lot more
defined<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:51.820> this<00:01:51.970> hairspray<00:01:52.479> is<00:01:52.600> really

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
defined and this hairspray is really

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.960 
defined and this hairspray is really
great<00:01:53.229> because<00:01:53.619> it<00:01:54.070> doesn't<00:01:54.460> bring<00:01:54.610> your<00:01:54.729> hair

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
and but by the time that you roll it in

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:06.410 
and but by the time that you roll it in
the<00:01:57.070> hairspray<00:01:57.520> has<00:01:57.700> already<00:01:58.119> dried

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.719 

and<00:02:06.720> then<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:07.979> want<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.220> continue<00:02:08.490> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and then you just want to continue the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.490 
and then you just want to continue the
process<00:02:09.210> to<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> remaining<00:02:09.960> sections<00:02:10.350> of

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
process to the remaining sections of

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:20.820 
process to the remaining sections of
hair

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.980 

so<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.890> create<00:02:22.310> really<00:02:22.820> nice<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.300> flowy<00:02:23.510> bangs

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
so to create really nice and flowy bangs

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.720 
so to create really nice and flowy bangs
that<00:02:24.350> I'm<00:02:24.440> actually<00:02:24.680> going<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.190> curl<00:02:25.580> them

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
that I'm actually going to curl them

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.640 
that I'm actually going to curl them
outward<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.570> I'm<00:02:26.750> just<00:02:26.960> going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.200> continue

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
outward and I'm just going to continue

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.710 
outward and I'm just going to continue
the<00:02:27.740> same<00:02:27.920> process<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.670> spraying<00:02:29.540> them<00:02:29.690> with

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
the same process of spraying them with

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.930 
the same process of spraying them with
styling<00:02:30.200> spray<00:02:30.350> curling<00:02:31.310> them<00:02:31.430> holding<00:02:31.820> it

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
styling spray curling them holding it

00:02:31.940 --> 00:03:01.230 
styling spray curling them holding it
for<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.120> few<00:02:32.300> seconds<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.960> then<00:02:33.140> letting<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.590> go

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.040 

next<00:03:02.240> what<00:03:02.360> I'm<00:03:02.450> going<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.600> do<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.870> start
