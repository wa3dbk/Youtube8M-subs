00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.680
Captions: After DK's game against EG, their pre-match internal strategy discussion video was leaked online. DK manager Farseer lodges a complaint with Valve staff.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.180
Farseer: Ask them to delete it

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.400
Farseer: Are they mentally ill?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.300
iceiceice: Ahhh...our discussion is now online

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.480
iceiceice: Whose fault is it?

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.260
Burning: Gamefy.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:58.680
71: I've gone into the media room to tell them (Gamefy). During the game of VG-Titan, I heard people saying that they heard our strategy yesterday online.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.290
71: This is overboard.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.880
71: They say they will delete it, but it's too late as others have downloaded it.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.620
Iceiceice: I don't know what we discussed.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.600
71: The entire discussion is there.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.100
71: How to BP, how to adapt, it's the fruits of our practice and research.

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.319
iceiceice: let's get thugs to beat them up

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.620
71: Gamefy's IQ is low.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.280
71: I heard my players say, the discussion about our banpicks against EG was leaked online

00:01:50.440 --> 00:02:04.160
71: I'm speechless. I've asked Gamefy Channel to remove it, but all they can do is to remove the source.

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:13.914
71: But the video has been duplicated elsewhere. I think the problem will not be minor.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.940
71: Gamefy said that it could have been a kid sneaking in to record it.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.820
71: It's usual to discuss strategy before match.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.600
71: After the players enter the lobby, I have to leave the room.

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:37.073
71: I don't know other media people got into our room.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.120
71: Someone asked ice3 for permission, ice3 said no.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.400
71: Still they went ahead and even uploaded it. The impact to us is great.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:03:06.020
71: EG are strong opponents. We made some preparations yesterday, based on long periods of previous research on their strategy and BP.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:20.820
Every team has their own understanding of BP. It's disadvantageous to have our BP strategy leaked.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.600
Didn't Gamefy say that we should help each other? Use your brain before you do anything like that.
