00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
their pad packing megahorn so I would

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
their pad packing megahorn so I would
have<00:01:06.360> been<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.659> little<00:01:06.810> smarter<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.409> wouldn't

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
have been a little smarter but wouldn't

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.270 
have been a little smarter but wouldn't
it<00:01:08.280> knocked<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.439> anyways<00:01:10.950> I'm

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
it knocked out so like anyways I'm

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.910 
it knocked out so like anyways I'm
guessing<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:11.909> oh<00:01:12.119> well<00:01:12.450> bronze<00:01:13.409> line<00:01:13.590> gets<00:01:13.770> up

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
guessing but oh well bronze line gets up

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.530 
guessing but oh well bronze line gets up
the<00:01:14.010> trick<00:01:14.220> room<00:01:14.430> now<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.659> great<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
the trick room now so that is great and

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.359 
the trick room now so that is great and
yeah<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.530> rhyperior<00:01:19.920> might<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.280> able

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
yeah so that rhyperior might be able

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.899 
yeah so that rhyperior might be able
threat<00:01:20.880> because<00:01:22.159> it's<00:01:23.159> pretty<00:01:23.460> slow<00:01:23.759> I

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
threat because it's pretty slow I

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.969 
threat because it's pretty slow I
noticed<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.799> glass<00:01:26.520> so

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
noticed that it was going like glass so

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.679 
noticed that it was going like glass so
bronzong<00:01:28.979> protect<00:01:29.460> itself<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.119> then

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
bronzong protect itself and then

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.960 
bronzong protect itself and then
rhyperior<00:01:31.140> uses<00:01:31.439> megahorn<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.189> they<00:01:32.850> were

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
rhyperior uses megahorn and they were

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.090 
rhyperior uses megahorn and they were
using<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.329> bronzong<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.290> protected<00:01:34.950> himself

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
using on bronzong but protected himself

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.090 
using on bronzong but protected himself
I'm<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.700> explode<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.890> need<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
I'm just explode because I just need to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.120 
I'm just explode because I just need to
get<00:01:38.310> my<00:01:38.369> next<00:01:38.729> attackers<00:01:39.479> out<00:01:39.630> there<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.170> even

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
get my next attackers out there so even

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.639 
get my next attackers out there so even
though<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.520> doesn't<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.820> much<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:43.590> was

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
though it doesn't do much really it was

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.920 
though it doesn't do much really it was
no<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.310> had<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:44.970> other<00:01:45.119> attackers<00:01:45.780> out

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
no I had to get my other attackers out

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.109 
no I had to get my other attackers out
there<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.290> they<00:01:46.409> could<00:01:46.670> start<00:01:47.670> doing<00:01:47.939> some

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
there so they could start doing some

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.080 
there so they could start doing some
damage<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> can't<00:01:50.759> really<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
damage but and so I can't really do that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.590 
damage but and so I can't really do that
much<00:01:51.240> anyway<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.950> anyways<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.329> ahead<00:01:54.479> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
much anyway so anyways I I go ahead and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.980 
much anyway so anyways I I go ahead and
I<00:01:54.630> switch<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.229> my<00:01:55.909> tour<00:01:56.909> Terrence's<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.750> think

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
my first time using him probably not but

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.090 
my first time using him probably not but
I<00:02:00.030> don't<00:02:00.390> know<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.479> don't<00:02:00.630> remember<00:02:01.100> bronzong

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
I don't know I don't remember bronzong

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.459 
I don't know I don't remember bronzong
use<00:02:02.310> Java<00:02:02.670> ball<00:02:02.969> knocks<00:02:03.689> out<00:02:03.960> with<00:02:04.110> choreo

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
use Java ball knocks out with choreo

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.870 
use Java ball knocks out with choreo
pretty<00:02:04.770> easily<00:02:04.979> because<00:02:05.399> he<00:02:05.490> only<00:02:05.610> had<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
pretty easily because he only had a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.869 
pretty easily because he only had a
little<00:02:06.090> HP<00:02:06.329> anyways<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.369> he<00:02:08.520> gets<00:02:08.700> knocked

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
little HP anyways and so he gets knocked

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.800 
little HP anyways and so he gets knocked
out

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
out

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.449 
out
and<00:02:09.899> then<00:02:10.050> brondon<00:02:10.649> takes<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.069> recoil

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
and then brondon takes a little recoil

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.760 
and then brondon takes a little recoil
