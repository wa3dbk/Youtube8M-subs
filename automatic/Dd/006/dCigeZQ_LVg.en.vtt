00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Kohl paradigm of Israel lives from one 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.319
 war up another question is not whether 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.260
 yet another war but when will it 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.330
 not miktion ration lives on israeli 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.009

 a few meters on the other side 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.039
 lives alone 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.410
 and zack despite the fact that in the eyes 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.980
 the leaders of their countries they are enemies in 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.900
 one of mimicry and adnan I agree 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.210
 that in this war are the authorities of both 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.219
 countries are they always making a decision 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.200
 so they have to change her situation 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.480
 Mickey and Adnan did not seek to take 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.670
 someone's side or find an enemy 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.420
 they just want to say at the top of their voice 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.829
 what is pretty with them 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.660
 the conflict has been going on for too long 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.309
 and on both sides of the israeli 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.920
 Palestinian border persists 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.899
 atmosphere anxiety distrust however 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.520
 there were those who express their protest and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.469
 calls for peace from interval adnan knows 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.359
 how hard it is to live during the war in 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.930
 a result of the invasion of Israel in the sector 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.070
 gas in the summer of 2014 his house and farm 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.140
 were destroyed 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.450
 now he has nothing to feed his wife and 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.250
 six children 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.260
 people living near the border want peace we 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.600
 we dream to build a house in which will 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.640
 live our grandchildren they rebuild it 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.119
 every couple of years so his then all 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.549
 equally destroyed about this dreaming and not 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.189
 amiki she is an activist israeli 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.869
 organizations have a different opinion advocating 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.250
 peace and understanding these endless 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.530
 fights lead nowhere 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.799
 they repeat again and again and with each 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.360
 time of destruction become more and more 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.610
 Israeli forces leave gas sector 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.560
 then surrounded him again after 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.380
 Palestinians fired rockets toward 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.329
 israel cycle of violence no end but 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.430
 it may seem that not solve the problem 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.159
 so hard 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.229
 people should have hope for 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.009
 normal life if not 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.360
 hopelessness turns into violence 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.219
 to achieve peace you need to open 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.619
 border checkpoints and again 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.630
 give people a job if people have 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.630
 work war they will not need 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.240
 and adnan hope that the authorities will ever 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.370
 they are listened to and not in words but on 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.170
 will try to break the deadlock in 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:24.880
 which they turned out to give a floor slier rt 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.880
 gas sector boundary
