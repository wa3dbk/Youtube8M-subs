00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 today we are going to do 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.600
 configuration of access points to 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.580
 penises for the operator movistar in a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.759
 equipment brought in this case is the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.160
 sony xperia or with android 4 means 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.650
 that this programming that we are going to do 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.080
 Applies to any device with 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.550
 4 Android up or any 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.039
 brand since with android the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.590
 settings or what are the settings 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.260
 they are very very very similar let's go 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.500
 to the osaka adjustments part 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.910
 configuration we verify that it is the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.690
 android that I am telling you if it is 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.879
 android 4 and we are going to do the process that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.340
 it was programming that is let's go 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.030
 back to the main menu we're going to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.550
 configuration let's go more in more let's 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.579
 cellular networks and cellular networks 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.680
 we go where it says access points in 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.989
 access points enable this button 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.719
 from here that vote no to the option of app in 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.000
 the new one we select them and here in 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.090
 name we write internet 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.890
 when we write the word internet the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.800
 same system suggests it we're going to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.070
 accept and most importantly where it says 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.130
 apn let's write the following we're going 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.030
 to write internet punto movistar 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.340
 dotcom zero point as it says there 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.220
 internet punto movistar puntocom dot 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.720
 zero we continue with the process where it says 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.510
 Username 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.440
 we are going to place absolutely nothing in 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:34.140
 password either but in kind of 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.750
 authentication if we go to the selection of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.460
 none of these two numbers that 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.479
 appear here 7 32 and 123 that brings them 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.160
 default 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.320
 the system is to say that we do not have to 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.070
 make any kind of additional adjustment 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.960
 finally we point to the button again and 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.850
 we give you save 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.220
 here is selected from the pn 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.070
 and we enable what is the part of 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.590
 data so that we can have service 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.770
 internet we have to give you a little bit of 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.869
 time for that in the part above the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.140
 signal us those letters that appear 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.030
 it means that it's a 3g or a h where 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.380
 tells us that we already have internet how 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.350
 confront you actually we have 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.110
 this service then we go to google 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.930
 chrome we do any search you 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:29.069
 like to look for example movistar and it appears 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.920
 and we already have internet 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.719
