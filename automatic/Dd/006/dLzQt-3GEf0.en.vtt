I<00:01:57.020> have<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.440> say<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:57.770> if<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.790> bought<00:01:59.119> the

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
I have to say this if you bought the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.590 
I have to say this if you bought the
earlier<00:01:59.960> version<00:02:00.290> of<00:02:00.410> canvas<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:02.030> might

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
earlier version of canvas this might

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.630 
earlier version of canvas this might
just<00:02:02.630> look<00:02:02.990> like<00:02:03.050> an<00:02:03.520> incremental<00:02:04.520> increase

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
just look like an incremental increase

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.870 
just look like an incremental increase
so<00:02:05.509> it's<00:02:05.630> not<00:02:05.869> a<00:02:06.050> revolution<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:07.700> an

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
so it's not a revolution it's just an

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.719 
so it's not a revolution it's just an
evolution<00:02:08.780> but<00:02:09.590> then<00:02:09.739> again<00:02:09.830> if<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.280> haven't

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
evolution but then again if you haven't

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.340 
evolution but then again if you haven't
bought<00:02:10.880> any<00:02:11.180> phone<00:02:11.510> in<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.660> canvas<00:02:11.900> series

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
single sim offering I think that's also
