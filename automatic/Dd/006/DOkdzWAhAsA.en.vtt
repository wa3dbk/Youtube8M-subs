here you guys now I'm going to go

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.670 
here you guys now I'm going to go
through<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.270> simple<00:01:16.450> hand<00:01:16.780> motion<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.500> the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
through the simple hand motion of the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.410 
through the simple hand motion of the
snake<00:01:17.920> shot<00:01:18.190> basically<00:01:19.000> what<00:01:19.120> you<00:01:19.240> want<00:01:19.360> to

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
snake shot basically what you want to

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.900 
snake shot basically what you want to
start<00:01:19.630> off<00:01:19.780> with<00:01:19.810> is<00:01:20.230> applying<00:01:21.130> pressure<00:01:21.520> to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
start off with is applying pressure to

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.680 
start off with is applying pressure to
the<00:01:22.510> 4<00:01:23.200> &amp;<00:01:23.440> 5<00:01:23.740> or<00:01:24.490> o'clock<00:01:24.790> position<00:01:25.270> on<00:01:25.510> the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
the 4 &amp; 5 or o'clock position on the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.630 
the 4 &amp; 5 or o'clock position on the
handle<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.200> see<00:01:27.040> how<00:01:27.100> that's<00:01:27.220> been<00:01:27.400> done<00:01:27.580> a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
handle and see how that's been done a

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.820 
handle and see how that's been done a
tiny<00:01:27.820> bit<00:01:28.030> I'm<00:01:28.210> applying<00:01:28.690> pressure<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:29.800> that

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
tiny bit I'm applying pressure so that

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.220 
tiny bit I'm applying pressure so that
it's<00:01:30.100> firmly<00:01:30.370> against<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.150> side<00:01:31.750> of<00:01:31.900> my<00:01:31.990> wrist

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
it's firmly against the side of my wrist

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.190 
it's firmly against the side of my wrist
and<00:01:33.120> you<00:01:34.120> want<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.300> get<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.420> nice<00:01:34.570> gliding

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
and you want to get a nice gliding

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.230 
and you want to get a nice gliding
motion<00:01:35.650> on<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:35.800> just<00:01:36.790> something<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.090> you

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
motion on it just something that you

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.430 
motion on it just something that you
basically<00:01:37.390> comfortable<00:01:37.930> with<00:01:38.020> you<00:01:38.110> can<00:01:38.260> try<00:01:38.410> a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
basically comfortable with you can try a

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.750 
basically comfortable with you can try a
lot<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.680> different<00:01:38.890> positions<00:01:38.950> that<00:01:39.430> you<00:01:39.610> hand

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
lot of different positions that you hand

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.940 
lot of different positions that you hand
up<00:01:39.910> there<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.540> down<00:01:40.780> here<00:01:40.810> some<00:01:41.620> people<00:01:41.860> even

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
up there and down here some people even

up there and down here some people even
like<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.220> put<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.430> hands<00:01:42.670> around<00:01:42.730> here

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
like to put the hands around here

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.510 
like to put the hands around here
which<00:01:43.480> I<00:01:43.690> don't<00:01:43.750> like<00:01:43.900> to<00:01:43.990> us<00:01:44.290> let's<00:01:45.250> keep<00:01:45.370> it

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
which I don't like to us let's keep it

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.350 
which I don't like to us let's keep it
normal<00:01:45.900> but<00:01:47.100> once<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.310> feel<00:01:49.150> comfortable

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
normal but once you feel comfortable

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
normal but once you feel comfortable
with<00:01:50.520> whatever<00:01:51.520> kind<00:01:51.790> of<00:01:51.910> position<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.330> like

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
with whatever kind of position you like

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.130 
with whatever kind of position you like
find<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.580> gap<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.540> which<00:01:55.720> you're<00:01:55.900> going<00:01:56.050> to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
find the gap of which you're going to

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.880 
find the gap of which you're going to
hit<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.430> then<00:01:57.550> move<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:59.020> handle<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.710> man

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
hit and then move the handle and the man

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.690 
hit and then move the handle and the man
and<00:02:00.160> then<00:02:00.910> execute<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.780> shot<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.520> man

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
and then execute the shot with the man

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:14.720 
and then execute the shot with the man
doing<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.210> complete<00:02:04.570> 360

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.149 

and<00:02:14.819> these<00:02:15.540> are<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> overhead<00:02:16.349> 360s<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.069> how

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
and these are the overhead 360s of how

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.809 
and these are the overhead 360s of how
the<00:02:17.220> man<00:02:17.550> hit<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.670> bowl<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.670> is

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
the man hit the bowl and this is

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.550 
the man hit the bowl and this is
basically<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.360> slow-motion<00:02:21.840> shot<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.349> what<00:02:22.470> it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
basically a slow-motion shot of what it

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.390 
basically a slow-motion shot of what it
looks<00:02:22.709> like<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:25.620> example<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.159> a<00:02:26.190> snake

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
looks like this example of a snake

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:36.850 
looks like this example of a snake
charlatan<00:02:26.879> player

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.920
