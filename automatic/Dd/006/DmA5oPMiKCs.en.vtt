yep so I'm using the same aperture that
is<00:02:22.920> with<00:02:23.400> out<00:02:23.640> sister<00:02:24.390> solve<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.840> out<00:02:25.020> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
is with out sister solve it out the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.130 
is with out sister solve it out the
converter<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:27.209> is<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.480> result<00:02:27.810> with

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
converter and this is the result with

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.730 
converter and this is the result with
the<00:02:28.740> converter<00:02:29.160> see<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:30.320> can<00:02:31.320> see<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.560> big

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
the converter see I can see the big

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.100 
the converter see I can see the big
difference<00:02:31.770> very<00:02:32.550> nice<00:02:32.790> yeah<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
difference very nice yeah and the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.290 
difference very nice yeah and the
quality<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.650> picture<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.160> same<00:02:35.300> cool

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
quality of the picture is the same cool

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.240 
quality of the picture is the same cool
so<00:02:37.400> that's<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.670> advantage<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:39.209> using<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:41.040> kill

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
so that's the advantage of using to kill

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.690 
so that's the advantage of using to kill
the<00:02:41.480> 0.45<00:02:42.480> X<00:02:43.430> Wow
