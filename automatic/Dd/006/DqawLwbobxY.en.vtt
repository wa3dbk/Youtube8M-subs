00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
comment on the care system but I was

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.050 
comment on the care system but I was

aware that you know the because about
the<00:01:42.210> care<00:01:42.359> system<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.320> grew<00:01:43.469> up<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the care system and I grew up in the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.109 
the care system and I grew up in the
care<00:01:43.859> system<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> was<00:01:44.490> aware<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.969> would

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
care system so I was aware that it would

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.999 
care system so I was aware that it would
make<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.899> would<00:01:46.140> make<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> comment<00:01:46.649> about<00:01:46.799> the

make it would make a comment about the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.910 
make it would make a comment about the
care<00:01:47.159> system<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.899> that's<00:01:49.140> probably<00:01:49.439> why<00:01:49.649> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
care system and that's probably why I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.370 
care system and that's probably why I
didn't<00:01:50.280> really<00:01:50.990> originally<00:01:51.990> want<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.229> write

looking at how society structured and

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.649 
looking at how society structured and
how<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:05.399> get<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.759> binary<00:02:06.060> oppositions<00:02:06.509> of
