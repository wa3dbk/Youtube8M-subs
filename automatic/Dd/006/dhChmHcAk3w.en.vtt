how<00:02:47.590> should<00:02:47.950> black<00:02:48.189> continue

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.530 

perhaps<00:02:55.220> black<00:02:55.760> considered<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.570> snack<00:02:56.950> and

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
perhaps black considered a snack and

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.930 
perhaps black considered a snack and
then<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.600> like<00:02:59.840> it<00:03:00.020> because<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:02.200> this<00:03:03.200> tactic

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
then I like it because of this tactic

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.160 
then I like it because of this tactic
Bishop<00:03:04.940> takes<00:03:05.150> on<00:03:05.480> c7<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:07.100> queen<00:03:07.610> takes

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
Bishop takes on c7 and a queen takes

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.990 
Bishop takes on c7 and a queen takes
this<00:03:09.170> six<00:03:09.500> for<00:03:10.010> king<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.520> Queen<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:10.940> the

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
this six for king the Queen and the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
this six for king the Queen and the
bishop<00:03:11.920> after<00:03:12.920> Queen<00:03:13.160> takes<00:03:13.340> pawn<00:03:14.020> Bishop

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
bishop after Queen takes pawn Bishop

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.390 
bishop after Queen takes pawn Bishop
takes<00:03:15.230> Bishop<00:03:15.410> on<00:03:15.920> day<00:03:16.070> seven

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
takes Bishop on day seven

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.890 
takes Bishop on day seven
so<00:03:19.400> perhaps<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:20.240> best<00:03:20.270> move<00:03:20.660> in<00:03:20.780> this

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
so perhaps the best move in this

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.010 
so perhaps the best move in this
position<00:03:20.960> is<00:03:21.470> night<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.730> six<00:03:23.210> defending<00:03:23.930> the

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
position is night to a six defending the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:34.840 
position is night to a six defending the
pawn<00:03:24.230> on<00:03:25.090> c7<00:03:28.480> but<00:03:29.480> we<00:03:29.630> have<00:03:30.250> g5<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:34.640> a

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
pawn on c7 but we have g5 this is a

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.160 
pawn on c7 but we have g5 this is a
