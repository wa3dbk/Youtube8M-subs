bottom which gives it quite a lot of

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.370 
bottom which gives it quite a lot of
character<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.340> its<00:01:14.670> sheer<00:01:15.119> which<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.170> adds

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380

another<00:01:16.590> dimension<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.490> actually<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.210> really

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
another dimension and actually it really

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.600 
another dimension and actually it really
makes<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.900> more<00:01:19.049> elegant<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.740> evening
