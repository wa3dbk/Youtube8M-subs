00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.540 

but<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> things<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:52.980> probably<00:00:53.370> going

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
but the things that it's probably going

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.840 
but the things that it's probably going
to<00:00:53.670> end<00:00:53.790> up<00:00:54.000> back<00:00:54.360> where<00:00:54.570> r

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
to end up back where r

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
to end up back where r
which<00:00:56.120> is<00:00:56.269> going<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.600> be

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
which is going to be

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.670 
which is going to be
mrs.<00:00:58.289> cyclists<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.890> think<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> think

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
mrs. cyclists I think that I think

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.980 
mrs. cyclists I think that I think
when<00:01:01.220> we<00:01:01.340> walked<00:01:01.580> in<00:01:02.090> i<00:01:02.270> think<00:01:02.450> there<00:01:02.900> was

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
when we walked in i think there was

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.820 
when we walked in i think there was
enough<00:01:03.230> to<00:01:03.440> justify

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.590 

the<00:01:07.190> herbicide

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the herbicide

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.179 
the herbicide
so<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.380> should<00:01:10.409> hopefully<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> safe

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
so we should hopefully as a safe

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.179 
so we should hopefully as a safe
finished<00:01:11.520> oilseed<00:01:11.939> rape<00:01:12.090> today<00:01:12.979> might<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.009> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
finished oilseed rape today might be a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.429 
finished oilseed rape today might be a
very<00:01:14.280> big<00:01:14.820> village<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.479> will<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:16.020> nice<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.200> get

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
very big village but will be nice to get

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.800 
very big village but will be nice to get
done<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.610> we<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.970> crack<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.450> get<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
done and then we can crack on get the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.710 
done and then we can crack on get the
combine<00:01:19.200> ready<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> eat<00:01:20.130> again<00:01:20.720> hopefully

combine ready in to eat again hopefully

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.080 
combine ready in to eat again hopefully
tomorrow<00:01:22.320> things

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.520 

and

have been back into the grain tank and
it's<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.409> good<00:01:43.560> idea<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.630> we're

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it's a really good idea so that we're

this<00:02:06.490> should<00:02:06.700> be<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:08.970> breaking<00:02:09.970> ball<00:02:10.120> now<00:02:10.500> so

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
this should be the breaking ball now so

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.290 
this should be the breaking ball now so
we<00:02:11.620> should<00:02:11.650> be<00:02:11.920> cracking<00:02:12.310> on<00:02:12.460> get<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:12.970> prop

we should be cracking on get this prop

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.710 
we should be cracking on get this prop
finished<00:02:13.660> off<00:02:13.840> today<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.970> then<00:02:16.300> cheating
