00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
get the board to go around wrap around

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.530 
get the board to go around wrap around
your<00:02:30.240> front<00:02:30.540> foot<00:02:31.610> there<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.760> go<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.210> last

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
your front foot there you go that last

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.510 
your front foot there you go that last
one<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.840> was<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.200> perfect<00:02:34.710> practice<00:02:34.950> step<00:02:35.340> you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
one that was a perfect practice step you

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.730 
one that was a perfect practice step you
should<00:02:35.700> be<00:02:35.850> doing<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.150> last<00:02:36.750> practice<00:02:37.560> step

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
should be doing that last practice step

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.830 
should be doing that last practice step
just<00:02:37.950> over<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.520> over<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:38.970> over<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.420> over<00:02:39.750> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
just over and over and over and over and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.680 
just over and over and over and over and
over<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.100> purposely<00:02:41.790> step<00:02:42.090> off<00:02:42.270> your<00:02:42.450> back

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
over so you purposely step off your back

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.050 
over so you purposely step off your back
foot<00:02:43.050> let<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.620> go<00:02:43.800> around<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.550> then<00:02:44.700> catch<00:02:45.030> it

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
foot let it go around and then catch it

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.090 
foot let it go around and then catch it
right<00:02:45.420> there<00:02:45.630> with<00:02:45.750> your<00:02:45.900> front<00:02:46.110> foot<00:02:46.380> that's

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
right there with your front foot that's

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.890 
right there with your front foot that's
the<00:02:47.310> practice<00:02:47.730> step<00:02:47.940> for<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.240> hardflip<00:02:48.630> for

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
the practice step for the hardflip for

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.020 
the practice step for the hardflip for
you<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.470> think<00:02:49.800> will<00:02:49.980> work<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.340> absolute

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
you that I think will work the absolute

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.320 
you that I think will work the absolute

flip the front foot is pretty fawful it

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.600 
flip the front foot is pretty fawful it
on<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.990> board<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.890> back<00:03:08.070> foot<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.520> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
on the board and the back foot is in the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.449 
on the board and the back foot is in the
back<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.450> shove<00:03:10.040> forward<00:03:11.040> with<00:03:11.220> your

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
back foot like that and then it does

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.949 
back foot like that and then it does
this<00:03:13.470> awkward<00:03:14.070> weird<00:03:14.430> rotation<00:03:15.270> that<00:03:15.480> kind<00:03:15.810> of

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
this awkward weird rotation that kind of

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.840 
this awkward weird rotation that kind of
shoves<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.590> board<00:03:16.830> into<00:03:17.340> your<00:03:17.490> foot<00:03:19.519> that<00:03:20.519> is

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
shoves the board into your foot that is

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.580 
shoves the board into your foot that is
the<00:03:20.880> step<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.480> want<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.870> practice<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.500> it

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the step I want you to practice and it

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.080 
the step I want you to practice and it
looks<00:03:22.890> like<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.160> did<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.489> couple<00:03:23.580> times

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
looks like you did that a couple times

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.690 
looks like you did that a couple times
but<00:03:24.330> yeah<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:25.140> repeat<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.590> just<00:03:26.040> over<00:03:26.459> and

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
but yeah just repeat that just over and

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.759 
but yeah just repeat that just over and
over<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.239> over<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.750> over<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.260> over<00:03:28.620> again

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
over and over and over and over again

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.640 
over and over and over and over again
and<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.880> more<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.209> do<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.690> better<00:03:30.870> so

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
and the more you do it the better so

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.009 
and the more you do it the better so
then<00:03:32.370> once<00:03:32.700> you're<00:03:33.120> very<00:03:33.390> comfortable<00:03:33.930> with

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
then once you're very comfortable with

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.259 
then once you're very comfortable with
that<00:03:34.470> board<00:03:34.860> wrapping<00:03:35.550> around<00:03:35.700> your<00:03:36.000> foot

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
that board wrapping around your foot

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.080 
that board wrapping around your foot
like<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.540> which<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.590> like<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.950> most<00:03:38.190> awkward

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
like that which is like the most awkward

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.140 
like that which is like the most awkward
weird<00:03:39.930> motion<00:03:40.830> you<00:03:40.950> could<00:03:41.100> ever<00:03:41.340> think<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.910> and

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
weird motion you could ever think of and

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.690 
weird motion you could ever think of and
that's<00:03:42.269> why<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.540> trick<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.080> hard<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.739> that's

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
that's why the trick is hard and that's

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.750 
that's why the trick is hard and that's
why<00:03:45.180> it's<00:03:45.390> called<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.810> hard<00:03:46.049> flip<00:03:46.350> but<00:03:47.190> that's

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
why it's called a hard flip but that's

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.789 
why it's called a hard flip but that's
what<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.570> got<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.750> do<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.110> got<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.380> get<00:03:49.500> used

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
what you got to do you got to get used

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.640 
what you got to do you got to get used
to<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.130> weird<00:03:50.910> awkward<00:03:51.630> motion<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.530> it

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
to that weird awkward motion of it

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.160 
to that weird awkward motion of it
flipping<00:03:53.100> into<00:03:53.370> your<00:03:53.820> front<00:03:54.150> foot<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.660> still

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
me out a lot with hard flips is that to

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.390 
me out a lot with hard flips is that to
put<00:04:09.120> my<00:04:09.239> front<00:04:09.540> foot<00:04:09.709> straight<00:04:10.709> it's<00:04:11.130> almost

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
put my front foot straight it's almost

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.789 
put my front foot straight it's almost
like<00:04:11.580> exactly<00:04:12.570> straight<00:04:12.959> on<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.290> board<00:04:13.560> it's

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
like exactly straight on the board it's

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.070 
like exactly straight on the board it's
not<00:04:13.890> like<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.360> kickflip<00:04:15.360> position<00:04:15.420> and

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
not like a kickflip position and

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.440 
not like a kickflip position and
straight<00:04:16.500> I<00:04:16.680> see<00:04:17.160> some<00:04:17.549> people<00:04:17.910> do<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.239> like<00:04:18.269> a

front foot out of the way you still have
to<00:04:58.240> flick<00:04:58.510> it<00:04:58.690> but<00:04:58.960> you<00:04:59.050> have<00:04:59.200> to<00:04:59.260> get<00:04:59.440> it<00:04:59.590> out

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
of the way and it's just crucial and

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.560 
of the way and it's just crucial and

and then land and roll away so that's

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.070
