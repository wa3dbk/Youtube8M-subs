00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
below to a video i made talking about

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.680 
below to a video i made talking about
the<00:00:59.039> georgian<00:00:59.489> currency<00:01:00.090> I'd<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.359> really

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the georgian currency I'd be really

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.750 
the georgian currency I'd be really
happy<00:01:00.870> if<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.440> checked<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.980> out<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.190> maybe

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
happy if you checked it out and maybe

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.149 
happy if you checked it out and maybe
left<00:01:03.120> me<00:01:03.359> some<00:01:03.600> feedback<00:01:03.899> I'm<00:01:04.409> not<00:01:04.769> exactly

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
left me some feedback I'm not exactly

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.820 
left me some feedback I'm not exactly
sure<00:01:05.339> why<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:06.210> introduced<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.229> suppose

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
sure why they introduced that I suppose

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.850 
sure why they introduced that I suppose
they're<00:01:08.159> two<00:01:08.850> possible<00:01:09.510> reasons<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.619> one

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
they're two possible reasons for it one

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.960 
they're two possible reasons for it one
would<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:13.010> they<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.610> keep

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
would be because they just want to keep

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.289 
would be because they just want to keep
the<00:01:15.240> elevator<00:01:15.780> clean<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.770> they<00:01:17.299> financed

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
the elevator clean and they financed

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.149 
the elevator clean and they financed
through<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.930> don't<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.790> um<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:25.159> suppose

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
through that I don't know um I suppose

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.880 
through that I don't know um I suppose
it's<00:01:26.610> well<00:01:27.450> from<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:27.990> I've<00:01:28.350> seen<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.650> far

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
it's well from what I've seen so far

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.580 
it's well from what I've seen so far
it's<00:01:29.369> not<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:30.060> working<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:32.960> yeah<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it's not really working and yeah the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.170 
it's not really working and yeah the
elevators<00:01:35.340> are<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.540> dirty<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:38.180> wear

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
elevators are just as dirty as they wear

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:47.179 
elevators are just as dirty as they wear
before<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:42.200> don't<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:44.159> good<00:01:45.649> it<00:01:46.649> does

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
before so I don't know what good it does

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.999 
before so I don't know what good it does
and<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.909> think<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.450> money<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.810> only<00:01:49.110> serving

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and I think the money is only serving

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.139 
and I think the money is only serving
the<00:01:51.979> guy<00:01:52.979> who<00:01:53.040> repairs<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.360> elevators<00:01:55.640> too<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
the guy who repairs the elevators too I

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.080 
the guy who repairs the elevators too I
don't<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.049> buy<00:01:58.380> himself<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:59.280> drink<00:01:59.520> or

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
don't know buy himself a drink or

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.679 
don't know buy himself a drink or
something<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:01.729> another<00:02:02.729> thing<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.479> was

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
something and another thing I was

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.800 
something and another thing I was
thinking<00:02:03.719> about<00:02:04.500> us<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.040> could<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:05.969> um

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
thinking about us it could be because um

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.320 
thinking about us it could be because um
electricity<00:02:09.810> costs

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
electricity costs

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.020 
electricity costs
and<00:02:14.230> people<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.620> like<00:02:16.010> some<00:02:16.370> people<00:02:16.790> just

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
and people just like some people just

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.730 
and people just like some people just
refused<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:19.030> pay<00:02:20.030> for<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.630> cost<00:02:21.380> of<00:02:21.710> the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
refused to pay for the cost of the

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.140 
refused to pay for the cost of the
elevator<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:22.940> they<00:02:23.120> had<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.570> split<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:25.150> people

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
elevator so they had to split it people

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.980 
elevator so they had to split it people
on<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.720> first<00:02:27.050> floor<00:02:27.650> obviously<00:02:28.550> just<00:02:29.000> like

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
on the first floor obviously just like

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.490 
on the first floor obviously just like
some<00:02:30.530> people<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.070> refuse<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.760> pay<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:32.500> they

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
some people just refuse to pay so they

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.160 
some people just refuse to pay so they
wanted<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.810> come<00:02:35.810> up<00:02:35.840> with<00:02:36.080> something<00:02:36.650> like

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
wanted to come up with something like

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.640 
wanted to come up with something like
for<00:02:39.170> people<00:02:39.200> who<00:02:39.740> used<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.490> so<00:02:40.820> that<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
for people who used it so that the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.170 
for people who used it so that the
electricity<00:02:42.650> costs<00:02:43.130> would<00:02:43.280> recover<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:44.030> or

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
electricity costs would recover it or

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.910 
electricity costs would recover it or
something<00:02:44.660> along<00:02:44.810> those<00:02:45.260> lines<00:02:46.630> um<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.860> don't

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
something along those lines um I don't

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.880 
something along those lines um I don't
know<00:02:49.220> what<00:02:49.610> else<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:50.270> add<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:51.260> if<00:02:51.590> you

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
know what else to add to this if you

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.190 
know what else to add to this if you
