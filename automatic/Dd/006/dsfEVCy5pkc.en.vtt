00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
the end of the podium so if you look at

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.520 
the end of the podium so if you look at
Wembley<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.090> about<00:01:57.240> twice<00:01:57.569> as<00:01:57.869> kind<00:01:58.109> of<00:01:58.170> as

you've<00:02:05.610> got<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.849> concrete<00:02:06.360> steps<00:02:07.229> you've<00:02:08.039> got

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
you've got the concrete steps you've got

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.620 
you've got the concrete steps you've got
the<00:02:08.310> seats<00:02:08.579> on<00:02:08.789> top<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.209> you've<00:02:09.420> got<00:02:09.450> the

all of that is well is their folder

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.670 
all of that is well is their folder
together<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.299> you<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.540> taken<00:02:30.959> down<00:02:31.170> about

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
together so you can be taken down about

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.819 
together so you can be taken down about
a<00:02:31.739> year<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.659> recycled<00:02:33.659> as<00:02:33.870> most<00:02:34.349> of<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.590> steel

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
like a bit off your helmets by spokes so

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.960 
like a bit off your helmets by spokes so
your<00:03:15.480> leaves<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.870> big<00:03:16.049> sort<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.319> soak<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.970> air

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.750 
after the games that full roof section
comes<00:03:32.570> down<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.950> do<00:03:34.100> this

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
comes down and I do this

truckers<00:04:10.850> could<00:04:11.030> all<00:04:11.150> be<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.750> other<00:04:12.080> the

truckers could all be and the other the

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.410 
truckers could all be and the other the

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
whole wing be a better can you take it

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.080 
whole wing be a better can you take it
down<00:04:14.600> and<00:04:14.780> read<00:04:14.990> and<00:04:15.470> recycle<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.640> most<00:04:16.940> of

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
down and read and recycle and most of

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.580 
down and read and recycle and most of
the<00:04:17.209> steel<00:04:17.510> that's<00:04:17.690> holding<00:04:18.110> up<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.440> actual

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
the steel that's holding up the actual

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.879 
the steel that's holding up the actual
seating<00:04:19.420> can<00:04:20.420> all<00:04:20.630> be<00:04:20.810> put<00:04:21.410> a<00:04:21.470> vet

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.529 

so<00:04:23.979> it's<00:04:24.219> a<00:04:24.280> very<00:04:24.520> very<00:04:24.699> minimal<00:04:25.240> structure

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
so it's a very very minimal structure

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.320 
so it's a very very minimal structure
just<00:04:25.870> material<00:04:26.590> now<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:27.249> be<00:04:27.370> draped<00:04:27.669> around<00:04:27.849> it

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
just material now to be draped around it

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.740 
just material now to be draped around it
so<00:04:28.990> it's<00:04:29.319> going<00:04:29.469> to<00:04:29.530> be

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
so it's going to be

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.780 
so it's going to be
of<00:04:31.230> anything<00:04:31.440> and<00:04:31.650> anybody<00:04:32.010> that

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
of anything and anybody that

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.240 
of anything and anybody that
but<00:04:34.360> as<00:04:34.480> we<00:04:34.660> come<00:04:34.870> round<00:04:35.080> you've<00:04:35.470> got<00:04:35.650> just<00:04:36.100> if

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
but as we come round you've got just if

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.860 
but as we come round you've got just if

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
it's worth looking you're right that is

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.980 
it's worth looking you're right that is
the<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.890> Zama<00:04:39.550> deeds<00:04:40.740> aquatics<00:04:41.740> proof

that's been laid on three boys a special
a<00:04:46.590> special<00:04:46.860> foundation<00:04:47.760> at<00:04:47.880> one<00:04:48.060> end<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:49.140> then

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
a special foundation at one end and then

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.540 
a special foundation at one end and then
here

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
here

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.090 
here
it's<00:04:50.880> probably<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.780> other<00:04:51.810> post

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
it's probably the other post

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.340 
it's probably the other post
thousand<00:04:53.520> four<00:04:53.700> hundred<00:04:53.880> tons<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.510> steel<00:04:54.810> in

thousand four hundred tons of steel in
that<00:04:55.950> roof<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.460> create<00:04:56.820> this<00:04:57.630> this<00:04:58.020> crazy<00:04:58.590> sort

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
that roof to create this this crazy sort

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.190 
that roof to create this this crazy sort
of<00:04:59.310> shake<00:04:59.580> it<00:04:59.610> from<00:05:00.420> a<00:05:00.510> structure<00:05:00.870> what<00:05:01.020> if<00:05:01.110> you

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
of shake it from a structure what if you

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.140 
of shake it from a structure what if you
just<00:05:01.440> look<00:05:01.590> like<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.770> tall<00:05:02.130> but<00:05:02.700> from<00:05:02.850> instead

just look like a tall but from instead

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.890 
just look like a tall but from instead
the<00:05:03.240> great<00:05:03.420> view<00:05:03.630> is<00:05:03.750> absolutely

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
the great view is absolutely

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.560 
the great view is absolutely
extraordinary
