years yes I've always been interested in

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.639 
years yes I've always been interested in
light<00:01:56.190> and<00:01:56.550> only<00:01:57.420> recently<00:01:57.600> became<00:01:58.320> aware

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
light and only recently became aware

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.650 
light and only recently became aware
that<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.670> to<00:02:00.060> deal<00:02:00.240> with<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.539> other
