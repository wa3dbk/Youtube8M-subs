00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello and welcome cube for 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.870
 micro atx and mini itx mainboards out there 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.840
 It's now quite a series though 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.020
 rather cool would that get involved and has 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.480
 the ds or dead silence in the market 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.990
 apparently brought a house that very much 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.539
 should be quiet 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:33.170
 otherwise at first glance so format 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.940
 Compatibility with micro atx and mini itx 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.280
 and also a equipment it then 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.950
 but something of the competition as for 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.040
 for example with phoenix prodigy and 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.129
 velen models sets apart remarkably 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.289
 We also have numerous timetables 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.850
 have us all here in hair loss 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.850
 let come red 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.369
 I had a bit too much 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.180
 promised 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.310
 that is so red but goes 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.070
 compared to the hardwareluxx red 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.070
 maybe a little bit more in 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.390
 his salmon-colored direction but there 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.350
 i am also no expert and would like to 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.289
 I'm not too far out of the window now 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.070
 go in any case a red friend 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:40.179
 go through relatively 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.310
 Apart from the loins for the 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.439
 external drives that it quite 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.600
 remarkable system even gives that 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.909
 is in the competitive models namely 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:56.289
 partly not the case 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:58.240
 red then the lid and see there 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:03.759
 we also have a special feature 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.420
 namely this cover of the so to speak 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.329
 his variant is that a dense 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.120
 Cover the thank the ceiling fan 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:15.870
 places closes during fan 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.820
 just want to install it 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.790
 mashup cover with dust filters 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:26.950
 mount and that is exactly goes to the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.459
 places makes this holding device 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:35.319
 mount but next to it 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:38.190
 the whole open and then back in 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.109
 Based on the operating models two 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.900
 120 mm fan places in the lid 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:47.829
 Alternatively, the assembly of a 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.840
 240 mm radiator allow so though 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.120
 this is a reasonably compact housing 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.650
 it is possible to water cooling to 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.190
 use 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.850
 a panel contemporary equipped with usb 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:04.540
 3.0 additionally twice usb 2.0 and 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:09.319
 Of course, the audio sockets have served 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.840
 you, of course, exist 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.400
 and then the whole thing at the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:20.200
 opportunity right down again 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.200
 a plastic stand surface 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:27.639
 worth mentioning here certainly the power supply 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.639
 on would pull out a can 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.550
 and then, of course, the look around it 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.560
 housing around there is the whole 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.580
 alternatively with meandering year 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.410
 excluded side part and then on 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.890
 the back nicely the construction too 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:51.239
 Detect power supply on the ground but about it 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.390
 then the mainboard is mounted lying with 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.400
 up to much expansion cards and too 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:04.890
 of course, see the back 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:11.849
 air fan diameter with 120 mm pension 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:18.019
 sure both sides screw the 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:20.519
 would also be pleasantly robust impression 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.760
 and then we see in the interior 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.850
 in 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.030
 In the case of the Phoenix models, one often only has one 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.450
 a drive cage sit the sport 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.180
 sure aerocool then very much 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.210
 space for long expansion cards and 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.090
 at the same time also just above this 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.820
 external drive slots 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.440
 difference as well as beautiful at the 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.110
 front to see because there is not 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.270
 a standard format fan but a 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.270
 huge 20 cm fan 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:02.120
 laterally and from below behind the front 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.919
 The air sucks like the volume 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.500
 characteristic is to be seen 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:11.600
 that it should be this large format 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:14.300
 partly still another problem so 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.090
 if then at the moment it does it justice 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.370
 will be waiting 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.130
 in any case to drive assembly in 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.690
 hard disk area a tool this 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:29.229
 system with these drawers 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:36.169
 decoupling by rubber rings sp against it 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:38.570
 defend the external screwed 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.100
 drives for the then there is the 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.669
 classic looks montage 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.830
 So here we see another 84 frames 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.250
 for expansion cards plenty of room for 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:53.060
 high tower cooler you just go up 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:55.669
 stand out as a housing that for small 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:00.500
 but hardly thought of 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:02.479
 Restrictions there is so in the 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.210
 components choice relative to the user 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.030
 free choices is 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.389
 of course not because ultra compact 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.509
 but is still worth than the typical 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:16.569
 on the whole looks at first glance 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.340
 the neatly processed the 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.650
 surface here by the way in are ready 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.229
 which is still perhaps to mention a 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.060
 soft coating so comparable 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.560
 this soft touch from with phoenix though 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:32.949
 Here it is called then just any surface 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:36.240
 good as you would like it, of course 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:37.660
 principle just a soft one 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:44.320
 surface coating over the 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:47.979
 Plastic a practical sturdy 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:52.780
 housing in beautiful colors but 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:54.130
 for the final conclusion the saving 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.789
 Of course, we dodge ourselves for ours 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:02.080
 Test on ours until then 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:04.319
 first impressions from dsd marcoule dead 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.319
 silence
