the<00:01:30.119> advanced<00:01:30.329> because<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.750> comes<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:30.960> some

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the advanced because it comes with some

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.160 
the advanced because it comes with some
badass<00:01:31.829> looking<00:01:32.280> shoulder<00:01:32.640> pads<00:01:32.869> so<00:01:33.869> do<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
badass looking shoulder pads so do that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.260 
badass looking shoulder pads so do that
you<00:01:34.560> need<00:01:34.710> yourself<00:01:34.860> now<00:01:35.729> bear<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.000> mind<00:01:36.180> if

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
you need yourself now bear in mind if

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.490 
you need yourself now bear in mind if
you<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.450> make<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> advanced<00:01:37.049> version<00:01:37.110> you

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you can make the advanced version you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.899 
you can make the advanced version you
can<00:01:37.619> make<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.159> standard<00:01:38.579> version

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
can make the just standard version

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.660 
can make the just standard version
because<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.299> costs<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.780> little<00:01:39.869> bit<00:01:39.990> less<00:01:40.200> so

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
because it costs a little bit less so

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.560 
because it costs a little bit less so
obviously<00:01:41.670> you'll<00:01:41.820> need<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> Alvin<00:01:42.329> armor

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
obviously you'll need the Alvin armor

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.469 
obviously you'll need the Alvin armor
the<00:01:42.750> 12<00:01:43.020> Quicksilver<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.220> 10<00:01:44.460> steal<00:01:44.759> third
