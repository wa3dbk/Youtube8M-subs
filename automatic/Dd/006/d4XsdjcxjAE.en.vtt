00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.000
 today I want to talk about a 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.799
 university professors who have marked my 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.600
 barco because he makes me understand 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.340
 that he was working in education this 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.139
 was not just instructing the 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.000
 young people of tomorrow 6 as we 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.830
 would call on the instruction 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.119
 that working in schools was 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.160
 not to make better 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.650
 workers is doing better 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.270
 great and still today I'm wearing his 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.349
 inheritance because even though I can 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.580
 teachers something in 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.529
 performing interpreter 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.599
 I created among others a song that 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.510
 is called the writer in which the 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.850
 tells of the miller and I think that 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.650
 many teachers like him plus the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.780
 tomorrow's adults will have the look 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.780
 lit up at the same price 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.370
 it was a person I had poured that 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.620
 will be our rope we do not have an internship that 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.240
 made compare with crazy m it's a 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.370
 available person is to note that at 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.680
 who always offers us services 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.410
 custom in a clan what 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.790
 when we resume a cocktail 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.590
 noticed because they all know 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.530
 trainees targets and their 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.050
 potential then it must and be interested 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.090
 also to us and this without our medium 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.050
 of internship meet our preferences at 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.820
 we then to our learning needs 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.710
 that name but he will take the resources 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.970
 to allow us to progress in 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.950
 our academic path and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 professional all my children I 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.210
 think it makes a human person 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.680
 then accomplice of no longer I have the honor 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.820
 today to introduce someone who 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.530
 is not lucky to be recognized for 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.700
 the exceptional work that is doing that is 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.930
 a world sports service 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 physical activity but it's also 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.259
 our dear equipment to the team of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.820
 football can act to the equipment 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.350
 in something that does it takes 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.790
 that he responds to our little ones asks a 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.170
 little player retreat and 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.910
 coaches can be alone to manage 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.020
 but it's really good 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.580
 always with a smile 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.350
 the subscription is a little bit our 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.280
 our sun to the team after our 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.050
 practices that have been a bit more 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.250
 difficult one reinvesting supported there for 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.710
 welcome you with a smile 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.670
 our great monuments so really so 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.050
 it's awesome to see how 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.390
 managed to juggle his time at 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.490
 through his position in the sporting sense but 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.360
 also to face these studies here 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.759
 the inauguration 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.560
 so on behalf of the athlete barium and 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.060
 etienne pour sherbrooke who thanked 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.940
 for us it's sort of since 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.080
 team 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.550
 this person is important 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.110
 for me in a moment my journey 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.819
 academic where I was wondering a shot I 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.620
 wanted I wanted to continue my 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.810
 studies I was about to finish 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.300
 a bachelor's degree in pharmacology and then 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.800
 I typed the idea of ​​doing a master's 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.330
 in philosophy it's complicated this is 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.130
 not a current path for 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.000
 today's students and then I'm 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.440
 am sitting in the office of the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.520
 program coordinator I 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.200
 was really expecting that we will be able to 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.670
 have a profound discussion with 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.920
 she because for me I was one of 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.300
 70 students of the agreement that's where I 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.530
 did not deceive what she really has to 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.550
 heart the success of each of his 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.320
 students of the foot but know 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.310
 personally 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.840
 now I'm back to the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.560
 Faculty of Medicine for a doctoral student 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.940
 clinical session 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.780
 I really wanted to thank this 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.220
 nobody but for advice for them 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.390
 I'm lying who really allowed me to 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.110
 do this detour water that allowed me 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.620
 also to acquire expertise 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.270
 how to present it's really this 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.470
 no one who wrote me the fiber 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.800
 entrepreneurial flowing in my 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.240
 veins 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.280
 it's also about alcohol 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.020
 in it's wonderful to lead the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.790
 chance to be born on court and companies 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.040
 this beautiful rose where he has also accepted 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.050
 to be the mentor of our company 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.720
 for five years now nuance between 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.340
 and recognize his teachers there 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.930
 much more than a teacher at my 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.660
 eyes it's really a protective dad 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.280
 a second step he has always been there to 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.170
 my sides as much in the good as in 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.640
 the less good times 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.020
 inspiration inspiration inspiration 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.880
 that's really the word that comes back to me 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.290
 head whenever I think back to 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.290
 this person who is much more 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.209
 that a teacher home from his 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.560
 country it takes a lot of courage but 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.600
 chemistry takes courage 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.010
 determination but also a 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.500
 teacher who is able to help us 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.850
 to surpass ourselves and he has always been there 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.760
 first to help me overwinter 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.440
 Quebec but then to explain myself 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.330
 chemistry to teach me chemistry and 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.770
 give me examples until 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.680
 I understood and that I am able 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.269
 to explain to others 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.769
 and it is high time his heart but 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.290
 also the largest of the department 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.030
 of chemistry and one day I tell him one day 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.890
 I will be as tall as you 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.049
 answered maybe when I will have slept 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.790
 in morning for me he's the example of 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.530
 successful integration but also and 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.400
 especially of the cultural diversity of 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.400
 the university of sherbrooke
