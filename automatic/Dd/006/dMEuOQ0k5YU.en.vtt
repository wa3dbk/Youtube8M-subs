00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
up while staying attached which is kind

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.830 
up while staying attached which is kind
of<00:01:13.340> cool<00:01:14.799> right<00:01:15.799> now<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.950> actually<00:01:16.100> have<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.840> this

of cool right now I actually have a this
this<00:01:18.590> ESC<00:01:19.159> this<00:01:19.310> brushless<00:01:19.640> esc<00:01:19.940> I<00:01:20.540> got<00:01:21.080> from<00:01:21.350> a

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
this ESC this brushless esc I got from a

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.000 
this ESC this brushless esc I got from a
and<00:01:21.710> exede<00:01:22.130> car<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:22.700> uh<00:01:23.350> 3,300<00:01:24.350> kv<00:01:24.710> brushless

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
and exede car and uh 3,300 kv brushless

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.210 
and exede car and uh 3,300 kv brushless
motor<00:01:25.430> cuz<00:01:25.850> I<00:01:26.180> mean<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.290> brush<00:01:27.500> one<00:01:27.710> gets<00:01:28.010> up

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
motor cuz I mean the brush one gets up

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.670 
motor cuz I mean the brush one gets up
to<00:01:28.400> speed<00:01:28.820> but<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.570> really<00:01:29.869> has<00:01:30.229> no

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
to speed but it really has no

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.000 
to speed but it really has no
acceleration<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:32.150> takes<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:33.080> very<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.799> takes

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
acceleration it takes a very it takes

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.950 
acceleration it takes a very it takes
probably<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:35.320> don't<00:01:36.320> know<00:01:36.439> 20<00:01:36.950> 20<00:01:37.610> feet<00:01:38.090> 25<00:01:38.630> feet

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
probably I don't know 20 20 feet 25 feet

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.429 
probably I don't know 20 20 feet 25 feet
maybe<00:01:39.170> two<00:01:39.439> for<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.650> to<00:01:39.740> get<00:01:39.890> up<00:01:39.979> to<00:01:40.130> full<00:01:40.340> speed

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
maybe two for it to get up to full speed

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.030 
maybe two for it to get up to full speed
now<00:01:42.439> my<00:01:42.680> ESC<00:01:43.250> burned<00:01:43.729> out<00:01:44.409> which<00:01:45.409> I'll<00:01:45.619> splice

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
now my ESC burned out which I'll splice

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:55.100 
now my ESC burned out which I'll splice
that<00:01:46.310> video<00:01:46.580> into<00:01:46.939> but

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
Tamiya adapter yeah it's got very very

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.420 
Tamiya adapter yeah it's got very very
nice<00:04:16.500> I<00:04:16.709> know<00:04:16.769> I've<00:04:16.890> said<00:04:17.100> this<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.220> million

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
nice I know I've said this a million

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.360 
nice I know I've said this a million
times<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.910> very<00:04:18.150> nice<00:04:18.359> aluminum<00:04:19.370> oil-filled

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
times the very nice aluminum oil-filled

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.210 
times the very nice aluminum oil-filled
shocks<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:21.150> they<00:04:21.440> even<00:04:22.440> have<00:04:22.620> speeds<00:04:22.980> they

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
shocks and they even have speeds they

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.880 
shocks and they even have speeds they
really<00:04:23.780> thrill<00:04:24.780> absorb<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.230> lot<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.470> impact

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
really thrill absorb a lot of the impact

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.280 
really thrill absorb a lot of the impact
BM<00:04:26.250> when<00:04:27.090> you're<00:04:27.210> turning<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:27.900> add<00:04:28.080> about<00:04:28.170> half

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
BM when you're turning to add about half

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.440 
BM when you're turning to add about half
half<00:04:29.130> to<00:04:29.310> full<00:04:29.490> speed<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.850> actually<00:04:30.150> leans

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
half to full speed it actually leans

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.490 
half to full speed it actually leans
into<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.900> turns<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:32.780> this<00:04:33.780> is<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.020> first<00:04:34.260> car

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
into the turns and this is the first car

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.500 
into the turns and this is the first car
I've<00:04:34.590> had<00:04:34.740> with<00:04:34.860> really<00:04:35.220> good<00:04:35.340> suspension<00:04:36.030> so

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
I've had with really good suspension so

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.820 
I've had with really good suspension so
it's<00:04:36.690> probably<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.110> lot<00:04:37.350> of<00:04:37.440> people<00:04:37.740> are

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
it's probably a lot of people are

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.950 
it's probably a lot of people are
probably<00:04:38.010> used<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:38.520> but<00:04:38.700> that<00:04:39.630> was<00:04:39.750> pretty

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
probably used to it but that was pretty

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.080 
probably used to it but that was pretty
cool<00:04:40.169> for<00:04:40.410> me<00:04:40.530> besides<00:04:40.980> a<00:04:41.270> slash<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:42.600> know

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
cool for me besides a slash you know

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.540 
cool for me besides a slash you know
that<00:04:45.090> was<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:45.360> cool<00:04:45.630> but<00:04:45.900> this<00:04:46.140> thing<00:04:46.550> this

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
that was so cool but this thing this

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.700 
that was so cool but this thing this
thing<00:04:47.610> is<00:04:47.880> a<00:04:47.970> rocket<00:04:48.270> with<00:04:48.720> this<00:04:48.900> setup<00:04:49.169> I<00:04:49.470> mean

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
thing is a rocket with this setup I mean

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.090 
thing is a rocket with this setup I mean
it<00:04:49.830> actually<00:04:50.130> weighs<00:04:51.560> what's<00:04:52.560> this<00:04:52.710> over<00:04:52.950> here

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
anything weighs about as much as my

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
roll the roll cage in the back is a nice

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.090 
roll the roll cage in the back is a nice
you<00:05:08.730> know<00:05:08.760> it's<00:05:08.910> pretty<00:05:09.060> nice<00:05:09.150> it's<00:05:09.330> plastic

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
you know it's pretty nice it's plastic

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.230 
you know it's pretty nice it's plastic
but<00:05:11.100> I've<00:05:11.190> rolled<00:05:11.460> on<00:05:11.610> in<00:05:11.730> a<00:05:11.790> couple<00:05:12.030> times

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240

but I've rolled on in a couple times
already<00:05:12.540> it<00:05:12.960> seems<00:05:13.140> pretty<00:05:13.440> durable<00:05:13.710> I<00:05:14.040> mean

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
already it seems pretty durable I mean

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.390 
already it seems pretty durable I mean
obviously<00:05:14.940> it's<00:05:15.120> not<00:05:15.470> iron<00:05:16.470> or<00:05:16.800> anything<00:05:17.160> but

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.460 
obviously it's not iron or anything but
it<00:05:17.669> seems<00:05:18.060> like<00:05:18.419> a<00:05:18.450> durable<00:05:18.840> plastic<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.260> shut

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470

it seems like a durable plastic you shut
it<00:05:19.500> off<00:05:19.680> there<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:21.720> wheels<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:23.010> wheels<00:05:23.040> are

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110
