00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.389
 Well, the recipe we are going to prepare today 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.869
 It is a very fast and super simple rice 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.619
 of meat and especially the brain of 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.660
 rice does not have a certain meat what 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.430
 you can do with anything that 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.949
 you have at home that sometimes we say use 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.570
 I have nothing to eat so look 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.059
 you have then look in this case some 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.730
 Butifarras that we had frozen 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.730
 we take them out we make them if you have pig 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.940
 If you have any beef whatever 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.590
 thing you can use chicken no problem 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.700
 then to do it 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.079
 we are going to need rice normally not 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.030
 according to actions at home it is customary 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.809
 to do is take a glass of these 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.629
 wine and each cup is the measure for a 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.570
 more or less about 100 grams 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.250
 A little less 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.800
 the people that you are in house then 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.020
 do one more quantity or less after 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:12.040
 we will need a tiny onion already 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.820
 crushed or grated as we want 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.880
 a mixture of white wine garlic and parsley 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.430
 then about 6 tablespoons of tomato 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.060
 fried or natural as we want there is no 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.030
 here there is no problem a little salt 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.320
 oil and hot water especially is very 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.930
 important the hot water issue 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.040
 for the cooking of the rice we are going to 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:40.480
 start by putting an oil base 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:50.200
 the ass more than anything to fry 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:53.469
 our sausages to people starts to 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.909
 already to warm up we will throw the meat that 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.770
 have in this case for the sausages 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.770
 and we give them a little bit 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.310
 once we have more or less 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.410
 9 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.410
 sopitas we will remove it 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.020
 and in the same oil where we have written 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.900
 the 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.610
 the goals 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.610
 we will donate the onion 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.840
 when you already have doradito 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.840
 we will add the tomato 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.190
 if we see that you already have enough tomato 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.180
 then we do not add more depends 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.180
 we will add 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:13.650
 and we will leave it or phil and when 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.769
 we have the tomato sofrito 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.129
 we add the butifarra or the 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.849
 meat that we have put and we give him a 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.849
 couple of laps 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.870
 now this point is when we have 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.159
 what 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.500
 and add the salt or as I do 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.370
 you add it as you go 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.370
 putting the tomato and the onion 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.760
 when we have this hot we add 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.730
 rice rice is important to add 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.680
 the time because for us to fit 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.680
 you have to toast a little 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.480
 we will not let you toast a bit 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.480
 very little outside 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.340
 and now that we have the rice 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:21.070
 more or less that we are made 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.600
 Toasted in a little we will add the 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.600
 agent parsley and wine 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:33.189
 and let us integrate everything well 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.189
 nothing a couple of minutes not much more 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.630
 here we will rectify salt again 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.630
 because keep in mind that the rice we 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.630
 we have put 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:05:01.070
 and we can always rectify the last 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:03.440
 moment and now that we have been 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.990
 evaporated the wine and everything we will go 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.990
 adding hot water 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.129
 until it heals us all 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:24.049
 and once we have everything covered 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:24.049
 we'll let it cook about 20 minutes 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.630
 or until we see that we have already been 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:33.400
 absorbed all the liquid in the rice in 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.260
 these moments if we can we should 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.870
 try a little bit what is the broth 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.450
 to see if it is to our liking for him 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.520
 because if you do not add salt by 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.640
 other side if we prefer we can instead 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.280
 to put water we can put it either 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.230
 broth or water with a pill 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.870
 you're avecrem and so you'll have more 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.200
 taste our rice like us 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.200
 we prefer 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.290
 as we can see we almost have the 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.810
 rice is too little to finish now 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.180
 it absorbs the remaining liquid and then 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.870
 already when we let it rest and what 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.870
 it will end 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:16.980
 to absorb everything and almost absorption 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:19.650
 all the broth then 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.930
 I would have paid for it and left it to rest 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.500
 5 minutes 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.500
 as you can see it has finished 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:32.340
 absorb all the liquid and has 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.970
 remaining a sweet rice is ready 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.060
 at your service 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.620
 here we have not been ready to serve 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.919
 you have verified that it is very easy to 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.350
 do very fast and with anything 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:45.810
 you have in the fridge if you have meat 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.150
 of beef you will know about pork 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.000
 chicken chicken what we want there is no 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.460
 problem is equally delicious and 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.410
 surprise more than one I hope that you 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.400
 have liked and see you next 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.400
