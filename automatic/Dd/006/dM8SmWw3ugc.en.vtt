00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
just on the melons I will include that

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.529 
just on the melons I will include that
but<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.810> also<00:00:21.990> wanted<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> plant<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.130> tomatoes

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
but I also wanted to plant the tomatoes

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.359 
but I also wanted to plant the tomatoes
and<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:24.779> been<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.289> hot<00:00:25.560> here<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.130> I've<00:00:26.220> been

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
and it's been so hot here and I've been

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.390 
and it's been so hot here and I've been
hardening<00:00:26.760> off<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.150> tomatoes<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:28.400> actually

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
hardening off the tomatoes and actually

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.669 
hardening off the tomatoes and actually
today<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:30.150> ended<00:00:30.599> up<00:00:30.689> being<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> perfect<00:00:31.320> day

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
today it ended up being the perfect day

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.209 
today it ended up being the perfect day
it's<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> 80s<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:33.030> overcast<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.649> think

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
it's in the 80s it's overcast so I think

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.940 
it's in the 80s it's overcast so I think
that<00:00:35.460> tomatoes<00:00:35.969> will<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:37.200> good

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that tomatoes will have a good

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.580

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.270 
far and the c90 we'll see how that fares
-<00:03:34.540> alright<00:03:35.049> let's<00:03:35.260> go<00:03:35.410> check<00:03:35.440> out<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:36.069> area
