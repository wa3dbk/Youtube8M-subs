00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.919
 it is 6 0 against Saloniki that is the conciliatory conclusion of a 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.929
 exciting half year 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.950
 Bad luck Rivoli happy that we could say goodbye in a peat festival 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.370
 with our loyal fans 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.560
 Stadium was full in freezing cold and percent the fans have our fingers crossed 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.230
 pressed Â»well supported 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.430
 and that's nice that the crew can pay back what is going to be nice too 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.290
 which also Kloten burst again is that also make goals again 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.699
 yes, I think today, the audience have experienced everything you experience 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.410
 Wanted it were Tolo gates and 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.990
 a team that partially re-solidifies the game of the second half 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.900
 we would have Cologne 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.120
 with the disaster must be quite so satisfied 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.160
 but more important is who 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.890
 In the last match to our arbitrator have recovered the opera with the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.270
 Playground can be very satisfied that it is him after the 1 0 through the head 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.520
 went 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.990
 same picture DK already said important is that we make this first goal and 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.520
 that's how you saw it " 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.810
 Well, I fly 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.930
 Wariner also convinced in the now only play 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.670
 there were scoring goals but there it has believed me and today 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.740
 the belief that must have been about 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.070
 if you shoot such a goal against the Slovenians full Fulda would have to the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.590
 Also wins three four now and historically Euro high 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.400
 yes certainly was 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.830
 are all relieved that today has worked so well and we are in first 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.560
 Line but also for the fans that he already 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.730
 Conclusion should have been offered who as a group-first 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.630
 the latter fall master and continue in the dfb cup SCA times 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.150
 to have merry holidays 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.120
 To be a camelle, I am glad that too 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.230
 rest for a few days now and they would be market turmoil 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.010
 After 1 0 one had the impression of having the crew 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.870
 would be released what for them on the bench Riahi Klimek because again 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.890
 more in their own way ca very defensive started 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.400
 I'll watch TV and watch it "but here they were 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 who had driven to before 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.550
 These six or more contribute to putting a bit of calm in, too 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.190
 outside of the media 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.680
 the tiny crowd there will explain everything then will be rest then how should 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.230
 Do not focus more on football, not on a side issue 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.299
 he left him on the bench 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.209
 of course, everything that says the first goal fell 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.560
 also very early 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.590
 and the second afterwards after 20 minutes but of course this was ideal for us 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.930
 and liberated play 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.840
 then percent even and playful accents set and percent SPD I want 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.040
 the tensions per cent so the work the tension it can be no big either 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.379
 Role more you can play free 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.439
 Daimler owe 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.609
 Iran two days no longer the winning ways 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.569
 also both percent regarding that but I'm good that we do that 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:42.959
 handball 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.590
 with so much pressure on the team's Ostalgia camp of clubs with six 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.029
 Goals and assists percent 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:53.480
 Bas makes you show he did and you want to go yes we always swallow 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.479
 and then again others are being reached as goals hurried Oslo wanted 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.359
 dfb cup and the uefa cup continue 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.569
 and who in the league first woman like that 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.419
 but steady
