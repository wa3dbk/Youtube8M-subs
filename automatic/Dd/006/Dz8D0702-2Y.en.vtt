Ahlers<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.410> still<00:00:49.950> think<00:00:50.130> Effect<00:00:50.460> Veiler<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
Ahlers I still think Effect Veiler is a

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.700 
Ahlers I still think Effect Veiler is a
pretty<00:00:51.120> good<00:00:51.300> option<00:00:51.630> in<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.230> deck<00:00:52.470> it

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
pretty good option in this deck it

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.160 
pretty good option in this deck it
allows<00:00:52.920> me<00:00:53.130> to<00:00:53.160> go<00:00:53.310> into<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.550> synchros<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.329> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
allows me to go into a synchros and it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.440 
allows me to go into a synchros and it
gives<00:00:55.320> me<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> extra<00:00:55.980> hand<00:00:56.370> trap<00:00:56.700> that<00:00:57.390> I

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
gives me that extra hand trap that I

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.060 
gives me that extra hand trap that I
think<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.380> know<00:00:58.470> you<00:00:58.530> sometimes<00:00:58.950> need

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
think I you know you sometimes need

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.180 
think I you know you sometimes need
inside<00:00:59.790> the<00:00:59.910> inn<00:00:59.970> sector<00:01:00.300> deck<00:01:00.590> as<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:01.950> mystic

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
inside the inn sector deck as for mystic

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.280 
inside the inn sector deck as for mystic
tomato<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.610> Armageddon<00:01:02.820> night<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.079> just

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
tomato and Armageddon night this is just

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.509 
tomato and Armageddon night this is just
to<00:01:04.379> kind<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.159> can't<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.460> my

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
to kind of you know if I can't get my

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.859 
to kind of you know if I can't get my
combo<00:01:05.880> pieces<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.390> away

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
combo pieces right away

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.239 
combo pieces right away
hopefully<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.530> draw<00:01:07.680> into<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.009> of<00:01:08.130> these

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:08.249 
hopefully I can draw into one of these

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:09.770 
hopefully I can draw into one of these
which<00:01:08.609> will<00:01:08.789> then<00:01:08.939> allow<00:01:08.969> me<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.509> get<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
which will then allow me to get the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.989 
which will then allow me to get the
combo<00:01:10.049> pieces<00:01:10.469> lots<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.399> darks<00:01:11.639> in<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> deck

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:11.999 
combo pieces lots of darks in the deck

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:13.550 
combo pieces lots of darks in the deck
so<00:01:12.179> I<00:01:12.210> still<00:01:12.450> think<00:01:12.630> dark<00:01:12.840> armed<00:01:13.020> dragon<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.530> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
so I still think dark armed dragon is a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.700 
so I still think dark armed dragon is a
nice<00:01:13.799> viable<00:01:14.450> card<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.719> it<00:01:15.869> some<00:01:16.109> people<00:01:16.229> have

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
nice viable card in it some people have

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.260 
nice viable card in it some people have
you<00:01:16.979> know<00:01:17.039> kind<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.310> opted<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.729> take<00:01:17.880> them<00:01:18.119> out

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
you know kind of opted to take them out

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.629 
you know kind of opted to take them out
I<00:01:18.539> don't<00:01:19.079> have<00:01:19.259> any<00:01:19.829> tour<00:01:20.069> guides<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.399> I<00:01:20.459> can't

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:20.639 
I don't have any tour guides so I can't

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:22.429 
I don't have any tour guides so I can't
play<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.789> tour<00:01:21.060> guide<00:01:21.179> build<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:22.289> will

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
play a tour guide build that will

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.870 
play a tour guide build that will
obviously<00:01:22.829> probably<00:01:23.039> change<00:01:23.429> in<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.759> next

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880

this<00:03:15.240> is<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.540> insector<00:03:15.960> deck<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.350> was<00:03:16.440> used

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
this is the insector deck that was used

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.440 
this is the insector deck that was used
against<00:03:16.980> me<00:03:17.070> in<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.370> recent<00:03:17.700> dual<00:03:17.820> video<00:03:18.180> I

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
against me in the recent dual video I

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.120 
against me in the recent dual video I
didn't<00:03:18.900> go<00:03:18.990> to<00:03:19.050> in-depth<00:03:19.440> into<00:03:19.770> this<00:03:19.920> deck

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.979

list<00:03:20.340> because<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:20.940> pretty<00:03:21.209> similar<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.600> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
list because it is pretty similar to the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.750 
list because it is pretty similar to the
deck<00:03:22.350> build<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.739> I<00:03:22.830> put<00:03:23.040> up<00:03:23.160> on<00:03:23.250> my<00:03:23.310> channel<00:03:23.700> a
