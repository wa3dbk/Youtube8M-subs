 Hi guys , how are you? 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.420
 I'm going to bring you one today. 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.600
 loaf bread recipe this loaf of bread 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.480
 it is simpler than the video that 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.490
 I posted before this 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.740
 who did not watch the locally here 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.000
 below if you are interested 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:33.500
 this recipe and we're going to use five eggs to 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.970
 light and the yolk 240 grams of sugar 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.600
 refined with 220 grams of 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.440
 wheat a tablespoon of yeast in 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.430
 powder and two tablespoons of 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.220
 Soy 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.220
 now I'm going to hit the eggs with sugar 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.489
 and I'm going to beat until the volume of people 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.489
 almost doubles 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.969
 now I'll add the oil and beat 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.969
 a little more 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.329
 the tva is in this consistency now I 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.929
 I'll add flour slowly and 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.929
 hit 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.420
 once more I added the flour and I go 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.420
 hit 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.100
 and now I'm going to add flour to 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.100
 last time 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.630
 ending the beat the dough will stay 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.459
 this way and now just add the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.459
 yeast and beat some more 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:30.849
 the texture of the final mass for this 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.970
 loaf bread recipe salsipé 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:40.239
 I have here three roasting options 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:43.209
 and different aaron here has the one to him is 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.700
 a rim and I think the 20 centimeters 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.519
 but then I'll put the measurements 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.069
 right on the video description if you 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.100
 choose to use an act like that you will 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.799
 having to hold paper in the background 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.680
 butter and got this tac in those 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:03.370
 flag and will have to put another 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.590
 make the biggest from down to there giving 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.410
 firmness on paper and not have the risk of 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.709
 break the paper with the dough inside the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:16.090
 oven has this one here is a baking dish 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.160
 normal, which is also easy and the one I 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.160
 I'll use this cause. 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.959
 I thought I suppose she's crazier and 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:30.069
 they also do these was that opens 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.470
 false bottom and I like to work with 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.109
 parchment paper 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.720
 I do not like a past today, I just 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.329
 I use the butter paper for any type 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.250
 cake that was doing and I also a 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.160
 something else either 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.430
 the sides who want a lid to put together 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.250
 but with me this cake always worked 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.490
 so I did not sing that I always 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.550
 put the paper on the bottom 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:01.150
 there it is at the discretion of who is to do 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.700
 I will now pour the batter into the only 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.840
 want because the mass here inside the 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.480
 villages 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.910
 and I like to spread the good mass 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.100
 income from it so as not to have the risk of 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.800
 loaf of bread grow crooked 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.859
 so where do I see that the 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.380
 patty I take ajeitadinho not 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.419
 have the risk of happening and take more 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.110
 I already knew 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.790
 and as for the furnace oven I assumed it already 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.669
 preheated at medium temperature it 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.930
 is in oven about a time 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:41.169
 30 to 35 minutes after baking it goes 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.470
 stay in this source soon from the horn shot 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.710
 I pass the knife around him to 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.540
 to detach from the form promote it 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.540
 to play the role of butter 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:05:04.470
 I had this false bottom by hand 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:04.470
 clean and go I'm pulling turntables 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:16.570
 careful not to take the risk of 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.570
 rip the cake 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.460
 now after having to take care of the 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.460
 sides I come 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.030
 Then it gets totally perfection. 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.920
 leasing 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:10.520
 he is looking to cut in this 3 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.780
 size of the baking pan I made up for 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.770
 43 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.060
 only in my case it 's just cut in two 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.020
 parts 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:24.860
 so here it is good as a large knife 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.440
 this very carefully to maintain the 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:31.220
 risk of ruin márcio mon 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.990
 like I said I was going to split two parts 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:38.200
 if you know it stayed until a small part 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:42.620
 in this part 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.810
 Now I'm going to do the stuffing and I'm going to 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.410
 wet the cake too with a lack I will 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:51.650
 post separately or the claudinha to 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.470
 to water a cake with staff the recipe is 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.220
 I hope that you have enjoyed 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.220
 see you next time
