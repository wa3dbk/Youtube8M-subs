00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.270
SHOW UP WITH MY TOTAL FORECAST

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.620
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.510
STEVE:

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.110
INVESTIGATORS IN OGUNQUIT

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.640
ARE TRYING TO DETERMINE THE

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.540
CAUSE OF MASSIVE FIRE THAT

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.340
DESTROYED TWO ICONIC BUSINESSES

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.010
LAST NIGHT.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.610
IT TOOK EIGHT FIRE DEPARTMENTS

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.720
TO PUT OUT THE FLAMES AT THE

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.850
BLUE WATER INN AND HUCKLEBERRY'S

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.920
.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.790
80 THOMPSON IS AT THE SCENE WITH

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.190
THE REASON FINDING A CAUSE WILL

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.760
BE CHALLENGING.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.860
KATIE: FIRE MARSHALS ARE TELLING

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.930
ME THE STRUCTURE IS SITTING ON

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:39.530
STILTS AND IT IS FAR TOO

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.670
DANGEROUS FOR THEM TO GO IN.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.570
WHICH MAY BE WHY WE HAVE SEEN

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.600
THEM PUT THIS FENCE UP AND

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.840
BOARDED-UP WINDOWS.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.610
BOTH BUILDINGS WILL NEED TO BE

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.610
TORN DOWN, CREATING A HOLE JUST

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.680
IN TIME FOR SUMMER.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.820
CELL PHONE CAMERAS CAPTURING

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.120
HARROWING MOMENTS AS FLAMES GROW

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.790
STRONGER.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.160
ALL UNITS ON.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.460
I DO NOT WANT ANYONE IN THE

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.200
BUILDING.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.900
KATIE: VIDEO SHOWS THE MOMENT OF

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.570
THE FIRE CHIEF ARRIVE TO A FIRE

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.800
TOO DANGEROUS TO FIGHT FROM THE

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.140
INSIDE.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.770
WE HAD TERRIBLE ACCESS

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.270
PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF WIRES.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.770
FIRE AND SMOKE COMING ACROSS THE

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.410
ROAD.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.940
WE DID THE BEST WE COULD TO SAVE

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.180
PART OF THE NEW BUILDING

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.950
OUTBACK.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.050
THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.460
I HEARD SOMETHING.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.520
KATIE:

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.150
THE LANDMARK BUILDINGS

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.360
ARE IN ATTRACTION OF THEIR OWN

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.290
TODAY.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.860
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A FIRE LIKE

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.390
THIS.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.360
THAT TIMING IS REALLY TOO BAD.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.060
KATIE: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT FOR

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.670
MANY WHO WITNESSED THE BLAZE.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.100
I FELT SAD THIS WAS HAPPENING

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.600
IN OUR COMMUNITY.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.200
THIS IS A FOCAL POINT OF TOURIST

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.540
ATTRACTIONS.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.770
KATIE: JOBS, INCOME, PROPERTY

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.680
LOST.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.980
BUT THERE IS A BRIGHT SIDE TO

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.650
THE STORY.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.520
NO LOSS OF LIFE, NO INJURIES.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.920
NO ONE IN THE RESTAURANT OR

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.490
ROOMS UP ABOVE.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.720
IF THIS HAD BEEN THE

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.390
SUMMERTIME,

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.630
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.450
KATIE: THAT IS THE SENTIMENT IN

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.730
OGUNQUIT TODAY

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.330
.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.930
WHEN THE BUILDINGS BECOME A

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.530
BLANK SPACE THIS SUMMER, THEY

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.130
WILL SERVE AS A REMINDER THAT

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.330
THINGS COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.800
WORSE.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.270
THE FIRE CHIEF TELLS ME TWO

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.740
FIREFIGHTERS WERE TAKEN TO THE

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.410
HOSPITAL LAST NIGHT WITH MINOR

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.610
INJURIES BUT BOTH ARE DOING FINE

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.080
TODAY.
