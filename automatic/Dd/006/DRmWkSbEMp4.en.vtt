question how could somebody possibly

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.660 
question how could somebody possibly
think<00:01:02.040> we're<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.489> blow<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.000> moon

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
think we're going to blow up the moon

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.200 
think we're going to blow up the moon
that's<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.850> great<00:01:06.060> question

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
that's a great question

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.850 
that's a great question
don't<00:01:09.210> worry<00:01:09.390> about<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.840> moon<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.500> set<00:01:10.740> our

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
don't worry about the moon we we set our

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.740 
don't worry about the moon we we set our
laser<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.369> stun

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
laser to stun

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.430 
laser to stun
smart<00:01:14.300> now<00:01:15.300> we'll<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.660> able<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> beam

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
smart now we'll be able to see the beam

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.630 
smart now we'll be able to see the beam
when<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.680> leaves<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.190> it<00:01:17.280> won't<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.490> strong

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
when it leaves but it won't be strong

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.160 
when it leaves but it won't be strong
enough<00:01:17.760> when<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.150> comes<00:01:18.360> back<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.660> be<00:01:18.870> seen<00:01:19.020> by

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
enough when it comes back to be seen by

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.850 
enough when it comes back to be seen by
the<00:01:19.230> naked<00:01:19.380> eye

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860

right now yet funny job that device
there<00:01:30.660> will<00:01:31.020> measure<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.650> photons<00:01:31.980> that

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
there will measure the photons that

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.350 
there will measure the photons that
return<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.700> let<00:01:32.850> us<00:01:32.940> see<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.120> on<00:01:33.210> this

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
return and let us see it on this

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.380 
return and let us see it on this
computer<00:01:33.690> watch<00:01:33.990> get<00:01:34.170> them<00:01:34.290> some<00:01:34.440> glasses

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
computer watch get them some glasses

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.640 
computer watch get them some glasses
cool<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.510> gonna<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.840> 3d

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.100 

preparing<00:01:44.650> to<00:01:44.680> fire<00:01:45.220> laser<00:01:45.640> at<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.420> moon<00:01:46.660> make

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
preparing to fire laser at the moon make

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.550 
preparing to fire laser at the moon make
it<00:01:47.350> so

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.940 

there<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.340> there's<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.940> fight<00:01:54.950> 2.5

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
there it is there's this fight 2.5

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.200 
there it is there's this fight 2.5
seconds<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.490> light<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.640> return<00:01:56.970> that's

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
seconds for the light to return that's

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.050 
seconds for the light to return that's
the<00:01:57.450> moon<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.810> get<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> moon<00:02:01.790> that's<00:02:02.790> your<00:02:02.940> big

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the moon we get the moon that's your big

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.940 
the moon we get the moon that's your big
experiment

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
experiment

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.190 
experiment
I'll<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.130> her<00:02:05.250> light<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.729> stream<00:02:06.200> yeah

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
I'll have her light on the stream yeah

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.350 
I'll have her light on the stream yeah
but<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.650> think<00:02:08.039> about<00:02:08.520> what<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.000> represents

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
but I think about what this represents

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.540 
but I think about what this represents
the<00:02:10.229> fact<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.520> only

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
the fact that we can do this is the only

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.670 
the fact that we can do this is the only
way<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.239> definitively<00:02:12.900> proving<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.530> there

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
way of definitively proving that there

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.070 
way of definitively proving that there
are<00:02:13.709> man-made<00:02:13.800> objects<00:02:14.730> on<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.090> moon<00:02:15.270> put

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
are man-made objects on the moon put

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.630 
are man-made objects on the moon put
there<00:02:16.260> by<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.440> member<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.980> species<00:02:17.190> at<00:02:17.520> only

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
there by a member of a species at only

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.430 
there by a member of a species at only
60<00:02:18.060> years<00:02:18.270> before<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.569> just<00:02:18.840> invented<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
60 years before I just invented the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.290 
60 years before I just invented the
airplane<00:02:20.150> what<00:02:21.150> species<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.690> that

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.610 

I<00:02:25.420> was<00:02:26.020> wrong<00:02:26.620> penny<00:02:26.980> can<00:02:27.220> do<00:02:27.340> better<00:02:28.620> thank

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
I was wrong penny can do better thank
