obviously you have to have both to be

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.830 
obviously you have to have both to be
successful<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:18.870> a<00:01:19.070> wholesaler<00:01:20.070> and

continuously to do deals you need an

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.060 
continuously to do deals you need an
effective<00:01:24.780> buyers<00:01:25.260> list<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.860> that's

effective buyers list and that's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.170 
effective buyers list and that's
probably<00:01:27.470> when<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.770> guess<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.130> 50/50<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.880> how

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
probably when I guess it's 50/50 on how

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.910 
probably when I guess it's 50/50 on how
to<00:01:30.240> find<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> field<00:01:30.810> versus<00:01:31.260> how<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.440> find<00:01:31.740> a

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
someone you're basically gonna throw out

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.140 
someone you're basically gonna throw out
the<00:02:00.810> Creator<00:02:01.200> I'm<00:02:01.950> gonna<00:02:02.220> go<00:02:02.400> say<00:02:02.580> take<00:02:02.880> money

from but you got to get some money from

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.940 
from but you got to get some money from
so<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:06.030> easier<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.510> give<00:02:06.720> money<00:02:06.930> away<00:02:07.320> or<00:02:07.590> is

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so is it easier to give money away or is

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.350 
so is it easier to give money away or is
it<00:02:08.039> easier<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.429> get<00:02:08.580> someone<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.910> give<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.130 
it easier to get someone to give you
money<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.760> it's<00:02:11.760> easier<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.239> give<00:02:12.510> money<00:02:12.750> away

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
money so it's easier to give money away

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.140 
money so it's easier to give money away
and<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:13.469> and<00:02:13.799> this

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
and this and this

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.470 
and this and this
example<00:02:14.680> equity<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.980> money<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.730> it's<00:02:17.150> easy<00:02:17.420> to
