strategy<00:00:21.920> okay<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.369> let's<00:00:23.850> get<00:00:24.029> into<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:25.580> so

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
strategy okay so let's get into it so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.460 
strategy okay so let's get into it so
let's<00:00:26.789> start<00:00:27.119> with<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:27.510> she<00:00:27.930> renting

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
let's start with what she renting

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.310 
let's start with what she renting
actually<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:30.240> was<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> strategy<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:31.050> was

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
actually is it was a strategy that was

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.250 
actually is it was a strategy that was
originally<00:00:31.890> named<00:00:32.669> by<00:00:33.090> Jamie<00:00:33.420> McIntyre<00:00:34.079> and

originally named by Jamie McIntyre and

originally named by Jamie McIntyre and
it's<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.649> his<00:00:34.800> instant<00:00:35.520> cash<00:00:35.910> flow

it's one of his instant cash flow
strategies<00:00:37.190> this<00:00:38.190> particular<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.120> based

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
strategies this particular one is based

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.690 
strategies this particular one is based
around<00:00:39.629> shares<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.770> works<00:00:41.040> particularly

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
around shares and works particularly

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.910 
around shares and works particularly
well<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.329> Australian<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.440> American

well on the Australian and the American
stock<00:00:44.250> markets<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.719> does<00:00:45.960> take<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.770> little<00:00:47.129> bit

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
stock markets it does take a little bit

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.639 
stock markets it does take a little bit
of<00:00:47.579> time<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.329> learn<00:00:48.539> how<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.440> once

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
of time to learn how to do it but once

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.650 
of time to learn how to do it but once
you're<00:00:49.890> doing<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.430> jamie<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> opinion

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you're doing it jamie is of the opinion

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.500 
you're doing it jamie is of the opinion
that<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.280> strategy<00:00:54.000> by

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
that you can do this strategy by

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.360 
that you can do this strategy by
spending<00:00:54.809> less<00:00:55.110> than<00:00:55.140> an<00:00:55.500> hour<00:00:55.710> each<00:00:55.980> month

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
spending less than an hour each month

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.849 
spending less than an hour each month
doing<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.809> definitely<00:00:58.109> regarded<00:00:58.710> as

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
doing it and it's definitely regarded as

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.639 
doing it and it's definitely regarded as
one<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> lower<00:00:59.609> risk<00:01:00.059> strategies<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.260> has

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
one of the lower risk strategies and has

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.979 
one of the lower risk strategies and has
got<00:01:01.829> very<00:01:02.129> very<00:01:02.340> simple<00:01:02.670> steps<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.539> follow<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
got very very simple steps to follow to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.859 
got very very simple steps to follow to
make<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.769> work<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:07.380> overall<00:01:07.680> concept<00:01:08.869> of

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
make it work the overall concept of

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.020 
make it work the overall concept of
share<00:01:10.439> renting<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.070> first<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.580> all<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.939> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
share renting is first of all that you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.719 
share renting is first of all that you
go<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.240> buy<00:01:12.479> some<00:01:12.750> shares<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> rent

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
go and buy some shares and then you rent

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.670 
go and buy some shares and then you rent
them<00:01:14.909> out<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.330> that's<00:01:15.450> sort<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.170> bit<00:01:16.380> like

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
them out and that's sort of a bit like

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.010 
them out and that's sort of a bit like
renting<00:01:17.220> out<00:01:17.400> an<00:01:17.610> investment<00:01:18.240> property<00:01:18.479> but

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
renting out an investment property but

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.830 
renting out an investment property but
for<00:01:19.710> shares<00:01:19.979> instead<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.610> property<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.780> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
for shares instead of property so you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.609 
for shares instead of property so you
receive<00:01:22.759> rent<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.990> case<00:01:25.049> they<00:01:25.439> call

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
receive rent or in this case they call

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.859 
receive rent or in this case they call
it<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.860> premium<00:01:26.369> but<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.000> receive<00:01:27.330> rent<00:01:27.630> each

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
it a premium but you receive rent each

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.030 
it a premium but you receive rent each
month<00:01:27.930> by<00:01:28.890> renting<00:01:29.369> out<00:01:29.579> your<00:01:29.610> shares<00:01:30.890> you<00:01:31.890> can

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
month by renting out your shares you can

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.429 
month by renting out your shares you can
use<00:01:32.220> margin<00:01:32.790> loans<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.869> multiply

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
use margin loans if you like to multiply

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.990 
use margin loans if you like to multiply
your<00:01:34.500> results<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.520> even<00:01:35.820> bigger

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
your results so you get even bigger

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.929 
your results so you get even bigger
returns<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.250> one<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> great<00:01:38.640> things

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
returns and one of the great things

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.539 
returns and one of the great things
about<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.390> strategy<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:39.960> if<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.920> you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
about this strategy is if you like you

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.240 
about this strategy is if you like you
can<00:01:41.670> also<00:01:41.850> ensure<00:01:42.150> your<00:01:42.840> shares<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.159> you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
can also ensure your shares so that you

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.740 
can also ensure your shares so that you
minimize<00:01:44.490> your<00:01:44.939> risks<00:01:45.390> even<00:01:45.689> further<00:01:47.689> okay<00:01:48.689> so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
minimize your risks even further okay so

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.200 
minimize your risks even further okay so
let's<00:01:49.049> take<00:01:49.740> an<00:01:49.860> example<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.399> how<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.700> works<00:01:50.909> if

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
let's take an example of how it works if

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.030 
let's take an example of how it works if
we<00:01:51.270> take<00:01:51.659> an<00:01:51.840> example<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.470> share<00:01:52.740> that's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
we take an example of a share that's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.270 
we take an example of a share that's
let's<00:01:53.460> say<00:01:54.110> trading<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.320> twenty<00:01:55.619> dollars<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
let's say trading for twenty dollars and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.840 
let's say trading for twenty dollars and
if<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.810> buy<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.680> particular<00:01:59.070> share<00:01:59.520> at

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
if you buy that particular share at

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.590 
if you buy that particular share at
twenty<00:02:00.299> dollars<00:02:01.009> what<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.329> order

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
twenty dollars what you then do in order

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.499 
twenty dollars what you then do in order
to<00:02:03.899> rent<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.670> enter<00:02:06.060> into<00:02:06.240> an

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.120 
that you you were comfortable with if
you'd<00:04:10.840> ever<00:04:10.959> dropped<00:04:11.290> below<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:11.740> figure

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
you'd ever dropped below that figure

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.340 
you'd ever dropped below that figure
then<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.550> could<00:04:12.760> always<00:04:12.910> sell<00:04:13.600> your<00:04:13.990> shares

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
then you could always sell your shares

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.760 
then you could always sell your shares
for<00:04:14.950> that<00:04:15.130> amount<00:04:15.370> of<00:04:15.520> money<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:17.470> what<00:04:17.620> this

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
for that amount of money so what this

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.060 
for that amount of money so what this
means<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.459> that<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.570> maximum<00:04:19.930> risk<00:04:20.590> that

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
means is that the maximum risk that

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.240 
means is that the maximum risk that
you've<00:04:21.280> got<00:04:21.580> in<00:04:21.850> owning<00:04:22.450> those<00:04:22.600> shares

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
you've got in owning those shares

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.540 
you've got in owning those shares
capped<00:04:23.610> at<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.480> ensured<00:04:25.290> amount<00:04:28.370> okay<00:04:29.370> no

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
capped at that ensured amount okay no

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.760 
capped at that ensured amount okay no
