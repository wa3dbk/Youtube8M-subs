 visual result still a claw 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.570
 2010 again it was a gamble I will 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.540
 I had to defend gourcuff these 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.809
 generations to the box rafael nadal 1 who 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.090
 was beaten by fognini 7-6 and in 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.160
 press conference 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.460
 rafael nadal said it's a week 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.560
 very negative is crew who was hurting 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.019
 before no longer make the difference it's 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.550
 a desaster 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:35.660
 so we'll bother them benoît maylin 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:45.300
 benoît benoît nadal he is still scared 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:49.680
 jada benoît instead of parquet do not put 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.640
 his ket before the summer by barriers and 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.610
 panicked everyone is terrified as much 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.260
 kerry or suspender does not kill 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.019
 me favaro and 2 who gives you before 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.200
 the apocalypse google inc except that the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.350
 flaw he dazzles nobody anymore since 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.500
 the beginning of the year it is already 7 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.600
 defeated seven defeats from the start 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.659
 of the year it had been ten years since 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.210
 had not lost so many games 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.600
 early January until the end of the tournament 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.130
 of Barcelona and we pay more against 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.140
 players who beat us all who 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.540
 was beating all and players who had 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.810
 afraid of him as like berlin 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.570
 German 127th we lose against 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.759
 behind berdeak the australia open and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.100
 lose against bernique verdasco in miami 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.250
 and brake before 2015 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.490
 tetanus he had never lost to 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.799
 phoning controls since the beginning of 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.439
 the year he played twice he lost 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.829
 on clay in rio in the month of 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.920
 February 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.490
 alas today in barcelona he loses 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.619
 so while seraph who has the break 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.979
 but in the second set leads 3 games 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.979
 at 1 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.320
 he will serve to lead 5 games to 3 he goes 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.390
 come back worried 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.210
 bah no no look look 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.370
 rafa is at the top look well look 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.620
 as he lacks power of length 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.540
 of ball and trust even on his 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.400
 famous lasso righthands there a disaster 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.190
 there he serves to win the second set 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.880
 san jose to 4 for him that distribute these 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.709
 towards my forehand 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.680
 it sticks you must neither in the bass 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.540
 cevennes crucifies the imac redit no to 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.060
 souls and in the tie break 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.010
 fognini proves that on clay 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.830
 can now control the lift from 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.360
 ravva we do not suffer anymore we can stay 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.130
 on his bottom line runs keep the water 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.110
 he's not moving he's taking the ball earlier 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.390
 it prevents nadal from getting organized 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.709
 plant his support to prepare his 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.420
 big strikes and hop and crack too 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.550
 crushed bole slamming 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.720
 why not he can not win anymore 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.450
 the important points 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.230
 he converted three break bats on 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.209
 14 3 break points on 14 to 9 that 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.530
 does not exist at rafa why he 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.080
 can not make any more hits 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.200
 he made half less congas denying 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.400
 that fognini 17 against 34 for pretty much 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.420
 so many direct mistakes 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.660
 ok ok so yes sure you're sure 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.220
 that they miss match death is missing 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.860
 of regularity it lacks confidence 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.380
 but mostly it lacks control over 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.720
 his ball he does not control his ball 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.769
 all because he uses a new 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.320
 racket 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.070
 he has a new racket since his 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.600
 defeat in miami 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.430
 it's been three weeks since he was 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.780
 entered there is neither he wanted this 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.579
 new racket it is he who has it 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.250
 wanted a racket that would bring him 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.560
 more lift more power for the 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.750
 reassure of course all this thanks to 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.730
 spacing a little more important 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.090
 between the strings but automatically he 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.590
 there is less control over the ball then 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.130
 they will have to control it 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.519
 new tool 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.220
 he stays with him four weeks before 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.510
 roland garros to me to domesticate 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.750
 this new amm 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.540
 otherwise but otherwise it will not scare and 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.340
 so where fraudsters there we go to a 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.340
 big disaster but a big disagreement 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.349
 bravo benoît go go take the 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.349
 sun a little bit
