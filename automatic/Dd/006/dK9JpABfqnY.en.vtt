00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
out the basement it was going to be a

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.309 
out the basement it was going to be a
hundred<00:02:34.299> hundred<00:02:34.510> fifty<00:02:34.840> thousand<00:02:35.140> dollar

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
hundred hundred fifty thousand dollar

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.920 
hundred hundred fifty thousand dollar
project<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:35.890> was<00:02:36.069> going<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.220> be<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.670> waste<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.629> a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
project and was going to be a waste of a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.630 
project and was going to be a waste of a
perfectly<00:02:38.110> good<00:02:38.349> house<00:02:38.680> they<00:02:39.069> really<00:02:39.430> didn't

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
perfectly good house they really didn't

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.250 
perfectly good house they really didn't
need<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:39.940> -<00:02:40.209> he<00:02:40.330> just<00:02:40.480> needed<00:02:40.690> more

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
need to do that - he just needed more

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.820 
need to do that - he just needed more
space<00:02:41.500> for<00:02:41.830> additional<00:02:42.870> room<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.170> work<00:02:44.319> in<00:02:44.560> and

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
space for additional room to work in and

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.890 
space for additional room to work in and
and<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:45.250> really<00:02:45.400> kind<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.239> thinking<00:02:46.720> was

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
and so really kind of that thinking was

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.839 
and so really kind of that thinking was
the<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.290> birth<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:47.920> modern<00:02:48.040> shed<00:02:48.340> concept

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
the the birth of the modern shed concept

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.819 
the the birth of the modern shed concept
where<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.150> can<00:02:49.299> just<00:02:49.780> add<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.590> small

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
where you can just add the small

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.289 
where you can just add the small
structure<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.370> backyard<00:02:51.819> they<00:02:52.000> ended<00:02:52.180> up

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
structure in the backyard they ended up

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.220 
structure in the backyard they ended up
spending<00:02:54.239> ten<00:02:55.239> percent<00:02:55.599> of<00:02:55.690> what<00:02:55.840> there<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.110> no

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
spending ten percent of what there is no

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.710 
spending ten percent of what there is no
budget<00:02:56.590> was<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:57.640> really<00:02:57.849> changes<00:02:58.450> how<00:02:58.510> you

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
budget was it really changes how you

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.900 
budget was it really changes how you
work<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.290> live<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.220> think<00:03:00.400> that's<00:03:00.549> what<00:03:00.790> we

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
work and live and I think that's what we

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.089 
work and live and I think that's what we
deal<00:03:01.120> with<00:03:01.329> modern<00:03:01.510> Chevy<00:03:01.870> we<00:03:02.500> change<00:03:02.769> how<00:03:03.040> you

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
deal with modern Chevy we change how you

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.089 
deal with modern Chevy we change how you
live<00:03:03.370> or<00:03:03.519> change<00:03:03.700> how<00:03:03.879> you<00:03:03.940> think<00:03:04.650> about<00:03:05.650> small

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
live or change how you think about small

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.640 
live or change how you think about small
spaces
