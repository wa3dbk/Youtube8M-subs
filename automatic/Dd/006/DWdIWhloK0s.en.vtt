these letters through all four days so

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.100 
these letters through all four days so
let's<00:01:28.640> say<00:01:28.759> we<00:01:28.789> pick<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.149> red<00:01:29.300> one<00:01:29.479> name<00:01:29.960> an

let's say we pick the red one name an
object<00:01:30.410> you<00:01:30.470> can<00:01:30.590> fit<00:01:30.770> into<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.979> pocket

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
object you can fit into a pocket

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.770 
object you can fit into a pocket
starting<00:01:31.789> with<00:01:31.910> one<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.149> these<00:01:32.210> letters<00:01:32.600> at

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
starting with one of these letters at

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.859 
starting with one of these letters at
that<00:01:33.500> point<00:01:33.770> in<00:01:33.890> time<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.820> person<00:01:35.149> who<00:01:35.479> turned

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
that point in time the person who turned

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.300 
that point in time the person who turned
the<00:01:35.929> card<00:01:36.170> over<00:01:36.289> is<00:01:36.530> going<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.800> roll<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.130> dice

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
the card over is going to roll the dice

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.270 
the card over is going to roll the dice
and<00:01:37.610> then<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:38.960> we<00:01:39.200> will<00:01:39.350> look<00:01:39.560> at<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.890> dice<00:01:40.070> at

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
and then so we will look at the dice at

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.070 
and then so we will look at the dice at
our<00:01:40.369> old<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:40.820> someone<00:01:41.539> needs<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:41.810> shout<00:01:42.050> out

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
our old and someone needs a shout out

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.480 
our old and someone needs a shout out
the<00:01:42.289> answer<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:42.679> let's<00:01:42.830> say<00:01:42.979> someone<00:01:43.190> shots

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
the answer so let's say someone shots

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.940 
the answer so let's say someone shots
out<00:01:43.670> penny<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.330> that's<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.350> correct<00:01:45.530> answer

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
out penny and that's the correct answer

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.919 
out penny and that's the correct answer
so<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.729> person<00:01:47.030> who<00:01:47.119> shouted<00:01:47.360> out<00:01:47.570> penny

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
so the person who shouted out penny

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.740 
so the person who shouted out penny
would<00:01:48.770> take<00:01:49.369> this<00:01:49.610> card<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.179> put<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.479> in<00:01:50.570> front

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
would take this card and put it in front

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.090 
would take this card and put it in front
of<00:01:50.869> them<00:01:50.990> they<00:01:51.200> would<00:01:51.320> look<00:01:51.409> at<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.679> card<00:01:51.890> it's

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
of them they would look at the card it's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.730 
of them they would look at the card it's
blue<00:01:52.429> that<00:01:53.210> means<00:01:53.479> on<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.899> next<00:01:54.289> card<00:01:54.530> the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
blue that means on the next card the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.350 
blue that means on the next card the
question<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:55.130> we<00:01:55.220> read<00:01:55.550> is<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:56.030> blue

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
question that we read is the blue

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.930 
question that we read is the blue
question<00:01:56.950> so<00:01:57.950> that's<00:01:58.099> a<00:01:58.190> that's<00:01:58.550> a<00:01:58.729> nice

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
question so that's a that's a nice

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.660 
question so that's a that's a nice
randomizer<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.530> that's<00:02:00.800> basically<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.399> way

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
randomizer so that's basically the way

our<00:04:15.670> room<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:18.549> computer<00:04:18.970> okay<00:04:19.000> fair<00:04:19.510> enough

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
our room the computer okay fair enough

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.430 
our room the computer okay fair enough
so<00:04:21.520> but<00:04:22.120> but<00:04:22.510> when<00:04:22.690> we<00:04:22.810> played<00:04:23.050> this<00:04:23.200> it<00:04:23.350> was

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
so but but when we played this it was

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.620 
so but but when we played this it was
pretty<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:24.100> was<00:04:24.220> very<00:04:24.520> even<00:04:24.940> back<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:25.360> forth

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
pretty it was very even back and forth

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.800 
pretty it was very even back and forth
and<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:27.250> really<00:04:27.760> like<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.060> concept<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.600> using

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
and I really like the concept of using

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.690 
and I really like the concept of using
the<00:04:29.080> back<00:04:29.290> of<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.650> card<00:04:29.890> to<00:04:30.100> determine<00:04:30.550> the

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
the back of the card to determine the

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.370 
the back of the card to determine the
random<00:04:31.060> thing<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.390> does<00:04:31.600> on<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.780> next<00:04:32.170> card

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
random thing it does on the next card

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.770 
random thing it does on the next card
that's<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.650> good<00:04:32.860> concept<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:33.700> allows<00:04:34.480> you<00:04:34.690> to

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
that's a good concept and allows you to

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.830 
that's a good concept and allows you to
play<00:04:34.960> through<00:04:35.170> the<00:04:35.260> cards<00:04:35.560> multiple<00:04:36.010> times

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
play through the cards multiple times

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.210 
play through the cards multiple times
