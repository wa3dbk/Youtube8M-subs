00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 the developers of hotline amy two 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.839
 Call for piracy of their own 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.639
 play on we give the answer to it 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.830
 who between the wars console 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.290
 playstation and xbox in the past year 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.139
 won and say how the start of 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.619
 h 1 z 1 ran hauser internet i am 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:26.880
 michael obermeier and that are today 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:29.340
 news today we deal with ourselves 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.869
 miami again with the event hotline two 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.520
 Since we had reported yesterday that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.320
 Game in Australia not sold 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.239
 may be because it is one in it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.430
 controversial rape scene there 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.020
 a worried australian player has 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.910
 so now the developers by e-mail 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 written and asked here but how 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.170
 should I get a play ran there now 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.329
 But the developer's answer is very 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.800
 Surprising because it was said that if that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.949
 do not actually play in australia 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.320
 can be sold then pirated 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.329
 simply does not need us any money 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.219
 give the publisher the vulva title it 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.590
 also not very amused about this 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.160
 All Australian review report for 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.140
 game 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.450
 this is the name of this test report 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.400
 would stretch the truth very far and 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.430
 Any details about it will invent that 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.630
 so in the game are not inside and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.090
 then the last but not least a 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.250
 Late filing of us yesterday are 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.020
 we falsely claim that 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.240
 if the game in Germany no 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.670
 usk release would get that then not 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.650
 it may be sold that fact 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.780
 wrong if sony but the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.759
 playstation 3 playstation 4 and ps vita 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.729
 version does not sell usk release 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.079
 would get sony then refrain from that 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.610
 to sell the game at all 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.610
 you should be it 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.500
 2014 may be already 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.030
 has noticed past and with it we can 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.950
 now finally the question clarify who 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.110
 in the old year the consoles war 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.660
 won between playstation and xbox 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.240
 at least at the sales figures 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.520
 the answer is sony with the playstation 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.220
 4 not only in the us but 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.160
 worldwide since the launch of the console 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.259
 Sony now has 18 5 million pcs 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.170
 sold his christmas business goods 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.239
 There are 4.1 million consoles as well 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.910
 microsoft picks up on that at least 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.070
 in the usa in november and december the 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.300
 Most consoles sell the answer 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.170
 why that was so it was relatively easy 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.020
 Microsoft has reduced the price of 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.790
 399 to 349 euros because that's so good 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.550
 has microsoft also works 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.280
 at least announced this reduction 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.060
 in the usa from now on also so 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.060
 maintain 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.190
 It was supposed to start yesterday evening yesterday 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.579
 It only started late at night 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.100
 the early access start of h 1 z 1 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.019
 at least then were just before twelve the 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.480
 server online because so many players 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.760
 wanted to log in at the same time is there 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.480
 the same thing happens as mister burns 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.480
 to the doctor 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.070
 meanwhile you can be reasonably 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.650
 normal deposits but there are already 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.530
 the first trouble because of the first big one 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.630
 edwyn crazy in the forum reddot 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.510
 Many players write that the 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.890
 So drops are paid air shipments 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.250
 which can be sent in the game 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.440
 can 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.170
 unlike sony has not just claimed 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.420
 cosmetic items but weapons 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.430
 and send ammunition and that is 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.200
 Of course, very unfair if you are with 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.630
 money weapons and ammunition sometime the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.180
 pampa can deliver 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.340
 h1n1 should be sony's answer to daisy 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.320
 be the game when it's done 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.359
 Free to play will be the early access 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.359
 phase currently costs money 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.950
 that was it for this week with the news 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.200
 many thanks that has watched her when 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.790
 you like that then gives a thumb 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.500
 up and tell your friends we 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.660
 See you again next week 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.410
 nice weekend and Monday to continue 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.410
 play
