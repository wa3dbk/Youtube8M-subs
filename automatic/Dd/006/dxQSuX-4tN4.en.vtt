00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
you're seeing here is a quad view so

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.370 
you're seeing here is a quad view so
this<00:03:58.150> is<00:03:58.239> four<00:03:58.450> different<00:03:58.569> end<00:03:58.840> coders<00:03:59.140> in<00:03:59.260> our

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
this is four different end coders in our

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.870 
this is four different end coders in our
booth<00:03:59.500> right<00:03:59.709> now<00:03:59.890> showing<00:04:00.340> different<00:04:00.670> feeds

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
booth right now showing different feeds

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.210 
booth right now showing different feeds
the<00:04:01.450> latency<00:04:01.840> is<00:04:01.870> about<00:04:02.080> four<00:04:02.290> frames<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:02.890> you

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
the latency is about four frames and you

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
I had already said we've built in 3d

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.400 
I had already said we've built in 3d
look-up<00:04:10.269> tables<00:04:10.299> that<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:10.810> can<00:04:10.959> apply<00:04:11.170> in

lookup table and then on top of it all

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.920 
lookup table and then on top of it all
you<00:04:15.160> can<00:04:15.190> also<00:04:15.430> record<00:04:15.880> all<00:04:16.209> these<00:04:16.570> feeds<00:04:16.810> at

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
you can also record all these feeds at

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.110 
you can also record all these feeds at
