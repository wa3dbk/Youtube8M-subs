00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.520
 how about youtube friends very good 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.400
 afternoons on this occasion we will see how 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.250
 connect a 4- channel amplifier to 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.589
 2 or more so to connect it to 211 then to 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.900
 two men we can in most of the 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.880
 cases take full advantage of the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.220
 amplifier all its power which is what 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.140
 what are we going to look for in this good video 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.080
 for this video I base myself on a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.970
 amplifier makes 1600 of the planet audio 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.050
 that your specifications 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.960
 they tell us they give us 300 watts to 4 or more 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.940
 and 600 watts to 2 or more as you can see 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.219
 I have half of the screen covered 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.190
 to give this explanation first and not 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.499
 rummage us and already later I'll 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.579
 uncover to explain it in what of the 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:50.039
 connection to 2 or more good here we have the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.920
 connection of an amplifier as already 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.469
 I told them to 4 or more that it's like 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.179
 normally we connect it all is not a 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.780
 amplifier that you have as you can see 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:03.059
 four channels 1 2 3 and 4 and we're going to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.000
 connect what would be two 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.200
 pairs of being of means this would be a couple 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.740
 of c of means that I know 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 in the front so to speak frontal 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.570
 and back these are the two pairs that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.429
 how do we connect it normally good 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.399
 we connect what would be the 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:23.070
 medium and the tweeter to the crossover and the 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.590
 crossover we go up to the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.649
 forgiveness amplifier as you can see then 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.759
 good are two pairs of seven media and 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.819
 each side it goes to its channel 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.679
 channel 1 channel 2 channel 3 good like this 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.409
 amplifier in this type of connection 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.270
 is connected to 4 or more 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.840
 specifications tell us that four 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.810
 outs will give us 300 watts this is 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:54.119
 that channel 1 will give us 75 to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.520
 channel 2 75 to channel 3 75 and channel 4 75 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.590
 what we are going to look for is how 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.630
 can get the 600 watts 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.579
 and good friends of youtube because here is 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.549
 the way in which we will be able to 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.429
 get the 600 watts as doing one 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.800
 connection to 2 or more normally like that 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.470
 we had explained we put everything 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.660
 set by channel now what we're going to do 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.900
 is to connect it in the following way 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.959
 let's connect crossover and tweeter 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.170
 cross of tweeter crossover and twiter and what 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.150
 What are we going to do? 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.390
 crossover a twitter a crossover and a 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.700
 tweeter to channel 1 let's repeat the 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.690
 process and put crossover tweeter 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.970
 crossover and twiter to channel 2 and on 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.900
 channel 3 and 4 we are going to connect what 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.299
 would be two means to channel 3 and 2 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.519
 means to channel 4 this the one that 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.379
 so it will benefit so let's go down 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.230
 the influence of our amplifier and 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.450
 we are going to work for 4 or more what we 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.140
 will make it to 2 or more sorry what it will do 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.660
 give us 150 watts per channel we 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.010
 will deliver 150 watts here of 150 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.830
 watts here to 150 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.140
 here 150 watts here one of the advantages 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.299
 to do this is that we will be able to do 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.819
 the settings of our amplifier what 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.909
 that would be the twitters we are going to 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.549
 can work on channel 1 and 2 as 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.650
 frontal as it were and on the channel 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.690
 3 and 4 we will be able to work the general 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.549
 without the frequencies only of the means 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.530
 a detail here is that the amplifier 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.769
 we have to have the configuration of 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.019
 hp efe that come doing step of 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.780
 high frequencies for what I 've been 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.760
 for twitter and for media friends and as 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.940
 you can see it is very simple 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.069
 only changes the way of doing 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.290
 connections what is usually done is 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.590
 this and what we should do here 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.959
 then to make media or horns that 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.690
 require more power we could 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.879
 make this configuration as you can see 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.190
 it's nothing special is very 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.440
 simple if they did not understand me why are we going 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.079
 about it again we are going to connect 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.540
 all the tweeters only to the 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.190
 crossover and the media we will leave 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.130
 apart and we will connect 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.890
 2 crossover with its respective tweeter at 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.170
 channel 1 other 2 crossover with your twitter 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.180
 to channel 2 as you can see everything comes 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.060
 separated with positive and negative 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.210
 positive and negative other data that is 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.180
 important that we have to have in 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.160
 account 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.289
 how about friends and how did another 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.570
 data that is important that we have in 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:34.139
 account is that not all 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.870
 4 channel amplifiers are stable 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.539
 2 or more of them are, but there are 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.610
 exceptions as in every rule and also 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.910
 remember that almost all sets of 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.490
 means come in what would come 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.669
 who work at 4 or more a set of media and 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.860
 armed work 4 and that's all for the 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.870
 moment friends of youtube you know if the 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.729
 video you liked please leave your little hand 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.139
 up to support the channel not you 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.479
 forget to leave your comments and 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.970
 questions here below that I gladly 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.590
 I will respond and do not forget to visit the 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.199
 facebook page where you will find 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.840
 all content related to the world 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:14.330
 of the audio car and that's all for the 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.330
 moment and see you until next time
