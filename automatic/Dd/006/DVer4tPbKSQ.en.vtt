00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.380 
recommend these guys because the granite
guardians<00:06:02.040> more<00:06:02.220> than<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.580> Sasquatch

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
guardians more than the Sasquatch

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.480 
guardians more than the Sasquatch
runners<00:06:04.220> because<00:06:05.220> um<00:06:06.350> these<00:06:07.350> have<00:06:07.560> a<00:06:07.620> more

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
runners because um these have a more

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.110 
runners because um these have a more
defense<00:06:08.940> and<00:06:09.330> um<00:06:10.490> they're<00:06:11.490> just<00:06:11.700> all<00:06:11.880> around

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
defense and um they're just all around

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.780 
defense and um they're just all around
better<00:06:12.570> i<00:06:12.750> think<00:06:12.900> those<00:06:13.740> even<00:06:14.640> though<00:06:14.730> they

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
better i think those even though they

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.570 
better i think those even though they
have<00:06:14.880> less<00:06:15.180> move<00:06:15.480> they<00:06:15.840> can<00:06:16.080> there<00:06:16.950> there<00:06:17.220> more

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
have less move they can there there more

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.790 
have less move they can there there more
of<00:06:17.610> an<00:06:17.790> attacking<00:06:18.270> thing<00:06:19.050> and<00:06:19.320> they<00:06:19.410> can<00:06:19.620> back

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
of an attacking thing and they can back

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.250 
of an attacking thing and they can back
it<00:06:19.980> up<00:06:20.070> with<00:06:20.250> the<00:06:20.430> fence<00:06:20.870> that's<00:06:21.870> what<00:06:22.110> i<00:06:22.140> think

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
it up with the fence that's what i think

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.770 
it up with the fence that's what i think
about<00:06:22.530> these<00:06:22.770> guys<00:06:23.010> and<00:06:23.280> for<00:06:23.760> these<00:06:23.940> for<00:06:24.720> the

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
about these guys and for these for the

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.350 
about these guys and for these for the
Sasquatch<00:06:25.290> i<00:06:25.650> think<00:06:26.610> that<00:06:26.970> it's<00:06:27.330> more<00:06:27.600> of<00:06:27.780> a

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
Sasquatch i think that it's more of a

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.890 
Sasquatch i think that it's more of a
supporting<00:06:30.360> role<00:06:30.650> kinda<00:06:31.650> better

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
supporting role kinda better

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.810 
supporting role kinda better
it<00:06:33.900> may<00:06:34.230> tackle<00:06:34.650> to<00:06:35.160> light<00:06:37.340> it<00:06:38.340> can<00:06:38.520> attack

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
it may tackle to light it can attack

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.630 
it may tackle to light it can attack
multiple<00:06:39.150> times<00:06:39.690> and<00:06:40.020> it<00:06:40.890> can<00:06:41.130> it<00:06:41.460> has<00:06:41.610> a

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
multiple times and it can it has a

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.420 
multiple times and it can it has a
higher<00:06:41.940> move<00:06:42.270> rate<00:06:42.570> and<00:06:42.810> it<00:06:43.020> can<00:06:43.230> bite<00:06:44.040> by

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
higher move rate and it can bite by

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.280 
higher move rate and it can bite by
their<00:06:44.580> ability<00:06:44.640> jungle<00:06:45.450> tracking<00:06:45.900> they<00:06:46.080> can
