00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.040
 speak now under marking a type of 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.639
 that the Japanese have a lot of 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.400
 difficulty about this 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.730
 Okay, so we 're not going to talk because the bigger 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.130
 Japanese problem the background ball 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.830
 especially terror is when the ball 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.519
 enters the bottom it comes to help the 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.560
 The student marking and turns his back is not 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.810
 to turn around because normally 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.060
 He comes to take this ball on his back. 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.060
 the guy comes in here and get it happens 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.140
 the biggest difficulty is this normally 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.810
 or by two flowerbeds or when this 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.940
 ball stuck from the bottom the player will turn 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.120
 back to the mark 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.100
 he looks at the ball and turns away from the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.290
 marking it has to be attentive to 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.480
 every day he has Tony the ball and 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.320
 especially its marker that can 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.320
 carry ball on back 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:09.020
 Hey, look, the ball is going to get into the bottom. 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.450
 usually the Japanese player does this 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.400
 Here O Coast gene 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.750
 I'll get to the vote and videos of 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.670
 wrong cut because she 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.080
 this is something you learn from 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.780
 base 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.450
 so the Japanese is not guilty of the south 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.430
 because he did not have that basis then 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.430
 usually he has this error in the game 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.090
 Okay, okay, I got the vote. 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:50.400
 I arrived because I do not need to go there soon. 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.840
 Imagine that I 'm not losing the 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.500
 game already has a face marking it there he 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.210
 is receiving the ball from his back 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.770
 so I have to go back worried about 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.399
 my bookmark 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.250
 I have my eye on the ball to lend. 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.899
 Be careful in the pass and keep an eye on my 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.899
 computer that was to get along with him
