 and that's why I also want to finish with target values 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 Recruits who are being recruited today appeal 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.040
 if they provide their basic military service for the next weeks and months 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.850
 Never forget what they are doing for their homeland 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.860
 Republic of Austria 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.210
 a country 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.360

 traditionally if I am today 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.530
 most notably 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.200
 those young men and women 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.350
 in a few minutes here 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.220

 Presence service does not always become the same 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.519
 he can be exhausting 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.539
 he can 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.929
 count from now on 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.139

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.829
 important 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.219
 something that affects all people in Austria 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.700
 in protecting and distributing this land 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:04.169
 All the best it is through the Bundeswehr 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.009

 three years to master the place name 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.430
