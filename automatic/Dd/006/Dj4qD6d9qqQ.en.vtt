journeys<00:04:23.270> before<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:23.960> they<00:04:24.110> know<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.620> when

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
journeys before and they know that when

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.280 
journeys before and they know that when
you<00:04:24.920> do<00:04:25.130> too<00:04:25.400> much<00:04:25.670> too<00:04:25.970> fast<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:27.080> can

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
you do too much too fast you can

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.620 
you do too much too fast you can
definitely<00:04:27.530> burn<00:04:28.070> yourself<00:04:28.520> out<00:04:28.700> so<00:04:29.330> as<00:04:29.450> long

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
definitely burn yourself out so as long

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.540 
definitely burn yourself out so as long
as<00:04:29.840> you<00:04:30.050> know<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:30.620> you're<00:04:30.830> doing<00:04:31.040> it<00:04:31.310> at<00:04:31.520> a

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
as you know that you're doing it at a

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.910 
as you know that you're doing it at a
pace<00:04:31.940> that<00:04:31.970> you<00:04:32.450> know<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.690> can<00:04:32.960> maintain<00:04:33.200> and

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
pace that you know you can maintain and

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.020 
pace that you know you can maintain and
keep<00:04:34.130> up<00:04:34.400> I<00:04:34.700> say<00:04:35.240> keep<00:04:35.510> doing<00:04:35.870> you<00:04:36.790> but<00:04:37.790> if<00:04:37.880> you

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
keep up I say keep doing you but if you

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.570 
keep up I say keep doing you but if you
feel<00:04:38.300> like<00:04:38.480> you<00:04:38.660> maybe<00:04:39.500> can't<00:04:40.010> keep<00:04:40.250> it<00:04:40.460> up

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
feel like you maybe can't keep it up

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.730 
feel like you maybe can't keep it up
then<00:04:40.910> maybe<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.300> want<00:04:41.450> to<00:04:41.570> slow<00:04:41.870> it<00:04:42.050> down<00:04:42.080> or

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
then maybe you want to slow it down or

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.060 
then maybe you want to slow it down or
you<00:04:43.430> know<00:04:43.610> do<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.120> at<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.300> slower<00:04:44.780> pace<00:04:45.070> but

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
you know do it at a slower pace but

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.570 
you know do it at a slower pace but
everyone's<00:04:46.700> pace<00:04:47.150> is<00:04:47.450> different

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
everyone's pace is different

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.070 
everyone's pace is different
unfortunately<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.760> took<00:04:49.970> me<00:04:50.300> to<00:04:50.570> go<00:04:50.750> from

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
unfortunately it took me to go from

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.220 
unfortunately it took me to go from
walking<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:52.210> jumping<00:04:53.210> around<00:04:53.360> but<00:04:53.900> some

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
walking to jumping around but some

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.540 
walking to jumping around but some
people<00:04:54.560> can<00:04:54.680> go<00:04:54.800> straight<00:04:55.070> into<00:04:55.580> it<00:04:55.790> and<00:04:56.090> also

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
people can go straight into it and also

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.940 
people can go straight into it and also
people<00:04:58.550> don't<00:04:58.850> understand<00:04:59.600> that<00:04:59.960> if<00:05:00.380> you've

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
really think about it it is common sense

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.380 
really think about it it is common sense
but<00:05:42.080> sometimes<00:05:42.680> people<00:05:45.880> lack<00:05:46.880> of<00:05:47.120> faith<00:05:47.360> in

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390
