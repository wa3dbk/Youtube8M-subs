00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.670
 as we all know, September and then 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.049
 is the month of return to school 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.639
 so what better opportunity for 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.380
 decorate our old notebooks 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.120
 used to transform them into new ones 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.130
 material we needed gods 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:26.449
 colored cards of any color 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:26.449
 and thick a ball of wool and a needle 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:36.649
 of the scissors and of course the notebooks 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.649
 any 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.399
 first we take the form of the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.440
 our notebook with the card because 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.269
 we will need it to cover it then 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.170
 whatever is drawn on the 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.610
 front 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.920
 it will be covered so it will be with a new one 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.019
 notebook glue it with glue 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.820
 vinavil or with simple glue stick 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:05.820
 do you think now take a piece 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.369
 music or the stuff you want e 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.830
 stick with the life of us have 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.440
 chosen we chose this piece but 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.899
 you can decide which of any 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:21.960
 I also sell each piece of fabric 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:25.470
 ok then if you want to add some gods 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.720
 Draw more ruler and with a chalk 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 with a marker in this case maybe 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.000
 with a gap but also recommended a per 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.630
 a felt-tip pen and color the part 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.530
 higher 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.789
 maybe the same color as the pacifica 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.409
 or for a decoration it is wrong 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.940
 finalizes with a coupon a piece of 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.239
 fabric pasting it in the part 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:53.310
 lower than the upper part of the block 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:55.319
 then seeing that it will still be a 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.649
 our notebook dedicated to memories 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.720
 take a picture of you from a ticket 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.280
 a museum concert and attached 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.280
 in the central part with scotch tape 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.190
 then priest other pieces of cloth or 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.760
 small decorations instead your group 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.849
 and put it on or under yours 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.250
 ticket a shell like this 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.220
 case for the shell we recommend the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.690
 glue from vinavil glue if not there is not 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.400
 or if you want to use scotch e 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.300
 stick with the two flaps then take 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.629
 of the sedans tico or if they are not 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.580
 constipated stick it with ships and put them 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.769
 in the part of the fabric in the part 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.629
 superior since this year that you of 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.019
 remember everyone and put what you do 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.760
 you want your photos with your friends 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.650
 tickets you want so that's fine 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.380
 all to accomplish this instead 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.990
 notebook this other decoration takes 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.440
 sila 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.840
 badly tie them up and with a bag 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.910
 tie them in the upper part o 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.670
 make a braid a third 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.420
 traditional of what you can 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.350
 you choose them calmly finished 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.750
 taken I recommend cut it and then 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.610
 paste and then paste it, stop it with 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:26.040
 of scotch with vinavil glue 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:28.390
 both are both okay you do 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.260
 been this project both for the part 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.630
 higher than the one below this 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.550
 point your notebook can stay 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.620
 so or every team waits in 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.040
 our case our gemina will become 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.930
 a diary but you can write us what 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.640
 you want as your name or subject 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.100
 why do you want to make the notebook e 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.500
 finally decorated places to apply 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.620
 braids for the entire notebook the choice 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.620
 it's yours 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.020
 3 this year decorations instead 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.480
 we choose a dark-colored notebook e 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.580
 on this advisable as safe 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.310
 let us approach any design 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.960
 risks very simple therefore used 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.940
 our case not yet stylized 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.799
 do it with the ruler so it will be 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.799
 however in metric 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:37.119
 alassino take lake and in some 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.519
 valid in some parts of the drawing 

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:42.069
 holes on the other side in some towers 

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:45.189
 of Islam ii holes on the other side 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.989
 this will serve because then we will have to do 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:49.089
 pass lake and wool then 

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:52.689
 don't worry if you don't see it later 

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:54.789
 Reached and then this point we take the lake 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:56.799
 with the wool and we go for 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.709
 various little holes that will still be gods 

00:04:56.799 --> 00:05:01.599
 of the passages precisely and will not be seen 

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:05.049
 then became quiet and fine 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.339
 let the whole wool pass in front and 

00:05:05.049 --> 00:05:09.419
 back until design will be 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:12.279
 completed then beat miss and get yourself 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:15.789
 follow precisely from the various forums in which 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:17.889
 sign is not complete and they fall off 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:22.869
 wrong don't worry 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:28.539
 just remove the finished priest's wool one 

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:30.759
 finished scissors 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:34.329
 take a pair of scissors and cut e 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:36.639
 cut the final burgundy this point 

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:44.319
 glue it with scotch no with 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:46.809
 of the glue veenhoven this process 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.729
 both at the top in that 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:51.659
 lower where where I am applied 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.659
 previous grandfather 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:07.970
 and here is our notebook I hope i 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.210
 you enjoyed our tutorials 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.950
 obviously do as you like and see you 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.640
 to the next video that will be a video of 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.120
 kitchen 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.120
