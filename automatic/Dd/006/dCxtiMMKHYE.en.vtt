a lone wolf could do some damage tell a

a lone wolf could do some damage tell a

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
lot of people but not a nuclear

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.420 
lot of people but not a nuclear
radiological<00:02:04.439> or<00:02:04.500> anything<00:02:04.829> like<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.979> look

as<00:02:06.360> president<00:02:06.810> united<00:02:06.899> states<00:02:07.170> i<00:02:07.290> worry<00:02:07.500> about

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
as president united states i worry about

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.699 
as president united states i worry about
all<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:08.910> i<00:02:09.149> think<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.289> most

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
all of it but i think that the most

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.160 
all of it but i think that the most
likely<00:02:11.209> scenario<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.629> we<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.020> guard

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
likely scenario that we have to guard

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.530 
likely scenario that we have to guard
against<00:02:13.530> right<00:02:13.709> now<00:02:13.920> ends<00:02:14.879> up<00:02:15.000> being<00:02:15.209> more<00:02:15.420> of

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
against right now ends up being more of

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.740 
against right now ends up being more of
a<00:02:15.629> lone<00:02:15.810> wolf<00:02:16.050> operation<00:02:16.709> than<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.160> large<00:02:17.750> well

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
a lone wolf operation than a large well

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.750 
a lone wolf operation than a large well
coordinated<00:02:19.319> terrorist<00:02:19.709> attack<00:02:20.099> we<00:02:20.520> still

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
coordinated terrorist attack we still

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.490 
coordinated terrorist attack we still
have<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.000> stay<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.209> top<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.750> though<00:02:21.930> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
have to stay on top of it though and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.229 
have to stay on top of it though and
we're<00:02:23.400> never<00:02:23.550> letting<00:02:23.879> our<00:02:24.000> guard<00:02:24.209> down
