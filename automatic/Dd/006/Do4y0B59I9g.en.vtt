00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.230
 drake and josh merry christmas I said all 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.609
 It took 1 year to reach Latin America 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.339
 since the water premiered in December 2008 and in Latin America in 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.039
 December 2009 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.169
 there may be many reasons he did not give them time to do the voice-over the voices 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.579
 he accepted they were not on vacation they wanted it to be released at Christmas 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.660
 etcétera in mexico 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.239

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.320
 channel 5 mexico and in Matamoros premiered in valley visions AP-7 at 10 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.140
 0 0 pm 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.060
 the transparent laptop that has children is the same as you can 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.060
 appreciate at the beginning of the movie icarly goes to japan 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.660
 just like the movie drake and josh 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.530
 vallejo book 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.870
 It was taken with different angles 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.080
 which are not very frequent in the series 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 the crazy is difficult to go to the Christmas parade in a delorean 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.579
 the car that became famous for returning to the future 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.299
 also when it goes away the patent of the car falls down and this one turns before 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:14.689
 fall completely 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.130
 like in going back to the future when the protocol dawned for the first time the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.710
 time Machine 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.220
 when I tried children they are going to ask for help the crazy one is this for his machine 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.430
 this later begins to sing there in the fountain there was a trickle 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.840
 the only song that calms him 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.430
 there's a scene where he's fucking the television and switching channels between 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.100
 the channels that happened could be observed the following a channel where clearly 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.869
 they were going through the last episode of zoé and 101 chasing azorín part 2 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.560
 and other channels where the cartoons that saw lola and kim from the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.649
 same tower series 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.239
 also in a channel you see the Danish face its leader the creator of this 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:53.950
 series and a scene of icarly in japan 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.479
 also throughout the movie you can notice that they changed some 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.460
 electrical appliances in the house of the parker nichols 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.590
 like a plasma screen in the room that ironically was destroyed after 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.570
 a transparent computer similar to baseball in the treatment room 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.009
 children 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.629
 and a transparent lap top 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.239
 among other things 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.560
 the crazy one you want pity put imitation of the i-phone of epo and 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.889
 transparent 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:20.809
 in relation the film was not one of the biggest of the series cause that 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.089
 the angles of the shots and many new areas 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:27.889
 in the movie the premiere cinema is on a mobile but in the series it is an end 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:29.179
 is only 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.869
 in a part of the movie when they talk to him in he says he was going to 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:37.199
 celebrate your divorce to what there will be that responds but that if you got married makes 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.680
 little bit 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.680
 hence the in devizes the weeks and they are explained that in ccoo 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:44.969
 not the thing is that they have to see is that jose has short hair at the moment 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.599
 of the wedding of the movie a giant shrimp and at the time of the 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.059
 talk has much longer hair like many more actors being that 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:56.849
 it had been five weeks that it had actually happened 1 year for the 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.599
 filming time 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.409
 and now with icarly 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.949
 before let me say that there are not many but it is so interesting 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:08.619
 first in the chapter that is to think comes a letter that has not returned a 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:11.819
 dvd back there will be a sign that says police helicopter 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.769
 a movie that comes out comes in parrots 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.290
 in the introduction to on a page called tour a trial and in Spanish it's 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.579
 Cali played and that's from a series called Tower 101 and the last one will be there soon 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.069
 a chapter called I sympathize with level and it will be a parody of twilight 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.579
 thank you for doing things back to god friends
