00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.439
 hello how welcome are you to this 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.240
 tiny tutorial and I'll show you a 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.370
 little trick to hang some 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.340
 partition your hard drive and thus move your 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.750
 The content of the sight of curious is very 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.640
 simple and works for any 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.759
 windows version right now I 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.320
 working on windows 7 64 bits though 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.820
 only works for windows if you achieve 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.039
 flip with some other operating system 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.140
 the hidden partition can be fixed 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.419
 along with its content for now you 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.249
 I can advise you to protect the start 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.470
 of session or even the boot itself with 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.270
 password if several people use 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.830
 the same computer I recommend ongs 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.570
 an administrator account with all 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.980
 the privileges and a user account 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.520
 providing the most permissions 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.160
 essential so you can work well 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.550
 let's start very well what you are going to do 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.010
 now it's very easy to type 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.800
 windows window after 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.270
 write disk mgmt 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.130
 msc 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.330
 I open a window when you can 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.230
 handle all disk partitions 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.590
 hard they do not look so friendly you can see the 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:14.050
 contribution of system recovery 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:17.620
 our partition has been assigned and a 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.420
 backing with the letter and if you click 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.760
 right gives you less options 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.150
 you can extend or reduce the volume 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.910
 but it has nowhere to hide but ok 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.800
 now let's ask for equipment to allow 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.840
 in the fraction d 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.370
 backed up very well in some folders 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.950
 these folders 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.810
 I do not want that I'm not going to pretend not to 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.990
 I want to have in the city that is 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.860
 away from curious and for that we are going to 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.560
 activate the windows sale key 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.149
 as if reading 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.840
 and we're going to run the cmd program that 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:01.040
 is the system that once in the trump 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.880
 let's type uncork 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.880
 all followed 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.780
 and this is going to open us 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.030
 but to handle the volumes of the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.110
 system let's type the list command 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.800
 valium 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:22.210
 so how can you see me now let's 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:26.020
 create select and the volumes project 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.030
 let's choose the number 3 that is where 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.760
 is our support and when 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.710
 meets the letter r 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.210
 selection yum 3 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:43.510
 says volume 3 to be assigned ok for 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.510
 disassemble it very easy only you believe 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:53.320
 space read the letter and space and the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:57.650
 letter that contains volume 3 now what 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.349
 which indicates the program that says state 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.939
 of assembly from the point point of the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.290
 assembly time 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:07.549
 we go to the team and we can see that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.810
 is our partition has been hidden 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.420
 as the recovery partition that 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.910
 have in our factory system and 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.739
 will you wonder if the files will follow 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.220
 it is clear that yes and it is very easy to bring them 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:24.170
 back with the same shot we're going to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.170
 create again crispa lyon 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.160
 through volumes and now it seems that 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.830
 has something different to volume 3 is 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.680
 there clear and has an asterisk and simple 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.380
 that has no letter assigned now for 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.360
 put it back we select the 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.030
 volume 3 the space and we return space 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.630
 3 which is where the label of the 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.710
 backing and typing saint claire 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.710
 space he 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.310
 and in 3 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.010
 well now how can you see the lyrics and 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.220
 has been assigned the disk is mounted and 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.500
 in fact if we had done 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.209
 omitted the letter 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.920
 I liked platinum would have recycled by 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.989
 what to give through do not worry and 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.040
 as you can see we are team and 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:16.410
 our and all our steam folders 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.810
 were there good that's all 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.850
 only class to go out and I hope they 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.740
 have served this little trick we continue 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.740
 in contact guys girls bye
