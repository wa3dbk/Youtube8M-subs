00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:11.760
 m 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:13.589
 I do not have much before if I know that 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.610
 one like being sent alone and now 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:20.310
 we are two for many things 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.720
 then nothing tries a little to overtake 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.670
 I imagine imagining that children have 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.140
 your own personality your own world 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.940
 your own desire your own things 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.030
 then it is that see if that everyone 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.669
 mine and hers with great but in 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.040
 principle I will continue to work less 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.269
 not as much as up to now but to follow 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.719
 working since she is very 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.579
 little girl and I'll think I'll opt 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.409
 for the light situation in terms of 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.019
 health u and everything that what one wants is 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.240
 be pretty kangaroo mom like I have 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.370
 budgeted 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.790
 I'm going to start with a new program that 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.010
 is one hour a day a little less and 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.160
 my idea is to go with them as digital 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.550
 in my dressing room his crib his things see 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.990
 like I feel that also one 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.670
 can change so much that next carlos 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.290
 a lot of life but neither afterwards 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 will have hers but for as long as I go 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.470
 to try to adapt life a bit to the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.790
 from her but I also need that is a 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.800
 little mine so there's a fact that 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.470
 ok kangaroo mommy those as my idea if 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.680
 they carry it everywhere 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.430
 my mom with me was very chic to me 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.880
 difference of all 18 then it was 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.450
 a super mom 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.740
 She is very affectionate but she was currently 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.060
 barto in the house so study 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.860
 when it was bigger, unlike 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.409
 then mine that she did is a world 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.509
 as a post job with a bus finally 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.640
 I always have the opposite 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.729
 super-structured working world before 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.710
 of being a mom then but if we see a 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.470
 day more was always good also that 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.700
 angle for all parties like and a 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.319
 little that I like because I 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 it has to be consistent with what one 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.679
 it's silent I understand that the children 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.170
 they need and require a whole system of 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.399
 feeding and bathing and sleeping too 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.950
 you have to be as consistent with the 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.890
 family that one has and me and ansÃ³n to me 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.420
 I did not stay like that and there was a lot 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.759
 thing average describe me digital beds 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.310
 to civilize a lot of change 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.010
 home and it does not really fit and I know that 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.200
 they slept everywhere and like that and because 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.510
 maybe I like traveling so much and I 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.069
 I clean myself anywhere and I 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.230
 I would love for my daughter to have 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.360
 that it was like you will not need 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.040
 have only your safety in your house but 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.350
 that any part of the world can be 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.260
 a super-livable place and that 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.840
 I would love how to transmit it 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.080
 to see, I think that 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.200
 I do not have it so established nor so 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.060
 thought of as what the world can be 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.300
 really when to the extent that one 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.160
 grows the world is changing and the worlds 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.069
 over all countries in the process of 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.450
 development like ours 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.790
 there are certain fears that I have as of 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.890
 things about having a daughter especially as 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.420
 enter here between adolescence and how 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.810
 handle the theme of the reel but also 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.090
 if one says if she touches what I 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.920
 Even pass does not happen suddenly your taste 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.920
 suddenly in places that are more 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.950
 the copete the drugs as one wants 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.660
 that is not the case, it's fears that I kind of like 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.300
 missing and with a while many years but 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.770
 same I do not go as how to internalize and 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.770
 at the world level I feel that 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.250
 that one is not going to change the world and 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.410
 I do not expect the world to be more 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.480
 perfect of what it is but that she enjoy 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.660
 and be very happy with the world that 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.700
 I have then do not think you have to 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.560
 touch a world without poverty find the 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.270
 that everyone much hairier with 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.160
 water wars yoga boy more 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.130
 big with an energetic problem but 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.780
 so I think that despite all that 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.060
 you have an equal can be happy then 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.530
 and especially if I would not have children by 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.080
 at least if the world were natural this 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.750
 fatalistic vision of the world that is coming 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.520
 you will follow your foot to my judgment will start 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.100
 be a mom and I am in the world of a place 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.640
 beautiful and super livable and I love 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.740
 and that's what I think is happy 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.680
 that has the least possible means that 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.230
 now the least possible risks and nothing 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.850
 you have to enjoy that you enjoy what you know 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.890
 that one is going to be as good as 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.830
 well I think the role of dads 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.810
 as a fundamental thing I think that 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.580
 there is a mix between first feeling 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.260
 that the children sit Antonio 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.980
 deeply loved I think that already 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.140
 it makes you a mattress of how to love 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.300
 with self-esteem with the security that 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.880
 is what I have seen in my friends with 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.590
 children with my friends with their dads is 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.570
 super important I feel it is vital 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.300
 that a son feels deeply 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.450
 critical is like the basics and after 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.220
 I think that's what I think it 's dad 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.170
 to be super difficult in terms of 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.000
 everything when you are bigger than not 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.290
 consent so much and I feel that the 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.850
 tolerance frustration is a 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.920
 very important issue for the world in 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.110
 that we live, I feel that we have to be 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.400
 you have to learn to go wrong 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.470
 you have to learn that things cost 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.270
 that you have to learn that life is not 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.460
 so easy and without that being a drama 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.750
 deep but even every time you go 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.840
 wrong time and you have to get back up 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.080
 in this sense I think it's good for 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.080
 a side 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.180
 educate in that sense that I imagine that 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.980
 it must be difficult and the other also the 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.170
 issue that has to go with the same 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.060
 as knowing how to set limits and so that 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.380
 one has tolerance for frustration and 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.500
 all because you know that life is 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.480
 these things that one can not access and 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.590
 I would love to be able to teach without 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.070
 the other but above all it happens to me that 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.360
 I find that what that thing of 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.450
 feel loved my thing goes like the 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:45.460
 love as well as trying to make ends meet 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.460
 what one is what one can 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.500
 very happy and I'm happy 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.110
 I'm very happy the same is a period 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.400
 super weird super nice finally 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.290
 like that the word is not like 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.970
 I will be more in the happiest woman in the 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.770
 world because I believe that happiness sells 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.180
 many things besides the children can 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.949
 sound a little hard but I also feel 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.300
 that happiness hangs on these things I 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.210
 I am happy for many things and 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.610
 now that happiness comes as a 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:16.590
 increase to know a new one 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:21.009
 new dimension with this motherhood 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:22.630
 I was very happy and now I am happier and 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.889
 I hope to continue being because there is a 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.680
 amount of loves that did not have to 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.090
 I have to go do everything well that 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.310
 everything is fine there is not a problem 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.500
 of health and I touch you then there is also 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.970
 some things that you did not have and that are not 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.199
 so happy either that they are afraid 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.389
 finally then you have to go 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.729
 compensating but but if I have some 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.919
 you win and when I see her kicking in 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.050
 the uat or I feel it in one dimension 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:46.139
 super unknown and how lovely 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.419
 also does not understand that one as a woman 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.770
 life has a sense of the body that 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.259
 they had some fears I knew to feel 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.460
 terrible I never felt bad that one is 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.070
 put horrible I do not feel for not 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.290
 live 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.880
 It has also been like super nice and 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.920
 especially the process that I know is nice 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.530
 the process that happens around one 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.750
 is not pregnant as with a 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.760
 nothing like that does not walk in example 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:14.020
 he opens you he looks at you he loves you people are 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:17.680
 affectionate and that's very nice I feel 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.790
 that yes it is a very magical moment the 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.040
 true and a hundred of motherhood has 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.450
 to touch with that with magic 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.730
 in the middle basket the table also the 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.070
 I want to see her I want to meet my friend 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.890
 personal of rosell who is klose has 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:32.280
 your things and we're fine is fine 

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.280
 exciting 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.780
 all right
