00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
now we've moved down to the riverbank

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.939 
now we've moved down to the riverbank
and<00:00:25.749> just<00:00:26.749> going<00:00:26.960> to<00:00:27.019> see<00:00:27.230> what<00:00:27.409> we<00:00:27.560> can<00:00:27.740> get<00:00:27.890> I

found a nice little spot here looking
between<00:00:29.960> these<00:00:30.529> two<00:00:30.800> barges<00:00:31.130> across<00:00:32.060> the

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
between these two barges across the

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.700 
between these two barges across the
river<00:00:32.480> with<00:00:32.689> a<00:00:32.720> little<00:00:33.020> bit<00:00:33.140> of<00:00:33.200> reflected

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
river with a little bit of reflected

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.650 
river with a little bit of reflected
light<00:00:33.890> off<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.040> water<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:35.180> we've<00:00:35.360> got<00:00:35.480> some

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
light off the water and we've got some

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.479 
light off the water and we've got some
colored<00:00:35.989> clouds<00:00:36.290> with<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.649> sunrise<00:00:37.130> coming

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
up behind the Eiffel Tower there so I've

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.900 
up behind the Eiffel Tower there so I've
just<00:00:39.530> gone<00:00:39.800> this<00:00:39.980> time<00:00:40.040> with<00:00:40.400> a<00:00:40.430> wide<00:00:40.670> angle

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
just gone this time with a wide angle

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.240 
just gone this time with a wide angle
not<00:00:41.240> the<00:00:41.390> super<00:00:41.690> wide<00:00:41.870> angle<00:00:42.260> lens<00:00:42.470> I've<00:00:43.040> got<00:00:43.220> a

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
not the super wide angle lens I've got a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.220 
not the super wide angle lens I've got a
graduated<00:00:43.940> filter<00:00:43.970> on<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.480> top<00:00:44.690> half<00:00:44.960> of<00:00:45.140> the

polarizer to saturate the colors a
little<00:00:49.400> bit<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.260> just<00:00:51.260> going<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.410> experiment

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
little bit and just going to experiment

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.070 
little bit and just going to experiment
with<00:00:52.160> a<00:00:52.190> few<00:00:52.250> shots<00:00:52.640> with<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.000> wide-angle<00:00:53.210> see

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
with a few shots with the wide-angle see

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.230 
with a few shots with the wide-angle see
what<00:00:54.260> results<00:00:54.740> I<00:00:54.860> can<00:00:54.920> get<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:55.520> then<00:00:55.940> I<00:00:55.970> might

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
what results I can get and then I might

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.910 
what results I can get and then I might
actually<00:00:56.420> switch<00:00:56.840> over<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.350> telephoto

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
actually switch over to the telephoto

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.610 
actually switch over to the telephoto
lens<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.580> concentrate<00:00:59.570> on<00:00:59.720> some<00:00:59.930> detail

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
lens and concentrate on some detail

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.460

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
the sun shining through that but we'll

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.179 
the sun shining through that but we'll
have<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.320> wait<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:06.650> see<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:06.950> I'm<00:01:07.040> going<00:01:07.159> to

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
have to wait and see so I'm going to

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:14.690 
have to wait and see so I'm going to
just<00:01:07.340> try<00:01:07.490> this<00:01:07.759> this<00:01:08.180> set<00:01:08.420> up<00:01:08.630> first

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.120 

down<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.170> quite<00:01:16.409> dark<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
down here is quite dark in the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.550 
down here is quite dark in the
foreground<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> front<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.899> these<00:01:18.990> barges

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
foreground in the front of these barges

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.170 
foreground in the front of these barges
especially<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.490> barge<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.060> is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
especially this one this barge here is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.300 
especially this one this barge here is
in<00:01:21.299> black<00:01:21.570> paint<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.560> lot<00:01:22.710> darker<00:01:22.979> so

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
in black paint so it's a lot darker so

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.429 
in black paint so it's a lot darker so
by<00:01:23.460> having<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.000> graduated<00:01:24.689> filter<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.259> I'm

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
by having the graduated filter on I'm

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.740 
by having the graduated filter on I'm
bringing<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> level<00:01:26.789> of<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.969> sky<00:01:27.210> down<00:01:27.509> more

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
bringing the level of the sky down more

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.319 
bringing the level of the sky down more
to<00:01:27.899> match<00:01:28.079> my<00:01:28.320> foreground<00:01:28.799> area<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:30.299> can

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
to match my foreground area and we can

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.179 
to match my foreground area and we can
see<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.780> Sun<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.289> breaking<00:01:31.590> through<00:01:32.069> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
see the Sun just breaking through the

once it's lifted up above that banker
cloud<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.740> could<00:01:37.920> make<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.369> quite<00:01:38.520> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
cloud this could make for quite a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.940 
cloud this could make for quite a
dramatic<00:01:39.299> shot<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.869> that's<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> great<00:01:40.920> thing

going<00:04:19.860> to<00:04:19.890> use<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.310> slow<00:04:20.970> shutter<00:04:21.239> speed<00:04:21.630> of

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
going to use a slow shutter speed of

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.750 
going to use a slow shutter speed of
maybe<00:04:21.989> about<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.320> tenth<00:04:22.710> or<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.040> fifteenth<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:23.640> a

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
maybe about a tenth or a fifteenth of a

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.850 
maybe about a tenth or a fifteenth of a
second<00:04:24.090> just<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.570> get<00:04:24.690> little<00:04:25.230> bit<00:04:25.380> motion

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
second just to get little bit motion

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.620 
second just to get little bit motion
blur<00:04:26.100> on<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.340> train<00:04:26.700> as<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:27.000> goes<00:04:27.150> over<00:04:27.360> the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
track there and those buildings that

track there and those buildings that
lift<00:04:30.000> up<00:04:30.120> says<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.510> little<00:04:30.900> bit<00:04:31.020> more<00:04:31.200> of<00:04:31.320> an

arcing City shot a little bit different

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.350 
arcing City shot a little bit different
so<00:04:33.720> I'm<00:04:33.780> gonna<00:04:33.900> see<00:04:34.050> what<00:04:34.170> I<00:04:34.200> can<00:04:34.230> come<00:04:34.380> up<00:04:34.500> with

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
so I'm gonna see what I can come up with

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.850 
so I'm gonna see what I can come up with

shutter speeds in the aperture then I

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.910 
shutter speeds in the aperture then I
