00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
is that those tables really really force

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.490 
is that those tables really really force
you<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.940> hammer<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.390> your<00:00:48.690> default<00:00:49.230> strategy

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500

that range default Bluff frequency
post-flop<00:00:54.449> etc<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:56.190> has<00:00:56.340> pros<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.820> cons

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
post-flop etc and that has pros and cons

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.729 
post-flop etc and that has pros and cons
to<00:00:57.210> write<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.660> pro<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.410> really

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
to write the pro is that you really

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.799 
to write the pro is that you really
really<00:00:59.039> hammer<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.550> your<00:00:59.850> default<00:01:00.270> game<00:01:00.510> but

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
really hammer out your default game but

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.180 
really hammer out your default game but
the<00:01:00.899> con<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.530> once<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.160> that

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the con is that once you have that

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.789 
the con is that once you have that
default<00:01:02.879> game<00:01:03.059> hammered<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.629> where<00:01:04.350> else<00:01:04.559> do

you<00:01:04.920> go<00:01:05.129> there's<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.909> much<00:01:06.180> else<00:01:06.450> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
you go there's really not much else you

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.069 
enough samples are going to happen in
the<00:02:02.969> little<00:02:03.420> bit<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.540> time<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.960> you're

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the little bit of time that you're

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.030 
the little bit of time that you're
playing<00:02:04.320> against<00:02:04.560> someone

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
playing against someone

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.940 
playing against someone
an<00:02:05.190> anonymous<00:02:05.460> table<00:02:06.150> so<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.320> thing<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.740> is

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
an anonymous table so the thing is is

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.980 
an anonymous table so the thing is is
when<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.490> a<00:02:08.520> very<00:02:09.000> limited<00:02:09.330> HUD<00:02:09.810> like

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
when you have a very limited HUD like

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.110 
when you have a very limited HUD like
this<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.410> really<00:02:10.770> only<00:02:10.979> useful<00:02:11.340> for<00:02:11.610> trying

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
this it's really only useful for trying

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.510 
this it's really only useful for trying
to<00:02:12.180> figure<00:02:12.450> out<00:02:12.630> player<00:02:13.050> types<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.800> then<00:02:14.070> once

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
to figure out player types and then once

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.280 
to figure out player types and then once
you<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:14.880> usually<00:02:15.780> again<00:02:16.110> you're

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
you have that usually again you're

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.800 
you have that usually again you're

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810

general advice in this situation will be

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.090 
general advice in this situation will be
to<00:02:42.240> keep<00:02:42.510> working<00:02:43.080> on<00:02:43.230> your<00:02:43.260> default<00:02:43.590> game

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
to keep working on your default game

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.699 
to keep working on your default game
your<00:02:44.310> default<00:02:44.820> strategy<00:02:45.170> keep<00:02:46.170> getting<00:02:46.590> that

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
your default strategy keep getting that

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.530 
your default strategy keep getting that
really<00:02:47.160> really<00:02:47.370> strong<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.940> solid<00:02:48.180> and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
really really strong and solid and

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.940 
really really strong and solid and
that's<00:02:48.630> just<00:02:48.840> kind<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.140> byproduct<00:02:49.350> of

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
that's just kind of a byproduct of

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.920 
that's just kind of a byproduct of
playing<00:02:50.220> on<00:02:50.400> anonymous<00:02:50.880> tables<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.660> first
