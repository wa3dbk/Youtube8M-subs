00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 convertibles Kampeter project still annoyed 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.820
 he will have ten points again 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.750
 lead from my view is earthy 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.260
 Slam will be even better 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.670
 murder better proportions 240 plus so 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.700
 clean comes out in the first passage 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.750
 that comes so the gods sails in 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.750
 direction world record 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.650
 martin panten he has them yes i know 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.580
 not me then yes but it could be about it 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.570
 have been 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.790
 again 246 meters that would be the record 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.989
 and he is overripe 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.570
 so are 50 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:50.660
 It is not true, it is not true 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:55.290
 they will witness a historical 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:00.800
 compete a date the first human 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:04.190
 the world of 250 meters flies 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:11.360
 unbelievable but if one is rather 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:14.510
 new world record the 246 meters are a 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.180
 but statistical value 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.100
 Actually, that's what he implied 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.830
 jumped like from another star 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.190
 with a self-assurance with a 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.670
 coolness with a technology everything you need 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.340
 can imagine what he needs 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.990
 here on the huge chance in vikersund 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.460
 brought to enjoy again 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.650
 analyze if anything at all 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.730
 Analyze just gives her pleasure and there 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.730
 you do not need to analyze anything 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.060
 Biaggi sets conditions 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.409
 Of course, with the last jumps 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.630
 line that was the old record please 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.320
 nice at home someone says yes 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.690
 but the land please do not go there 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.880
 It is already quite flat down there 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.390
 and since he can not telemark more 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.479
 and he made the most of this flight 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.290
 until then no more 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.780
 And that pushes him on the manufacturer 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.940
 do not call the knee halleluja yourself 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.470
 really centered there 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.910
 he rises again right away because 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.060
 he has so much speed up 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.190
 has taken that is almost 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.910
 silent silence and then breaks 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.300
 cheers out 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.940
 also from the competition for some 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.220
 unbelievable for some incredible ones 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.459
 you are satisfied when you reach the 200 meters 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.709
 fly over and fly 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.819
 smooth way 50 meters further that 's that 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.030
 a dream 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.150
 that will become his flight 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.989
 Never forget career 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.989
 No way
