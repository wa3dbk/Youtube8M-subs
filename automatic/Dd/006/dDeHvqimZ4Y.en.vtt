00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
grayed out everything the next thing we

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.510 
grayed out everything the next thing we
want<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.509> add<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> margin<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.500> top<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.340> it

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
want to do is add a margin on top of it

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.399 
want to do is add a margin on top of it
so<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.329> kind<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:55.020> straight

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
so that it's kind of not straight

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.880 
so that it's kind of not straight
against<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> top<00:01:56.180> so<00:01:57.180> we're<00:01:57.450> gonna<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.140> for

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
against the top so we're gonna do is for

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.219 
against the top so we're gonna do is for
this<00:01:58.950> container<00:01:59.369> what<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.850> might<00:01:59.969> do<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.509> footer

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
this container what I might do is footer

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.539 
this container what I might do is footer
-<00:02:02.130> margin

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
- margin

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.950 
- margin
now<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.819> where<00:02:05.969> our<00:02:05.999> custom<00:02:06.450> styles<00:02:06.810> come

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
now this is where our custom styles come

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.020 
now this is where our custom styles come
in<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.319> can<00:02:07.409> go<00:02:07.670> puts<00:02:08.670> off

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
in so we can go puts off

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.240 
in so we can go puts off
-<00:02:09.300> margin<00:02:10.050> -<00:02:10.950> top<00:02:12.769> margin<00:02:13.769> -<00:02:14.310> top<00:02:14.700> 10<00:02:15.269> pixels<00:02:16.250> so

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
- margin - top margin - top 10 pixels so

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.460 
- margin - top margin - top 10 pixels so
now<00:02:17.430> when<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:17.879> refresh<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.930> can<00:02:19.080> see<00:02:19.230> it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
now when we refresh this you can see it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.170 
now when we refresh this you can see it
brings<00:02:19.769> it<00:02:19.950> down<00:02:20.129> slightly<00:02:22.640> if<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.849> wanted<00:02:24.060> to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
brings it down slightly if we wanted to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.180 
brings it down slightly if we wanted to
create<00:02:24.480> one<00:02:24.810> left<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.319> on<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.440> right<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:26.129> is

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
create one left and on the right this is

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.220 
create one left and on the right this is
also<00:02:26.519> really<00:02:26.849> simple<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.780> would<00:02:27.959> just<00:02:28.140> do<00:02:28.290> pull
