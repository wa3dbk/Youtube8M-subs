00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
I've got an AT&amp;T sim in here right now

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.010 
I've got an AT&amp;T sim in here right now
as<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:44.740> can<00:04:44.830> see<00:04:44.889> it's<00:04:45.160> hspa+<00:04:46.150> there's<00:04:46.600> LTE

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
as you can see it's hspa+ there's LTE

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.390 
as you can see it's hspa+ there's LTE
bands<00:04:47.259> on<00:04:47.470> this<00:04:47.620> device<00:04:47.889> but<00:04:48.190> they're<00:04:48.310> not

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
bands on this device but they're not

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.520 
bands on this device but they're not
compatible<00:04:49.000> with<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.150> US<00:04:49.479> obviously<00:04:50.350> if<00:04:50.410> it

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
compatible with the US obviously if it

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.520 
compatible with the US obviously if it
comes<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:50.889> the<00:04:50.979> US<00:04:51.220> it<00:04:51.490> will<00:04:51.759> have<00:04:51.940> LTE

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
comes to the US it will have LTE

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.920 
comes to the US it will have LTE
capability<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.740> so<00:04:54.190> if<00:04:54.310> it<00:04:54.430> does<00:04:54.580> have<00:04:54.759> LT<00:04:55.030> I

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
capability and so if it does have LT I

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.379 
capability and so if it does have LT I
expect<00:04:56.620> that<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:57.460> will<00:04:57.610> be<00:04:57.669> compatible<00:04:58.300> with

expect that it will be compatible with

expect that it will be compatible with
