00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.310
 we have come to madrid 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.789
 but in a first contact with 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.239
 the people that the truth is a motorcycle 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.250
 different what we are used to 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:32.279
 they say it's a tribute to the Boxer engine 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.610
 and we thought the bike was pretty 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.480
 to walk and to teach about everything and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.100
 then you have the opportunity to try 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.870
 also the bmw s1000rr which is a naked 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.860
 with a very powerful motor with a motor 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.680
 the war and good has a lot of technology 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:53.190
 unlike any of its rivals anymore 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.140
 direct and it's a very interesting bike 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.809
 also to put a little more for the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.480
 rush day and more sporty in terms of 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.480
 the ninety bmv has made the combination 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.229
 perfect retro style but maximum 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.850
 Handle type naked has nothing 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.830
 to see any of its competitors 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.289
 the grace is magnificent both in curve 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.710
 as in response and the engine and as soon as 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:19.530
 a la s1000rr is a super spot 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.750
 disguised as super naked is for all 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.940
 the benefits of that from a great 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.720
 sporty but the manageability of a 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.270
 naked 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.320
 well I think it will not stop day 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.600
 fun with neither of the two 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.210
 amazing the night that we liked 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.160
 especially because it's not just a coffee 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.720
 Racer is not just a motorcycle with a 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.700
 urban spirit but it is also a 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.190
 super fun bike to go by area 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.250
 curves for the nobility by the potential 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.070
 of your engine and because the complete chassis 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.500
 a frankly fun set the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.930
 s1000rr does everything that is supposed to be 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.600
 super sports a 160 horsepower motorbike 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.270
 with a heritage sports chassis from the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.030
 s1000rr and it's very similar in 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.680
 behavior with a very full engine 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.050
 fun curves very easy to handle 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.970
 and also very easy to go very fast we 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.070
 we just got off the new one in which 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.750
 they must be a machine that the s1000rr 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.130
 a motorcycle that derives from the super 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.990
 sports s1000rr as it promises everything 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.200
 what you can expect is a very 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.870
 CaÃ±era has an engine that does not stop 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.820
 never and exceptional maneuverability 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.310
 practically in town you can go as 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.560
 on a sixth scooter that goes on 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.400
 automatic you want higher up you have 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.709
 all 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.269
 and all the horses in the world but 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.470
 always safe because we have 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.500
 tested with whole pack 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.000
 accessories with traction control 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.230
 electronic suspensions abs and the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.280
 true that it is a motorcycle to pass it very 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.480
 well but that also with a lot 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.519
 security we have also tried the naked 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.530
 lighting is a motorcycle that honors 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.459
 90 years of existence of the brand 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.109
 German and brings some very 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.659
 modern on fork brakes and so on 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:00.150
 but what oozes is personality and 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.030
 retro environment if you are a lover of 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.010
 motorcycles of yesteryear with current technology the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.260
 truth is that it is a very 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.879
 very interesting very well the light has 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.099
 looked like a very suitable motorcycle very 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:14.880
 pretty for people who want 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.730
 enjoy a motorcycle 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.000
 on very limited days as late as 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.900
 week for real output maybe short not 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.150
 type coffee racing and the s1000rr the 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.820
 municipality a very powerful motorcycle or 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.650
 hilarious to go very fast with 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.490
 she has just finished the presentation 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.860
 of the bmv ninety of the bmw s1000rr and the 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.420
 true after almost a hundred 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.540
 kilometers with each of them you 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.850
 I can say that the s1000rr is a motorbike 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.860
 very versatile very agile especially with a 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.680
 brutal power obviously derived from 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.710
 the s 1000 rr a cycle part very very 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.090
 achieved but also driving modes 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.720
 elasticity from below goes very well 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.580
 it has about an exceptional low 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.930
 incredible means and some high 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.030
 not as much as spectacular 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.680
 rr seeds but the truth is that it is 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.140
 a motorcycle that stretches a lot is very 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.450
 agile very versatile and above all you will 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.820
 provide many many kilometers of 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.060
 good feelings and fun in 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.040
 As for the bmw ninety, well, it's a 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.489
 new line that opened bmw and the truth 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.160
 is that 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.109
 that at the moment everything what they have 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.660
 in Spain it is almost sold I think 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:29.880
 one thing worth mentioning is a nod to 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.169
 authentic motorcycles to beautiful motorcycles 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.419
 to motorcycles ride the motorcycles 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.449
 teach motorcycles to go dressed 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.759
 well to enjoy with the walks in order 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.919
 the ninety is a bike that is worth it 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.690
 especially if you look like you 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.580
 Well we have here before the 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.560
 land because I like the most 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.509
 personalization options you have and 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.130
 As for the miller, it seems like a 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.720
 authentic r what I liked the most is 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.389
 the sixth speed you have to from 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.220
 1500 revolutions is pushed up and the 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.409
 laws of physics but especially 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.030
 road safety laws tell you there are 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:03.449
 to cut because you get very soon 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.520
 the dangerous area the s1000rr is a motorbike 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.020
 really sporty and exciting is for 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.759
 the people who like the sensations 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.669
 strong and the adrenaline but without 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.409
 give up the agility in city the 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.870
 ninety in turn combines 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.030
 perfectly the spirit of coffee racer 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.550
 with agility and movement in 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.889
 Exceptional road is a capable motorbike 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.700
 to amuse the fastest and fastest 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.190
 on the highway 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.440
 while satisfying the user of the 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.780
 day by day in the city play will read me 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.570
 It has looked like a sport without a fairing 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:38.160
 but it's still the 1000 rr that everyone 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:41.760
 we know very agile and with many low in 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.530
 road meanwhile the mind seems 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.350
 your whole life bike and there's where the 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.240
 you see with a retro aesthetic is capable of 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.270
 unwind on the road as if it were 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.950
 a completely modern motorcycle very well 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.950
 and it looks like your motorcycle of the day 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.630
 with the love
