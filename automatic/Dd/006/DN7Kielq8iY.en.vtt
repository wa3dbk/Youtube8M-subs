00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
okay here we have an Edelbrock 1406 the

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.430 
okay here we have an Edelbrock 1406 the
electric<00:00:04.110> choke<00:00:04.350> 1406<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.430> 600<00:00:05.910> cubic<00:00:06.379> feet<00:00:07.379> a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.340 
minute CFM and this one has the electric
choke<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.910> we're<00:00:15.269> going<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.540> start<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.109> up<00:00:16.199> and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
choke and we're going to start it up and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.810 
choke and we're going to start it up and
demonstrate<00:00:16.920> how<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:19.369> mixture<00:00:20.369> with

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
demonstrate how the the mixture with

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.150 
demonstrate how the the mixture with
this<00:00:21.630> little<00:00:21.930> thing<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.800> it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
this little thing here is this is it

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160 
this little thing here is this is it
this<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.850> readout<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.510> computer<00:00:24.990> hook

tell just calculating jr. let me turn
the<00:00:30.900> light<00:00:31.080> out<00:00:31.109> there

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.750 

see<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.320> computer<00:00:35.770> computing<00:00:36.310> in<00:00:36.550> that

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
see the computer computing in that

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.860 
see the computer computing in that
pretty<00:00:36.940> okay

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
pretty okay

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.770 
pretty okay
now<00:00:38.560> now<00:00:39.250> that<00:00:39.520> right<00:00:39.760> there<00:00:39.970> is<00:00:40.150> giving<00:00:40.510> us<00:00:40.630> an

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
now now that right there is giving us an

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.320 
now now that right there is giving us an
indication<00:00:41.200> of<00:00:41.500> what<00:00:41.680> of<00:00:41.890> what<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.820> computer

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
indication of what of what the computer

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.080 
indication of what of what the computer
settings<00:00:43.630> I<00:00:43.989> mean<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:44.290> reading<00:00:44.650> is<00:00:44.940> what<00:00:45.940> we

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
settings I mean the reading is what we

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.500 
settings I mean the reading is what we
do<00:00:46.380> we<00:00:47.380> know<00:00:47.559> what<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.830> reading<00:00:48.130> should<00:00:48.370> be<00:00:48.510> we

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
do we know what the reading should be we

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.130 
do we know what the reading should be we
want<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:49.930> be<00:00:50.820> about<00:00:51.820> twelve<00:00:52.180> parts<00:00:52.570> of<00:00:52.720> air<00:00:52.900> to

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
want to be about twelve parts of air to

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.770 
want to be about twelve parts of air to
one<00:00:53.290> part<00:00:53.530> of<00:00:53.650> gasoline<00:00:54.239> which<00:00:55.239> is<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.449> good

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
one part of gasoline which is a good

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.160 
one part of gasoline which is a good
clean<00:00:56.080> burn<00:00:56.410> and<00:00:57.210> good<00:00:58.210> economy<00:00:58.720> good<00:00:58.900> power

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
clean burn and good economy good power

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.119 
clean burn and good economy good power
then<00:00:59.920> we<00:01:00.100> want<00:01:00.309> to<00:01:00.400> take<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.580> look<00:01:01.830> up<00:01:02.830> to<00:01:03.100> a

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
then we want to take a look up to a

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.310 
then we want to take a look up to a
maximum<00:01:03.640> of<00:01:03.820> about<00:01:03.940> fourteen<00:01:04.720> point<00:01:05.050> seven

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
maximum of about fourteen point seven

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.080 
maximum of about fourteen point seven
with

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.670 

Oh

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.170 

it'll<00:01:17.680> thin<00:01:17.920> out<00:01:18.070> because<00:01:18.550> you've<00:01:18.760> overcome

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
it'll thin out because you've overcome

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.430 
it'll thin out because you've overcome
inertia<00:01:19.480> and<00:01:19.750> you<00:01:19.840> don't<00:01:20.020> need<00:01:20.110> as<00:01:20.260> much

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
inertia and you don't need as much

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.010 
inertia and you don't need as much
liquid<00:01:20.770> gas<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.370> propel<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.850> vehicle<00:01:22.270> so

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
liquid gas to propel the vehicle so

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.450 
liquid gas to propel the vehicle so
therefore<00:01:23.410> you<00:01:23.560> can<00:01:23.590> get<00:01:23.800> by<00:01:23.980> with<00:01:24.010> a<00:01:24.190> thinner

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
therefore you can get by with a thinner

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.360 
therefore you can get by with a thinner
mixture<00:01:24.910> inertia<00:01:25.840> now<00:01:26.260> when<00:01:27.010> you<00:01:27.100> buy<00:01:27.310> this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
mixture inertia now when you buy this

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.500 
mixture inertia now when you buy this
carburetor<00:01:27.880> you're<00:01:28.180> going<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.360> get

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
carburetor you're going to get

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.780 
carburetor you're going to get
instructions<00:01:29.050> and<00:01:29.229> how<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.380> set<00:01:29.680> this<00:01:29.890> you're

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
instructions and how to set this you're

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.520 
instructions and how to set this you're
getting<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.210> get<00:01:31.390> instructions<00:01:31.960> on<00:01:32.080> your<00:01:32.290> fuel

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
getting to get instructions on your fuel

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.859 
getting to get instructions on your fuel
pressure<00:01:32.710> what's<00:01:33.160> how<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.400> set<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:33.910> what<00:01:34.720> the

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
pressure what's how to set that what the

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.480 
pressure what's how to set that what the
proper<00:01:35.229> fuel<00:01:35.500> pressure<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.190> make<00:01:36.340> this

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
proper fuel pressure is to make this

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.310 
proper fuel pressure is to make this
thing<00:01:36.700> work<00:01:36.760> correctly<00:01:37.390> with<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.690> ethanol

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
thing work correctly with the ethanol

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.520 
thing work correctly with the ethanol
based<00:01:38.500> fuels<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:39.130> you're<00:01:39.790> going<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.090> get

you buy it you get all the information
like<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.340> said<00:02:00.580> you'll<00:02:01.000> get<00:02:01.210> three<00:02:01.570> or<00:02:01.720> four

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
like I said you'll get three or four

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.240 
like I said you'll get three or four
video<00:02:02.200> lengths<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.830> get<00:02:03.040> written
