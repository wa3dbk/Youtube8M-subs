your auto attack animation I don't know
people<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.220> realized<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.090> neatly<00:01:18.869> has

like<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.619> my<00:01:19.740> opinion<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> worst<00:01:20.460> auto<00:01:20.700> attack

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
like in my opinion the worst auto attack

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
like in my opinion the worst auto attack
animation<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.960> game<00:01:22.080> not<00:01:22.350> because<00:01:22.590> it's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
animation in the game not because it's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
animation in the game not because it's
actually<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.580> worst<00:01:23.729> like<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.180> probably

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
actually the worst like that probably

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.640 
actually the worst like that probably
belongs<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> Karthus<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.409> something<00:01:25.590> like

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
belongs to Karthus or something like

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.350 
belongs to Karthus or something like
that<00:01:25.710> was<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:26.460> slow<00:01:26.790> auto<00:01:27.060> attack

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
that was this really slow auto attack

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.510 
that was this really slow auto attack
animation<00:01:27.840> nedley's<00:01:28.590> problem<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> looks

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
animation nedley's problem is it looks

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.700 
animation nedley's problem is it looks
like<00:01:29.820> her<00:01:29.970> auto<00:01:30.119> attack<00:01:30.479> shouldn't<00:01:31.320> suck<00:01:31.560> it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
like her auto attack shouldn't suck it

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
like her auto attack shouldn't suck it
looks<00:01:31.890> fairly<00:01:32.159> crisp<00:01:32.549> what<00:01:33.150> happens<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
looks fairly crisp what happens is the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.719 
looks fairly crisp what happens is the
instant<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.259> speeder<00:01:34.590> hits<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:35.579> how<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.460 
instant the speeder hits see how the
spear<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.180> kind<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.360> floats<00:01:36.750> inside<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
spear just kind of floats inside the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.469 
spear just kind of floats inside the
target<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.310> throws<00:01:39.060> off<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
target and it's like throws off the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.990 
target and it's like throws off the
damage<00:01:39.659> by<00:01:39.960> point<00:01:40.890> two<00:01:41.159> seconds<00:01:41.640> or<00:01:41.759> something

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
damage by point two seconds or something

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.060 
damage by point two seconds or something
especially<00:01:42.659> given<00:01:42.869> Lily's<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.470> craptastic

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
especially given Lily's like craptastic

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.249 
especially given Lily's like craptastic
base<00:01:44.759> ad<00:01:45.060> early<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.750> stuff<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.020> try<00:01:46.200> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
base ad early on and stuff you try to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
base ad early on and stuff you try to
last<00:01:46.470> hit<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.310> throws<00:01:47.579> me<00:01:47.729> off

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
last hit that really throws me off

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.550 
last hit that really throws me off
because<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.570> should<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.079> doing<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
because it's like it should be doing the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.789 
because it's like it should be doing the
damage<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.729> yeah<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.659> sphere<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.439> kind<00:01:52.740> of

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
damage but yeah the sphere just kind of

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.740 
damage but yeah the sphere just kind of
floats<00:01:53.310> inside<00:01:53.670> people<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.360> find<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.689> so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
floats inside people I find that so

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.359 
floats inside people I find that so
incredibly<00:01:55.409> annoying<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:55.920> really<00:01:56.280> glad

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
incredibly annoying so I'm really glad

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.550 
incredibly annoying so I'm really glad
that<00:01:56.520> they're<00:01:56.729> fixing<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:58.259> we'll<00:01:58.409> see

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that they're fixing that and we'll see

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.530 
that they're fixing that and we'll see
how<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.740> coal<00:01:59.100> kitchen<00:01:59.579> turns<00:01:59.850> out<00:02:00.030> that's

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
how the coal kitchen turns out that's

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.719 
how the coal kitchen turns out that's
kind<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.350> don't<00:02:01.860> know<00:02:02.130> how<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> feel<00:02:02.670> about

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
kind of I don't know how I feel about

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.340 
kind of I don't know how I feel about
what<00:02:03.090> they're<00:02:03.240> doing<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.600> kid<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.930> mean<00:02:04.049> I'm

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
what they're doing is a kid I mean I'm

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.630 
what they're doing is a kid I mean I'm
not<00:02:04.619> gonna<00:02:04.740> come<00:02:05.009> because<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.310> haven't<00:02:05.430> tested

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
not gonna come because I haven't tested

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.310 
not gonna come because I haven't tested
it<00:02:05.820> could<00:02:06.060> be<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.450> cool<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.110> might

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
it could be really cool like I might

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.779 
it could be really cool like I might
actually<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.680> know<00:02:07.770> end<00:02:08.039> up<00:02:08.280> meaning<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.700> or

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
actually you know end up meaning it or

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.850 
actually you know end up meaning it or
something<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.090> who<00:02:09.330> knows<00:02:09.479> but

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
something like that who knows but

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.589 
something like that who knows but
it's<00:02:11.970> unfortunate<00:02:12.970> because<00:02:13.030> nearly<00:02:13.300> have

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
it's unfortunate because nearly have

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.570 
it's unfortunate because nearly have
this<00:02:13.750> occupied<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.349> weird<00:02:14.739> space<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.489> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
this occupied this weird space in the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.920 
this occupied this weird space in the
game<00:02:15.730> which<00:02:15.849> I<00:02:15.940> don't<00:02:16.000> think<00:02:16.330> was<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.510> terrible

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
game which I don't think was a terrible

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.900 
game which I don't think was a terrible
thing<00:02:16.989> just<00:02:17.410> like<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.980> know<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.190> nuclear<00:02:18.610> tip

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
thing just like you know the nuclear tip

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.580 
thing just like you know the nuclear tip
spear<00:02:19.330> thing<00:02:19.599> where<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:19.870> kind<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.379> want

people<00:02:22.810> sometimes<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.319> was<00:02:23.500> more<00:02:23.680> or<00:02:23.709> less<00:02:23.800> to

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
people sometimes it was more or less to

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.589 
people sometimes it was more or less to
shotting<00:02:24.430> people<00:02:24.730> from<00:02:24.910> across<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.209> screen

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
shotting people from across the screen

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.050 
shotting people from across the screen
and<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.379> is<00:02:26.739> kind<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.190> interesting<00:02:27.700> seed

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
and it is kind of this interesting seed

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.900 
and it is kind of this interesting seed
dynamic<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.200> game<00:02:29.530> thing<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.430> no<00:02:30.760> other

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
dynamic to the game thing that no other

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.780 
dynamic to the game thing that no other
champion<00:02:31.420> really<00:02:32.080> had<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:33.640> know<00:02:33.700> I

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
champion really had and you know I

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.910 
champion really had and you know I
didn't<00:02:34.330> feel<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.510> was<00:02:34.660> overly<00:02:35.170> problematic<00:02:35.830> I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
didn't feel it was overly problematic I

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.990 
didn't feel it was overly problematic I
mean<00:02:36.040> sometimes<00:02:36.370> because<00:02:36.549> it's<00:02:36.700> kind<00:02:36.849> of

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
mean sometimes because it's kind of

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.490 
mean sometimes because it's kind of
annoying<00:02:37.209> when<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.480> get<00:02:37.599> one<00:02:37.750> shot<00:02:37.959> by<00:02:38.170> fed<00:02:38.410> in

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
annoying when you get one shot by fed in

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.289 
annoying when you get one shot by fed in
Italy<00:02:38.739> or<00:02:38.860> something<00:02:39.190> but<00:02:39.849> you<00:02:39.970> know<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.120> can

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
Italy or something but you know you can

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.759 
Italy or something but you know you can
always<00:02:40.420> pay<00:02:40.690> attention<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.319> screen<00:02:41.500> and

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
always pay attention to the screen and

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.080 
always pay attention to the screen and
generally<00:02:42.370> avoid<00:02:42.640> mold<00:02:42.970> Spears<00:02:44.849> but<00:02:45.849> you<00:02:46.000> know

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
generally avoid mold Spears but you know

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.150 
generally avoid mold Spears but you know
I'm<00:02:46.540> open-minded<00:02:47.019> so<00:02:47.440> I'm<00:02:47.680> gonna<00:02:47.980> look

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
I'm open-minded so I'm gonna look

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.059 
I'm open-minded so I'm gonna look
forward<00:02:48.579> to<00:02:48.700> what<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.940> kid<00:02:49.090> actually<00:02:49.269> does

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
forward to what the kid actually does

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.130 
forward to what the kid actually does
judging<00:02:51.069> by<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.610> numbers<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.540> wouldn't<00:02:53.019> be

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
judging by the numbers I wouldn't be

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.800 
judging by the numbers I wouldn't be
entirely<00:02:53.590> surprised<00:02:54.190> if<00:02:54.370> we<00:02:54.459> see<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.239> return<00:02:55.480> of

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
entirely surprised if we see a return of

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.630 
entirely surprised if we see a return of
some<00:02:55.959> sort<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.410> tanking<00:02:57.040> Italy<00:02:57.370> or<00:02:57.549> at

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
some sort of like tanking Italy or at

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.240 
some sort of like tanking Italy or at
least<00:02:57.819> like<00:02:58.150> somewhat<00:02:58.870> tanky<00:02:59.349> like<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.950> tank

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
least like somewhat tanky like a tank

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.650 
least like somewhat tanky like a tank
EAP<00:03:00.700> Nidalee<00:03:01.000> maybe<00:03:01.180> because<00:03:01.420> now<00:03:01.540> they

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
EAP Nidalee maybe because now they

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.930 
EAP Nidalee maybe because now they
affect<00:03:01.930> should<00:03:02.079> go<00:03:02.290> in<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:02.829> it<00:03:03.640> looks

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
affect should go in and and it looks

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.360 
affect should go in and and it looks
like<00:03:04.030> going<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:05.110> more<00:03:05.500> damage<00:03:05.950> but<00:03:06.280> of

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
like going in is more damage but of

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.059 
like going in is more damage but of
course<00:03:06.549> when<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:06.790> go<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.120> it's<00:03:07.420> riskier<00:03:08.140> so

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
course when you go in it's riskier so

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.699 
course when you go in it's riskier so
we'll<00:03:09.730> see<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.180> really<00:03:10.959> actually<00:03:11.170> did<00:03:11.410> enjoy

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
we'll see I really actually did enjoy

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.069 
we'll see I really actually did enjoy
the<00:03:11.860> old<00:03:12.069> tank<00:03:12.730> Nidalee<00:03:13.239> build<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.569> long<00:03:13.780> time

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
the old tank Nidalee build a long time

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.750 
the old tank Nidalee build a long time
before<00:03:14.230> they<00:03:14.470> nerf<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.859> crap<00:03:15.100> out<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.519> so

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
before they nerf the crap out of it so

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.539 
before they nerf the crap out of it so
maybe<00:03:15.880> I'll<00:03:16.120> experiment<00:03:16.630> with<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:16.870> again

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
maybe I'll experiment with that again

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.069 
maybe I'll experiment with that again
and<00:03:18.549> I<00:03:18.910> may<00:03:19.090> be<00:03:19.150> mixing<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.510> bit<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.840> pea<00:03:20.049> or

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
and I may be mixing a bit of a pea or

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.379 
and I may be mixing a bit of a pea or
maybe<00:03:20.530> even<00:03:20.620> try<00:03:21.040> like<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.340> tank<00:03:21.670> 18<00:03:22.090> Italy

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
maybe even try like a tank 18 Italy

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:23.610 
maybe even try like a tank 18 Italy
again<00:03:22.569> see<00:03:22.720> how<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:22.959> works<00:03:23.079> with<00:03:23.380> them

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
again see how that works with them

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.110 
again see how that works with them
what's<00:03:23.829> that<00:03:23.889> I<00:03:24.010> don't<00:03:24.220> call<00:03:24.400> trinity<00:03:24.970> force

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
what's that I don't call trinity force

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.330 
what's that I don't call trinity force
isn't<00:03:25.420> like<00:03:25.569> that<00:03:25.600> I<00:03:26.500> don't<00:03:26.889> know<00:03:27.010> I'm<00:03:27.250> not

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
isn't like that I don't know I'm not

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.559 
isn't like that I don't know I'm not
gonna<00:03:27.459> mass<00:03:27.700> craft<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.150> right<00:03:28.239> now<00:03:28.359> at<00:03:28.510> this

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
gonna mass craft it right now at this

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:29.849 
gonna mass craft it right now at this
point<00:03:28.780> let's<00:03:29.019> I'll<00:03:29.109> just<00:03:29.230> go<00:03:29.380> in<00:03:29.500> game<00:03:29.650> and

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
point let's I'll just go in game and

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.759 
point let's I'll just go in game and
test<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.160> out<00:03:30.280> for<00:03:30.760> myself<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:32.200> we<00:03:32.349> as<00:03:32.440> soon<00:03:32.620> as

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
test it out for myself so we as soon as

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.319 
test it out for myself so we as soon as
that<00:03:32.859> becomes<00:03:33.130> available<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.819> will<00:03:34.030> have<00:03:34.180> that

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
that becomes available I will have that

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.870 
that becomes available I will have that
up<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.170> ready<00:03:35.349> for<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.620> guys<00:03:35.859> in<00:03:36.489> fact<00:03:36.730> I'll

up and ready for you guys in fact I'll
probably<00:03:36.910> put<00:03:37.329> that<00:03:37.540> in<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.840> description<00:03:37.959> and

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
probably put that in the description and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.020 
probably put that in the description and
you<00:03:38.829> know<00:03:38.920> annotations<00:03:39.549> at<00:03:39.669> the<00:03:39.730> beginning

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
you know annotations at the beginning

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.129 
you know annotations at the beginning
like<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.269> usually<00:03:40.419> do<00:03:40.690> when<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.900> video<00:03:41.049> was

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
like I usually do when the video was

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.409 
like I usually do when the video was
actually<00:03:41.380> out<00:03:41.829> for<00:03:42.130> actual<00:03:42.609> gameplay<00:03:42.849> not<00:03:43.269> me

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
actually out for actual gameplay not me

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.900 
actually out for actual gameplay not me
theorizing<00:03:44.349> so<00:03:44.980> yeah<00:03:45.250> we<00:03:45.430> all<00:03:45.549> have<00:03:45.639> that<00:03:45.760> to

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
theorizing so yeah we all have that to

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.030 
theorizing so yeah we all have that to
look<00:03:45.940> forward<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.690> yeah<00:03:47.260> hopefully<00:03:47.530> this

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
look forward to and yeah hopefully this

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.740 
look forward to and yeah hopefully this
new<00:03:48.220> newly<00:03:48.549> reworked<00:03:48.730> doesn't<00:03:49.209> suck<00:03:49.419> because

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
new newly reworked doesn't suck because

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.020 
new newly reworked doesn't suck because
I<00:03:49.989> like<00:03:50.680> nearly<00:03:50.889> how<00:03:51.099> she<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.760> don't<00:03:51.970> think

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
I like nearly how she is I don't think

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.659 
I like nearly how she is I don't think
it's<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.329> massive<00:03:52.840> problem<00:03:52.989> as<00:03:53.290> i<00:03:53.380> said<00:03:53.530> earlier

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669
