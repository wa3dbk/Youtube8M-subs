00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.690 
doesn't know exactly how this happened
but<00:03:20.020> they're<00:03:20.410> hard<00:03:20.650> at<00:03:20.800> work<00:03:20.980> looking<00:03:21.459> for<00:03:21.640> the

but they're hard at work looking for the
answer<00:03:26.280> we<00:03:27.280> took<00:03:27.489> material<00:03:27.670> from<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.180> top<00:03:28.390> of

answer we took material from the top of

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.240 
answer we took material from the top of
the<00:03:28.570> garden<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.410> then<00:03:29.530> we<00:03:29.620> took<00:03:29.800> material

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
the garden and then we took material

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.770 
the garden and then we took material
from<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.459> bottom<00:03:30.489> of<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.880> gardens<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.330> we

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
from the bottom of the gardens and we

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.840 
from the bottom of the gardens and we
just<00:03:32.020> measured<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.650> amount<00:03:32.739> of<00:03:33.250> cellulose

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
just measured the amount of cellulose

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.030 
just measured the amount of cellulose
that<00:03:34.150> was<00:03:34.239> present<00:03:34.810> inside<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.800> plant

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
that was present inside of that plant

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.240 
that was present inside of that plant
bound<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.239> part<00:03:38.200> of<00:03:38.290> what<00:03:38.739> we're<00:03:38.950> doing

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
bound and so part of what we're doing

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.280 
bound and so part of what we're doing
now<00:03:39.430> is<00:03:39.790> we're<00:03:40.060> going<00:03:40.209> through<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.750> trying<00:03:40.930> to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
now is we're going through and trying to

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.050 
now is we're going through and trying to
find<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.709> microbes<00:03:42.130> that<00:03:42.190> are<00:03:42.280> responsible

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
find the microbes that are responsible

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.690 
find the microbes that are responsible
for<00:03:43.239> this<00:03:43.360> degradation<00:03:43.720> be<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:45.100> fungus<00:03:45.550> that

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
for this degradation be it a fungus that

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.090 
for this degradation be it a fungus that
means<00:03:45.970> go<00:03:46.120> quickly<00:03:46.330> themselves<00:03:46.959> or<00:03:47.320> bacteria

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
means go quickly themselves or bacteria

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.729 
means go quickly themselves or bacteria
that<00:03:48.459> also<00:03:48.850> live<00:03:49.030> inside<00:03:49.390> of<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.110> microbial

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
that also live inside of this microbial

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.009 
that also live inside of this microbial
community<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:51.730> we<00:03:51.820> got<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.090> bacteria<00:03:52.660> out<00:03:52.840> of

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
community so we got the bacteria out of

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:53.940 
community so we got the bacteria out of
the<00:03:53.170> dirt

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
the dirt

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.190 
the dirt
now<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.090> now<00:03:55.300> we're<00:03:55.450> going<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:55.750> do<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.020> want

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
now so now we're going to do is you want

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.690 
now so now we're going to do is you want
to<00:03:56.230> test<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.650> see<00:03:56.680> whether<00:03:57.099> or<00:03:57.220> not<00:03:57.370> they<00:03:57.640> can

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
to test to see whether or not they can

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.089 
to test to see whether or not they can
eat<00:03:58.060> cellulose<00:03:58.390> so<00:03:59.020> here<00:03:59.319> is<00:03:59.470> our<00:03:59.590> cellulose

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
eat cellulose so here is our cellulose

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.350 
eat cellulose so here is our cellulose

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
introduce you to mrs. Laura so Laura why

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.580 
introduce you to mrs. Laura so Laura why
don't<00:04:06.849> you<00:04:07.000> explain<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.959> little<00:04:08.140> bit<00:04:08.319> what

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
don't you explain a little bit what

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.979 
don't you explain a little bit what
you're<00:04:08.709> doing<00:04:09.060> well<00:04:10.060> once<00:04:10.360> you<00:04:10.540> get<00:04:10.720> the

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
you're doing well once you get the

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.559 
you're doing well once you get the

media<00:04:18.130> called<00:04:18.790> CMC<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.930> see<00:04:20.109> if<00:04:20.230> they<00:04:20.350> can<00:04:20.560> grow

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
media called CMC to see if they can grow

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.640

so<00:04:21.700> we<00:04:21.940> if<00:04:22.750> they're<00:04:22.960> able<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.230> grow<00:04:23.410> on<00:04:23.560> this

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
so we if they're able to grow on this

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.230 
so we if they're able to grow on this
media<00:04:23.710> we<00:04:24.130> know<00:04:24.250> that<00:04:24.370> they<00:04:24.460> probably<00:04:24.700> can<00:04:25.090> do
