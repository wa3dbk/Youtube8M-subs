and just going to keep playing that
eventually<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.390> just<00:03:00.420> switch<00:03:00.750> going

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
eventually you just switch going

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.990 
eventually you just switch going
backwards<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.069> switch<00:03:02.370> into<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.790> one

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
backwards so you switch into the one

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.630 
backwards so you switch into the one
where<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:04.650> don't<00:03:04.860> hit<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.099> fifth<00:03:05.310> fret<00:03:05.489> you

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
where you don't hit the fifth fret you

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.089 
where you don't hit the fifth fret you
hit<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.879> sixth<00:03:06.120> fret<00:03:09.530> then<00:03:10.530> things<00:03:10.799> just<00:03:10.860> hit

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
hit the sixth fret then things just hit

00:03:11.099 --> 00:04:08.330 
hit the sixth fret then things just hit
quieter<00:03:11.519> so<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.120> end<00:03:12.329> sounds<00:03:12.720> like<00:03:12.840> this

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340
