 is amazing friends and friends as when time goes by 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.429
 some trades incredibly and this really draws attention 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.149
 they are left behind 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:12.960
 it will be for technology 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.960
 be for the advancement of science in some areas 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.439
 simply because times change 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.570
 there are jobs 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.330
 that little by little every time 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.089
 it is done at least 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.929
 and even less 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.380
 a for example in a case like Durango 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.550
 when 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.550
 a means of transport such as the railroad disappeared 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.010
 just this not only our very good friend enters mu침oz 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.780
 about the day of the railroad worker 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.580
 That 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.280
 that is to say in durango already of those men and in women also because 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.180
 there was 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.050
 who were engaged 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.050
 Noble job of baby's life communication 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.140
 through the railroad 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.540
 happens now with the railroaders 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.210
 how is your life 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.260
 These questions will answer us Indra Mu침oz through this work 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.280
 special 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 of the railroad worker 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.930
 land uses fell the voter go back to the concession granted by 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.770
 maximiliano organized crime 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.140
 will continue later with benito ju치rez 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.690
 originally the company was created under the mandate of the porfirio government 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.490
 day 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.470
 throughout the course of the 30 years that his government lasted the majority 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.500
 of railways of that time were administered by foreign companies and 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.430
 It was until 1988 when L치zaro Cardenas led the sporting railroad and put it on 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.180
 Mexican hands the hackers 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.180
 More optimistic 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.270
 the idea is that mexico of torrijos true this precept 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.690
 if true 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.640
 to this sector 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.239
 this gadget that traveled in that way expresses 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.400
 in the absence of agreement to the analysis there forever 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.699
 fax 2508 friday 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.319
 this is not exactly 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.149
 Telam peasants 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.619
 will take us alcohol 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.619
 Tobon very beautiful work 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:34.449
 the one that all this 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.059
 be foreign 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.059
 to this they add 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.090
 Well I have about 20 years on if there is no justice you can 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.539
 If I continue ordaz 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:49.419
 yes there were situations 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.419
 if you want this 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.289
 he also exposed all those accidents 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.119
 the residents 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.639
 pedro ochoa already for phoenix 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.639
 the same did present 3 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.540
 in less than four years the central garden which will unite the city of 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.159
 Mexico with North Pass 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.499
 a stretch of almost two thousand kilometers the rights of way were the cause of some 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.299
 problems between railroad companies and farmers 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.879
 some actors say that the railways came to modify the 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.460
 agrarian distribution of the country 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.440
 but the government's priority in building a railroad was greater than the 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.430
 of protecting the land of the peasants which led to the expropriation of 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.279
 large tracts of land 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:56.669
 The success of the company is reflected in its growth rates beginning with 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:02.619
 14% wolves decreasing 7% and then buying the railroad from Monterrey to 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:06.749
 gulf climbed 15 percent this undoubtedly generated an expectation of 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:10.180
 very large growth by which entrepreneurs gave themselves the luxury of 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:14.689
 build a large number of stations the problem arose when they were given 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.560
 account that the load was contemplated only in some 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.799
 but this situation of overload only in some stations remained barely 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.599
 a few who during the following years 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.430
 This led to more radical decisions, as some of the 

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:32.589
 pine stations gave the company some profit for more than 20 years 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.490
 particular pulse of what he did 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.360
 and in addition the group 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.409
 since there was 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.400
 the units 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.919
 this happened 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.349
 particular 2 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.520
 this fact was recorded this afternoon 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.520
 and if not the inevitable 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.099
 and today has been such 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.099
 states contribute so much is a job 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.080
 thousands of stories that existed of life but when they will stay in those that 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.300
 for years they were part of the history of Mexico
