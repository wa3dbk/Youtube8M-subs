00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.099
 It's okay, I'm tarcísio sodano no 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.280
 team and today I will present the new 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.910
 model of aqualand watches collection 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.250
 of sic without this model as all 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.779
 others is a much more specific model 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.310
 for diving 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.529
 this watch it already has the ratchet 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.099
 unidirectional like all models of the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.790
 it is logical that it also has the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.090
 depth gauge this most modern version 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.370
 of speakers that was released on the 20th 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.110
 hours take a look at the cool image 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.219
 a detail that also has to be 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.350
 highlight is that this watch is 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.690
 fully analog 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.770
 then their functions are through the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.260
 pointers 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.680
 see on the display that it also has the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.379
 load indicating pointer to be 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.870
 an ecodrive model then this facilitates 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.949
 view of the diver's person. 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.610
 user right 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.439
 the charge autonomy of this watch 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.170
 very cool it 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.729
 see in the video that it has a format well 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.140
 and his bracelet looks like it's 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.479
 embedded in the box, right? 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.409
 the thickness of this watch is also well 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.960
 large and it has 17.88 millimeters 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.299
 approximately a very thick watch and 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.150
 He is heavy despite having the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.439
 Rubber it has 178 grams 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.200
 approximately and it has the function of 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.240
 maximum depth reached 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.170
 he keeps this record for you to know 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.240
 How far do you get plunged? 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.979
 it also has the rapid rise alarm 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.220
 This is very cool, which is a precaution. 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.320
 for the diver is the measurement is 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.570
 depth as soon as possible. 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.369
 get into the water it already starts to measure 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.140
 you do not have to press a button nor 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.630
 nothing, so this is very cool 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.689
 Look how cool this bracelet detail is. 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.880
 he has this final part of it because he is a 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.580
 slightly wider then it is difficult to 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.140
 to put on the beer buckle but he 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.780
 also has this advantage which is a 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.680
 protection for the watch case to be 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.739
 open 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.599
 will it not a soft easily I will 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.989
 put him on the course is for you benitão 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.549
 Reasonable size is large watch not 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.819
 is the extra large value 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:30.540
 it seems bigger because of the 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.400
 thickness but it is 48 millimeters 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.719
 It's a pretty big bracelet so this 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.639
 facilitates at the time of placing on top of 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:41.579
 Rubber tire tire premium is for 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:43.680
 the diver you like the clothes of 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.329
 rubber three millimeters three thousand 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.970
 liter and a half will dive into a place 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.939
 very cold that the clothes are thick 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.919
 that watch it fits well is a 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.200
 clock that dispenses comments from 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:57.959
