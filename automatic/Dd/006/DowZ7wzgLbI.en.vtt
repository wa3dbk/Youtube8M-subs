00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.760 

my<00:00:02.310> earliest<00:00:02.790> memory<00:00:02.970> is<00:00:03.720> running<00:00:04.410> around<00:00:04.500> as

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
my earliest memory is running around as

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.769 
my earliest memory is running around as
a<00:00:04.830> girl<00:00:04.980> with<00:00:05.130> her<00:00:05.310> anyone<00:00:06.089> who<00:00:06.240> was<00:00:06.359> tall<00:00:06.569> was

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
a girl with her anyone who was tall was

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.230 
a girl with her anyone who was tall was
always<00:00:07.049> in<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.400> shooting<00:00:08.400> end<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.970> court

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
always in the shooting end of the court

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.140 
always in the shooting end of the court
yeah<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:09.809> remember<00:00:10.260> one<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.380> my<00:00:10.500> first<00:00:11.150> state

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
yeah I remember one of my first state

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.910 
yeah I remember one of my first state
teams<00:00:12.420> trying<00:00:12.660> out<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.080> know<00:00:13.200> when<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.380> was<00:00:13.469> 14

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
teams trying out you know when I was 14

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.560 
teams trying out you know when I was 14
I<00:00:14.070> think<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.610> coach<00:00:14.849> said<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.240> me<00:00:15.360> that

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
I think the coach said to me that

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.300 
I think the coach said to me that
there's<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.230> many<00:00:16.350> tall<00:00:16.590> shooters<00:00:16.949> out<00:00:17.070> there

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
there's so many tall shooters out there

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.609 
there's so many tall shooters out there
but<00:00:18.240> there's<00:00:18.390> no<00:00:18.539> tall<00:00:18.779> defenders<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.289> play<00:00:19.470> on

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
but there's no tall defenders to play on

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.320 
but there's no tall defenders to play on
them<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:19.980> why<00:00:20.130> don't<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> go<00:00:20.670> be<00:00:21.150> your

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
them so why don't you have a go be your

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.599 
them so why don't you have a go be your
defender<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.900> was<00:00:22.320> not<00:00:22.470> interested<00:00:22.710> at<00:00:23.100> all<00:00:23.279> and

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
defender I was not interested at all and

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.070 
defender I was not interested at all and
it<00:00:23.699> took<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.910> lot<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.090> convincing<00:00:24.240> from<00:00:24.689> my<00:00:24.840> mum

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
it took a lot of convincing from my mum

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.810 
it took a lot of convincing from my mum
for<00:00:25.439> me<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> listen<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.949> my<00:00:26.039> coach<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.550> get<00:00:26.699> out

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
for me to listen to my coach and get out

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.220 
for me to listen to my coach and get out
there<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> go<00:00:27.390> as<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> defender<00:00:28.199> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
there and have a go as a defender and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.529 
there and have a go as a defender and
I'm<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.160> glad<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.400> did<00:00:29.670> because<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:30.060> think<00:00:30.210> it's

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
I'm so glad I did because I think it's

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.749 
I'm so glad I did because I think it's
probably<00:00:31.439> created<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.040> very<00:00:32.430> different

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
probably created a very different

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.819 
probably created a very different
pathway<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.329> me<00:00:33.420> had<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> been<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:34.200> shooter<00:00:34.649> at

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
pathway for me had I been a shooter at

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.170 
pathway for me had I been a shooter at
all<00:00:35.010> shooter<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.399> would<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.670> been<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:36.030> one

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
all shooter I would have been just one

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.810 
all shooter I would have been just one
of<00:00:36.300> probably<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.809> thousand<00:00:39.950> she<00:00:40.950> wanted<00:00:41.430> it

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
of probably a thousand she wanted it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.290 
of probably a thousand she wanted it
check<00:00:42.420> field<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.290> never<00:00:44.070> even<00:00:44.250> dreamed<00:00:45.030> of

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
check field I never even dreamed of

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.729 
check field I never even dreamed of
playing<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.660> Australia<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.410> didn't<00:00:46.620> even

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
playing for Australia like I didn't even

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.150 
playing for Australia like I didn't even
think<00:00:47.340> about<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.649> it's<00:00:49.649> almost<00:00:49.920> like

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
think about it I just it's almost like

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.220 
think about it I just it's almost like
once<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.520> got<00:00:50.730> into<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.090> bubble<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> playing

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
once I got into this bubble of playing

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.529 
once I got into this bubble of playing
netball<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.280> all<00:00:53.489> kind<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.820> happened<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
netball it just all kind of happened and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
netball it just all kind of happened and
I<00:00:54.840> think<00:00:55.230> they<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.500> took<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.550> bit<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.030> faith

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
I think they just took a bit of faith

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.750 
I think they just took a bit of faith
with<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> young<00:00:57.960> kid<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.379> put<00:00:58.530> me<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.070> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
with a young kid and put me in and you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.310 
with a young kid and put me in and you
know<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.879> think<00:00:59.940> my<00:01:00.180> family<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.660> surprised<00:01:01.020> I

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
know I think my family was surprised I

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.110 
know I think my family was surprised I
was<00:01:01.469> surprised<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.370> completely

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
was surprised it's just completely

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.030 
was surprised it's just completely
surreal<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> whole<00:01:03.870> experience<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.860> then<00:01:05.010> I

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
surreal the whole experience but then I

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.560 
surreal the whole experience but then I
feel<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.339> my<00:01:05.519> Aussie<00:01:05.790> careers<00:01:06.030> being<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.390> real

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
feel like my Aussie careers being a real

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.810 
feel like my Aussie careers being a real
roller<00:01:06.810> coaster<00:01:06.930> yes<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.159> super

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
roller coaster yes I was super

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.490 
roller coaster yes I was super
privileged<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.450> made<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:09.869> 18<00:01:10.260> but

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
privileged to have made it at 18 but

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.870 
privileged to have made it at 18 but
then<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.770> know<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> got<00:01:11.220> dropped<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.670> then<00:01:11.729> got

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
then you know I got dropped and then got

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.219 
then you know I got dropped and then got
back<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.540> dropped<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.110> got

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
back here and then got dropped and got

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.719 
back here and then got dropped and got
back<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.710> had<00:01:13.890> injuries<00:01:14.250> along<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> way

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
back in and had injuries along the way

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
back in and had injuries along the way
and<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.540> certainly<00:01:16.080> hasn't<00:01:16.259> been<00:01:16.409> smooth

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and it certainly hasn't been smooth

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.190 
and it certainly hasn't been smooth
sailing<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:18.119> probably<00:01:18.450> been<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.960> times

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
sailing but it's probably been the times

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.469 
sailing but it's probably been the times
where<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.590> don't<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> great<00:01:21.030> time<00:01:21.240> so

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
where you don't have the great time so

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.820 
where you don't have the great time so
when<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.720> are<00:01:21.869> dropped<00:01:22.200> from<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> team<00:01:22.619> or

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
when you are dropped from the team or

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.289 
when you are dropped from the team or
whatever<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.220> makes<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.580> fight<00:01:23.759> harder<00:01:24.180> and

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
whatever that makes you fight harder and

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.390 
whatever that makes you fight harder and
makes<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.540> work<00:01:24.689> harder<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.259> kind<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.189> really

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
makes you work harder and kind of really

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.950 
makes you work harder and kind of really
taught<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:26.820> about<00:01:26.909> what<00:01:27.210> an<00:01:27.270> athlete<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.840> was

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
taught me about what an athlete it was

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.170 
taught me about what an athlete it was
actually<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.280> means<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.060> have

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
actually what it means and what you have

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.670 
actually what it means and what you have
to<00:01:30.210> do<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.570> actually<00:01:30.900> stay<00:01:31.140> there<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.470> top

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
to do to actually stay there at the top

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.859 
to do to actually stay there at the top

see it as teaching me so much more than

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.940 
see it as teaching me so much more than
what<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.170> taught<00:01:37.380> me<00:01:37.500> about<00:01:37.590> nipple<00:01:38.930> in<00:01:39.950> 2010

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
games like that was pretty hard at the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.149 
games like that was pretty hard at the
time<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.390> was<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.079> could<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.500> retired<00:01:46.829> quite

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
time I was I could have retired quite

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.429 
time I was I could have retired quite
easily<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.520> was<00:01:47.759> 28<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.540> I'd<00:01:48.630> had<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.140> good

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
easily I was 28 and I'd had a good

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.310 
easily I was 28 and I'd had a good
enough<00:01:49.530> career<00:01:50.030> but<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.899> kind<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.170> have

enough career but you just kind of have

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.499 
enough career but you just kind of have
that<00:01:52.350> burning<00:01:53.310> desire<00:01:53.579> inside<00:01:54.119> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
that burning desire inside that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
and you just know you're not done and I

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.499 
and you just know you're not done and I
just<00:01:58.950> surrounded<00:01:59.430> myself<00:01:59.549> with<00:01:59.820> great<00:02:00.360> people

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
just surrounded myself with great people

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.899 
just surrounded myself with great people
who<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:02.009> helped<00:02:02.219> me<00:02:02.250> get<00:02:02.460> back<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.610> track

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
who you know helped me get back on track

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.730 
who you know helped me get back on track
and<00:02:03.299> that's<00:02:03.420> when<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.990> evolved<00:02:04.680> into

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and that's when I kind of evolved into

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.639 
and that's when I kind of evolved into
more<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.189> goal<00:02:05.340> defense<00:02:05.490> than<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.360> goalkeeper

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
more of a goal defense than a goalkeeper

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.859 
more of a goal defense than a goalkeeper
you<00:02:07.649> know<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:08.220> getting<00:02:08.520> too<00:02:09.360> short<00:02:09.690> almost

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
you know I was getting too short almost

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.570 
you know I was getting too short almost
to<00:02:10.229> be<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> goalkeeper<00:02:10.619> because<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.370> all<00:02:11.489> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
to be a goalkeeper because of all the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.930 
to be a goalkeeper because of all the
mess

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
mess

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.150 
mess
shooters<00:02:12.300> out<00:02:12.420> there<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.650> playing<00:02:13.980> goal

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
shooters out there and so playing goal

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.890 
shooters out there and so playing goal
defense<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.820> loved<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.540> because<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.750> had<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
defense I loved it because I had to

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.240 
defense I loved it because I had to
train<00:02:16.200> differently<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.650> played<00:02:17.070> on<00:02:17.220> different

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
train differently I played on different

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.400 
train differently I played on different
players<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.940> if<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.660> really<00:02:19.020> kick-started

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
players and if that really kick-started

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:31.170 
players and if that really kick-started
my<00:02:19.800> career<00:02:20.190> again

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.780 

I<00:02:31.650> think<00:02:32.650> on<00:02:32.799> four<00:02:33.099> everyone<00:02:33.549> would<00:02:33.670> agree

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
I think on four everyone would agree

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.119 
I think on four everyone would agree
it's<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:34.989> much<00:02:35.200> more<00:02:35.349> physical<00:02:35.859> than<00:02:35.890> it's

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
it's so much more physical than it's

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.270 
it's so much more physical than it's
ever<00:02:36.310> been<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:38.200> love<00:02:38.409> that<00:02:38.590> as<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.739> defender

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
ever been and I love that as a defender

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.490 
ever been and I love that as a defender
I<00:02:39.640> think<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.480> long<00:02:40.719> you<00:02:40.989> just<00:02:41.170> want<00:02:41.319> to<00:02:41.349> be<00:02:41.439> able

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
I think so long you just want to be able

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.929 
I think so long you just want to be able
to<00:02:41.590> contest<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.219> compete<00:02:42.519> for<00:02:42.549> a<00:02:42.730> ball<00:02:42.909> and

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
to contest and compete for a ball and

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.599 
to contest and compete for a ball and
not<00:02:43.269> be<00:02:43.390> out<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.629> play<00:02:43.750> all<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.019> time<00:02:44.609> whereas

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
not be out of play all the time whereas

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.140 
not be out of play all the time whereas
now<00:02:45.819> it's<00:02:46.299> just<00:02:47.170> game<00:02:47.409> on<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.400> know<00:02:48.519> as<00:02:48.849> long

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
now it's just game on you know as long

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.209 
now it's just game on you know as long
as<00:02:49.209> it<00:02:49.510> looks<00:02:49.689> like<00:02:49.780> you're<00:02:50.019> both<00:02:50.219> evenly

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:51.219 
as it looks like you're both evenly

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.250 
as it looks like you're both evenly
contesting<00:02:51.939> it<00:02:52.060> then<00:02:52.329> anything<00:02:52.689> you<00:02:53.019> get<00:02:53.079> away

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
contesting it then anything you get away

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.559 
contesting it then anything you get away
with<00:02:53.409> anything<00:02:53.639> it's<00:02:54.639> tough<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.269> you've<00:02:55.420> got

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
with anything it's tough and you've got

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.890 
with anything it's tough and you've got
to<00:02:55.659> be<00:02:55.719> strong<00:02:56.139> I<00:02:56.560> love<00:02:57.189> how<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:58.000> don't<00:02:58.719> know<00:02:58.810> if

the New Zealand girls created it but I

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.220
