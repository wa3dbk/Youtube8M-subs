00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.550
 oh loves and are ready to fall 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.880
 In the party I'm super super prepared. 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.500
 anxious I love carnival and everything and it arrives 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.750
 the weekend she goes to the end of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.960
 week now I have prepared for you a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.500
 makeup and also some junk hair to 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.180
 You give and it does not work. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.790
 so in that voice people lose a lot 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.710
 very glitter very colorful very everything 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.960
 but I decided to do one more thing 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.420
 so basic what I would wear at the carnival 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.880
 and I did not make a more pink look an old 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.010
 and have some little bits here a little bit 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.990
 blue I think it looks pretty cute 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.750
 I hope that you really like and 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.820
 I can not even do this 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.250
 here because you do not know carnival no 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.020
 How's your hair hanging loose? 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.480
 heat is much more here in the river of 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.310
 January so I prepared something as soon as 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.700
 people would use it good I hope you like it 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.610
 and although it checked to get started I 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.729
 I made a side tail and opened the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.830
 half on him and on his fingers and rolled 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.229
 part of the tail so that no one stays 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.720
 releasing and passing it all through that 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.479
 there how you can see and 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.190
 It looks like this is a really cool hairstyle but 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.200
 I wanted to implement a little more 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.030
 it would be a satin ribbon I passed through 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.420
 inside the rubber band I had 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.310
 I learned a lot, and he was like that. 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.620
 video hair in two parts a ribbon of 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.930
 satin for each part is and now the 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.290
 People take a little ribbon behind a 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.380
 little ribbon a lock of hair right back and 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.049
 pass to the other side doing this 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.650
 and moved to the washing part. 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.330
 hair 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.820
 Now I'm going to do the same thing as the other. 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.750
 I'm going to pick up a back marching side . 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.020
 look and I'll go through that other part 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.750
 of hair forming an x ​​in so 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.909
 hair and we're doing it in 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.280
 all the hair takes much of stir 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.530
 from one side to another 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.450
 and pick up the china on the other side. 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.060
 and bring it here try to involve all 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.870
 Sometimes the tape goes through what goes 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.870
 look very handsome 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.570
 arrives on the final stretch already gives you 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.410
 to see how the tape appears on the 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.840
 hair right 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.300
 you people have time to spend 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.100
 Marching Band tries to bring the tape together 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.500
 just like doing now 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.950
 I spent little ribbon together with the city 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.950
 hair 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.670
 now it 's just a bottle the little one 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.800
 tip and your hair is ready and going. 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.320
 practice in a way that will not 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.210
 I walk and you will feel super comfortable. 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.300
 now we go to the makeup part 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.130
 Let's go to start makeup. 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.750
 I put this crepe tape to leave the 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.510
 well-marked makeup 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.370
 take the light proof jumbo white and 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.010
 I'll go through every eyelid you can call 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.470
 who act more alive is this palette of 96 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.900
 colors I got a roll of pink and 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.510
 glued to his collar to the makeup to 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.060
 shadow on entire eyelid 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.940
 now with that tone of pink half pulled 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.940
 for a purple I'll make ours with fu 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.300
 the same palette I took that tone of 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.310
 pink that I love too and I applied for 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.410
 that rose that we had already 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.410
 applied and a little bit over the top too 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.080
 This rose is so ruthful. 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.090
 stronger purple I'll choose a little 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.790
 outer corner of the eye we will 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.680
 passing by smoking until you see how he 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.270
 It's going to be dark in the palette. 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.250
 Diamond I took that shade of white 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.230
 to light the little corner of the tear 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.800
 so I spent a lot that he did not to the 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.350
 bitter we returned with the palette 96 colors 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.930
 light up the eyebrow now I'm going to use 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.050
 liquid eyeliner that has no mark I 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.870
 thus these lines bought from 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.030
 boardwalk tastes cheap and I 'm 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.470
 worshiping him so you enjoy and do 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:37.350
 a pull of garching this crepe tape 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.630
 besides helping us in the shade to stay 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.750
 very well, it helps a lot in the 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.110
 outlined then I took now I passed pencil 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.960
 avon black across the movable eyelid and 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.420
 I will also apply this tone of blue one 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.510
 or see of water I do not know 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.910
 with this bevelled episode beneath the 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.860
 Now I'm going to get this 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.380
 I've already told a drama and these 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.930
 pebbles that are for June and I'll paste 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.270
 in the corner of the tear and also in the 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.760
 outside corner to pass victory 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.160
 followed in powder form. 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.990
 He steals color. It 's beautiful and I applied. 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.990
 in all makeup with the same finger 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.070
 eyelash mascara I'll wear this one from here 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.410
 says berenice this makeup asks eyelashes 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.330
 but I did not have glue here 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.520
 at home but if you put it will stay 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.100
 Well, that's pretty lipstick to Paris. 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.370
 daniks and there I think it was cute 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.470
 with that makeup and a blush I'm 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.680
 using this very cheap one that is 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.680
 model in conference 03 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.249

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:51.399
 of heart that you have liked not 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:53.599
