00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.150 
another six hours I'm not going to do
another<00:04:17.450> six<00:04:17.720> hours<00:04:17.900> but<00:04:18.320> goddamn<00:04:18.740> it<00:04:18.800> is<00:04:19.040> it

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
another six hours but goddamn it is it

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
another six hours but goddamn it is it
worth<00:04:19.310> it

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
worth it

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.110 
worth it
