00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
will be crucial I think more weight will

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
will be crucial I think more weight will
be<00:01:09.750> put<00:01:09.929> on<00:01:10.080> those<00:01:10.320> as<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.070> said<00:01:11.250> before<00:01:11.280> because

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
be put on those as I said before because

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.120 
be put on those as I said before because
it's<00:01:11.970> live<00:01:12.479> reps<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.289> teen<00:01:13.530> said<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
practice part will be important but I

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.570 
practice part will be important but I

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
think it's safer to say that o yer will

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.389
