hi<00:00:07.970> i'm<00:00:08.149> matt<00:00:08.389> from<00:00:08.420> espares<00:00:08.660> in<00:00:09.170> this<00:00:09.620> video

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
hi i'm matt from espares in this video

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.619 
hi i'm matt from espares in this video
i'm<00:00:10.400> gonna<00:00:10.610> show<00:00:10.670> you<00:00:10.850> how<00:00:10.969> a<00:00:11.000> microwave<00:00:11.510> oven

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:11.629 
i'm gonna show you how a microwave oven

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.070 
i'm gonna show you how a microwave oven
works<00:00:12.309> so<00:00:13.309> what<00:00:13.459> are<00:00:13.639> microwaves<00:00:14.359> well

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
works so what are microwaves well

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.840 
works so what are microwaves well
they're<00:00:15.260> just<00:00:15.410> a<00:00:15.500> form<00:00:15.740> of<00:00:15.830> energy<00:00:16.010> that<00:00:16.400> move

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
they're just a form of energy that move

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.269 
they're just a form of energy that move
in<00:00:17.060> a<00:00:17.119> wave-like<00:00:17.390> way<00:00:17.930> much<00:00:18.680> like<00:00:18.920> visible

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
in a wave-like way much like visible

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.679 
in a wave-like way much like visible
light<00:00:19.400> let's<00:00:20.269> have<00:00:20.359> a<00:00:20.390> look<00:00:20.510> at<00:00:20.600> the

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
light let's have a look at the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.159 
light let's have a look at the
electromagnetic<00:00:21.050> spectrum<00:00:22.900> it's<00:00:23.900> visible

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
electromagnetic spectrum it's visible

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.220 
electromagnetic spectrum it's visible
light<00:00:24.470> right<00:00:25.099> in<00:00:25.130> the<00:00:25.249> middle<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:25.669> as<00:00:26.659> we<00:00:27.050> move

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
light right in the middle and as we move

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.810 
light right in the middle and as we move
this<00:00:27.409> way<00:00:27.650> along<00:00:27.859> the<00:00:28.009> spectrum<00:00:28.460> you<00:00:28.489> can<00:00:28.669> see

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
this way along the spectrum you can see

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.729 
this way along the spectrum you can see
that<00:00:28.939> wavelengths<00:00:29.480> get<00:00:29.630> longer<00:00:29.689> and<00:00:30.439> longer

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:30.739 
that wavelengths get longer and longer

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.640 
that wavelengths get longer and longer
and<00:00:31.189> our<00:00:31.999> microwaves<00:00:32.540> are<00:00:32.720> here<00:00:32.960> just<00:00:33.380> between

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
and our microwaves are here just between

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.940 
and our microwaves are here just between
infrared<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:34.610> radio<00:00:35.540> waves<00:00:35.890> now<00:00:36.890> the

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
infrared and radio waves now the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.790 
infrared and radio waves now the
microwaves<00:00:37.340> that<00:00:37.640> are<00:00:37.700> produced<00:00:38.060> by<00:00:38.800> ordinary

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
microwaves that are produced by ordinary

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.980 
microwaves that are produced by ordinary
microwave<00:00:40.400> oven<00:00:40.730> have<00:00:41.300> just<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.840> right

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:41.990 
microwave oven have just the right

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.810 
microwave oven have just the right
wavelength<00:00:42.380> to<00:00:43.280> be<00:00:43.400> absorbed<00:00:43.970> by<00:00:44.300> water<00:00:44.720> and

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
wavelength to be absorbed by water and

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.450 
wavelength to be absorbed by water and
foods<00:00:46.820> like<00:00:47.090> potatoes<00:00:47.870> are<00:00:48.140> full<00:00:48.800> of<00:00:49.010> water

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
foods like potatoes are full of water

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.150 
foods like potatoes are full of water
now<00:00:50.300> imagine<00:00:50.690> for<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:50.840> second<00:00:51.170> that<00:00:51.860> this<00:00:52.010> is

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
now imagine for a second that this is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.590 
now imagine for a second that this is
not<00:00:52.310> potato<00:00:52.670> it's<00:00:52.940> actually<00:00:53.240> a<00:00:53.270> water

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
not potato it's actually a water

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.900 
not potato it's actually a water
molecule<00:00:53.900> it's<00:00:54.800> polar<00:00:55.190> which<00:00:55.580> means<00:00:55.760> it's

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
molecule it's polar which means it's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.540

to popular belief microwaves don't heat

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.230 
to popular belief microwaves don't heat

but<00:01:20.990> that's<00:01:21.200> why<00:01:21.350> you'll<00:01:21.500> see<00:01:21.710> on<00:01:21.920> cooking

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
but that's why you'll see on cooking

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.490 
but that's why you'll see on cooking
instructions<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.909> often<00:01:23.150> tells<00:01:23.360> you<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:23.600> leave

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
instructions it often tells you to leave

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.290 
instructions it often tells you to leave
the<00:01:24.680> food<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.070> stand<00:01:25.370> for<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.640> little<00:01:25.729> while<00:01:26.060> and

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
the food to stand for a little while and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.170 
the food to stand for a little while and
that<00:01:26.570> allows<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.990> heat<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.400> penetrate<00:01:28.400> evenly

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
that allows the heat to penetrate evenly

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.040 
that allows the heat to penetrate evenly
throughout<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.720> food<00:01:30.100> now<00:01:31.479> microwaves<00:01:32.479> don't

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
throughout the food now microwaves don't

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.550 
throughout the food now microwaves don't
heat<00:01:33.620> up<00:01:33.729> plastics<00:01:34.729> or<00:01:35.000> glass<00:01:35.450> or<00:01:35.780> ceramics

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
heat up plastics or glass or ceramics

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.190 
heat up plastics or glass or ceramics
that's<00:01:37.190> because<00:01:37.490> their<00:01:37.700> molecules<00:01:37.909> are<00:01:38.510> not

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
that's because their molecules are not

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.649 
that's because their molecules are not
polar<00:01:39.680> if<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.549> ball<00:01:40.700> does<00:01:40.909> get<00:01:41.120> hot<00:01:41.360> is

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
polar if the ball does get hot is

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.170 
polar if the ball does get hot is
through<00:01:42.140> conduction<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:42.890> heat<00:01:42.950> from<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:43.940> food

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
through conduction of heat from the food

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.770 
through conduction of heat from the food
itself<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.040> I'm<00:01:46.040> sure<00:01:46.400> you<00:01:46.580> know<00:01:46.610> not<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.540> put

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
itself and I'm sure you know not to put

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.500 
itself and I'm sure you know not to put
metal<00:01:48.290> objects<00:01:48.710> into<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.460> microwave<00:01:49.880> that's

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
metal objects into the microwave that's

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.080 
metal objects into the microwave that's
because<00:01:50.750> many<00:01:51.140> metals<00:01:51.590> reflect<00:01:52.400> microwaves

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
because many metals reflect microwaves

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.690 
because many metals reflect microwaves
and<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.390> get<00:01:53.510> that<00:01:53.630> arcing<00:01:54.290> or<00:01:54.440> sparking

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
and you get that arcing or sparking

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.070 
and you get that arcing or sparking
that's<00:01:55.700> actually<00:01:56.060> dangerous<00:01:56.479> can<00:01:56.869> cause

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
that's actually dangerous can cause

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.830 
that's actually dangerous can cause
damage<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.680> microwave<00:01:58.070> oven<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:59.330> let's

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
damage to the microwave oven so let's

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.100 
damage to the microwave oven so let's
open<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.140> up<00:02:00.350> now<00:02:01.390> I'm<00:02:02.390> doing<00:02:02.630> something<00:02:02.900> that

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
open it up now I'm doing something that

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.490 
open it up now I'm doing something that
we<00:02:03.320> recommend<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:03.950> don't<00:02:04.159> do<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:06.080> you

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
we recommend you don't do and you

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.339 
we recommend you don't do and you
shouldn't<00:02:06.830> ever<00:02:07.330> take<00:02:08.330> off<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.840> outer<00:02:08.959> casing

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
shouldn't ever take off the outer casing

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.640 
shouldn't ever take off the outer casing
of<00:02:09.739> your<00:02:10.519> microwave<00:02:10.970> like<00:02:11.810> I'm<00:02:12.049> doing<00:02:12.409> you

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
of your microwave like I'm doing you

should only ever be done by a qualified
appliance<00:02:15.319> engineer<00:02:15.830> we've<00:02:16.040> got<00:02:16.130> high

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
appliance engineer we've got high

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.040 
appliance engineer we've got high
voltages<00:02:16.790> inside<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.360> can<00:02:17.450> potentially<00:02:17.690> be

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
voltages inside it can potentially be

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.420 
voltages inside it can potentially be
quite<00:02:18.319> dangerous

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
quite dangerous

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.759 
quite dangerous
and<00:02:19.969> I'm<00:02:20.569> doing<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.109> that<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.349> can<00:02:21.530> show

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
and I'm doing that so that I can show

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.250 
and I'm doing that so that I can show
you<00:02:21.829> the<00:02:22.129> flow<00:02:22.879> of<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.599> electrical<00:02:23.989> current

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
you the flow of the electrical current

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.170 
you the flow of the electrical current
through<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.250> microwave<00:02:25.760> obviously<00:02:26.060> I'm

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
through the microwave obviously I'm

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.690 
through the microwave obviously I'm
unplugged<00:02:26.689> from<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.959> mains<00:02:27.129> so<00:02:28.129> it<00:02:28.370> comes<00:02:28.549> in

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
unplugged from the mains so it comes in

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.330 
unplugged from the mains so it comes in
here<00:02:29.030> into<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:29.510> little<00:02:30.200> board<00:02:30.829> here<00:02:30.950> where

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
here into this little board here where

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.039 
here into this little board here where
we've<00:02:31.430> got<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.609> fuse<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.450> we've<00:02:32.569> got<00:02:32.689> a<00:02:32.719> filter

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
we've got a fuse and we've got a filter

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.140 
we've got a fuse and we've got a filter
and<00:02:33.439> that<00:02:33.590> just<00:02:33.799> cleans<00:02:34.159> any<00:02:34.430> noise<00:02:34.700> from<00:02:35.030> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
and that just cleans any noise from the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.319 
and that just cleans any noise from the
electrical<00:02:35.510> signal<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.819> comes<00:02:37.819> across<00:02:38.060> to

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
electrical signal and comes across to

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.539 
electrical signal and comes across to
this<00:02:38.959> here<00:02:39.230> which<00:02:39.349> is<00:02:39.469> a<00:02:39.500> thermal<00:02:39.920> cutouts

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
this here which is a thermal cutouts

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.879 
this here which is a thermal cutouts
which<00:02:40.959> just<00:02:41.959> means<00:02:42.079> if<00:02:42.170> everything's<00:02:42.500> getting

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:42.889 
which just means if everything's getting

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.819 
which just means if everything's getting
too<00:02:43.700> hot<00:02:43.969> inside<00:02:44.239> it'll<00:02:45.049> cut<00:02:45.469> the<00:02:45.590> power

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
too hot inside it'll cut the power

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.360 
too hot inside it'll cut the power
before<00:02:46.400> things<00:02:46.819> start<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.180> catch<00:02:47.389> fire<00:02:48.370> then

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
before things start to catch fire then

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.640 
before things start to catch fire then
comes<00:02:49.639> down<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:50.329> a<00:02:50.569> little<00:02:51.019> micro<00:02:51.379> switch

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
comes down to a little micro switch

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.170 
comes down to a little micro switch
which<00:02:52.459> if<00:02:52.939> I<00:02:53.090> open<00:02:53.359> and<00:02:53.450> close<00:02:53.629> the<00:02:53.810> door

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
which if I open and close the door

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.240 
which if I open and close the door
hopefully<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.239> can<00:02:56.359> see<00:02:56.599> that<00:02:57.159> it's<00:02:58.159> just

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
hopefully you can see that it's just

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.270 
hopefully you can see that it's just
again<00:02:59.090> cutting<00:02:59.389> the<00:02:59.569> current<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.950> stop<00:03:01.159> the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
again cutting the current to stop the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.599 
again cutting the current to stop the
microwaves<00:03:01.760> when<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.599> door<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.810> open<00:03:03.609> that

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
microwaves when the door is open that

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.720 
microwaves when the door is open that
also<00:03:04.879> comes<00:03:05.120> up<00:03:05.299> to<00:03:05.419> a<00:03:05.450> bulb<00:03:05.719> here<00:03:06.519> so<00:03:07.519> we<00:03:07.579> can

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
also comes up to a bulb here so we can

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.149 
also comes up to a bulb here so we can
see<00:03:07.879> what<00:03:08.030> we're<00:03:08.150> doing<00:03:08.389> inside<00:03:08.719> and<00:03:09.079> down<00:03:09.980> to

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
see what we're doing inside and down to

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.199 
see what we're doing inside and down to

down to this big lump at the bottom here
which<00:03:24.919> is<00:03:25.069> a<00:03:25.099> transformer<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.359> that's<00:03:26.720> just

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
which is a transformer and that's just

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.890 
which is a transformer and that's just
jumping<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.739> voltage<00:03:28.280> up<00:03:28.489> from<00:03:28.729> ordinary<00:03:28.940> 240

motor is right in the middle underneath

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.240 
motor is right in the middle underneath
here<00:04:47.360> and<00:04:47.629> that's<00:04:48.289> just<00:04:48.560> what<00:04:48.710> turns<00:04:49.009> the

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
here and that's just what turns the

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.330 
here and that's just what turns the
plate<00:04:49.520> round<00:04:49.900> whilst<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.139> microwave<00:04:51.620> is<00:04:51.889> on

and foodies cook up and plate is very

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:00.459 
and foodies cook up and plate is very
often<00:04:58.969> broken<00:04:59.360> it's<00:04:59.659> the<00:04:59.840> most<00:05:00.050> commonly

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
often broken it's the most commonly

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:04.330 
often broken it's the most commonly
replaced<00:05:00.770> spare<00:05:01.400> part<00:05:01.699> on<00:05:01.909> a<00:05:01.969> microwave<00:05:03.340> so

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
replaced spare part on a microwave so

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.399 
replaced spare part on a microwave so
