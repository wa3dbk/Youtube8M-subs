00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.550 
this installed a very common issue on
aftermarket<00:03:43.730> wheels<00:03:44.180> they<00:03:44.900> don't<00:03:45.080> sit<00:03:45.350> down

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
aftermarket wheels they don't sit down

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.430 
aftermarket wheels they don't sit down
on<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.280> column<00:03:46.610> all<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.790> way<00:03:47.019> so<00:03:48.019> you<00:03:48.080> end<00:03:48.350> up

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
on the column all the way so you end up

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.660 
on the column all the way so you end up
with<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.650> little<00:03:48.739> more<00:03:48.920> gap<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:49.519> you're

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
with a little more gap and you're

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.759 
with a little more gap and you're
anticipating<00:03:50.000> well<00:03:50.900> they<00:03:51.080> fix<00:03:51.380> that<00:03:51.590> by

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
anticipating well they fix that by

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.350 
anticipating well they fix that by
putting<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.160> little<00:03:52.310> set<00:03:52.670> screw<00:03:52.700> in<00:03:53.060> here<00:03:53.090> with

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
putting a little set screw in here with

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.150 
putting a little set screw in here with
an<00:03:53.480> adjustable<00:03:53.900> collar<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:54.680> this<00:03:54.769> will<00:03:54.920> slide

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
an adjustable collar so this will slide

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.979 
an adjustable collar so this will slide
down<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.670> meet<00:03:55.910> your<00:03:56.120> column<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.630> take<00:03:56.810> up

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
down to meet your column and take up

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.479 
down to meet your column and take up
that<00:03:57.140> gap<00:03:57.350> so<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.650> won't<00:03:57.829> see<00:03:58.100> behind<00:03:58.400> the

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
that gap so you won't see behind the

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.490 
that gap so you won't see behind the
wheel

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500
