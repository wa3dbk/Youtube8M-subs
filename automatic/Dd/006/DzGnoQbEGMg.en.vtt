fiber<00:01:44.220> along<00:01:44.970> with<00:01:45.270> paper<00:01:45.570> fiber<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.110> we've

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
fiber along with paper fiber and we've

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.980 
fiber along with paper fiber and we've
blended<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.700> new<00:01:47.850> ingredient<00:01:48.479> which<00:01:48.750> is

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
blended in a new ingredient which is

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.740 
blended in a new ingredient which is
rapidly<00:01:49.229> renewable<00:01:49.700> bamboo<00:01:50.700> fiber<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.479> then

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
rapidly renewable bamboo fiber and then

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.210 
rapidly renewable bamboo fiber and then
what<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.170> with<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.409> basically<00:01:53.070> these

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
what do you do with it basically these

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.520 
what do you do with it basically these
fibers<00:01:53.610> are<00:01:53.729> brought<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> paper<00:01:54.990> mill<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
fibers are brought to a paper mill and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.399 
fibers are brought to a paper mill and
they<00:01:55.710> make<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.960> my<00:01:57.960> doesn't<00:01:58.259> smell

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
they make this this my doesn't smell

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.810 
they make this this my doesn't smell
like<00:01:58.469> anything<00:01:58.590> doesn't<00:01:59.189> have<00:01:59.280> any<00:01:59.430> smell<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
like anything doesn't have any smell to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.870 
like anything doesn't have any smell to
it<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.689> goes<00:02:00.869> from<00:02:01.110> this

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
it so it goes from this

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.730 
it so it goes from this
just<00:02:02.880> puree<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:04.410> make<00:02:04.590> these

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
just puree and then you make these

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.430 
just puree and then you make these
sheets<00:02:05.190> correct<00:02:05.940> great<00:02:06.300> big<00:02:06.540> roles<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
sheets correct great big roles of it the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.160 
sheets correct great big roles of it the
roles<00:02:07.650> are<00:02:07.980> as<00:02:08.160> big<00:02:08.490> as<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.729> Volkswagen<00:02:09.479> bug<00:02:09.690> so

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
roles are as big as a Volkswagen bug so

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.720 
roles are as big as a Volkswagen bug so
okay<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> want<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.770> see<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.979> next<00:02:11.130> step<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.670> this

curing it correct and it is partial it's
a<00:03:47.200> partial<00:03:47.590> cure<00:03:47.800> it's<00:03:48.010> not<00:03:48.130> going<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.310> be<00:03:48.400> a

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
a partial cure it's not going to be a

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.370 
a partial cure it's not going to be a
hundred<00:03:48.550> percent<00:03:48.700> cured<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.660> when<00:03:50.260> it

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
hundred percent cured so that when it

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.930 
hundred percent cured so that when it
gets<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:50.920> next<00:03:51.160> phase<00:03:51.370> where<00:03:51.670> we<00:03:51.790> actually

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
gets to the next phase where we actually

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.510 
gets to the next phase where we actually
pressing<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.600> laminate<00:03:52.990> then<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:54.160> this

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
pressing the laminate then the this

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.240 
pressing the laminate then the this
resin<00:03:55.030> will<00:03:55.180> actually<00:03:55.630> flow<00:03:56.020> and<00:03:56.560> consolidate

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
resin will actually flow and consolidate

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.460 
resin will actually flow and consolidate
much<00:03:57.910> like<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.150> glue<00:03:58.450> in<00:03:58.840> order<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.230> keep

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
much like a glue in order to keep

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.830 
much like a glue in order to keep
develop<00:03:59.770> together<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.190> see

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.430 

and<00:04:05.170> we<00:04:05.379> can<00:04:05.620> trim<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.720> work<00:04:07.720> just<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.019> get<00:04:08.170> one

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
and we can trim it work just to get one

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.920 
and we can trim it work just to get one
sheet<00:04:08.980> of<00:04:09.010> this<00:04:09.340> so<00:04:10.090> how<00:04:10.239> many<00:04:10.300> of<00:04:10.480> these<00:04:10.629> being

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
sheet of this so how many of these being

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.140 
sheet of this so how many of these being
for<00:04:11.410> one<00:04:11.709> piece<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.310> countertop<00:04:12.670> yeah<00:04:13.030> its

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150
