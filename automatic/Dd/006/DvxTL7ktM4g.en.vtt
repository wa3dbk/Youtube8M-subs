inside<00:01:01.900> the<00:01:02.080> box<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:03.550> have<00:01:03.670> got<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:03.970> cable<00:01:04.269> which

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
inside the box we have got a cable which

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.219 
inside the box we have got a cable which
is<00:01:05.110> a<00:01:05.140> USB<00:01:05.440> cable<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.930> consider

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
is a USB cable and you consider

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.840 
is a USB cable and you consider
connected<00:01:08.680> air<00:01:08.800> which<00:01:08.979> goes<00:01:09.220> into<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.610> actual

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
connected air which goes into the actual

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.600 
connected air which goes into the actual
device<00:01:10.120> here<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.630> then<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:12.250> meter

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
device here and then the meter

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.370 
device here and then the meter
it's<00:01:12.760> about<00:01:12.970> meter<00:01:13.270> long<00:01:13.600> in<00:01:13.750> length<00:01:13.960> this

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
it's about meter long in length this

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.190 
it's about meter long in length this
cable<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.640> it<00:01:15.760> does<00:01:15.940> charge<00:01:16.330> by<00:01:16.690> plugging<00:01:16.960> it

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
cable and it does charge by plugging it

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.070 
cable and it does charge by plugging it
straight<00:01:17.530> into<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:18.390> power<00:01:19.390> adapter<00:01:19.420> into<00:01:19.990> the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
straight into the power adapter into the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.810 
straight into the power adapter into the
wall<00:01:20.260> or<00:01:20.530> you<00:01:20.799> can<00:01:20.979> charge<00:01:21.250> it<00:01:21.400> from<00:01:21.670> a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
wall or you can charge it from a

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.370 
wall or you can charge it from a
computer<00:01:22.090> it's<00:01:22.300> not<00:01:22.330> gold-plated<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.110> actual

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
computer it's not gold-plated the actual

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.880 
computer it's not gold-plated the actual
USB<00:01:23.770> but<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.070> doesn't<00:01:24.340> really<00:01:24.430> matter<00:01:24.670> really

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
USB but it doesn't really matter really

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.110 
USB but it doesn't really matter really
let's<00:01:26.890> have<00:01:26.980> a<00:01:27.040> look<00:01:27.160> at<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.310> actual<00:01:27.400> power

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
let's have a look at the actual power

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.530 
let's have a look at the actual power
adapter<00:01:28.480> here<00:01:28.630> this<00:01:28.840> is<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.080> actual<00:01:29.350> 2<00:01:30.070> pin

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
adapter here this is the actual 2 pin

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.910 
adapter here this is the actual 2 pin
part<00:01:31.540> here<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:31.930> plugs<00:01:32.170> into<00:01:32.440> this<00:01:32.710> little

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
part here that plugs into this little

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.720 
part here that plugs into this little
device<00:01:33.250> like<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.770> just<00:01:36.040> snap<00:01:36.220> that<00:01:36.370> in<00:01:36.520> and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
device like so just snap that in and

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.360 
device like so just snap that in and
then<00:01:37.180> you<00:01:37.300> plug<00:01:37.540> your<00:01:37.570> USB<00:01:37.980> into<00:01:38.980> there<00:01:39.190> and

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
then you plug your USB into there and

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.630 
then you plug your USB into there and
you<00:01:39.730> can<00:01:39.910> charge<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:40.300> up<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.680> wall<00:01:41.860> or<00:01:42.130> you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
you can charge it up in the wall or you

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.980 
you can charge it up in the wall or you
can<00:01:42.760> actually<00:01:43.060> charge<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.450> up<00:01:43.570> from<00:01:43.840> the

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
can actually charge it up from the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.900 
can actually charge it up from the
computer<00:01:44.110> itself<00:01:44.710> it<00:01:44.950> by<00:01:45.130> plugging<00:01:45.400> straight

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
computer itself it by plugging straight

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.970 
computer itself it by plugging straight
into<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.180> USB

the<00:05:01.779> website<00:05:02.169> into<00:05:02.499> display<00:05:03.009> because<00:05:03.550> it

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
the website into display because it

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.999 
the website into display because it
doesn't<00:05:04.060> auto<00:05:04.270> size<00:05:04.749> that<00:05:05.050> will<00:05:05.229> bother<00:05:05.830> than

that it is a budget tab and I think it's

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.929 
that it is a budget tab and I think it's
value<00:05:08.469> for<00:05:08.650> money<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.520> think<00:05:09.610> we're<00:05:09.849> gonna
