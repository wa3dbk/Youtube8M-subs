00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
working probably well last week was the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.860 
working probably well last week was the
finishing<00:02:40.010> like<00:02:41.000> some<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.480> stuff<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.840> I

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
finishing like some of the stuff that I

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.470 
finishing like some of the stuff that I
did<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.709> that<00:02:43.489> wasn't<00:02:43.790> wasn't<00:02:44.390> good

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
did and and that wasn't wasn't good

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.430 
did and and that wasn't wasn't good
enough<00:02:44.510> we<00:02:44.780> probably<00:02:44.959> could<00:02:45.170> have<00:02:45.200> put<00:02:45.380> the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
enough we probably could have put the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.009 
enough we probably could have put the
game<00:02:45.620> away<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:46.220> lot<00:02:47.150> earlier<00:02:47.450> work<00:02:47.569> or<00:02:47.750> we<00:02:47.840> could

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
game away a lot earlier work or we could

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.360 
game away a lot earlier work or we could
have<00:02:48.049> scored<00:02:48.319> a<00:02:48.380> few<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.739> first<00:02:48.980> half<00:02:49.160> at

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
have scored a few in the first half at

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.440 
have scored a few in the first half at
least<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:49.730> they<00:02:49.819> would<00:02:49.940> have<00:02:50.030> helped<00:02:50.209> us<00:02:50.299> out

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
least and they would have helped us out

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.340 
least and they would have helped us out
a<00:02:50.510> bit<00:02:50.600> oh<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:52.760> just<00:02:52.819> I<00:02:53.330> just<00:02:53.510> think<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.989> few<00:02:54.019> more

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
a bit oh I just I just think a few more

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.199 
a bit oh I just I just think a few more
games<00:02:54.500> then<00:02:54.799> it'll<00:02:55.069> it'll<00:02:55.370> probably<00:02:55.670> click<00:02:56.000> by

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
games then it'll it'll probably click by

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.729

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.740 
seemed good luck in in the camp this
week<00:03:17.000> after<00:03:17.180> another<00:03:17.900> defeat<00:03:18.230> no<00:03:19.160> it's<00:03:19.340> fine

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
week after another defeat no it's fine

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.420 
week after another defeat no it's fine
because<00:03:20.750> we're<00:03:21.049> gradually<00:03:21.799> playing<00:03:22.160> better

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
because we're gradually playing better

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.220 
because we're gradually playing better
and<00:03:22.519> we're<00:03:22.760> getting<00:03:23.000> better<00:03:23.090> we're<00:03:23.959> happy

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
and we're getting better we're happy

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.930 
and we're getting better we're happy
wherever<00:03:24.410> we<00:03:24.650> are<00:03:24.680> we're<00:03:25.100> disappointed<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.820> be

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
wherever we are we're disappointed to be

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.699 
wherever we are we're disappointed to be
on<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.150> bottom<00:03:26.269> of<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.570> league<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:26.959> not

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
on the bottom of the league and not

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.920 
on the bottom of the league and not
winning<00:03:27.920> games<00:03:28.220> but<00:03:28.630> we<00:03:29.630> believe<00:03:29.900> that

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
winning games but we believe that

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.360 
winning games but we believe that
that'll<00:03:30.350> come<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.769> hopefully<00:03:30.890> it'll<00:03:31.220> come

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
that'll come and hopefully it'll come

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.970 
that'll come and hopefully it'll come

you're always playing better and it's

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.710 
you're always playing better and it's
we're<00:03:52.610> just<00:03:52.790> like<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.209> said<00:03:53.390> we're<00:03:53.510> playing

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
we're just like I said we're playing

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.600 
we're just like I said we're playing
good<00:03:53.870> football<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.430> because<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.550> the

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
good football and because of the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.190 
good football and because of the
football<00:03:55.819> that<00:03:56.000> my<00:03:56.150> teammates<00:03:56.600> are<00:03:56.810> doing<00:03:57.020> it

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
football that my teammates are doing it

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.900 
football that my teammates are doing it
allows<00:03:57.590> me<00:03:57.800> to<00:03:57.830> get<00:03:58.010> in<00:03:58.069> a<00:03:58.160> lot<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.340> space<00:03:58.610> and

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
allows me to get in a lot of space and

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.570 
allows me to get in a lot of space and
that's<00:03:59.000> probably<00:03:59.390> why<00:04:00.130> I'm<00:04:01.130> doing<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.430> bit

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
that's probably why I'm doing a bit

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.190
