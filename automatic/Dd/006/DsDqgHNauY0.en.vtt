 challenges so the principle of the gold coast 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.930
 these are miniature patterns that one can 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.700
 enlarge to its measurements 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.379
 that is, it's a miniature of 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.420
 patterns we have a tape measure and a 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.440
 graduated scale which is completely 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.329
 different from the others 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.829
 a mathematical formula is adapted 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.559
 in our bosses and in the scale of 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.449
 graduation we will enlarge on lines 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.699
 where we have numbers and we will enlarge in 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.190
 makes the thumbnail on the measurements 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.530
 of each person while using the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.450
 same boss this cutting system 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.280
 for both novices and 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.860
 professionals allows us to create its 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.159
 custom patterns his calculation and without 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.659
 special knowledge our manual 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.909
 basic is recognized in relation to a 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.460
 child a school book already relative 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.020
 at the age of 8 I started to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.369
 start on the product since I see 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.770
 the my parents do to As 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.240
 at the age of four so it takes 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.380
 really that a notion to be able to the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 do it and I invite everyone to a 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.729
 to be able to realize it in power try 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.840
 of course so eight years and the departure if 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.970
 you have children on the contrary 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.950
 do not hesitate to show them the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.869
 moving our system because you in 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.369
 as an adult you will not have put the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.799
 points that the child will have already connected 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.509
 since a child visualizes the points 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.729
 very quickly compared to the cut 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.860
 of drawing this method is already used 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.590
 in over 90 countries like the states 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.470
 united japan brazil and post arica 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.730
 but without a public Guyana rather attentive 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.710
 was he conquered the very well 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.390
 click because before we dreaded 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.790
 to cut or bias badly cut in 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.360
 that now this something more 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.100
 easy 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.010
 I'm not used to doing 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.790
 sewing I begin Wednesday years with a 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.380
 sewing classes 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.480
 but I found the presentation very 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.400
 interesting me who took another 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.920
 method of listening to measure I find 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.690
 that it's ugly a lot easier the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.310
 gold cup is an alternative to 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.650
 standardized patterns sold in the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.870
 sewing stores a method that gets 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.870
 wants economic playful practice
