00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
project so you put it in there then it

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.350 
project so you put it in there then it
will<00:06:12.710> conform<00:06:13.130> takes<00:06:13.789> maybe<00:06:14.000> two<00:06:14.240> or<00:06:14.270> three

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
will conform takes maybe two or three

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.930

minutes drag the footage into the

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.270 
minutes drag the footage into the
timeline<00:06:17.180> and<00:06:17.630> then<00:06:18.169> what<00:06:18.410> I<00:06:18.440> do<00:06:18.560> is<00:06:18.680> to<00:06:18.979> sync

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
timeline and then what I do is to sync

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.580 
timeline and then what I do is to sync
it<00:06:19.370> up<00:06:19.520> you<00:06:20.180> have<00:06:20.300> to<00:06:20.449> match<00:06:20.630> the<00:06:21.050> audio<00:06:21.410> from

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
it up you have to match the audio from

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.240 
it up you have to match the audio from
the<00:06:21.680> GoPro<00:06:22.310> where<00:06:23.120> you<00:06:23.240> clap<00:06:23.830> to<00:06:24.830> the<00:06:24.860> audio

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
the GoPro where you clap to the audio

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.439 
the GoPro where you clap to the audio
from<00:06:25.880> your<00:06:26.120> microphone<00:06:27.280> so<00:06:28.280> you<00:06:28.449> pinpoint

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
from your microphone so you pinpoint

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.029 
from your microphone so you pinpoint
them<00:06:29.630> correctly<00:06:29.960> otherwise<00:06:30.199> a<00:06:30.410> video<00:06:30.770> it<00:06:30.949> will

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039
