00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.680 

I<00:04:00.599> think<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.349> hopefully<00:04:02.010> then<00:04:02.580> rather<00:04:02.849> slow

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
well it was an okay performance so just

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.150 
well it was an okay performance so just
no<00:04:40.880> fire<00:04:41.210> there<00:04:41.240> there<00:04:41.810> was<00:04:41.900> no<00:04:42.080> flame<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:42.740> she

Russian fans here cheering her on
wasn't<00:05:07.790> her<00:05:07.850> best<00:05:08.180> but<00:05:08.480> do<00:05:08.810> you<00:05:08.900> think<00:05:09.230> it's

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
wasn't her best but do you think it's

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.170 
wasn't her best but do you think it's
good<00:05:09.650> enough<00:05:09.890> two<00:05:10.130> tops<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:10.700> nice<00:05:10.940> he's<00:05:11.150> got

good enough two tops is nice he's got
the<00:05:11.540> lead<00:05:11.660> right<00:05:11.930> now

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.610 

now<00:05:15.700> her<00:05:15.850> second<00:05:16.240> move<00:05:16.420> in<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:17.020> competition

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
now her second move in the competition

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.740 
now her second move in the competition
was<00:05:17.740> this<00:05:17.860> triple<00:05:18.340> flip<00:05:18.580> look<00:05:19.060> at<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.300> turning

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
was this triple flip look at the turning

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.410 
was this triple flip look at the turning
edge<00:05:19.990> there<00:05:20.380> wow<00:05:20.800> it's<00:05:21.250> almost<00:05:21.520> to<00:05:21.910> an<00:05:22.000> outside

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
edge there wow it's almost to an outside

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.600 
edge there wow it's almost to an outside
edge<00:05:22.630> which<00:05:22.870> would<00:05:23.050> often<00:05:23.440> technically<00:05:24.160> make

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
edge which would often technically make

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.430 
edge which would often technically make
it<00:05:24.760> a<00:05:24.850> lutz<00:05:25.150> but<00:05:25.660> I'm<00:05:25.780> sure<00:05:25.990> that<00:05:26.170> won't<00:05:26.320> be

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
it a lutz but I'm sure that won't be

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.040 
it a lutz but I'm sure that won't be
noted<00:05:26.890> and<00:05:27.100> it<00:05:27.820> was<00:05:27.970> a<00:05:28.000> clean<00:05:28.300> edge<00:05:28.510> going<00:05:28.810> out

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
noted and it was a clean edge going out

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.770 
noted and it was a clean edge going out
and<00:05:29.290> then<00:05:29.710> there<00:05:29.890> was<00:05:30.010> this<00:05:30.190> triple<00:05:30.940> salchow<00:05:31.480> a

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
and then there was this triple salchow a

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.040 
and then there was this triple salchow a
position<00:05:32.350> which<00:05:33.180> gets<00:05:34.180> nice<00:05:34.420> height<00:05:34.720> good

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
position which gets nice height good

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.070 
position which gets nice height good
crossed<00:05:35.470> legs<00:05:35.920> and<00:05:36.220> as<00:05:37.060> you<00:05:37.120> see<00:05:37.660> it<00:05:37.750> we're

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
crossed legs and as you see it we're

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.700 
crossed legs and as you see it we're
seeing<00:05:38.440> her<00:05:38.770> coming<00:05:39.220> down<00:05:39.250> right<00:05:39.970> on<00:05:40.240> to<00:05:40.780> sort

how<00:05:56.050> about<00:05:56.260> you<00:05:56.410> do<00:05:56.530> you<00:05:56.590> think<00:05:56.650> it<00:05:56.860> was<00:05:56.980> good

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
how about you do you think it was good

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.860 
how about you do you think it was good
enough<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.820> tell<00:05:57.970> us<00:05:58.030> his<00:05:58.270> knee<00:05:58.450> who<00:05:58.570> has<00:05:58.690> the

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
enough to tell us his knee who has the

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.500 
enough to tell us his knee who has the
lead<00:05:59.050> well<00:05:59.830> you<00:06:00.100> know<00:06:00.310> I<00:06:00.580> think<00:06:00.700> for<00:06:01.210> me<00:06:01.360> it

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
lead well you know I think for me it

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.810 
lead well you know I think for me it
seems<00:06:01.720> like<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.530> most<00:06:02.890> important<00:06:03.490> thing<00:06:03.640> for

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
seems like the most important thing for

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.610 
seems like the most important thing for
us<00:06:03.940> to<00:06:03.970> get<00:06:04.450> through<00:06:04.660> the<00:06:04.810> program<00:06:05.020> to<00:06:05.440> have<00:06:05.560> a

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
us to get through the program to have a

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.670 
us to get through the program to have a
somewhat<00:06:06.460> clean<00:06:07.210> program<00:06:07.990> and<00:06:08.230> she<00:06:08.650> was

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
somewhat clean program and she was

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.280 
somewhat clean program and she was
concentrating<00:06:09.520> on<00:06:09.700> this<00:06:09.910> and<00:06:10.270> she<00:06:10.690> did<00:06:10.900> but

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
concentrating on this and she did but

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.260 
concentrating on this and she did but
definitely<00:06:11.860> I<00:06:11.890> was<00:06:12.250> missing<00:06:12.580> the<00:06:12.700> speed<00:06:12.940> in

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
definitely I was missing the speed in

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.770 
definitely I was missing the speed in
the<00:06:13.660> spins<00:06:13.990> and<00:06:14.290> in<00:06:14.920> her<00:06:15.100> skating<00:06:15.490> and<00:06:15.790> I

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
the spins and in her skating and I

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.990 
the spins and in her skating and I
thought<00:06:17.440> since<00:06:17.830> this<00:06:17.980> program<00:06:18.400> was<00:06:18.550> just<00:06:18.820> much

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
thought since this program was just much

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.290 
thought since this program was just much
better<00:06:20.190> all<00:06:21.190> right<00:06:21.370> but<00:06:21.580> I<00:06:21.610> can't<00:06:21.670> get<00:06:21.970> anyone

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
better all right but I can't get anyone

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.540 
better all right but I can't get anyone
to<00:06:22.510> give<00:06:22.660> me<00:06:22.810> a<00:06:22.840> concrete<00:06:23.110> answer<00:06:23.680> on<00:06:24.070> this<00:06:24.340> is

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
to give me a concrete answer on this is

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.360 
to give me a concrete answer on this is
knee<00:06:24.790> question<00:06:25.300> a<00:06:25.570> very<00:06:25.810> clear<00:06:26.650> answer<00:06:26.890> on

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
knee question a very clear answer on

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.790 
knee question a very clear answer on
that<00:06:27.400> I<00:06:27.760> think<00:06:28.090> that<00:06:28.300> Sydney<00:06:28.780> was<00:06:28.930> far<00:06:29.530> ahead

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
that I think that Sydney was far ahead

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.790 
that I think that Sydney was far ahead
of<00:06:30.280> Sokolova<00:06:31.030> in<00:06:31.180> this<00:06:31.450> performance<00:06:32.080> she<00:06:32.290> was

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
clean except for one fall

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.900 
clean except for one fall
she<00:06:35.110> had<00:06:35.290> wonderful<00:06:35.680> jumps<00:06:36.130> her<00:06:36.250> spins<00:06:36.670> were

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
she had wonderful jumps her spins were

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.090 
she had wonderful jumps her spins were
truly<00:06:37.240> magnificent<00:06:38.020> her<00:06:38.140> choreography<00:06:38.920> was

better her musical interpretation was

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.890 
better her musical interpretation was
better<00:06:41.440> and<00:06:41.680> it<00:06:42.040> was<00:06:42.130> first-rate

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
better and it was first-rate

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.920 
better and it was first-rate
all<00:06:44.770> right<00:06:44.950> that's<00:06:45.130> a<00:06:45.220> clear<00:06:45.460> answer<00:06:45.930> how

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
all right that's a clear answer how

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:47.670 
all right that's a clear answer how
