00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.450
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.220
 driver i do a tutorial again 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.730
 Today I want to show you how 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:20.080
 one at ls 13 respectively 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:24.489
 again at ls 11 the console is activated 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:29.470
 the console is in the game quasi lok 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:31.180
 So magath you can see in game what 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.370
 for example, the game is just a mistake 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.870
 power and you can also command as a couple 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.390
 which I use in another 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.510
 would like to explain the tutorial in more detail 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.550
 but today I want to focus on the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.809
 enter flight mode because you can so up 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.350
 but fly over the world later 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.190
 more 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.510
 So first we have that console 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.249
 virtually unlock 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.649
 We have to do this once in may 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:02.800
 folder will go ride here 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.960
 faded in there where the mods in 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.930
 virtually everyone should know and 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.119
 Now here's the game xml the below 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.180
 we have to open once and then it is 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.040
 very important or that is actually the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.350
 main thing about the whole thing here 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.750
 below the numbers 37-39 pay these 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.700
 here this ultimately the most important 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.409
 without them, we can do one like that 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.759
 Everything here is now before wood 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:33.340
 standard we say there is the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.649
 The console is not on when I am 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.189
 earlier one always write in english 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.030
 all right 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:42.219
 if from true to I memory 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.780
 just what you want but before 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.360
 absolutely must do is 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.829
 Backup copy without a backup 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.750
 So I take no responsibility with 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.759
 So you had to be wrong 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.700
 close the backup saved 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.350
 Here we can look again 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.789
 fits too and then we'll see each other now 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.229
 right back in game where i'll give you the 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.680
 explain flight mode a little more detail 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.679
 want 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.780
 so here we are back game here 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.710
 for you what a short I hope that gamer 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.440
 have to start 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.120
 so and now if you have everything right 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.640
 did and twice on this 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.950
 hat presses on the keyboard or 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.530
 One time is enough 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.920
 the console opens up like you do 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.990
 Look, you see now that my lures 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.340
 error-free is the only mod I do 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.730
 to have it in is the simple motto 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.620
 he is at the top and there stands as 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.240
 warning here because I do not tilted the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.670
 is that he is not in multiplayer 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.660
 works that is not a mistake 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.489
 but if there is any 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.590
 flawed mod would be worth it 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.910
 that will be shown as synonymous if I 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.140
 now again on it expresses then can 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.790
 I write something for example 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.290
 my commands enter all commands this 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.989
 But I can also if I am with the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.850
 tabulator button can be pushed 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:05.220
 switch through here all the commands I tell 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:10.570
 now so now we are looking for the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.720
 the gs circle flight and noah ud 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.130
 fashion if you give this one you can 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.530
 give her the way through among those too 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.600
 enter manually then enter then press 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.830
 you have the flight mode ever 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.989
 activated something good that now 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.600
 once again from the hat and the console 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.890
 we disappear so now is still 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.170
 everything is normal you can run 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.870
 run everything normal 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.820
 and now it has important if you 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.769
 you want to fly the button once 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.489
 Press j to enter the flight mode 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.519
 activate 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.459
 and then you can with the button cow in 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.370
 the air rises and with the key 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.350
 eh again almost singing down you can 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.840
 in the air on backward and forward 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:55.660
 walk sideways and with shift you can 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.040
 So also know here see you can 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.079
 of course also about building over it 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.900
 So there are no limits 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:07.239
 can also on the building roof lamps like that 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.610
 that is a wonderful feature of 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.870
 this flight mode the second wonderful 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.389
 Recommendation function is just for people 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.760
 They like to shoot videos or like to 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:23.169
 pictures make interesting and indeed can 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.900
 If you press the button all the help 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.630
 fields such as the clock or 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.270
 below the price make the price off 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.530
 that counts even if you are me 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.990
 buy a tractor 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.570
 if you buy in a tractor you have 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.260
 also no one can show and 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.740
 make up 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.430
 even if I want to attach attach to buy 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.430
 Me too 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.759
 he does not seem to have any help 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.469
 link up 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.210
 you can also do this box 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:02.120
 just so you can have wonderful videos 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.969
 Of course you can also film them from 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.840
 me from the normal boat and with j can 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.219
 Of course, even if the air 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.800
 hunting for time simply flies again 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:12.479
 Back on the ground these are actually the ones 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.789
 main functions of the flight 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.219
 Mode is I know it was a relative 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.719
 short tutorial but i hope so 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:22.789
 could you guys despite that I could handle you with it 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:25.199
 help anyway and what definitely 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.879
 it is important for you if it is you 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.930
 interested are you have here 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:33.509
 but seen many different ones 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.819
 I'll run a few 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:38.400
 raussuchen of the most important and 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:43.199
 this in a tutorial in one 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.430
 following video explain to you 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.779
 example is here 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.569
 I can do that fast now 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.349
 show today has at times there is the gadget 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.900
 part 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:54.210
 I could now, for example, on 1 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.599
 sentences and then it is dark is one 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.789
 clock at night it will restart 81 but 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.069
 more on that later in a next video 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.789
 Thank you very much 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:06.120
 watch 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:10.259
 and if you ask the flight mode you 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:15.080
