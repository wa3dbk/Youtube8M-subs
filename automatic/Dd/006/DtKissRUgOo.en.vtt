played a little bit further with this

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.370 
played a little bit further with this
one<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> two<00:00:23.330> simulators<00:00:24.330> I've<00:00:24.570> shown<00:00:25.350> you

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
one of the two simulators I've shown you

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.279 
one of the two simulators I've shown you
a<00:00:25.980> couple<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.400> weeks<00:00:26.580> ago<00:00:26.699> web<00:00:27.300> curve<00:00:27.720> sim

a couple of weeks ago web curve sim
which<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> google<00:00:29.070> project<00:00:29.310> here's<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> URL

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
which is a google project here's the URL

which is a google project here's the URL
what<00:00:32.430> I'm<00:00:32.550> finding<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.230> this<00:00:34.230> looks<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.590> an

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
what I'm finding is this looks like an

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.930 
what I'm finding is this looks like an
abandoned<00:00:36.590> project<00:00:37.590> last<00:00:37.920> update<00:00:38.340> was<00:00:38.370> form<00:00:38.790> a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
abandoned project last update was form a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.440 
abandoned project last update was form a
24<00:00:40.879> 2011<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.719> actually<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:44.550> version<00:00:45.000> causes

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
24 2011 but actually this version causes

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.840 
24 2011 but actually this version causes
some<00:00:45.629> kind<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.899> build<00:00:46.140> problems<00:00:46.620> when<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.129> try

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
some kind of build problems when you try

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.889 
some kind of build problems when you try
to<00:00:47.879> build<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.600> within<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.379> NetBeans<00:00:50.010> IDE<00:00:50.899> this

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to build it within the NetBeans IDE this

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.170 
to build it within the NetBeans IDE this
version<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:53.690> 1.35<00:00:55.460> actually<00:00:56.460> works<00:00:56.760> when

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
version here 1.35 actually works when

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.099 
version here 1.35 actually works when
you<00:00:57.270> download<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.940> let's<00:01:00.780> say<00:01:00.989> if

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
you download that one and let's say if

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.929 
you download that one and let's say if
you<00:01:01.230> drop<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.829> into<00:01:02.010> your<00:01:03.739> workspace<00:01:04.939> for

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
you drop it into your workspace for

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.359 
you drop it into your workspace for
Eclipse<00:01:06.360> my<00:01:06.869> case<00:01:07.140> which<00:01:07.560> I'm<00:01:07.740> using<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.130> my

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
Java IDE I'm able to open it and build

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.039 
Java IDE I'm able to open it and build
it<00:01:12.869> no<00:01:13.020> problem<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.770> actually<00:01:14.010> run<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.090> as

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it no problem and actually run it so as

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.480 
it no problem and actually run it so as
you<00:01:16.590> knew<00:01:17.130> from<00:01:17.549> previous<00:01:18.740> videos<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
previous video I was not able to run it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.690 
previous video I was not able to run it
off<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.229> command<00:01:22.560> line<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:23.070> java<00:01:23.430> and

off the command line with my java and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
build all the dependency jars are

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.100 
build all the dependency jars are
included<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.060> part<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> download<00:01:30.840> since

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
included it's part of the download since

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.710 
included it's part of the download since
this<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:32.220> particular<00:01:32.430> download<00:01:33.240> looks<00:01:33.450> ok

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
this this particular download looks ok

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.109 
this this particular download looks ok
1.35<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> as<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.659> result<00:01:36.869> i<00:01:37.200> am<00:01:37.320> able<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.710> run

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
1.35 so as a result i am able to run

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.179 
1.35 so as a result i am able to run
this<00:01:39.119> application<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.229> run<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> j<00:01:40.950> unit

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
this application and run all the j unit

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.969 
this application and run all the j unit
test<00:01:41.640> cases<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.360> my<00:01:42.630> case<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:43.079> i<00:01:43.200> run<00:01:43.470> java

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
test cases so my case if i run java

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.679 
test cases so my case if i run java
application<00:01:45.649> under<00:01:46.649> web<00:01:47.340> curve<00:01:47.579> run<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
application under web curve run as and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.710 
application under web curve run as and
then<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.619> java<00:01:50.340> application<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.210> get<00:01:51.509> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
then the java application I get a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.990 
then the java application I get a
variety<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.110> test<00:01:52.409> case<00:01:52.649> which<00:01:52.890> test<00:01:53.700> cases

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
variety of test case which test cases

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.600 
variety of test case which test cases
which<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.750> run<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.380> test<00:01:55.680> run<00:01:56.250> test

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
which I can run so if I test run test

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.889 
which I can run so if I test run test
one<00:01:57.649> off<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.950> goes<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.579> as<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.390> tell<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.869> is

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
one off it goes so as you can tell it is

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.660 
one off it goes so as you can tell it is
running<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.770> no<00:02:01.799> issues<00:02:03.950> test<00:02:04.950> number<00:02:05.070> two

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
running with no issues test number two

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.530 
running with no issues test number two
is<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.479> same<00:02:06.750> thing<00:02:07.340> as<00:02:09.440> well<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.770> test

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.770 

three<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:15.700> five<00:02:16.700> are<00:02:17.060> pretty<00:02:17.269> well<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.510> same

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
three and five are pretty well the same

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.309 
three and five are pretty well the same
results<00:02:18.469> so<00:02:18.829> everything<00:02:19.609> seems<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:20.000> be

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
results so everything seems to be

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.449 
results so everything seems to be
hunky-dory<00:02:21.319> but<00:02:21.950> where<00:02:22.099> it<00:02:22.189> gets<00:02:22.310> very

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
hunky-dory but where it gets very

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.740 
hunky-dory but where it gets very
interesting<00:02:23.269> is<00:02:23.569> in<00:02:24.109> the<00:02:24.200> test<00:02:24.469> case<00:02:24.769> for<00:02:25.750> so

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
interesting is in the test case for so

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.860 
interesting is in the test case for so
let<00:02:26.870> me<00:02:26.900> just<00:02:27.079> show<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.319> that<00:02:28.689> one<00:02:29.689> of<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
let me just show you that one of the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.569 
let me just show you that one of the
things<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.319> you<00:02:30.500> will<00:02:30.650> need<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.950> start<00:02:31.400> is

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
things that you will need to start is

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.080 
things that you will need to start is
the<00:02:32.230> exchange<00:02:33.230> as<00:02:33.439> i<00:02:33.590> showed<00:02:34.189> you<00:02:34.220> before<00:02:34.549> if

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
the exchange as i showed you before if

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.259 
the exchange as i showed you before if
you<00:02:35.180> navigate<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.720> your<00:02:35.900> folder<00:02:36.739> of<00:02:37.189> the<00:02:37.269> web

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
you navigate to your folder of the web

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.339 
you navigate to your folder of the web
curve<00:02:38.599> and<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:40.480> list<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.659> out<00:02:41.840> you'll<00:02:42.079> get

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
curve and you list it out you'll get

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.740 
curve and you list it out you'll get
this<00:02:42.590> batch<00:02:43.129> file<00:02:43.489> in<00:02:43.700> windows<00:02:43.849> exchange

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
this batch file in windows exchange

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.929 
this batch file in windows exchange
batch<00:02:45.109> if<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:45.650> run<00:02:45.889> that<00:02:46.099> that<00:02:46.400> will<00:02:46.519> start<00:02:46.849> up

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
batch if you run that that will start up

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.559 
batch if you run that that will start up
the<00:02:47.090> exchange<00:02:47.569> i<00:02:47.930> guess<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:48.799> can<00:02:48.920> call<00:02:49.099> it<00:02:49.159> the

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
the exchange i guess you can call it the

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.250 
the exchange i guess you can call it the
exchange<00:02:50.569> server<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.760> there<00:02:53.659> you<00:02:53.750> go<00:02:53.810> it's

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
exchange server and there you go it's

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.569 
exchange server and there you go it's
basically<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.680> swing<00:02:55.159> app<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.939> java<00:02:56.720> swing<00:02:57.049> app

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
basically a swing app a java swing app

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.089 
basically a swing app a java swing app
and<00:02:58.579> i'll<00:02:59.389> start<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.139> server<00:03:00.439> so<00:03:00.799> as<00:03:01.040> a

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
and i'll start this server so as a

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.800 
and i'll start this server so as a
result<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.760> can<00:03:01.879> then<00:03:02.239> run<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:04.510> test<00:03:05.510> case

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
result you can then run the test case

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.520 
result you can then run the test case
for<00:03:06.459> which<00:03:07.459> will<00:03:07.819> run<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.090> client<00:03:09.019> swing

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
for which will run a client swing

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.819 
for which will run a client swing
application<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:11.209> then<00:03:11.419> what<00:03:12.349> it<00:03:12.439> will<00:03:12.560> do<00:03:12.799> is

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
application and then what it will do is

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.750 
application and then what it will do is
in<00:03:13.159> the<00:03:13.250> log<00:03:13.489> it<00:03:13.790> will<00:03:13.970> obviously<00:03:15.639> connect<00:03:16.639> to

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
in the log it will obviously connect to

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.599 
in the log it will obviously connect to
the<00:03:16.879> exchange<00:03:17.150> I've<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:19.150> first<00:03:20.290> exchange

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
the exchange I've the first exchange

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.949 
the exchange I've the first exchange
application<00:03:22.609> or<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.879> server<00:03:23.150> is<00:03:23.269> not<00:03:23.479> open

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
application or the server is not open

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.110 
application or the server is not open
this<00:03:24.169> one<00:03:24.379> it<00:03:24.949> will<00:03:25.310> get<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.579> refused

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
this one it will get a refused

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.909 
this one it will get a refused
connection<00:03:26.389> so<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:26.780> need<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.139> run<00:03:27.739> that

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
connection so you need to run that

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.780 
connection so you need to run that
obviously<00:03:28.430> everything's<00:03:29.150> done<00:03:29.359> locally<00:03:30.790> on

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
obviously everything's done locally on

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.000 
obviously everything's done locally on
the<00:03:31.940> same<00:03:32.150> desktop<00:03:32.599> and<00:03:33.079> everything<00:03:33.560> seems<00:03:33.859> to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
the same desktop and everything seems to

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.140 
the same desktop and everything seems to
run<00:03:34.159> so<00:03:34.370> let<00:03:34.549> me<00:03:34.639> show<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.940> client

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
run so let me show you the client

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.250 
run so let me show you the client
application<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.199> if<00:03:36.319> you<00:03:36.470> put<00:03:36.739> in<00:03:37.750> an<00:03:38.750> order

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
application so if you put in an order

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.469 
application so if you put in an order
for<00:03:39.409> this<00:03:39.859> particular<00:03:40.519> stock<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:43.790> know<00:03:43.909> you

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:44.479 
for this particular stock you know you

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.789 
for this particular stock you know you
will<00:03:44.629> get<00:03:44.840> activity<00:03:45.470> on<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.799> exchange<00:03:46.310> server

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
will get activity on the exchange server

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.520 
will get activity on the exchange server
so<00:03:48.799> if<00:03:49.459> I<00:03:49.790> list<00:03:50.419> it<00:03:50.659> I<00:03:51.590> believe<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:53.530> can't

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
so if I list it I believe I can't

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.330 
so if I list it I believe I can't
remember<00:03:54.949> where<00:03:55.930> but<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:56.989> did<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:57.799> have<00:03:57.979> seen

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
remember where but I did I have seen

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.800 
remember where but I did I have seen
some<00:03:58.699> data<00:03:58.970> get<00:03:59.389> updated<00:03:59.959> as<00:04:00.139> i<00:04:00.379> put<00:04:00.620> in<00:04:00.769> orders

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
some data get updated as i put in orders

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.020 
some data get updated as i put in orders
so<00:04:02.810> they<00:04:03.049> are<00:04:03.439> communicating<00:04:04.900> which<00:04:05.900> is<00:04:06.079> good

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
so they are communicating which is good

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.199 
so they are communicating which is good
so<00:04:08.049> we're<00:04:09.049> up<00:04:09.229> and<00:04:09.409> running<00:04:09.790> with<00:04:10.790> with

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
so we're up and running with with

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.120 
so we're up and running with with
everything<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:13.120> pretty<00:04:14.120> happy<00:04:14.449> with<00:04:14.569> that

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
everything and pretty happy with that

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.399 
everything and pretty happy with that
and<00:04:16.130> as<00:04:16.880> I<00:04:16.940> said<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.509> complete<00:04:17.870> source<00:04:18.079> code

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
and as I said the complete source code

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:22.800 
and as I said the complete source code
is<00:04:19.150> within<00:04:20.150> my<00:04:20.419> Eclipse<00:04:20.810> environment

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
is within my Eclipse environment

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.340 
is within my Eclipse environment
so<00:04:23.810> i<00:04:23.840> think<00:04:24.170> i'm<00:04:24.470> using<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:25.690> Eclipse<00:04:26.690> indigo

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
so i think i'm using the Eclipse indigo

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.800 
so i think i'm using the Eclipse indigo
version<00:04:27.920> whatever<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:28.550> is<00:04:28.640> it's<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.510> pretty<00:04:29.720> old

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
version whatever it is it's a pretty old

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.750 
version whatever it is it's a pretty old
setup<00:04:32.140> source<00:04:33.140> code<00:04:33.610> so<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.730> dependency<00:04:35.360> um

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
setup source code so the dependency um

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.730 
setup source code so the dependency um
jars<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:37.970> need<00:04:38.150> you<00:04:38.270> need<00:04:38.390> Jay<00:04:38.690> unit<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.350> SL

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
jars you need you need Jay unit the SL

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.890 
jars you need you need Jay unit the SL
for<00:04:40.040> J<00:04:40.250> which<00:04:40.460> is<00:04:40.610> for<00:04:40.790> logging<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.540> then

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
for J which is for logging and then

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.340 
for J which is for logging and then
obviously<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.830> quick<00:04:43.580> fix<00:04:43.930> jar<00:04:44.930> as<00:04:45.110> well

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
obviously the quick fix jar as well

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.480 
obviously the quick fix jar as well
which<00:04:45.650> is<00:04:45.680> this<00:04:46.070> one<00:04:46.310> quick<00:04:47.060> fix<00:04:47.300> all<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:49.010> then

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
which is this one quick fix all and then

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.920 
which is this one quick fix all and then
the<00:04:49.610> mena<00:04:49.820> core<00:04:50.090> which<00:04:50.270> is<00:04:50.420> needed<00:04:50.750> by<00:04:50.870> the

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
the mena core which is needed by the

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.700 
the mena core which is needed by the
quick<00:04:51.230> fix<00:04:52.990> something<00:04:53.990> seems<00:04:54.230> to<00:04:54.320> be<00:04:54.410> kind<00:04:54.560> of

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
quick fix something seems to be kind of

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.490 
quick fix something seems to be kind of
working<00:04:55.130> I<00:04:55.310> have<00:04:55.640> gone<00:04:55.850> through<00:04:56.230> the<00:04:57.230> source

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
working I have gone through the source

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:05.050 
working I have gone through the source
code<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:59.680> oddly<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:03.470> source<00:05:03.800> code<00:05:04.070> that

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
code and oddly the source code that

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.050 
code and oddly the source code that
there<00:05:05.270> isn't<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.870> lot<00:05:06.140> of<00:05:06.500> comments<00:05:07.190> but<00:05:07.700> it's

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
there isn't a lot of comments but it's

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.690 
there isn't a lot of comments but it's
not<00:05:08.330> too<00:05:08.710> complicated<00:05:09.760> there's<00:05:10.760> a<00:05:10.820> set<00:05:11.120> of<00:05:11.300> of

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
not too complicated there's a set of of

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.210 
not too complicated there's a set of of
a<00:05:13.700> set<00:05:14.060> of<00:05:16.150> getters<00:05:17.150> and<00:05:17.650> whatnot<00:05:18.650> so<00:05:18.680> it's

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
a set of getters and whatnot so it's

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.250 
a set of getters and whatnot so it's
pretty<00:05:19.520> straightforward<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:22.990> it<00:05:23.990> there

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
pretty straightforward and it there

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.170 
pretty straightforward and it there
doesn't<00:05:24.650> seem<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.830> be<00:05:24.950> a<00:05:25.010> lot<00:05:25.220> of<00:05:25.280> gotchas<00:05:25.850> in

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
doesn't seem to be a lot of gotchas in

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.930 
doesn't seem to be a lot of gotchas in
it<00:05:26.480> the<00:05:27.200> next<00:05:27.500> step<00:05:27.680> for<00:05:27.710> me<00:05:28.070> is<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.250> get<00:05:28.610> this

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
it the next step for me is to get this

the order book this sort of information

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.790 
the order book this sort of information
seems<00:05:59.210> to<00:05:59.360> be<00:05:59.450> fairly<00:06:00.760> valuable<00:06:01.760> and<00:06:02.710> it's<00:06:03.710> a

good<00:06:03.950> way<00:06:04.070> to<00:06:04.660> you<00:06:05.660> know<00:06:05.750> have<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:06.020> variety<00:06:06.410> of

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
good way to you know have a variety of

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.460 
good way to you know have a variety of
different<00:06:06.590> scenarios<00:06:07.070> you<00:06:07.160> can<00:06:07.310> test<00:06:08.470> with

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
different scenarios you can test with

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.040 
different scenarios you can test with
your<00:06:09.680> strategy<00:06:10.280> but<00:06:10.430> again<00:06:10.760> all<00:06:11.090> your<00:06:11.480> testing

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
your strategy but again all your testing

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.310 
your strategy but again all your testing
would<00:06:12.770> be<00:06:12.920> done<00:06:13.160> through<00:06:13.460> the<00:06:13.910> g<00:06:14.720> unit<00:06:14.900> test

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
would be done through the g unit test

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.580 
would be done through the g unit test
cases<00:06:15.650> as<00:06:16.190> i<00:06:16.400> showed<00:06:16.640> you<00:06:16.670> earlier<00:06:17.320> which<00:06:18.320> are

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
cases as i showed you earlier which are

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.300 
cases as i showed you earlier which are
obviously<00:06:18.940> this<00:06:19.940> test1<00:06:20.510> test2<00:06:21.050> and<00:06:21.650> let<00:06:22.220> me

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
obviously this test1 test2 and let me

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
obviously this test1 test2 and let me
show<00:06:22.460> you<00:06:22.490> that<00:06:22.730> there's<00:06:22.940> a<00:06:23.000> readme<00:06:23.860> for<00:06:24.860> that

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.710 

so<00:06:32.009> these<00:06:33.009> are<00:06:33.250> all<00:06:33.280> the<00:06:33.490> different<00:06:34.180> tasks<00:06:34.599> in

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
so these are all the different tasks in

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.459 
so these are all the different tasks in
which<00:06:34.900> way<00:06:35.199> and<00:06:36.189> describing<00:06:36.939> what<00:06:37.870> the<00:06:38.020> tests

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:38.469 
which way and describing what the tests

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:40.529 
which way and describing what the tests
do<00:06:38.770> and<00:06:39.280> everything<00:06:40.060> seems<00:06:40.360> to<00:06:40.419> be<00:06:40.479> working

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
do and everything seems to be working

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:43.700 
do and everything seems to be working
which<00:06:41.020> is<00:06:41.139> really<00:06:41.319> good<00:06:41.530> so<00:06:41.889> if<00:06:42.610> I<00:06:42.939> do<00:06:43.000> get<00:06:43.300> my

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
which is really good so if I do get my

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.540 
which is really good so if I do get my
platform<00:06:44.710> my<00:06:44.860> trading<00:06:45.099> platform

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550
