eating<00:02:02.100> those<00:02:02.280> foods<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:03.030> top<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.840> those<00:02:03.960> other

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
eating those foods on top of those other

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.800 
eating those foods on top of those other
foods<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:05.070> your<00:02:05.100> colon<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.450> will<00:02:06.600> get

foods in your colon and you will get

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.199 
foods in your colon and you will get

this distinction in your stomach no
doubt<00:02:09.539> about<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.840> because<00:02:10.170> fruit<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
doubt about it because fruit is like a

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.580 
doubt about it because fruit is like a
jealous<00:02:11.430> partner<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.120> was<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.510> all<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:13.170> itself

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
jealous partner it was you all to itself

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.710 
jealous partner it was you all to itself
ok<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.430> doesn't<00:02:14.610> want<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.849> share<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.300> with<00:02:15.450> any

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
ok it doesn't want to share you with any

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.559 
ok it doesn't want to share you with any
other<00:02:16.020> food<00:02:16.440> at<00:02:16.680> all<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.940> you're<00:02:18.209> going<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> get

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
other food at all so you're going to get

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.449 
other food at all so you're going to get
that<00:02:18.690> mixing<00:02:19.200> gonna<00:02:19.709> get<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.950> gas<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
that mixing gonna get the gas and the

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.820 
that mixing gonna get the gas and the
bloating<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.810> another<00:02:22.019> reason<00:02:22.410> for<00:02:22.440> bloating

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
bloating so another reason for bloating

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.940 
bloating so another reason for bloating
is<00:02:23.340> you're<00:02:24.209> eating<00:02:24.510> too<00:02:24.540> fast<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.650> you're<00:02:25.800> like

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
is you're eating too fast so you're like

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.430 
is you're eating too fast so you're like
literally<00:02:26.459> gulping<00:02:27.030> air<00:02:27.360> as<00:02:27.750> you're<00:02:28.110> eating

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
literally gulping air as you're eating

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.309 
literally gulping air as you're eating
up<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.880> you're<00:02:30.090> taking<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.540> all<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:30.840> air<00:02:31.110> and

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
up and you're taking it all this air and

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.220 
up and you're taking it all this air and
that<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.709> also<00:02:31.860> cause<00:02:32.130> bloating<00:02:33.230> another

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
that can also cause bloating another

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.380 
that can also cause bloating another
thing<00:02:34.560> about<00:02:35.310> coming<00:02:35.730> back<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.150> food

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
thing about coming back to the food

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.050 
thing about coming back to the food

faster<00:03:19.950> jesting<00:03:20.459> plant<00:03:21.000> foods<00:03:21.269> dinner<00:03:21.570> then

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
faster jesting plant foods dinner then

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.479 
faster jesting plant foods dinner then
he<00:03:22.200> had<00:03:22.320> watermelon<00:03:22.650> in<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.980> morning<00:03:23.310> he's

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
he had watermelon in the morning he's

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.220 
he had watermelon in the morning he's
not<00:03:23.700> likely<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.090> get<00:03:24.329> that<00:03:24.570> but<00:03:24.989> there's<00:03:25.170> still

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
not likely to get that but there's still

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.870 
not likely to get that but there's still
maybe<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.709> little<00:03:25.980> bit<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.400> because

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
maybe a little bit of that because

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.090 
maybe a little bit of that because
cooked<00:03:27.239> food<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.840> fruit<00:03:28.140> digests<00:03:29.040> a

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
cooked food and fruit digests a

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.280 
cooked food and fruit digests a
different<00:03:29.549> rates<00:03:29.760> okay<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.690> more<00:03:30.870> water<00:03:31.109> and

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
different rates okay the more water and

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.860 
different rates okay the more water and
a<00:03:31.440> food<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.160> faster<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.910> isn't<00:03:33.209> going<00:03:33.690> to

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
a food the faster it isn't going to

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.949 
a food the faster it isn't going to
digest<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:35.519> another<00:03:35.910> thing<00:03:36.060> can<00:03:36.510> be<00:03:36.540> for

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
digest so another thing can be for

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.410 
digest so another thing can be for
bloating<00:03:37.200> if<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:38.280> have<00:03:38.489> an<00:03:38.640> inefficient

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
bloating if you have an inefficient

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.559 
bloating if you have an inefficient
colon<00:03:39.870> you're<00:03:40.380> not<00:03:40.560> very<00:03:40.590> fit<00:03:41.269> okay<00:03:42.269> that's<00:03:42.480> a

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
colon you're not very fit okay that's a

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.599 
colon you're not very fit okay that's a
big<00:03:42.810> one<00:03:42.989> because<00:03:43.109> i<00:03:43.290> love<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.739> population<00:03:44.400> is

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
big one because i love the population is

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.509 
big one because i love the population is
not<00:03:44.880> very<00:03:45.120> fit<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.560> feeder<00:03:46.829> you<00:03:47.069> become

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
not very fit so the feeder you become

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.910 
not very fit so the feeder you become
the<00:03:47.970> more<00:03:48.150> efficient<00:03:48.840> your<00:03:49.049> colon<00:03:49.560> becomes

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
the more efficient your colon becomes

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.250 
the more efficient your colon becomes
that<00:03:50.130> eliminating<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.030> waste<00:03:51.269> pushing<00:03:52.139> it

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
that eliminating the waste pushing it

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.430 
that eliminating the waste pushing it
through<00:03:52.819> okay<00:03:53.819> so<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.420> really<00:03:54.840> really<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.410> a
