00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.080
 me 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.080
 goo 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.620
 goo 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.079
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.750
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:25.000
 Among the parts above the base 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.910
 I wanted to leave 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.250
 Well as Well strategy 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.470
 Okui-san 's number 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:40.380
 Of course I could work from home and the government 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:43.620
 If it were not for it to I could have spree at once from the back in the opposite spaced little headway 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.940
 I think it was not a straight line match 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:52.620
 For now, even I'd regret full of 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:57.400
 After all on that stage since last year's big stage 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.800
 I wonder if I should have the feeling of money far 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:05.110
 I was troubled 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:08.280
 Again I think after all it is really supported by various people but 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.360
 Throne in plenipotentiary of this feature to be 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.360
 I will 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:20.050
 Well, after all I was asked to do it that way, so I always felt like I did it 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.420
 But after all 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.420
 I think he also contains a bail that can be angry 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.740
 Mr. Okui's run after the sentence 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.330
 It is called measures 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.319
 I think that there is resistance of 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:42.400
 Well, after all, it is the best selection in Japan. 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.410
 After all I think that I can only play a much better game 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.069
 Hm 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.799
 Moe with me with her 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:55.849
 Also her preceding a stroke he forsake the preceding but it is important that your confirmation of course preceded 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:03:01.819
 I said is really tilted forward because I do not think we have to go 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:04.260
 I think that I want to the goal of Tteyuu break their shell as a target of the year this year 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.970
 To that also the Okui's in order 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.270

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.270

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.480

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.629
