00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
extremely fast normally when you have a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.209 
extremely fast normally when you have a
really<00:00:54.600> good<00:00:54.840> dribbler<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.350> someone<00:00:56.100> with

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
really good dribbler and someone with

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.580 
really good dribbler and someone with
really<00:00:56.430> high<00:00:56.640> pace<00:00:56.910> his<00:00:57.390> pace<00:00:57.690> tends<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.440> go

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
really high pace his pace tends to go

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.529 
really high pace his pace tends to go
down<00:00:58.620> he<00:00:59.100> doesn't<00:00:59.309> feel<00:00:59.609> as<00:00:59.760> false<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.300> he<00:01:00.420> is

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
down he doesn't feel as false as he is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.569 
down he doesn't feel as false as he is
in<00:01:00.780> game<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.590> guy<00:01:01.739> actually<00:01:02.100> feels<00:01:02.340> like

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
in game but this guy actually feels like

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.399 
in game but this guy actually feels like
he<00:01:02.699> has<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.420> eighty<00:01:03.660> eight<00:01:03.870> sprint<00:01:04.199> speed

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
he has I think eighty eight sprint speed

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.560 
he has I think eighty eight sprint speed
or<00:01:04.589> something<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:06.360> think

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
or something like that and I think

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.940 
or something like that and I think
that's<00:01:06.810> why<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.080> says<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.500> his<00:01:07.650> in-game

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
that's why it says it in his in-game

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.219 
that's why it says it in his in-game
stats<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:08.939> he<00:01:09.090> does<00:01:09.270> definitely<00:01:09.540> feel<00:01:09.869> around

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
stats but he does definitely feel around

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.350 
stats but he does definitely feel around
there<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.619> he<00:01:11.100> has<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.850> good<00:01:12.000> dribbling

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
there and he has really good dribbling

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.570 
there and he has really good dribbling
I'm<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.409> easy<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.890> past<00:01:14.159> defenders

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
I'm it's so easy to get past defenders

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.310 
I'm it's so easy to get past defenders

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
couple of long shots with him but if you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.469 
couple of long shots with him but if you
if<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.280> are<00:01:53.369> really<00:01:53.640> good<00:01:53.759> at<00:01:53.820> long<00:01:54.060> shots<00:01:54.270> you

if you are really good at long shots you

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.850 
if you are really good at long shots you
could<00:01:54.659> definitely<00:01:54.840> get<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.229> guy<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.500> score

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
could definitely get this guy to score

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.730 
could definitely get this guy to score
some<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.610> awesome<00:01:56.759> ones<00:01:57.180> he's<00:01:57.899> not<00:01:58.110> also

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
some really awesome ones he's not also

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.740 
some really awesome ones he's not also
he's<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.009> very<00:01:59.219> expensive<00:01:59.670> surprisingly

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
he's not very expensive surprisingly

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.510 
he's not very expensive surprisingly
I<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.439> because<00:02:01.710> he's<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.159> not

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I think it's because he's in the not

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.440 
I think it's because he's in the not
really<00:02:02.880> popular<00:02:03.090> league<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.079> he's<00:02:04.590> around<00:02:05.450> 160

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
really popular league so he's around 160

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.510

his<00:02:23.250> finisher<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.880> probably<00:02:24.209> one<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> best

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
his finisher is probably one of the best

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.330 
his finisher is probably one of the best
for<00:02:24.840> their<00:02:24.959> shots<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.319> this<00:02:25.470> game<00:02:25.709> he<00:02:26.099> can

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
for their shots in this game he can

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.160 
for their shots in this game he can
score<00:02:26.580> them<00:02:26.760> from<00:02:26.970> really<00:02:27.209> difficult<00:02:27.780> angles

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
score them from really difficult angles

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.440 
score them from really difficult angles
his<00:02:28.590> passing<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.250> also<00:02:29.670> really<00:02:30.060> good<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.390> you

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
his passing is also really good so you

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.059 
his passing is also really good so you
can<00:02:30.720> cross<00:02:30.959> with<00:02:31.170> him<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.470> stuff<00:02:31.769> like<00:02:31.890> that

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
can cross with him and stuff like that

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.740 
can cross with him and stuff like that
unless<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.880> if<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> really

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
unless you have if you have a really

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.900 
unless you have if you have a really
good<00:02:33.959> target<00:02:34.349> man<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.950> guy<00:02:35.130> will<00:02:35.370> be<00:02:35.400> ideal

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
good target man this guy will be ideal

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.790 
good target man this guy will be ideal
to<00:02:36.090> play<00:02:36.239> as<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.450> left<00:02:36.720> forward<00:02:36.989> or<00:02:37.200> left<00:02:37.470> winger

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
to play as a left forward or left winger

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.070 
to play as a left forward or left winger
and<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.760> think<00:02:39.180> that's<00:02:39.360> pretty<00:02:39.540> much<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.750> he

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
and I think that's pretty much it he

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.930 
and I think that's pretty much it he
also<00:02:40.260> has<00:02:40.500> full<00:02:40.709> star<00:02:40.980> skills<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.519> full<00:02:41.700> star

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
also has full star skills and full star

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.030 
also has full star skills and full star
weak<00:02:42.150> foot<00:02:42.420> making<00:02:42.720> him<00:02:42.989> even<00:02:43.380> more<00:02:43.560> deadly

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
weak foot making him even more deadly

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.890 
weak foot making him even more deadly
when<00:02:44.519> you're<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:45.090> know<00:02:45.209> trying<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.569> cut<00:02:45.780> in

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
when you're you know trying to cut in

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.360 
when you're you know trying to cut in
with<00:02:46.019> him<00:02:46.200> even<00:02:46.500> if<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.739> shoot<00:02:46.920> with<00:02:46.950> his<00:02:47.160> left

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
with him even if you shoot with his left

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.890 
with him even if you shoot with his left
foot<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.549> did<00:02:47.760> tend<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.120> score<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> couple<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.780> his

foot I did tend to score a couple of his

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.720 
foot I did tend to score a couple of his
left<00:02:49.140> foot<00:02:49.319> I<00:02:49.500> think<00:02:49.709> you'll<00:02:50.040> see<00:02:50.280> one<00:02:50.580> or<00:02:50.700> two

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
left foot I think you'll see one or two

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.430 
left foot I think you'll see one or two
in<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.030> video<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.110> pretty<00:02:52.260> much<00:02:52.380> it
