00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
food isn't cooking in a really harsh way

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.270 
food isn't cooking in a really harsh way
so<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.970> result<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> very<00:01:46.350> very<00:01:46.799> tender

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
so the result is a very very tender

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.469 
so the result is a very very tender
succulent<00:01:48.119> food<00:01:48.360> product<00:01:48.869> ideal<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:50.070> steaks

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
succulent food product ideal for steaks

but even your cheaper cuts of meat as

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.730 
but even your cheaper cuts of meat as
well<00:01:53.909> by<00:01:54.509> cooking<00:01:54.780> them<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> sous-vide<00:01:55.680> style

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
well by cooking them the sous-vide style

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.700 
well by cooking them the sous-vide style
means<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.790> they<00:01:56.939> come<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:57.329> really<00:01:57.750> tender

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
means that they come out really tender

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.899 
means that they come out really tender
so<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.399> versatile<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.329> all<00:02:00.570> types<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.469> food
