00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.639 
julienne blades and snap up a portion is
so<00:00:35.640> nice<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.059> tight<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:37.050> now<00:00:37.380> we're<00:00:37.559> gonna

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
so nice and tight and now we're gonna

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.760 
so nice and tight and now we're gonna
loosen<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.090> we're<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.390> to

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
loosen this up here and we're going to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.880 
loosen this up here and we're going to
move<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.129> julienne<00:00:42.000> plate<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.530> probably

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
move this julienne plate up to probably

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.119 
move this julienne plate up to probably
about<00:00:44.190> one<00:00:44.670> millimeter<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.329> quarter<00:00:45.719> inch<00:00:46.129> in

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
about one millimeter or quarter inch in

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.430 
about one millimeter or quarter inch in
height<00:00:48.710> lock<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.860> tight

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
height lock it tight

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.530 
height lock it tight
and<00:00:51.710> this<00:00:52.670> carrot<00:00:53.000> here<00:00:53.120> is<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:53.329> little<00:00:53.450> bit

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
and this carrot here is a little bit

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.440 
and this carrot here is a little bit
longer<00:00:53.780> than<00:00:54.260> what<00:00:55.250> this<00:00:55.400> holder<00:00:55.730> will<00:00:56.150> hold

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
longer than what this holder will hold

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.960 
longer than what this holder will hold
so<00:00:56.989> we'll<00:00:57.110> go<00:00:57.230> ahead<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.580> cut<00:00:58.580> this<00:00:58.700> guy<00:00:58.910> in

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
so we'll go ahead and cut this guy in

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:06.520 
so we'll go ahead and cut this guy in
half<00:01:01.660> here<00:01:03.280> inside<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.840> lock<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:05.990> down<00:01:06.110> so

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
half here inside and lock it down so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.370 
half here inside and lock it down so
once<00:01:06.710> again<00:01:06.830> hold<00:01:07.250> onto<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:08.170> soft<00:01:09.170> grip

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
once again hold onto the soft grip

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.410 
once again hold onto the soft grip
handle<00:01:09.410> in<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.830> back<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:10.340> then<00:01:10.910> just<00:01:11.150> kind<00:01:11.360> of

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
handle in the back and then just kind of

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.990 
handle in the back and then just kind of
we're<00:01:11.540> gonna<00:01:11.600> proceed<00:01:11.990> our<00:01:12.260> way<00:01:12.350> down<00:01:16.000> give

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
we're gonna proceed our way down give

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:28.570 
we're gonna proceed our way down give
some<00:01:17.180> momentum<00:01:17.720> going<00:01:17.750> here<00:01:27.070> there's<00:01:28.070> no<00:01:28.310> way

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
some momentum going here there's no way

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.740 
some momentum going here there's no way
you<00:01:28.640> can<00:01:28.850> cut<00:01:29.000> this<00:01:29.119> by<00:01:29.300> hand

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
you can cut this by hand

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.230 
you can cut this by hand
look<00:01:29.869> at<00:01:29.960> how<00:01:30.080> fine<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.560> is<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.759> some<00:01:32.119> of<00:01:32.149> the

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
look at how fine it is so some of the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.370 
look at how fine it is so some of the
pieces<00:01:32.390> you<00:01:32.600> may<00:01:32.720> not<00:01:32.840> just<00:01:33.020> kind<00:01:33.110> of<00:01:33.200> pull

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
pieces you may not just kind of pull

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.900 
pieces you may not just kind of pull
apart<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.680> little<00:01:33.830> bit<00:01:33.920> depending<00:01:34.130> on<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.399> fruit

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
apart a little bit depending on a fruit

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.910 
apart a little bit depending on a fruit
or<00:01:35.479> vegetable<00:01:35.750> that<00:01:36.050> you<00:01:36.200> using<00:01:36.530> some<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.770> them

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
or vegetable that you using some of them

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.080 
or vegetable that you using some of them
kind<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.190> sticks<00:01:37.399> together<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.729> little<00:01:37.820> bit<00:01:37.970> but

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
kind of sticks together a little bit but

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.540 
kind of sticks together a little bit but
as<00:01:38.240> soon<00:01:38.420> as<00:01:38.479> she's<00:01:38.660> just<00:01:38.810> kind<00:01:38.960> of<00:01:39.460> free<00:01:40.460> it

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
as soon as she's just kind of free it

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.040 
as soon as she's just kind of free it
around<00:01:40.789> like<00:01:40.940> this<00:01:41.149> it'll<00:01:41.479> just<00:01:41.660> kind<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.899> fall

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
around like this it'll just kind of fall

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.320 
around like this it'll just kind of fall
apart<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:42.950> hopefully<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.789> will<00:01:43.850> give<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.119> an

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
apart so hopefully that will give you an

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.999 
apart so hopefully that will give you an
idea<00:01:44.509> how<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.899> jewel<00:01:45.140> in<00:01:45.259> works<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:45.770> then

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
idea how the jewel in works and then

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.370 
idea how the jewel in works and then
once<00:01:46.910> again<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:48.340> blade<00:01:49.340> in<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.060> bottom<00:01:50.420> pop

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
once again the blade in the bottom pop

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.970 
once again the blade in the bottom pop
it<00:01:51.530> off<00:01:52.720> there<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:53.840> have<00:01:54.050> it<00:01:54.910> thank<00:01:55.910> you
