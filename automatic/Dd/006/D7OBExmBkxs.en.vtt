so<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.359> have<00:00:06.630> your<00:00:06.809> two<00:00:07.049> pots<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.280> two-part

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
so you have your two pots of two-part

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.180 
so you have your two pots of two-part
molding<00:00:09.150> compound<00:00:09.630> they're<00:00:10.530> usually<00:00:10.710> white

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
molding compound they're usually white

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.060 
molding compound they're usually white
and<00:00:11.640> blue<00:00:12.230> sometimes<00:00:13.230> they're<00:00:13.470> white<00:00:13.740> and

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
and blue sometimes they're white and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.669 
and blue sometimes they're white and
purple<00:00:14.420> you<00:00:15.420> basically<00:00:15.870> just<00:00:16.019> need<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.470> get<00:00:16.560> an

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:16.679 
purple you basically just need to get an

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.529 
purple you basically just need to get an
equal<00:00:17.099> amount<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.609> each<00:00:17.880> which<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.390> going

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
equal amount of each which we're going

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.779 
equal amount of each which we're going
to<00:00:18.630> mix<00:00:18.779> together<00:00:19.019> I'm<00:00:20.009> going<00:00:20.159> to<00:00:20.249> take<00:00:20.460> a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
to mix together I'm going to take a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.349 
to mix together I'm going to take a
little<00:00:21.210> ball<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.509> white<00:00:21.839> and<00:00:22.909> a<00:00:23.909> little<00:00:23.939> ball

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
little ball of white and a little ball

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.859 
little ball of white and a little ball
of<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.900> blue<00:00:29.029> you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.149> just<00:00:30.390> judge<00:00:30.569> it<00:00:30.749> by

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
of the blue you can just judge it by

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.630 
of the blue you can just judge it by
your<00:00:31.019> eye<00:00:31.169> they<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:31.949> need<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.220> roughly

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
your eye they just need to be roughly

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.170 
your eye they just need to be roughly
equal<00:00:32.759> they<00:00:33.120> don't<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.720> exact

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
equal they don't have to be exact

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.370 
equal they don't have to be exact
once<00:00:36.180> you've<00:00:36.330> got<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> two<00:00:36.810> ones<00:00:37.080> that<00:00:37.290> are

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
once you've got the two ones that are

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.530 
once you've got the two ones that are
roughly<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> same<00:00:37.800> size<00:00:37.950> mix<00:00:38.940> them<00:00:39.120> together

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
roughly the same size mix them together

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.850 
roughly the same size mix them together
and<00:00:39.810> make<00:00:39.960> sure<00:00:39.990> you<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.470> really

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and make sure you do it really

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.010 
and make sure you do it really
vigorously<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:42.120> don't<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.450> want<00:00:42.630> to<00:00:42.690> rub

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
vigorously you don't just want to rub

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.670 
vigorously you don't just want to rub
them<00:00:43.230> gently<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.190> really<00:00:44.400> need<00:00:45.180> them

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
them gently you have to really need them

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.070 
them gently you have to really need them
you<00:00:46.680> see<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.490> marbling<00:00:48.000> effect<00:00:48.120> that's

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
you see this marbling effect that's

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.470 
you see this marbling effect that's
there<00:00:49.380> you<00:00:49.650> don't<00:00:50.400> want<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.790> it<00:00:51.030> has<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.330> be<00:00:51.450> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
there you don't want that it has to be a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.840 
there you don't want that it has to be a
uniform<00:00:51.960> color<00:00:52.200> so<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:53.070> mix<00:00:53.310> them<00:00:53.580> until

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
uniform color so really mix them until

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.590 
uniform color so really mix them until
it's<00:00:54.150> all<00:00:54.330> together<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:57.000> also<00:00:57.150> have<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> do

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
it's all together you also have to do

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.180 
it's all together you also have to do
this<00:00:57.720> quite<00:00:57.990> quickly<00:00:58.260> because<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.980> mold

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
this quite quickly because the mold

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.000 
this quite quickly because the mold
starts<00:00:59.610> to<00:00:59.760> set<00:01:00.000> usually<00:01:00.900> takes<00:01:01.170> between<00:01:01.350> two

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
starts to set usually takes between two

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.380 
starts to set usually takes between two
and<00:01:02.130> five<00:01:02.310> minutes<00:01:02.370> depending<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.329> your

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and five minutes depending on your

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.510 
and five minutes depending on your
molding<00:01:03.900> compound<00:01:10.009> once<00:01:11.009> it's<00:01:11.219> thoroughly

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
molding compound once it's thoroughly

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.370 
molding compound once it's thoroughly
mixed<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.270> I'm<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.749> to<00:01:12.810> roll<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.079> into<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
mixed in I'm going to roll it into a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.209 
mixed in I'm going to roll it into a
ball<00:01:14.539> place<00:01:15.539> it<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:16.020> table<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> nonstick

ball place it on the table or a nonstick

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.669 
ball place it on the table or a nonstick
surface<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.990> you're<00:01:19.109> gonna<00:01:19.229> take<00:01:19.469> your

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.419 
I'm just gonna use this shell and push
it<00:01:24.329> in<00:01:24.479> gently<00:01:24.899> making<00:01:25.679> sure<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.249> don't

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
it in gently making sure that you don't

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.489 
it in gently making sure that you don't
push<00:01:26.729> too<00:01:26.999> far<00:01:27.329> so<00:01:27.719> that<00:01:27.749> it<00:01:27.960> comes<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.350> the

push too far so that it comes out the

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:33.260 
push too far so that it comes out the
other<00:01:28.560> side<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:31.549> that's<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:33.030> I'm<00:01:33.149> going

other side and that's it now I'm going
to<00:01:33.359> leave<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.689> for<00:01:33.719> a<00:01:33.840> couple<00:01:34.109> of<00:01:34.170> minutes<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
to leave it for a couple of minutes and

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:41.389 
to leave it for a couple of minutes and
it's<00:01:35.249> gonna<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.609> hard<00:01:39.439> okay<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.799> now<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:41.280> just

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
it's gonna go hard okay so now I'm just

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:42.709 
it's gonna go hard okay so now I'm just
going<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.609> check<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.179> a<00:01:42.240> couple<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.479> minutes

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
going to check it's a couple of minutes

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.020 
going to check it's a couple of minutes
later<00:01:42.929> if<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.469> piece<00:01:43.649> has<00:01:43.829> gone<00:01:44.009> hard<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.880> I'm

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
later if the piece has gone hard so I'm

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.279 
later if the piece has gone hard so I'm
just<00:01:45.179> going<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.329> put<00:01:45.479> my<00:01:45.509> finger<00:01:45.869> now<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.170> the

just going to put my finger now on the
side<00:01:46.529> and<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.459> doesn't<00:01:47.700> make<00:01:47.819> a<00:01:47.850> mark<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
side and if it doesn't make a mark it

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.870 
side and if it doesn't make a mark it
means<00:01:48.569> that<00:01:48.779> it's<00:01:48.929> set<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.520> take<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.789> off

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
means that it's set so I can take it off
