00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
somewhere between 1st and 3rd like maybe

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.830 
somewhere between 1st and 3rd like maybe
they<00:02:54.310> could<00:02:54.430> upset<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.700> entire<00:02:54.850> group<00:02:55.329> the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
they could upset the entire group the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.870 
they could upset the entire group the
problem<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.560> their<00:02:56.799> region<00:02:57.220> is<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:57.489> shallow

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
problem is their region is so shallow

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.600 
problem is their region is so shallow
you<00:02:58.630> it's<00:02:59.019> like<00:02:59.260> they<00:02:59.620> have<00:02:59.739> HQ<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.489> then<00:03:00.579> a

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
you it's like they have HQ and then a

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.530 
you it's like they have HQ and then a
bunch<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.820> like<00:03:00.970> clg's<00:03:01.450> like<00:03:01.959> mostly<00:03:03.090> are<00:03:04.090> not

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
bunch of like clg's like mostly are not

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.449 
bunch of like clg's like mostly are not
really<00:03:05.109> big<00:03:05.290> tests<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.829> so<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.010> say<00:03:06.310> like

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
really big tests and so you say like

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.860 
really big tests and so you say like
they<00:03:06.579> have<00:03:06.670> these<00:03:06.820> really<00:03:06.880> fast<00:03:07.299> game<00:03:07.570> times

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
they have these really fast game times

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.960 
they have these really fast game times
but<00:03:08.109> like<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:09.220> doesn't<00:03:09.489> necessarily<00:03:09.609> mean

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
but like that doesn't necessarily mean

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.390 
but like that doesn't necessarily mean
anything<00:03:10.000> for<00:03:10.840> for<00:03:11.290> TPA<00:03:11.890> here<00:03:12.130> so<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.280> don't

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
anything for for TPA here so I don't

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.880 
anything for for TPA here so I don't
know<00:03:12.609> how<00:03:13.060> strong<00:03:13.120> necessarily<00:03:13.870> are<00:03:14.079> but

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
know how strong necessarily are but

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.140 
know how strong necessarily are but
maybe<00:03:15.100> they're<00:03:15.310> actually<00:03:15.579> incredible<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.060> may

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
maybe they're actually incredible it may

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.729 
maybe they're actually incredible it may
be<00:03:16.209> they<00:03:16.329> finish<00:03:16.540> number<00:03:16.780> one<00:03:16.930> but<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.500> me<00:03:17.590> it's

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739
