00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:02.408
So you can change your nationality for love?

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.200
Yes of course. (A new romanticist?)

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.380
I can find a new way if I am in love.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.360
I can do something good for a country.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.320
I am not talking about politics or politicians but for the country, history, culture and heritage.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.100
(A country is not a simple concept that can be dealt by an individual.)

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.650
Each individual makes a country.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.100
If I believe I need to take that path, I should and make a new life with the girl.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.562
(Proving that he is a true romanticist.)

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.260
I don’t think you will be working for Brazilian Embassy for long.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.620
It is our choice.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.660
If we choose the girl, we need to give up everything we’ve been working on so far.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.760
But things we’ve been working on are not done by myself only but with others.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.720
(The matter involves others, not a choice of my own.)

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.500
In case I choose the country, I can protect the country if I alone just give up.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.424
Oh~

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.660
(Zhang Yuan became logical after debating for a year.)

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.320
So all 20 will be killed if we prepare together.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.040
My point is that a country can change.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.900
We don’t know how things will turn out in a country.
Nobody can make an accurate prediction.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.827
Carlos, I think this is the case.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.280
People are worthy and there are neighbors around you.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.340
As Zhang Yuan said before, a country is family, friend and the place where you were born and raised.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.960
How could you give it all up for one love?

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:45.035
Love can change

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.800
Love changes and we divorce.
What would happen if we abandoned the country too?

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.700
We call it true love.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.680
This love is truly huge.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.920
If we love someone, we can let that person go because of love.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.244
(We let her go because we love her.)

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.080
If we love her so much, it would be better if we didn’t marry her to protect her

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:10.307
And stop loving her.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.320
(So into playing spy role)

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.360
If you love this woman so much so you tell her the secret and got caught

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.276
Then she has to die with me.

00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:20.914
There are many cases like this.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.420
There is that kind of dilemma even if you don’t die together.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.580
I don’t think I would ever be happy because of guilt after abandoning my country.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.042
I have 2 different points.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.320
As Zhang Yuan said, it is good to go for your love

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.940
But people who has been preparing with you will be jeopardized

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.520
And giving up your family

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.580
Would you be OK with everything?

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.880
If I believe that the love is true love

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.880
You wouldn’t know if you were in that situation

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.060
It was an opportunity to listen to what everyone thinks about the issue.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.420
That’s’ right.
