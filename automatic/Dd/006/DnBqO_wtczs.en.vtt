00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.660
 This is the LG Optimus that has a phone 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.179
 which costs more than 500 euros in the store 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.529
 and this is also the nexus 4 of lg and 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.029
 it costs slightly less than in the store 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.919
 400 euros 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.390
 But why would you want your name better? 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.829
 spend money for almost the same 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.399
 phone 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.399
 that takes care of it 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.690
 just to start with a difference 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.040
 between these two phones that are huge 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.170
 catches the eye 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.940
 that is the difference in design the nexus 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.900
 4 has some rounder shapes and the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.000
 optimistic 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.320
 yes that is simply a bit more angular one 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.900
 Another difference, of course, is that below 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.620
 the screen at the optimistic 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.080
 allowing touch sensitive buttons 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.700
 Nexus 4 is not like that but there are 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.230
 also huge similarities in such 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.400
 they are both made of glass 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.710
 both from the front and the back 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.870
 and with both is at the back too 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.570
 to see a pattern even though that neighborhood 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.400
 with both phones that is off and it is one 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.720
 kind of you holographic pattern if you 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.640
 the soul holds him in the light 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.290
 reflect and that is very cool 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.630
 effect at least if you like it 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.619
 and other elements in the design that 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.390
 deviates 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.890
 that is the bulge at the back 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.600
 for the camera 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.100
 and that is very clearly noticeable too 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.630
 if in your pocket 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.610
 if you leave your hand in your pocket 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.900
 disappear to grab your phone then 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.479
 You notice that it is actually best 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.760
 annoying and that is because lg for it 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.350
 has chosen in 13 megapixel camera 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.720
 to put this phone there is 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.479
 also a version with an 8 megapixel 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.280
 cameras under bulge and what us 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.020
 that is just the same for the Netherlands for the Netherlands 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.729
 be able to choose well 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.640
 this optimist has that hardware 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.960
 some things for the nexus 4 like that 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.170
 for example , the optimistic has one 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.300
 FM radio that does not have in Nexus 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.770
 supports the optimist see also 4g and 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.200
 that seems now or not so important but 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.520
 if you have been using a telephone for 2 or 3 years 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.990
 yes it can also be pretty important 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.750
 be becomes 4g network and those are coming 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.180
 all in our country and kpn already has it 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.790
 and third the optimus that has 32i 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.610
 go internal memory storage memory to 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.140
 nexus 4 has a maximum of 16 and at the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.270
 phone too we do not have expandable 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.610
 memory so you are really committed to it 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.350
 that is the 16 crazy stra of the optimus 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.360
 title very nice 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.280
 another big difference is the software 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.080
 the nexus 4 yes that is of course one 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.000
 Google phone therefore always runs on the 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.680
 latest version of android and 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.540
 will be the first to receive updates 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.520
 so that's very nice that's something you 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.010
 of LG phones generally do not 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.840
 can say because lg updates and phone 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.030
 only rarely is there long 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.840
 unclear and updates coming slow 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.830
 within 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.870
 so for that matter you are sitting a bit 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.460
 stuck to the android 4 point one point two 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.760
 that stands up 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.709
 lg has also added its own skin 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.689
 and that is characterized by that year 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.209
 quite a few features such as 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.500
 once the notification bar completely different 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.230
 it is actually quite busy 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.140
 torres at the top of the round are cue slide 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.879
 apps that is a very striking name 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.720
 for it actually kind of a widget 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.549
 to be 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.780
 a small applications that you on top 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.709
 can paste the screen for 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.030
 for example a quick one 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.610
 calculator 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.739
 underneath is another slider around the 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.269
 adjust brightness and below 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.859
 stands a bar with time date and one 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.299
 button to the settings 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.040
 so that means when you get in the phone 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.540
 landscape actually loves you 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.340
 hardly have more room left for 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.680
 what the notification bar is for 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.000
 namely notifications that is only one 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.129
 of the points showing this 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.930
 quite a heavy skin is another 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.000
 distinctive element of the lg skin 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.230
 that is skeuomorphism 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.900
 and that is a difficult word for things 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.450
 that are digital but on analogue matters 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.370
 should look like the switches are on 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.379
 turn things on and off 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.849
 those are really switching like we are in it 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.040
 really look like 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.090
 and also when you add things to a folder 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.040
 yes then it seems like a hold 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.019
 file folder he is also yellow he opens 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.430
 he closes and things like that 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.290
 you notice that lg 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.540
 yes that skin just a bit like 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.370
 arrange that it resembles analogue matters 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.930
 you have to love 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.549
 one of the things on which this optimist 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.769
 that performs best 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.130
 that is the battery life has a 21 100 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.019
 million per battery and partly due to apparently 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.360
 optimizations in the software or the 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.080
 snapdragon s4 pro processor that is in it 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.090
 sit 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.340
 actually it really good he 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.470
 lasts 16 hours with heavy use that is 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.810
 so a full day that is as much as 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.520
 a full the htc one of the galaxy note 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.220
 2 and that is quite a decent one 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.930
 performance to new both larger battery 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.340
 perhaps consumption is the battery consumption 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.110
 also 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.370
 easily more than limited 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.960
 five days 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.909
 with that he is also in the top of all 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.460
 our lists and that is a good one 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.169
 performance for their phone like this 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.940
 one of the things in which the nexus 4 is one 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.419
 optimist who are the same that's it 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:01.169
 screen comes with a 4.7 once eps LCD with 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:04.199
 a resolution of 1280 by 768 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.580
 that is indeed not 7020 pixels in the 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.380
 in width that makes the image 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.729
 slightly wider than with many others 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.559
 telephones different 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.569
 I'm pretty nice the screen is too 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:13.379
 very nice in both cases it is 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.999
 sharp 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.159
 the good contrast is good the colors 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:19.110
 look beautiful its best naturally 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.639
 in short, that is all very well 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.379
 the only point on which he big 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.639
 lags behind phones this year 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.650
 came true 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.900
 yes that is the resolution a lot 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.809
 other phones have mails full HD 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.819
 1920 by 1080 pixels and that has this one 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:34.499
 so not optimistic and you can see that 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:36.960
 solid even though it is the difference with this one 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:39.330
 resolution is not that big 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.949
 the camera that is said to be a 13 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.020
 here is the megapixel camera 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.499
 back with a single LED 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.330
 flash 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:46.379
 it must be said that makes pretty sharp 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.990
 pictures as the light conditions 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.999
 well we are the color is beautiful 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.289
 enough detail in short that is best 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:54.180
 beautiful pictures 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.439
 but as soon as the light becomes less than 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.899
 it quickly becomes less and that comes 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:59.669
 because the sensor size is the same as 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.620
 that 8 megapixel cameras 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.509
 pixels are smaller so less can 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.860
 capture light and that makes it like it 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.149
 what is darker is that he soon 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.149
 late and that's quite a pity 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.330
 both the optimus die and the nexus 4 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.380
 came in many in November last year 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.000
 countries 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.590
 there are now widely available in 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.520
 although the nexus 4 never in the Netherlands 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.140
 came out 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.990
 seen as just being in the price 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.850
 for sale and for the 130 euros extra that already 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.800
 he asks for the optimus gee 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.720
 you actually only get 4g and 16 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.520
 gigabyte extra but you are not 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.530
 always assured of the newest 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.960
 Android version that does have the Nexus 4 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.790
 that actually makes the optimist here 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.390
 a little attractive phone for that 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:45.330
 many people 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.330
 because it is simply too expensive and too late
