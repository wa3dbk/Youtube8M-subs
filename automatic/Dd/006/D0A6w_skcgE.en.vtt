00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.020

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.869
 activate these powers in the chat we are going to 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.320
 put the following command that would be 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.140
 bar list then we will give you enter to 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.420
 that is activated and how they can be given 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.710
 account appears this box which 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.290
 contains all the powers 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.239
 let's go try one by one first 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.180
 we have the fist of fire let's go out 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.660
 to prove it 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.250
 and here I have some good test cows 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.440
 Fire chicken for them prendiera 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.700
 fire to mold that we attack 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.700
 then we have 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.769
 then we have the fist shooter that fist 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.780
 it does not do anything I'm already trying it 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.780
 then we have the murderous fist 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.500
 this fist good this power what does 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.410
 is to kill the way of a single hole see and 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.780
 also sets them on fire as they can 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.180
 give an account in the lower right 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.560
 we see a button that is to restart and 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.290
 if you do not have to touch each time 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.180
 have to want to change their power 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.130
 because if they do not touch it they are going to 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.850
 combine all the effects so let's 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.850
 to restart it 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.700
 then we will make an explosive fist 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.210
 This will make the mobile that we attack 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.100
 well exploded see the kun and how it 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.049
 you can give account leaves as you see a 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.070
 cross-shaped crater 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:48.979
 let's restart let's go with the next 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.260
 then we have the regenerative fist 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.380
 I have not tried it but let's see 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.380
 watch 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.340
 or if I remember when they have little 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.380
 life or for example when they lack life 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.050
 they have to attack or rather hit 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.090
 an animal to which it is and you are 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.220
 It will generate to life but the life 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.530
 poor animal will go down that's what 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.230
 bad 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.900
 let's see what follows 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.690
 then we have the fist destroyer this 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.319
 see what you do see see you see 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.319
 ready guys 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.760
 what it does is like a peak of 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.860
 see diamond but stronger with 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.810
 a single touch removes it 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.810
 let's see which one follows 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.570
 this later we have the mountable fist 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.820
 this the truth that from here on 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.730
 I did not try them anymore, let's see, let's see 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.040
 what do you do or fuck like you can give 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.500
 count on this with this fist we can 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.790
 mount to the box mods and to lower it not 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.010
 we just have to jump 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.799
 and excuse me if my voice is a bit strange 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.940
 but I do not know what I have, let's see which 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:05.870
 follow after we have a strong fist 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.700
 let's try it the strong fist 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.360
 the strong fist the truth that I do not know what 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.830
 let's see what else we have or 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.100
 I thought I was going to attack the cow I do not know 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.140
 why 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.970
 I'm just going to tell you why 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.830
 serves more or less the arachnid fist the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.540
 I really do not know what the fist of 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.820

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.980
 of hitting a move the fist of the going to 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.170
 let lava fist diamond the truth 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.770
 I do not know what to do so better 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.819
 let's try it 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.310
 we're going to try it 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.560

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.359

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.080
 diamond every time they hit a 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:48.730
 move with diamonds for all 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.200
 let's restart this 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.200
 and we will continue with others 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.440
 the golden fist will spoil the gold 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.450

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.909
 meteor I do not know what to do so we're going to 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.769
 prove it close with that power and lack of 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.120
 spelling guys 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.920
 but let's continue let's see for 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.099
 What's the use of the meteor fist? I think it's going to 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.470
 be a super explosion and if guys see 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.199
 How much cause do I recommend you do? 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.449
 the guys see me I loved more 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.449
 Literally guys can be 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.760
 stop I'm going to change to creative for 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:31.080
 to get out of this damn crater 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:34.050
 does not recommend using the portal is 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.730
 more guided than nothing 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:42.030
 so I better go to this place 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.100
 Well, here, but if 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.310
 we flip back from balaguer good 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.700
 let's continue with the others they were missing 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.700
 few 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.040
 then we have the ironman fist that the 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.610
 I really do not know what to do I hope and I do not 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.340
 cause the because if not if it will be very 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.510
 the created one is going to be a video its collegiate 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.270
 the we will not put a vaquita here 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.730
 and this list 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.070
 hahaha sorry guys can be given 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.290
 account the ironman takes off flying the way 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.450
 that we hit and well nothing guys I think 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.830
 that would be all of us going to check 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.230
 yes they are all 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.540
 and if as you can tell, those are 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.730
 we are all going to close this and good 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.070
 remember that it is only a point js 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.900
 so they only import the script and 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.250
 it is ready and well nothing friends I think 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.920
