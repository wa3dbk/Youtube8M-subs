thought<00:00:45.230> you<00:00:45.380> should<00:00:45.590> be<00:00:45.770> allowed<00:00:46.220> to<00:00:46.280> have<00:00:46.610> a

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
thought you should be allowed to have a

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.700 
thought you should be allowed to have a
scrimmage<00:00:47.060> or<00:00:47.360> a<00:00:47.450> mixed<00:00:47.720> practice<00:00:48.290> with<00:00:48.500> some

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
scrimmage or a mixed practice with some

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.640 
scrimmage or a mixed practice with some
other<00:00:48.890> team<00:00:49.220> you<00:00:49.520> know<00:00:50.080> not<00:00:51.080> unlike<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.620> NFL

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
other team you know not unlike the NFL

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.510 
other team you know not unlike the NFL
does<00:00:52.280> I<00:00:52.490> mean<00:00:52.640> if<00:00:53.560> you<00:00:54.560> know<00:00:54.650> if<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:54.920> NCAA<00:00:55.310> is

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
does I mean if you know if the NCAA is

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.490 
does I mean if you know if the NCAA is
not<00:00:55.730> comfortable<00:00:56.060> scrimmaging<00:00:56.960> another<00:00:57.230> team

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
not comfortable scrimmaging another team

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.640 
not comfortable scrimmaging another team
I<00:00:57.670> think<00:00:58.670> yata<00:00:59.080> people<00:01:00.080> have<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:00.290> mixed

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
I think yata people have a mixed

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.820 
I think yata people have a mixed
practice<00:01:01.190> with<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.900> team<00:01:02.900> you<00:01:03.050> don't<00:01:03.260> play<00:01:03.530> you

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
practice with a team you don't play you

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.980 
practice with a team you don't play you

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
you do scale you do one-on-one and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.550 
you do scale you do one-on-one and
inside<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.859> and<00:01:10.429> you<00:01:11.149> know<00:01:11.179> with<00:01:11.560> with

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.819 
inside and and you know with with
somebody<00:01:13.249> else<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:13.939> know<00:01:14.299> you<00:01:14.390> get

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
somebody else so you know you get

everybody's got little characteristics

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.969 
everybody's got little characteristics
as<00:01:17.359> far<00:01:17.569> as<00:01:17.689> their<00:01:17.840> style<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.319> play<00:01:18.530> what<00:01:18.799> they

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
as far as their style of play what they

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.760 
as far as their style of play what they
do<00:01:19.039> and<00:01:19.600> just<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.780> mix<00:01:20.929> it<00:01:21.079> up<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.409> think<00:01:21.590> they'd

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
do and just to mix it up I think they'd

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.559 
do and just to mix it up I think they'd
make<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.130> interesting<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:22.880> know<00:01:22.909> where<00:01:23.210> you

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
make it interesting you know where you

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.239 
make it interesting you know where you
just<00:01:23.749> have<00:01:23.929> a<00:01:23.960> split<00:01:24.319> practice<00:01:24.829> or<00:01:24.979> something

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:25.249 
just have a split practice or something

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:27.459 
just have a split practice or something
like<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.369> it<00:01:26.030> brought<00:01:26.270> that<00:01:26.509> idea<00:01:26.749> to<00:01:27.140> anyone

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
like that it brought that idea to anyone

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.620 
like that it brought that idea to anyone
yeah<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.579> you<00:01:28.969> know<00:01:29.119> i<00:01:29.149> mean<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:29.979> it's<00:01:31.630> it's

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
yeah and you know i mean it it's it's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.719 
yeah and you know i mean it it's it's
received<00:01:33.200> with<00:01:33.499> a<00:01:33.530> big<00:01:33.799> file<00:01:34.009> would<00:01:34.130> look<00:01:34.429> and

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
received with a big file would look and

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.330 
received with a big file would look and
then<00:01:34.909> in<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.420> lot<00:01:35.569> but<00:01:36.439> I<00:01:36.469> I<00:01:36.619> think<00:01:37.130> it'd<00:01:37.219> be<00:01:37.249> a

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
then in a lot but I I think it'd be a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.279 
then in a lot but I I think it'd be a
good<00:01:37.399> idea<00:01:37.579> i<00:01:37.880> mean<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:40.159> know<00:01:40.630> it's<00:01:41.630> just<00:01:41.840> kind

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
good idea i mean you know it's just kind

of you can either you could either have

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.719 
of you can either you could either have
a<00:01:44.749> mixed<00:01:45.079> practice<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.799> then<00:01:45.920> go<00:01:46.159> live<00:01:46.429> and

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
drill

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.440 
drill
I<00:01:52.220> mean<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:52.490> think<00:01:52.580> that'd<00:01:52.910> be<00:01:53.060> very<00:01:53.270> valuable

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
system pull out a bit the biggest thing

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.340 
system pull out a bit the biggest thing
is<00:02:49.460> they're<00:02:50.270> in<00:02:50.360> better<00:02:50.510> shape<00:02:50.630> physically

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
is they're in better shape physically

we're in a lot better shape physically

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.460 
we're in a lot better shape physically
and<00:02:54.290> then<00:02:54.500> I'd<00:02:54.650> say<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:57.050> know<00:02:57.170> we<00:02:57.320> had<00:02:57.440> a

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
and then I'd say you know we had a

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.530 
and then I'd say you know we had a
productive<00:02:57.800> summer<00:02:58.280> from<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.209> standpoint

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
productive summer from the standpoint

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
productive summer from the standpoint
people<00:03:00.020> came<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.410> i<00:03:01.130> guess<00:03:01.640> maybe<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.780> pretty

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
people came in i guess maybe a pretty

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.760 
people came in i guess maybe a pretty
polish<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.190> start<00:03:04.459> out<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.590> thought

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
polish to start out and so I thought

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.550 
polish to start out and so I thought
that<00:03:06.830> was<00:03:07.130> good<00:03:07.400> i<00:03:07.430> mean<00:03:07.640> they<00:03:07.850> clearly<00:03:08.180> a

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
that was good i mean they clearly a

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.930 
that was good i mean they clearly a
dedicated<00:03:09.560> does<00:03:09.890> some<00:03:10.100> time<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.580> effort<00:03:10.700> that

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
dedicated does some time and effort that

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.729 
dedicated does some time and effort that
to<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.450> summer<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:12.050> i<00:03:12.320> thought<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:12.560> was

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
to the summer and i thought that was

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.070 
to the summer and i thought that was
good<00:03:13.209> which<00:03:14.209> everyone's<00:03:14.570> used<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.810> seeing

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
good which everyone's used to seeing

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.510 
good which everyone's used to seeing
marquis<00:03:15.440> out<00:03:15.620> there<00:03:15.860> but<00:03:16.040> you've<00:03:16.160> also<00:03:16.280> got

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
marquis out there but you've also got

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.460 
marquis out there but you've also got
some<00:03:16.730> freshman<00:03:17.120> wide<00:03:17.300> outs<00:03:17.510> that<00:03:18.290> have<00:03:18.380> been

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
some freshman wide outs that have been

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.660 
some freshman wide outs that have been
playing<00:03:18.709> pretty<00:03:18.890> well<00:03:19.010> he's<00:03:19.280> kind<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.520> talk

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
playing pretty well he's kind of talk

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.040 
playing pretty well he's kind of talk
about<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:20.120> potential<00:03:20.420> for<00:03:20.690> those<00:03:20.810> guys<00:03:20.989> to

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
about the potential for those guys to

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.110 
about the potential for those guys to
contribute<00:03:21.680> maybe<00:03:22.040> earlier<00:03:22.370> earlier<00:03:22.700> than

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
contribute maybe earlier earlier than

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.080 
contribute maybe earlier earlier than
sooner<00:03:23.330> than<00:03:23.510> later<00:03:23.630> Wow<00:03:24.019> Gabe<00:03:24.380> marks<00:03:24.620> and

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
sooner than later Wow Gabe marks and

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.640 
sooner than later Wow Gabe marks and
Brett<00:03:26.090> bartoloni<00:03:26.570> have<00:03:26.780> played<00:03:27.260> real<00:03:27.470> well

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
Brett bartoloni have played real well

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.330 
Brett bartoloni have played real well
and<00:03:28.360> I<00:03:29.360> think<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:30.170> lot<00:03:30.560> of<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.800> has<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.010> do

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
and I think that a lot of it has to do

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.680 
and I think that a lot of it has to do
with<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.580> fact<00:03:31.610> they<00:03:32.060> have<00:03:32.269> a<00:03:32.300> real<00:03:32.540> good

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
with the fact they have a real good

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.720 
with the fact they have a real good
sense<00:03:33.019> of<00:03:33.200> space

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
sense of space

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.720 
sense of space
marks<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.750> know<00:03:35.780> as<00:03:36.349> a<00:03:36.800> freshman<00:03:37.400> which<00:03:37.550> this

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
marks you know as a freshman which this

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.720 
marks you know as a freshman which this
almost<00:03:37.970> never<00:03:38.120> happens<00:03:39.010> is<00:03:40.010> coming<00:03:40.580> as<00:03:40.700> a

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
almost never happens is coming as a

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.320 
almost never happens is coming as a
fairly<00:03:41.150> polished<00:03:41.599> receiver<00:03:43.120> bartoloni<00:03:44.120> is

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
fairly polished receiver bartoloni is

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.940 
fairly polished receiver bartoloni is
impressive<00:03:44.900> from<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:45.140> standpoint<00:03:45.409> played

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
impressive from the standpoint played

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.040

running<00:03:46.220> back

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
running back

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.590 
running back
and<00:03:47.890> still<00:03:48.400> has<00:03:48.520> a<00:03:48.550> sense<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:49.030> space<00:03:49.300> as<00:03:49.570> a

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
and still has a sense of space as a

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.860 
and still has a sense of space as a
receiver<00:03:50.110> so<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.070> think<00:03:51.190> that's<00:03:51.640> been<00:03:51.970> really

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870

positive<00:03:53.200> and

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
positive and

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.899 
positive and
so<00:03:55.319> goat<00:03:55.500> over<00:03:55.650> there<00:03:55.920> at<00:03:56.010> linebacker<00:03:56.250> has

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909
