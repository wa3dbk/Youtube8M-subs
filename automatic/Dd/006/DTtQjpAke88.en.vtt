 this little video I'm going to show you 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.710
 how to add external memory 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.719
 from a usb key 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.640
 of course overselling xbox but also on 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.869
 ps3 i do not know how to do but i 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.930

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.970
 of 32 if you have above normally 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.920

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.020
