set out to design dolphin black we knew

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.950 
set out to design dolphin black we knew
that<00:03:11.250> these<00:03:11.370> would<00:03:11.580> be<00:03:11.750> competing<00:03:12.750> priorities

that these would be competing priorities
in<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:14.010> design<00:03:14.280> process<00:03:14.570> you<00:03:15.570> know<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
in the design process you know the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.140 
in the design process you know the
consumer<00:03:16.320> user<00:03:16.800> experience<00:03:17.490> with<00:03:18.030> the

like<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.760> 99<00:03:21.210> es<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.470> we<00:03:22.590> had<00:03:22.710> to<00:03:22.740> go<00:03:22.920> about

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
like the 99 es so we had to go about

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.610 
like the 99 es so we had to go about
this<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.640> new<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.090> different<00:03:24.120> ways<00:03:24.450> we<00:03:25.260> had<00:03:25.470> to

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
this in new and different ways we had to

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.890 
this in new and different ways we had to
send<00:03:25.860> our<00:03:26.010> engineers<00:03:26.490> to<00:03:26.970> observe<00:03:27.330> customers

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
send our engineers to observe customers

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.690

once<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.770> start<00:03:29.010> talking<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.370> them<00:03:29.550> you

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
once you start talking to them you

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.390 
once you start talking to them you
change<00:03:29.940> what<00:03:30.120> they<00:03:30.240> do<00:03:30.300> we<00:03:31.260> had<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.740> design

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
change what they do we had to design

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.360 
change what they do we had to design
questionnaires<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:33.600> studies<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.710> games<00:03:34.980> and

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
questionnaires and studies and games and

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.430 
questionnaires and studies and games and
interviews<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.570> we<00:03:36.660> could<00:03:36.780> really<00:03:37.080> get

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
interviews so that we could really get

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.950 
interviews so that we could really get
two<00:03:37.770> and<00:03:38.040> three<00:03:38.280> layers<00:03:38.550> down<00:03:38.910> from<00:03:39.690> what<00:03:39.840> it

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
two and three layers down from what it

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.380 
two and three layers down from what it
was<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:40.440> really<00:03:40.920> makes<00:03:41.160> people<00:03:41.700> drive<00:03:42.360> a

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
was that really makes people drive a

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.430 
was that really makes people drive a
decision<00:03:43.080> in<00:03:43.170> their<00:03:43.290> organization<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:46.290> we're

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
decision in their organization so we're

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.840
