00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.910
 I need to know where I came from. 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:26.000
 I need to know where the source is, and it's not important that I realized it. 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:30.020
 I do not know the root of my enlightenment, and I do not know. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.260
 Even if you wear one outfit at the factory 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:37.610
 It's mad. 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:45.290
 It's made in China. 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:46.159
 The design was created where something like this ballpoint made one more here 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.339
 There is a person. 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:54.170
 Where the hell did you make it? 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:59.900
 I'm telling you where you made it. 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:03.949
 I do not know where the beginning of my enlightenment is . 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:09.799
 And if you do not know where Paul of my Enlightenment is 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:16.100
 It will be self-defeating, or it will fall into the consciousness of harm. 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:21.299
 I can find the roots, find the sources, know the basics, but I know. 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:29.020
 You know that the root of enlightenment is your grandfather. 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:36.490
 I know, but I do not want to forget this. 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:38.229
 I want to continue searching and deepening my roots of enlightenment more deeply . 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.140
 I will 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:46.420
 Be grateful first. 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:52.310
 It creates a phenomenon that can not help but be thankful 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:55.820
 It is a good attitude and a right attitude 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.780
 A polite person is treated everywhere. 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:04.430
 Yes, but without manners. 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:09.979
 There is a time to take chicken bone even if we take this money cheaply. 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:16.640
 There is no courtesy and I know that I know all about the heavens 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:22.760
 It is a good attitude to receive complete blessings and aura from heaven 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:27.960
 So, what's the most polite attitude, and I have to thank you first. 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:35.540
 Thank you very much. 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:42.590
 Before the phenomenon happens, you can imagine, believe, and be confident, and thank you first. 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:44.940
 This is the most basic religion that religious people should have. 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.150
 I believe in attitude. 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:54.630
 I could never thank you not to mind no one 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:56.070
 I was hurt and hurt just to say that I am thankful in that situation 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.330
 That's it. 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:06.270
 At that time, heaven pursued the heart of gratitude 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:10.740
 Thanks to'll give paste according to the phenomenon does not only 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:16.500
 I will tremble your souls of gratitude . 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:20.520
 It will awaken each and every one of your organs and make them survive. 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:26.010
 Just habitually thank you. 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.390
 But what about the habit of gratitude no matter if to live in the twenty won tremors 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.660
 I can not support it.

 Thank you and love you. 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:40.970
 It's not habitual 1, it's love. 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:47.880
 And so is gratitude. So even in difficult and difficult conditions, 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:51.810
 Thank you for your courage .

 Well then, I was the first to do it.

 I am thankful to be followed by edd 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:14.489
