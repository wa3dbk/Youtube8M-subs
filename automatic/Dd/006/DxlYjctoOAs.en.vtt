00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.120
 Hello 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.090
 in this video I will explain what are shades 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.799
 semitones surplus musical 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.410
 this knowledge is essential for 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.850
 we can continue on the rest of the song 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.529
 Let's start by looking at the keyboard. 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.990
 of the piano 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.060
 if we look closely we see that the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.140
 piano keyboard has a key pattern 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.390
 white and black keys wertinho east 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.020
 default is one octave 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.300
 that is, we have the dollar bills if 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.820
 then we get pissed off again in a 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.250
 more acute recording 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.010
 the white keys are the natural notes 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.989
 I do not know if they are part of the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.510
 largest scale 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.829
 these black keys are the accidents 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.440
 musical 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.289
 musical accidents are used to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.640
 m each increase or decrease of a tone 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.280
 natural note 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.760
 a me tomtom and the shortest distance 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.190
 between each key on the cam for example is 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.180
 What's the score for climbing a few? 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.720
 cemetery 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.780
 we have this black key the black keys 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.910
 may have two names 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.080
 In these cases, if the increase is 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:25.390
 note flames do sharp however if 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.820
 would have to decrease the note see natural 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.700
 this note z flames of the mall 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.210
 so when we increase a note symptom 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.750
 using substituted has this 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.479
 symbol when we diminish one made me 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.570
 a natural examination note the symbol of the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.840
 mall than an baby in italic 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.660
 these notes called notes in harmonics 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.670
 which means they have different names 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.670
 but the sound is the same 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:05.260
 so let's see all the notes on the piano 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:11.380
 right hand or right hand wheel 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:16.569
 to the midway mall mi f fá sharp the sun 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:23.420
 of the sol sun node replaced or lip mall 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:26.120
 there it's sharp or move that 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.739
 the distance between each of these notes 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.819
 is a semi tô a antónio is nothing more than 2 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.550
 millions 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.239
 for example if we move the note back to 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.140
 note 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.480
 me and we raised 2 million then we can 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.080
 say that back to me 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.959
 we have a tone that is two good times 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.480
 in the next video we'll see how to put in 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.330
 practice and shinawatra musical screen 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.260
 subscribe a video will be very like 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.260
 and until the next
