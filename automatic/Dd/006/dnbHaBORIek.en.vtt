00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:10.209
 hello friends from youtube I am place 3,036 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.860
 and in this video because this video is a 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.770
 continuation of my other video entitled 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.510
 how to fight bullying in this video 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.970
 I'm going to show you weak points in the 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.310
 human body I will classify them in 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.950
 three degrees l grade one is for you 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.710
 enemy picture the grade 2 is for 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.330
 knock him out and grade 3 is to kill him 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.840
 good let's start now 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.210
 the first is a blow to the nose 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.489
 when you hit this part with enough 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.860
 force bleed a lot and your tears do not 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.350
 they will arrive 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.670
 so you can apply this blow with 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.300
 that asshole that bothers you 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.890
 so I'm telling you blowjobs have 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.520
 bron is a blow to the nose 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.700
 that will stop him for a while believe me 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 good then go grades 2 and 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.100
 3 therefore very dangerous use them with 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.510
 responsibility and this channel is not done 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.560
 responsible for its misuse 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.560
 good let's start 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.939
 the first blow is to the apple of adam 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.890
 a strong blow in this region of 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.729
 neck can cause your enemy to 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.180
 suffocation or so if you like jail 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.659
 and you want to go soon then to 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.740
 someone this blow and I assure you that 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.930
 at least 15 years of imprisonment will be dictated 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.110
 well here is another hook the jaw 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.450
 a powerful blow in the form of a hook to 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.920
 The front of the jaw can 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.320
 break your enemy's neck 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.510
 resulting in where in an outcome 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.110
 fatal 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.940
 therefore he will also die if 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.360
 do you want me to die 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.610
 he no longer disarms his to this blow anymore 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.480
 you will no longer have to buy ammo weapons 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.870
 I do not use this blow from the jaw 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.080
 here goes another blow to the abdomen to this 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.380
 it seems quite then quite harmless 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.090
 but it is a very dangerous blow a blow 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.180
 substantial this area could but 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.220
 vital organs causing death 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.240
 this blow is dangerous 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.660
 for this the next next this is 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.410
 a key 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.760
 where I use the one I almost always use 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.220
 I use it very often 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.709
 and I can assure you that you can pass out 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.810
 the ones when I've only knocked out 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.730
 the faint ones 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.780
 and sometimes seizures 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.920
 please do not do not use with many 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.630
 responsibilities 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.850
 this choke no key 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.490
 Well, this is one of the favorites of the 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.420
 responsible for enforcing the law often 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.420
 with deadly results 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.020
 now I explain to you how the 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.990
 right arm goes over the right shoulder 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.810
 of the enemy and this takes the back 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.690
 of the head the right arm is approaching 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.670
 over his left shoulder and extends 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.560
 through the neck he grabs his own 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.709
 right forearm with enough pressure 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.610
 applied causes brain damage or death 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.950
 or you can leave him asshole for life 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.010
 or you can kill him 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.460
 you decide if you use it or not 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.120
 and goes to another 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.489
 it's a jerk in the head 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.670
 now goes its realization tips to 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.970
 enemy forward takes his head and 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.950
 Pull back with convenient force 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.070
 this movement can separate from the 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.650
 work of fencing vertebrae 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.990
 provoke from the source 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.830
 they passed is I'm a fool I do not know how to read 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.830
 I can not read 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.740
 good if this movement can separate 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:07.210
 delicate vertebrae causing death 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:10.540
 so you can kill him can 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:14.290
 because in fact they are very dangerous not 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:18.750
 use unless you want your whole life 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.750
 escape from the law or go to jail 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.120
 well you can also use one of 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.070
 these blows 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.350
 excusing himself that he attacked you first 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.360
 you can wait for me to attack you and then 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.850
 to use one of these hits if you can 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.990
 say that it was in self-defense so 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.990
 the law will not pursue you 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.800
 now he goes to another 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:46.660
 this is for when they bother you in the 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.390
 classroom or in the classroom as I know it 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.820
 it's a fast and hard and cold blow to the 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.040
 head of your enemy while he is 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.220
 standing near a wall can carry your 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:01.390
 head up to the structure doing the 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.300
 causing the rear portions of which 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.800
 skull destroy him against 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.010
 hit or causing serious damage 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.010
 brain 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.990
 as I told you in the above you can 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:20.040
 wait for the attack and then 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.830
 attack him because you can kill him if 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.490
 you can kill him 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:29.009
 so you can already hear yourself with the law that 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.169
 they can only defend themselves 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.419
 well here the video ends and the next 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.969
 video I'm going to talk about how to have dreams 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.520
 lucid I hope you see it will be 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.399
 very interesting and if you liked the video 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.110
