00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.699 

so<00:00:00.210> one<00:00:00.329> of<00:00:00.359> my<00:00:00.450> instagramers<00:00:01.170> asked<00:00:01.439> me<00:00:01.680> a

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
so one of my instagramers asked me a

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.590 
so one of my instagramers asked me a
good<00:00:01.800> question<00:00:01.979> she<00:00:02.580> asks<00:00:02.939> how<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.090> it<00:00:03.449> that

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
good question she asks how is it that

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.230 
good question she asks how is it that
men<00:00:03.810> move<00:00:04.020> on<00:00:04.200> so<00:00:04.500> fast<00:00:04.799> after<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.400> relationship

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
men move on so fast after a relationship

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.249 
men move on so fast after a relationship
and<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.480> think<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.870> good<00:00:07.080> question

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
and I think this is a good question

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.049 
and I think this is a good question
because<00:00:07.740> it's<00:00:08.189> something<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.880> lot<00:00:08.910> of

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
because it's something that a lot of

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.600 
because it's something that a lot of
women<00:00:09.240> tend<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.260> struggle<00:00:10.469> with<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:11.010> mean<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.460> lot

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
women tend to struggle with I mean a lot

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.860 
women tend to struggle with I mean a lot
of<00:00:11.700> people<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.030> general<00:00:12.179> but<00:00:12.450> definitely<00:00:12.840> a

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
of people in general but definitely a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.720 
of people in general but definitely a
lot<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.110> women<00:00:13.320> how<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:13.950> we've<00:00:14.490> had

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
lot of women how is it that we've had

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.820 
lot of women how is it that we've had
this<00:00:14.910> long<00:00:15.240> relationship<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:16.230> we've<00:00:16.440> put<00:00:16.680> so

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this long relationship that we've put so

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.130 
this long relationship that we've put so
much<00:00:16.980> into<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.730> you've<00:00:18.150> moved<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.930> fast

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
much into it and you've moved on so fast

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.990 
much into it and you've moved on so fast
this<00:00:19.529> made<00:00:19.740> me<00:00:19.859> think<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.460> relationship

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
this made me think of a relationship

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.550 
this made me think of a relationship
that<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.240> had<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.630> think<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:22.170> was<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.350> first

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
that I had I think it was the first

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.320 
that I had I think it was the first
relationship<00:00:22.949> where<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.310> actually<00:00:23.490> invested

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
relationship where I actually invested

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.300 
relationship where I actually invested
myself<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.930> at<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.529> end<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.980> she<00:00:26.130> walked

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
myself and at the end of it she walked

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.450 
myself and at the end of it she walked
away<00:00:26.460> like<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.119> easy<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.680> wasn't<00:00:28.890> so

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
away like so easy and and it wasn't so

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.099 
away like so easy and and it wasn't so
hard<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> relationship<00:00:30.660> was<00:00:30.750> over<00:00:30.990> I

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
hard that the relationship was over I

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.720 
hard that the relationship was over I
could<00:00:31.349> handle<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.890> what<00:00:32.130> was<00:00:32.250> hard<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.610> me

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
could handle that what was hard for me

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.120 
could handle that what was hard for me
is<00:00:32.910> all<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.690> sacrifices<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.530> other<00:00:34.829> things

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
is all the sacrifices and other things

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.490 
is all the sacrifices and other things
that<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.340> had<00:00:35.489> poured<00:00:35.760> into<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:37.170> watch

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that I had poured into it just to watch

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.130 
that I had poured into it just to watch
her<00:00:37.829> walk<00:00:37.860> away<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.700> effortlessly<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
her walk away so effortlessly and I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
her walk away so effortlessly and I
think<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> painful<00:00:40.890> thing<00:00:41.100> for<00:00:41.430> most<00:00:42.090> people

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
think the painful thing for most people

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.260 
think the painful thing for most people
is<00:00:43.070> that's<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.250> point<00:00:44.520> when<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.820> realize

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
is that's the point when you realize

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.310 
is that's the point when you realize
that<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.750> person<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.350> not<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:47.180> involved<00:00:48.320> are

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that that person was not as involved are

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.500 
that that person was not as involved are
invested<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> relationship<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.120> were

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
invested in the relationship as you were

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.850 
invested in the relationship as you were
and<00:00:51.719> that's<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.020> very<00:00:52.199> difficult<00:00:52.469> thing<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and that's a very difficult thing to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.260 
and that's a very difficult thing to
piece<00:00:53.129> together<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.760> then<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.059> seems

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
piece together because then it seems

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.240 
piece together because then it seems
like<00:00:54.390> you've<00:00:54.629> wasted<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.379> much<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.620> your<00:00:56.010> time

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
like you've wasted so much of your time

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
like you've wasted so much of your time
and<00:00:56.460> energy<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> something<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> I

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and energy this is something that I

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.229 
and energy this is something that I
think<00:00:57.840> women<00:00:58.829> deal<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.160> more<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.879> than<00:01:00.059> men

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
think women deal with more so than men

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.619 
think women deal with more so than men
because<00:01:00.739> men<00:01:01.739> don't<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:03.030> pour<00:01:03.449> themselves

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
because men don't really pour themselves

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.410 
because men don't really pour themselves
in<00:01:04.140> relationships<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:05.430> women<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.119> they're

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
in relationships like women do they're

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.359 
in relationships like women do they're
probably<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:07.229> their<00:01:07.380> late<00:01:07.530> 30s<00:01:07.890> before<00:01:08.100> they

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
probably in their late 30s before they

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.870 
probably in their late 30s before they
even<00:01:09.590> invest<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.189> relationship<00:01:11.760> they'll

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
even invest in a relationship they'll

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.520 
even invest in a relationship they'll
get<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.180> relationships<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.960> actually

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
get in relationships but actually

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.560 
get in relationships but actually
investing<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.520> becoming<00:01:14.820> vulnerable<00:01:15.119> in

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
investing and becoming vulnerable in

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.940 
investing and becoming vulnerable in
relationships<00:01:16.080> those<00:01:16.650> are<00:01:16.799> two<00:01:16.920> totally

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
relationships those are two totally

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
relationships those are two totally
different<00:01:17.340> things<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.090> really<00:01:18.210> quickly<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
different things so really quickly I

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.390 
different things so really quickly I
want<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.930> tell<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.290> three<00:01:19.590> things<00:01:19.619> are<00:01:20.189> three

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
want to tell you three things are three

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.450 
want to tell you three things are three
reasons<00:01:20.670> why<00:01:21.200> men<00:01:22.200> get<00:01:22.470> over<00:01:22.770> relationships

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
reasons why men get over relationships

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.420 
reasons why men get over relationships
so<00:01:24.330> quickly<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.080> first<00:01:25.320> point<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.280> was

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
so quickly the first point like I was

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.460 
so quickly the first point like I was
just<00:01:26.670> saying<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.810> probably<00:01:28.200> never

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
just saying is it was probably never

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.289 
just saying is it was probably never
really<00:01:28.770> invested<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> first<00:01:29.759> place<00:01:29.909> I

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
really invested in in the first place I

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.749 
really invested in in the first place I
know<00:01:30.500> sometimes<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.920> seems<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.250> how<00:01:32.610> could

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
know sometimes it seems like how could

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.460 
know sometimes it seems like how could
that<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:32.939> possible<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.720> mean<00:01:33.930> he<00:01:34.020> took<00:01:34.200> me<00:01:34.350> out

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that be possible I mean he took me out

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.649 
that be possible I mean he took me out
of<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> days<00:01:34.890> he<00:01:35.670> was<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:36.000> me<00:01:36.180> for<00:01:36.420> two<00:01:36.570> or

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
of the days he was with me for two or

three years he was nice he let me meet
mom<00:01:39.030> those<00:01:39.659> things<00:01:40.079> don't<00:01:40.380> necessarily<00:01:40.530> mean

mom those things don't necessarily mean

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.670 
mom those things don't necessarily mean
that<00:01:41.310> he<00:01:41.790> was<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.240> invested<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.200> thought

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that he was as invested as you thought

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.969 
that he was as invested as you thought
he<00:01:43.920> was<00:01:44.030> he<00:01:45.030> may<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.360> had<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> limit<00:01:46.079> because

he was he may have had a limit because
vulnerability<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> very<00:01:48.509> scary<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
vulnerability can be a very scary and

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.889 
vulnerability can be a very scary and
for<00:01:49.770> some<00:01:49.920> people<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.280> dangerous<00:01:50.700> thing<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.210> so

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
for some people a dangerous thing and so

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.620 
for some people a dangerous thing and so
he's<00:01:52.110> only<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.590> let<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.890> get<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.430> far<00:01:53.820> so

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
he's only going to let you get so far so

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.929 
he's only going to let you get so far so
far<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> point<00:01:55.350> where<00:01:55.829> okay<00:01:56.399> if<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.670> break

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
far to the point where okay if I break

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.420 
far to the point where okay if I break
up<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.210> her<00:01:57.390> at<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.869> point<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.439> if<00:01:58.710> she

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
up with her at this point are if she

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.859 
up with her at this point are if she
does<00:01:59.610> something<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.030> hurt<00:02:00.149> me<00:02:00.299> at<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.540> point

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
does something to hurt me at this point

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.190 
does something to hurt me at this point
I'm<00:02:01.259> still<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> bounce<00:02:02.369> back

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
I'm still going to bounce back

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.080 
I'm still going to bounce back
relatively<00:02:04.200> quickly<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.130> relatively

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
relatively quickly and relatively

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.809 
relatively quickly and relatively
so<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.170> an<00:02:07.320> investment<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.100> not<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
so it's an investment but not to the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.300 
so it's an investment but not to the
degree<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.240> maybe<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.380> had<00:02:10.590> invested<00:02:11.160> in

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
degree that maybe you had invested in

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.040 
degree that maybe you had invested in
and<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.120> he<00:02:12.240> can<00:02:12.420> keep<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.720> at<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.020> level

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and so if he can keep it at that level

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.350 
and so if he can keep it at that level
then<00:02:13.709> once<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.220> breakup<00:02:14.550> does<00:02:14.730> come<00:02:14.970> he<00:02:15.209> can

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
then once the breakup does come he can

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.210 
then once the breakup does come he can
easily<00:02:15.480> walk<00:02:15.780> away<00:02:16.080> number<00:02:16.410> two<00:02:16.709> he

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
easily walk away number two he

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.400 
easily walk away number two he
transferred<00:02:17.940> his<00:02:18.180> feelings<00:02:18.660> one<00:02:19.200> thing<00:02:19.350> you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
transferred his feelings one thing you

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.170 
transferred his feelings one thing you
got<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.560> remember<00:02:19.709> about<00:02:20.160> relationships<00:02:20.970> when

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
got to remember about relationships when

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.090 
got to remember about relationships when
we<00:02:21.300> do<00:02:21.510> invest<00:02:21.959> in<00:02:22.260> relationships<00:02:22.440> when

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
we do invest in relationships when

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.510 
we do invest in relationships when
they're<00:02:23.310> over<00:02:23.730> they<00:02:24.209> hurt<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.220> because<00:02:26.220> men

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
they're over they hurt and because men

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.760 
they're over they hurt and because men
are<00:02:26.550> not<00:02:26.850> as<00:02:26.910> good<00:02:27.420> with<00:02:27.600> emotional<00:02:28.319> pain<00:02:28.500> as

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
are not as good with emotional pain as

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.100 
are not as good with emotional pain as
women<00:02:29.160> are<00:02:29.330> we<00:02:30.330> don't<00:02:30.420> want<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.660> feel<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.959> and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
women are we don't want to feel it and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.949 
women are we don't want to feel it and
so<00:02:31.770> when<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.100> breakup<00:02:32.550> does<00:02:32.790> come<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.420> order

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
so when that breakup does come in order

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.800 
so when that breakup does come in order
to<00:02:34.140> avoid<00:02:34.739> feeling<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.400> pain<00:02:35.810> there's

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
to avoid feeling that pain there's

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.360 
to avoid feeling that pain there's
another<00:02:37.410> woman<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.830> comes<00:02:37.950> into<00:02:38.190> the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
another woman that comes into the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.780 
another woman that comes into the
picture

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
picture

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.970 
picture
and<00:02:38.970> what<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.840> man<00:02:40.050> may<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.560> quickly

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
and what that man may do is quickly

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.070 
and what that man may do is quickly
transfer<00:02:41.610> his<00:02:41.850> feelings<00:02:42.239> over<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.660> her<00:02:42.840> and

transfer his feelings over to her and

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.690 
transfer his feelings over to her and
not<00:02:43.320> just<00:02:43.500> his<00:02:43.650> feelings<00:02:44.010> but<00:02:44.190> everything

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700
