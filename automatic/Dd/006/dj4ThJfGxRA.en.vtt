welcome<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:01.050> another<00:00:01.340> episode<00:00:02.340> of<00:00:03.170> testing

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
welcome to another episode of testing

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.140 
welcome to another episode of testing
Skyblock<00:00:05.180> sky<00:00:06.180> factory<00:00:06.750> myths<00:00:07.730> this<00:00:08.730> time

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
Skyblock sky factory myths this time

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.910 
Skyblock sky factory myths this time
we're<00:00:09.540> testing<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.170> difference<00:00:10.530> between<00:00:10.800> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
we're testing the difference between the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.700 
we're testing the difference between the
magnetic<00:00:11.429> dynamo<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.929> lava<00:00:13.200> generator

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
magnetic dynamo and a lava generator

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.890 
magnetic dynamo and a lava generator
some<00:00:14.670> people<00:00:14.910> say<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> lava<00:00:15.420> generator

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
some people say the lava generator

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.040 
some people say the lava generator
produces<00:00:16.109> more<00:00:16.619> power<00:00:16.730> better<00:00:17.730> power<00:00:18.050> and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
produces more power better power and

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.720 
produces more power better power and
others<00:00:19.320> say<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> magnetic<00:00:20.100> dynamo<00:00:20.279> is

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
others say the magnetic dynamo is

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.140 
others say the magnetic dynamo is
superior<00:00:21.289> so<00:00:22.289> we're<00:00:22.710> gonna<00:00:22.890> test<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.699> got

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
superior so we're gonna test this I got

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.540 
superior so we're gonna test this I got
a<00:00:24.180> bucket<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.689> lava<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.109> he's<00:00:25.260> tank<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.130> each

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
a bucket of lava and he's tank and each

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.720 
a bucket of lava and he's tank and each
engine<00:00:27.560> each<00:00:28.560> sparse<00:00:29.029> generator<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
engine each sparse generator is going to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.459 
engine each sparse generator is going to
use<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.969> bucket<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.420> lava<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.809> produce<00:00:34.200> power

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
use that bucket of lava to produce power

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.880 
use that bucket of lava to produce power
they<00:00:35.250> both<00:00:35.489> produce<00:00:35.730> 80<00:00:36.180> RF<00:00:36.690> per<00:00:36.930> tick<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.770> they

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
they both produce 80 RF per tick so they

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.130 
they both produce 80 RF per tick so they
both<00:00:38.040> produce<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.640> same<00:00:38.790> per<00:00:39.059> tick<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
both produce the same per tick but the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
both produce the same per tick but the
question<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.710> how<00:00:41.190> much<00:00:41.309> max<00:00:41.670> power<00:00:41.969> do<00:00:42.270> they

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
question is how much max power do they

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.900 
question is how much max power do they
produce<00:00:42.649> so<00:00:43.649> we're<00:00:43.950> gonna<00:00:44.100> find<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.550> when

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
produce so we're gonna find out when

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.610 
produce so we're gonna find out when
they<00:00:45.030> flip<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.539> switch<00:00:49.520> welcome<00:00:50.520> back

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
they flip this switch welcome back

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.500 
they flip this switch welcome back
everything<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.920> lava<00:00:53.219> lavas<00:00:54.120> spent

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
everything is out of lava lavas spent

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.189 
everything is out of lava lavas spent
and<00:00:54.809> power<00:00:55.739> has<00:00:55.920> been<00:00:56.100> generated<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.210> let's

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and power has been generated and let's

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.889 
and power has been generated and let's
look<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> totals<00:00:59.270> as<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.570> see<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
look at the totals as we can see the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.380 
look at the totals as we can see the
lava<00:01:01.109> generator<00:01:01.649> produce<00:01:02.520> twenty<00:01:02.969> thousand

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
lava generator produce twenty thousand

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.800 
lava generator produce twenty thousand
less<00:01:03.600> RF<00:01:04.080> than<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> magnetic<00:01:05.430> dynamo<00:01:05.810> during

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
less RF than the magnetic dynamo during

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.570 
less RF than the magnetic dynamo during
testing<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.320> noticed<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> lava

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
testing I noticed that the lava

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.450 
testing I noticed that the lava
generator<00:01:09.210> used<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.439> lava<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.920> little<00:01:11.310> bit

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
generator used up the lava a little bit

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.390 
generator used up the lava a little bit
faster<00:01:11.970> than<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> magnetic<00:01:12.750> dynamo<00:01:13.070> not<00:01:14.070> too

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
faster than the magnetic dynamo not too

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
faster than the magnetic dynamo not too
significantly<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.330> enough<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
significantly but enough that it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.580 
significantly but enough that it
obviously<00:01:16.259> made<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> difference<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:21.409> there<00:01:22.409> we

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
obviously made a difference so there we

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.039 
obviously made a difference so there we
have<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.580> magnetic<00:01:24.119> dynamo<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.659> superior

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
have it the magnetic dynamo is superior

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.950 
have it the magnetic dynamo is superior
to<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.380> lava<00:01:25.650> generator<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:27.060> course<00:01:27.390> with

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
to the lava generator of course with

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.350 
to the lava generator of course with
Skyblock<00:01:28.470> win<00:01:28.979> sky<00:01:29.220> factory<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.210> have

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
Skyblock win sky factory you have

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.499 
Skyblock win sky factory you have
unlimited<00:01:30.689> lava<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.700> uses<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> lava

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
unlimited lava so the uses of lava

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.899 
unlimited lava so the uses of lava
doesn't<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.500> matter<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:35.460> both<00:01:35.670> produce

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
doesn't really matter they both produce

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.800 
doesn't really matter they both produce
the<00:01:36.180> same<00:01:36.360> RF<00:01:36.900> protect<00:01:37.439> 80<00:01:38.060> which<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.210> 80<00:01:39.420> RF

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the same RF protect 80 which is 80 RF

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.620 
the same RF protect 80 which is 80 RF
per<00:01:39.990> tick<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> they're<00:01:41.880> they're<00:01:42.299> equivalent

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
per tick so they're they're equivalent

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.539 
per tick so they're they're equivalent
in<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.079> manner<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.619> they<00:01:44.220> will<00:01:44.399> produce

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
in that manner and they will produce

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.670 
in that manner and they will produce
they<00:01:45.000> will<00:01:45.180> power<00:01:45.659> machines<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> same

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
they will power machines that the same

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.950 
they will power machines that the same
quality<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.090> if<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.390> want<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.689> make

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
quality it's just if you want to make

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.889 
quality it's just if you want to make
your<00:01:49.079> lavas<00:01:49.560> last<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.820> long<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.090> possible

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
your lavas last as long as possible

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.170 
your lavas last as long as possible
you<00:01:52.409> want<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> choose<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.490> magnetic<00:01:53.970> dynamo

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you want to choose the magnetic dynamo

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.139 
you want to choose the magnetic dynamo
over<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> lava<00:01:55.079> generator<00:01:55.939> anyways<00:01:56.939> that's

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
over the lava generator anyways that's

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.840 
over the lava generator anyways that's
it<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.360> another<00:01:57.780> episode<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.369> Skye<00:01:59.369> factory

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
