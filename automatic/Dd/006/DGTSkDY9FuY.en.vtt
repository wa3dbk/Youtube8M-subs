00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello welcome to a new video today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.350
 I will try to make a trauma life 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.139
 where I'm going to tell you a little about myself 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.690
 life but like me shit I do not know how to draw 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.790
 very well this is going to be a life joke and 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.850
 picture my life where we are going to use 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.680
 also some photos to help me 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.660
 in that part that I do not know how to do very well 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.359
 hopefully my mom loves to save 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.010
 photos and memories of everything so we're going 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.720
 to help a lot throughout this 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.480
 video the obvious first is the first thing 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.820
 I was born and I will give a very chubby baby seemed 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.590
 a ball totally serious round 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.540
 except the day I do not so they say that 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.120
 it seemed a year but good they decided 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.950
 name me mariles andrÃ¡s so all stuck 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.079
 are 13 letters yes sometimes not even 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.390
 fit some spreadsheets I grew up with my 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.039
 mom and my dad are still brothers although 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.200
 well I have three brothers from me 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.020
 dad but then those count because 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.329
 are my mom's age and if it's a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.370
 little what is good story I do not know if 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.559
 history dissipation environment and by 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.500
 Of course I had someone who did not live with 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.110
 us but I love her with madness and abby 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.060
 it's grandmother I just say it baby and the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.540
 I love too much and you are always my life 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.000
 only that 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.950
 we did not live together I had a very childhood 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.050
 happy and of course very spoiled 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.120
 because I was only daughter I remember that 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.250
 loved to eat tomatoes and when 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.010
 I visited web at home they always gave me 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.840
 tomatoes and blue cheese apart I also 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.850
 He loved to make a radio program 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.950
 the computer then I did with a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.030
 gossip program and talked alone and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.130
 then I listen to it to grade of the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.780
 computer I think my passion for 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.060
 trips were passed on to me by my parents 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.910
 because they have even saved my first 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.700
 ticket on plane and it was when I had 2 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.009
 months of age even if you do not believe it was not 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.020
 the most feminine girl in fact I was the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.690
 first to enroll in karate in my 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.840
 school and that was like a revolution and 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.479
 I left the ballet to go out and do 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.820
 karate and I guess that was good 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.400
 because my mom always said that when 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.619
 did ballet looked like an imputed and 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.710
 it seemed the very fantasy computation in my 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.380
 ballet costume 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.150
 she knew that she was very fat and also the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.940
 halloween lover since childhood my 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.180
 mom disguised me absolutely everything 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.640
 from universe pocahontas dog e 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.620
 even clown that good of that they 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.989
 story after small I have changed 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.480
 very much school and is a was so 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.910
 fun but I learned how to adapt 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.860
 quickly and the best memories that 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.500
 I have was when they changed my school 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.380
 but to miami and there I am trying 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.060
 do as borrowed to florida and although 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.370
 they did not speak anything the language had no idea 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.750
 nothing English and I know that in Florida the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.390
 Spanish but at school we have to 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.190
 speak English between a program that 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.350
 he called did everything teaching you to speak it 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.420
 and I learned very fast and I also did 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.550
 many friends and I was completely happy 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.190
 I love my school, I've given my neighbors 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.780
 also my troop the couts things that for 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.239
 true if we got to sell those 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.060
 Typical cookies like from the movies 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.040
 I'm there trying to draw them but 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.390
 I will not be fine and it was a party 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.160
 the scouts where we were going decided to 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.769
 disguise myself as a clown instead of something 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.980
 terrifying because halloween does not understand 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.510
 the three witch questions 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.099
 if travel was really super 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.129
 fun was spent in the pool and 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:15.340
 those things but I can not forget the 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.959
 gym and I was in a gym for 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.200
 fat kids because my mom was 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.450
 determined to have a skinny girl like that 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.370
 that already every day or almost all 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.549
 days I came to a gym called 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.739
 fit kids where I exercise and what 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.209
 comical is that I was really one of 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.920
 the skinniest girls there because 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.170
 Remember how American children are 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.970
 and good in the moments that I was in the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.110
 gym was not so cheerful except 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.610
 when I started to realize that it was the 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.670
 skinniest girl and then it was like that 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.000
 it was like that but in general it was like that 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.920
 I hate mom, you do not lie and another thing you know 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.230
 what path is ignacio there was a parking 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.480
 I was Lopez for every day I passed 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.790
 that's why I said I want because that 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.560
 when I was in fifth grade I joined 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.450
 the money in auschwitz where the children 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.190
 they made the school news 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.739
 I was a cameraman and I loved it 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.230
 I suppose that blogger from tiny 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.480
 and that if I forgot at some point 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.440
 that period another ball was born to whom 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.660
 We decided to call Maria Elena 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.890
 I will never forget that day one of the most 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.660
 happy of all my life 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.609
 After a while we return to 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.829
 venezuela where I was again 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.230
 jumping between schools and in that 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.450
 period the computer was linked with the 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.970
 friend I loved playing the sims and 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.820
 visit forums and social networks that time 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.830
 as myspace they remember her already 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.260
 create my first web page in this 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.450
 time I liked rap music and I did 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.490
 many friends began to environment 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.470
 interested in makeup but as 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.830
 I had not met 15 my parents did not 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.440
 they did not even bring me an eyeliner 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.150
 my 15 years were the best my uncle 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.550
 He gave a party where everyone had 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.680
 to go dressed in black and I highlighting 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.080
 in fuchsia apart they also sent me a 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.480
 trip europe which I returned completely 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.690
 changed or at least that tells me that 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.070
 at 15 he finally let me put on makeup like that 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.950
 I spent a lot of time trying 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.840
 learn in forums because at that time 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.990
 there was community today is on youtube 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.120
 then at 16 I met the fat man and my 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.730
 life changed forever I know it sounds 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.800
 a little cheesy but it's true is what 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.510
 better that has happened to me and I feel 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.820
 extremely fortunate to have him in my 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.190
 life then I entered the university to 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.960
 study biology and that 's another story 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.970
 because that's how he studied biology but that's what 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.190
 I'm studying now and I'm 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.780
 close to graduating james but good the 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.030
 point is that I always had a passion for 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.040
 the makeup and many girls followed 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.320
 by internet at that time finally 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.720
 I discovered and tube and I swear to you that I still 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.120
 I remember that day I looked for the first 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.850
 makeup video and I found it on 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.490
 youtube I loved to follow the 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.139
 american community on youtube and felt 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.750
 that I could also do something similar 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.600
 in Spanish and mostly aimed at 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.690
 Venezuelan so one year the elbow traveled 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.750
 and gave me a camera with her decides 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.960
 do my first makeup video and 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.760
 again my life changed forever 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.520
 I know that's corny but it really is 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.340
 true and since then everything has gone 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.540
 super fast not only are my family the 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.030
 fat but also all 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.760
 who have seen me grow little by little 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.400
 and I hope to continue doing it forever 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.740
 I want to improve I want to have new ideas 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.110
 to have a kind of community not 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.240
 only around me but one that is in 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.180
 base to all of you in around 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.070
 each and in the interests of all 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.280
 others that not only upload makeup but 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:42.520
 that are so and so wide and I think that 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.390
 every day we can grow more and improve 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.890
 only me but between all of us 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.440
 so I really want to tell you 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.570
 thank you for supporting me this way although 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.880
 sometimes I'm not sure where 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.830
 I 'm happy about where it has brought me 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.600
 this tour and would not change 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.270
 absolutely nothing I'm extremely 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.870
 lucky to be able to do every day 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:07.840
 something that I love and be with people that I 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:11.540
 they support and write to me and who I give them 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.490
 I can see and answer and really 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.380
 I am a lucky person I think not 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.500
 there is another way to say it never 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.330
 I would imagine a life towards you and not 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.570
 I would like to have to do it thank you 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.670
 thanks for all these videos and thanks 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:29.600

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:32.980
