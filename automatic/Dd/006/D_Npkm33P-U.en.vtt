to show you how to make this mini
paperclip<00:00:04.290> catapult

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
paperclip catapult

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.760 
paperclip catapult
as<00:00:04.950> you<00:00:05.850> can<00:00:05.970> see<00:00:06.120> you'd<00:00:06.299> get<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.779> little

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
as you can see you'd get the little

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.250 
as you can see you'd get the little
paper<00:00:08.099> ball<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.730> there<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.690> one<00:00:09.840> roll<00:00:10.050> out

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
paper ball in there and a one roll out

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.890 
paper ball in there and a one roll out
because<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.980> slowest<00:00:11.340> thing<00:00:11.750> I'm<00:00:12.750> going

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
because of the slowest thing I'm going

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.270 
because of the slowest thing I'm going
to<00:00:13.019> teach<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.380> how<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.559> make<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.860> part<00:00:14.130> and

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
to teach you how to make this part and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.410 
to teach you how to make this part and
slides<00:00:14.580> on<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.150> any<00:00:15.330> paperclip<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:17.270> then<00:00:18.270> you

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
slides on to any paperclip and then you

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.390 
slides on to any paperclip and then you
just<00:00:18.630> put<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.170> little<00:00:19.380> paper<00:00:19.619> ball<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.070> there

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.910 

and<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.880> flings<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.590> here's<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.740> first

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
and it flings it so here's the first

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.019 
and it flings it so here's the first
step<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.490> cut<00:00:26.730> out<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> piece<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.359> graph<00:00:27.660> paper

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
step you cut out a piece of graph paper

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.510 
step you cut out a piece of graph paper
you<00:00:30.029> see<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.510> six<00:00:32.000> squares<00:00:33.000> tall<00:00:34.520> six

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
you see it's six squares tall six

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.340 
you see it's six squares tall six
squares<00:00:35.790> by<00:00:35.969> six<00:00:36.210> squares<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.719> then<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.110> cut

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
squares by six squares and then you cut

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.500 
squares by six squares and then you cut
it<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.250> these<00:00:38.430> two<00:00:38.489> spots<00:00:41.149> and<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.300> cut

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it here on these two spots and you cut

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930 
it here on these two spots and you cut
the<00:00:42.660> square<00:00:43.079> out<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:44.340> you'll<00:00:44.520> use<00:00:44.760> this

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
the square out and you'll use this

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.160 
the square out and you'll use this
little<00:00:45.450> square<00:00:45.660> later<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.260> keep<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:48.170> then

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
little square later so keep it then

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.430 
little square later so keep it then
you're<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.309> want<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.489> fold<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.030> here

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
you're going to want to fold it here

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.389 
you're going to want to fold it here
here<00:00:53.570> here<00:00:55.489> here<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:58.309> it'll<00:00:59.309> look

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
here here here and here so it'll look

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:09.910 
here here here and here so it'll look
like<00:00:59.460> that<00:01:06.049> then<00:01:07.939> when<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.570> you

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
like that then when it's like this you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.179 
like that then when it's like this you
tape<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.010 

so<00:01:15.999> it<00:01:16.090> looks<00:01:16.270> like<00:01:16.829> this<00:01:18.420> when<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.479> tape<00:01:19.810> it

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
so it looks like this when you tape it

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.440 
so it looks like this when you tape it
you<00:01:20.289> put<00:01:20.530> one<00:01:20.679> piece<00:01:20.890> of<00:01:21.100> tape<00:01:21.369> here<00:01:21.640> when<00:01:22.299> they

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
you put one piece of tape here when they

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.690 
you put one piece of tape here when they
fold<00:01:22.689> together<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:24.009> don't<00:01:24.340> want<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.549> take

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
fold together but you don't want to take

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.069 
fold together but you don't want to take
this<00:01:24.909> so<00:01:25.149> you<00:01:25.210> see<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.539> could<00:01:25.659> just<00:01:25.810> peel<00:01:26.049> that

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
this so you see it could just peel that

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.910 
this so you see it could just peel that
apart<00:01:28.469> and<00:01:29.549> then<00:01:30.549> you<00:01:30.880> cut<00:01:31.359> this<00:01:31.869> piece<00:01:32.530> that

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
apart and then you cut this piece that

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.539 
apart and then you cut this piece that
you<00:01:33.009> cut<00:01:33.189> out<00:01:33.250> here<00:01:34.240> from<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.509> square<00:01:35.369> half<00:01:36.369> of

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
you cut out here from the square half of

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.249 
you cut out here from the square half of
that<00:01:37.859> and<00:01:38.859> you<00:01:39.009> tape<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.429> right<00:01:39.490> here<00:01:40.149> so<00:01:41.079> when

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
that and you tape it right here so when

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.870 
that and you tape it right here so when
it's<00:01:41.380> at<00:01:41.530> an<00:01:41.590> angle<00:01:41.740> like<00:01:42.099> this<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.640> little

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
it's at an angle like this the little

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.149 
it's at an angle like this the little
paper<00:01:43.060> ball<00:01:43.329> won't<00:01:43.509> fold<00:01:43.780> out<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:46.739> now<00:01:47.739> you<00:01:47.799> can

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
paper ball won't fold out so now you can

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.649 
paper ball won't fold out so now you can
just<00:01:48.369> slide<00:01:48.579> this<00:01:48.819> and<00:01:49.090> between<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.479> two

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
just slide this and between the two

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.880 
just slide this and between the two
sheets<00:01:51.179> and<00:01:52.179> then<00:01:52.329> you<00:01:52.479> have<00:01:52.689> a<00:01:52.719> little<00:01:53.140> paper

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
sheets and then you have a little paper

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.849 
sheets and then you have a little paper
clip<00:01:54.159> we'll<00:01:54.610> see
