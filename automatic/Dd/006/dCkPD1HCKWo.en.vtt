00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
old for this long this might be the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.090 
old for this long this might be the
oldest<00:00:21.660> device<00:00:21.930> they<00:00:22.199> are<00:00:22.619> currently

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
oldest device they are currently

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.849 
oldest device they are currently
supporting<00:00:23.550> officially<00:00:24.230> as<00:00:25.230> far<00:00:25.560> as<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.800> know

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
supporting officially as far as I know

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.910 
supporting officially as far as I know
that's<00:00:26.539> that's<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.840> oldest<00:00:28.170> device<00:00:28.410> that

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
that's that's the oldest device that

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.859 
that's that's the oldest device that
they<00:00:29.010> are<00:00:29.130> currently<00:00:29.279> supporting<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.090> that's

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
they are currently supporting so that's

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.240 
they are currently supporting so that's
something<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.380> think<00:00:31.410> about<00:00:31.679> when<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.099> watch

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250

update<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.480> what<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:37.079> different<00:00:37.200> from<00:00:37.559> cm

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
update and what I see different from cm

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.940 
update and what I see different from cm
10<00:00:38.100> cm<00:00:38.129> 9<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.329> as<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.230> tell<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.710> I'm

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
10 cm 9 so as you can tell as I'm

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.290 
10 cm 9 so as you can tell as I'm
swiping<00:00:41.129> through<00:00:41.460> these<00:00:41.579> home<00:00:41.760> screens<00:00:42.030> it's

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
swiping through these home screens it's

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.750 
swiping through these home screens it's
it<00:00:42.780> seems<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> lot<00:00:43.559> quicker<00:00:43.920> than<00:00:44.129> CM<00:00:44.550> 10

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
it seems to be a lot quicker than CM 10

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.389 
it seems to be a lot quicker than CM 10
now<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.840> ROM<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.110> by<00:00:46.379> no<00:00:46.440> means<00:00:46.559> lack<00:00:47.010> free

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
now this ROM is by no means lack free

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.790 
now this ROM is by no means lack free
but<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.239> seems<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> lot<00:00:48.989> faster<00:00:49.469> than<00:00:49.620> any

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
but it seems to be a lot faster than any

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920 
but it seems to be a lot faster than any
other<00:00:49.980> previous<00:00:50.340> ROM<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.480> device<00:00:51.899> has

other previous ROM that this device has
received<00:00:52.250> as<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.520> tell<00:00:53.670> there's

received as you can tell there's

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.700 
received as you can tell there's
occasional<00:00:54.989> lag<00:00:55.140> when<00:00:55.440> you're<00:00:55.559> swiping

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
occasional lag when you're swiping

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.830 
occasional lag when you're swiping
through<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.309> widget<00:00:56.670> screen<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.480> other<00:00:57.690> than

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
through the widget screen but other than

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.569 
through the widget screen but other than
that<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.289> seems<00:00:58.530> pretty<00:00:58.770> smooth<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.280> me<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
that it seems pretty smooth to me I

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.130 
that it seems pretty smooth to me I
could<00:00:59.850> definitely<00:00:59.969> use<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.600> daily

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140

pretty<00:01:42.360> sluggish<00:01:42.600> for<00:01:42.869> me<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.310> for<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
pretty sluggish for me and for the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.870 
pretty sluggish for me and for the
maximum<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.149> haven't<00:01:45.450> set<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.780> 100<00:01:46.430> 1000<00:01:47.430> 100

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
um this kernel on this device so you can

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.910 
um this kernel on this device so you can
an<00:01:53.939> always<00:01:54.210> install<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> custom<00:01:54.780> Cremona<00:01:55.259> but

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
an always install a custom Cremona but

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.950 
an always install a custom Cremona but

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
as for the stock kernel it maxes out at

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.850 
as for the stock kernel it maxes out at

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
one one thousand one hundred megahertz

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.910 
one one thousand one hundred megahertz
so<00:02:02.329> as<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.600> tell<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:03.990> very<00:02:04.079> fast<00:02:04.649> very

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
so as you can tell it's very fast very

under CyanogenMod under interface you

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.610 
under CyanogenMod under interface you

can go to system quick settings panel

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.300 
can go to system quick settings panel
and<00:02:20.360> then<00:02:21.360> go<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:22.890> tiles<00:02:23.130> and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
and then go to not that but tiles and

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.960 
and then go to not that but tiles and
layout<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.900> have<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.430> interface<00:02:26.430> where

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
layout and you have this interface where

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.210 
layout and you have this interface where
you<00:02:27.000> can<00:02:27.360> actually<00:02:28.080> interact<00:02:28.770> with<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.040> and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
you can actually interact with it and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.130 
you can actually interact with it and
move<00:02:29.370> stuff<00:02:29.550> around<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.060> delete<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.989> can

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
move stuff around and delete and you can

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.130 
move stuff around and delete and you can
add<00:02:31.350> obviously<00:02:32.340> new<00:02:32.459> tiles<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.480> when<00:02:33.989> you

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
add obviously new tiles so that when you

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.550 
add obviously new tiles so that when you
are<00:02:34.170> pulling<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.130> down<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.930> have<00:02:37.050> more<00:02:37.319> or

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
are pulling this down you have more or

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.470 
are pulling this down you have more or
less<00:02:37.800> depending<00:02:38.520> on<00:02:38.580> what<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.940> use<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.420> you

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
less depending on what you use and you

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.690 
less depending on what you use and you
can<00:02:39.510> always<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:40.340> enable<00:02:41.340> or<00:02:41.459> disable

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
can always just enable or disable

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.550 
can always just enable or disable
whatever<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.600> want<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.810> do<00:02:42.930> from<00:02:43.200> there

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
whatever you want to do from there

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.500 
whatever you want to do from there
so<00:02:44.010> obviously<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.519> just<00:02:44.760> regular<00:02:45.000> for<00:02:45.330> point

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
so obviously is just regular for point

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.750 
so obviously is just regular for point
to<00:02:45.630> stuff<00:02:45.840> I've<00:02:46.200> got<00:02:46.410> my<00:02:46.500> Nexus<00:02:46.800> 7<00:02:46.830> here<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:47.670> I

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
to stuff I've got my Nexus 7 here so I

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.000 
to stuff I've got my Nexus 7 here so I
can<00:02:47.940> basically<00:02:48.239> just<00:02:48.660> compare<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.080> speed<00:02:49.320> you

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
can basically just compare the speed you

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.150 
can basically just compare the speed you
can<00:02:50.160> get<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.310> feel<00:02:50.519> for<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:52.800> looks<00:02:52.950> pretty

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
can get a feel for it so it looks pretty

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.250 
can get a feel for it so it looks pretty
similar<00:02:53.400> book<00:02:53.700> through<00:02:53.820> 7-inch<00:02:54.269> tablets<00:02:54.690> so

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
similar book through 7-inch tablets so

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.170 
similar book through 7-inch tablets so
this<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.680> gonna<00:02:55.769> be<00:02:55.950> easy<00:02:56.070> but<00:02:56.340> obviously<00:02:56.819> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
this is gonna be easy but obviously the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.780 
this is gonna be easy but obviously the
Nexus<00:02:57.510> 7<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.769> lot<00:02:58.950> faster<00:02:59.130> for<00:02:59.400> obvious

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
Nexus 7 is a lot faster for obvious

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.990 
Nexus 7 is a lot faster for obvious
reasons<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.959> here<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.040> get<00:03:02.160> us<00:03:02.280> get<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.819> see

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
reasons so here you get us get to see

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.090 
reasons so here you get us get to see
you<00:03:03.360> know<00:03:03.480> how<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.810> runs<00:03:03.989> at<00:03:04.140> 60<00:03:04.470> frames<00:03:04.590> second

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
you know how it runs at 60 frames second

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.610 
you know how it runs at 60 frames second
so<00:03:05.850> that's<00:03:06.810> what<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.170> looks<00:03:07.319> like<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:08.519> here<00:03:09.620> so

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
so that's what it looks like and here so

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.340 
so that's what it looks like and here so
obviously<00:03:10.800> it's<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.459> little<00:03:11.580> bit<00:03:11.760> slower<00:03:12.350> after

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
obviously it's a little bit slower after

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.229 
obviously it's a little bit slower after
use<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.769> Nexus<00:03:14.130> 7<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.459> honestly<00:03:14.850> does<00:03:15.000> seem<00:03:15.209> a

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
use the Nexus 7 and honestly does seem a

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.210 
use the Nexus 7 and honestly does seem a
little<00:03:15.360> slow<00:03:15.569> but<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.410> can<00:03:16.709> get<00:03:16.890> used<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.160> it

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
little slow but you can get used to it

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.190 
little slow but you can get used to it
and<00:03:17.459> when<00:03:17.579> I<00:03:17.640> open<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:17.970> up<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.959> little

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
and when I open this up so a little

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.780 
and when I open this up so a little
jittery<00:03:19.380> but<00:03:19.799> other<00:03:20.010> than<00:03:20.130> that<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.610> works

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
jittery but other than that it works

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.310 
jittery but other than that it works
pretty<00:03:21.209> fine

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
pretty fine

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.110 
pretty fine
another<00:03:22.799> thing<00:03:23.070> that<00:03:23.190> they've<00:03:23.340> improved<00:03:23.730> is

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
another thing that they've improved is

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.000 
another thing that they've improved is
now<00:03:24.840> Google<00:03:25.440> now<00:03:25.560> works<00:03:25.829> on<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:27.239> color<00:03:28.170> which

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
now Google now works on the color which

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.000 
now Google now works on the color which
it<00:03:29.910> didn't<00:03:30.209> work<00:03:30.329> in<00:03:30.510> cm<00:03:30.810> 10<00:03:31.019> which<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.680> why<00:03:31.980> I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
it didn't work in cm 10 which is why I

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.890 
it didn't work in cm 10 which is why I
had<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.310> disabled<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:33.000> now<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.750> will

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
had it disabled but now you will

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.210 
had it disabled but now you will
networks<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.650> one<00:03:34.769> thing<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.070> does

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
networks and the one thing that does

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.360 
networks and the one thing that does
more<00:03:35.430> fun<00:03:35.579> however<00:03:35.820> is<00:03:36.180> voice<00:03:37.140> search<00:03:37.380> if<00:03:38.310> you

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
more fun however is voice search if you

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.599 
more fun however is voice search if you
try<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.000> do<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> voice<00:03:39.329> search<00:03:39.390> on<00:03:39.810> there<00:03:40.609> it'll

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
try to do a voice search on there it'll

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.190 
try to do a voice search on there it'll
open<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.970> up<00:03:42.060> at<00:03:42.180> first<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.600> then<00:03:42.780> it'll<00:03:42.989> stop

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
open it up at first and then it'll stop

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.590 
open it up at first and then it'll stop
whereas<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:44.160> should<00:03:44.190> just<00:03:44.700> open<00:03:44.880> up<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.510> do<00:03:45.570> a

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
whereas it should just open up and do a

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.560 
whereas it should just open up and do a
prompt<00:03:45.989> like<00:03:46.350> on<00:03:46.560> here<00:03:46.829> so<00:03:47.370> that's<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.180> that's

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
prompt like on here so that's a that's

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.810 
prompt like on here so that's a that's
one<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.049> bugs<00:03:49.560> really<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.430> think<00:03:50.670> that's

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
one of the bugs really I think that's

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.610 
one of the bugs really I think that's
the<00:03:50.880> only<00:03:50.940> bug<00:03:51.299> really<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:52.170> I've<00:03:52.320> seen<00:03:52.500> on

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
the only bug really that I've seen on

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.370
