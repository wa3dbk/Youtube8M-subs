00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.639
 hello to all of these we'll do it 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.960
 possible provost marbles we already had 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.519
 put a seat with the recipe link 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.439
 our facebook page 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.410
 and in fact this recipe was taken from 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.789
 site does not waste the point it 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.289
 however this is the ingredients that there 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.140
 300 g of bicarbonate are needed 1 2 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.330
 tablespoons of their liquid soap 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.210
 they recommend the marseille one better 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.390
 two tablespoons 15 drops of essential oil 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.239
 of lemon and we would also add one 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.120
 ten voice wanted him intentions 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.479
 to give more perfume but they are not 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.510
 indispensable demineralized water neither 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.820
 then we already tried molds 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.180
 I made them in these molds 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.949
 here and here it is a little more difficult then 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.809
 remove the pads then vi 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.049
 advice if you have silicone then 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.010
 because if you take away a little better than the 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:06.659
 mold here so let's start with three that 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.120
 It is very fast we have already 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.100
 try and I must say that they wash well 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.680
 so from now on we will only do these 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.210
 then we have already measured two here 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.940
 spoons of liquid Marseille soap 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:32.010
 here we weighed 300 g of bicarbonate 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:34.800
 and now we punish them then we mix 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.700
 meanwhile we can add 15 items of 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.700
 essential lemon rock 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.420
 and 10 drops of mint essential oil 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:15.820
 and we mix then now add 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.950
 a little bit of water because I already had 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.410
 tried to do it overwhelmed her 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.920
 and I added a little too much water indeed 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.480
 in other words, a little medine remained 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.700
 I came anyway but enough 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.190
 add little by little do not need it 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.030
 much more add it more 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.250
 sometimes it doesn't have to come one 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.040
 liquid compound otherwise not you not 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.020
 it dries it will need to add a 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.870
 consistent short adds I don't know if 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.750
 have you ever done the bowler hats from 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.550
 bathroom like those of the leaves because 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.600
 make yourself become a powder if that 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.930
 total premiums between companies is compacted 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.560
 add a little water very little 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.900
 and mix we added water and 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.400
 you have to reach the consistency there 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.930
 you can check so it comes from 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.750
 slowly add the water type 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.180
 do so with your fingers and come if you are 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.010
 never the form if the shape remains are 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.450
 ready to be put simply between the 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.489
 powder ready to be put into the 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.890
 stencil we present the molds and after 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.210
 with his fingers we split for good 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.470

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.560

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.230

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.850
 obviously of the action just pressed 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.130
 for good and now you let yourself dry 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.530
 we left them to dry one day 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.390
 leave it out 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.900
 don't get a feeling like you that 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.990
