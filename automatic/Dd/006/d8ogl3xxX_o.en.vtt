00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:09.349
 it's another test for violence in games 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.599
 a lot of people do but this was 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.580
 millions in games where you let yourself be 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.080
 simply a dangerous side though 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.119
 that you do not have to talk about it 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.189
 right to talk about all matters 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.470
 about video games and graphic price 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.439
 of launches anything beauty 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.820
 who does not have no parents in the language 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.730
 people even say that everyone is 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.240
 Talking next beauty comes out a new 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.149
 research that is not games 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.590
 violence that makes people violent 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:42.260
 if yes the games that bring frustrations 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.079
 that violent people or whatever 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.840
 playing business shot count on death by 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.520
 Ana who will leave her violent and yes 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.190
 when the person can not pass the 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.010
 whether it's a cart game or a 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.350
 game of anything that eyes 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.649
 they become violent madmen when these 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.359
 disappointments await study with the game 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.820
 half life 2 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.950
 so they took a part of the normal there 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.590
 When you kill the cares with blood. 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.740
 when you fall dead on the floor with corpses 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.630
 corpses and everything else and then did 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.840
 modified version and place other 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.880
 people to play and also from the elevation 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.920
 in the version he had no blood at all 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.200
 corpse december as the most things 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.110
 and users have had the 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.510
 same frustrations were responding to 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.450
 violent stimuli in the same way or 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.250
 be an agreement with research in research 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.470
 that I can not believe the cast 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.360
 according to this research was not the 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.980
 issue of violence that made guys were 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.540
 violent was not done in any 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.820
 place is accurate not made in 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.290
 Oxford University choice just hope 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.070
 everything there in oxford 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.450
 the idea is that the game is 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.640
 accessible they lose more games 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.310
 accessible and easier for you to 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.470
 progress without a difficulty that is not 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.800
 player to stay there with behaviors 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.110
 aggressive by being a difficult game 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.480
 then it seems that once again the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.370
 violence in young people this is not the fault of 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.860
 video games are thinking things that 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.820
 we leave people frustrated 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.600
 vestibular of this person much more 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.420
 violent 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.790
 that video games or whatever what the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.310
 frustration of life 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.350
 I can quote several but this is more 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.140
 trying to justify the licenses 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.070
 Little games, you move slower people. 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.070
 did not mention
