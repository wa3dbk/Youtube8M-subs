Joe<00:01:37.060> is<00:01:37.210> always<00:01:37.509> thinking<00:01:37.810> about<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.080> next

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
Joe is always thinking about the next

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.670 
Joe is always thinking about the next
thing<00:01:38.680> no<00:01:39.340> matter<00:01:39.549> what<00:01:39.880> we're<00:01:40.149> doing<00:01:40.479> in<00:01:41.140> the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
thing no matter what we're doing in the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.710 
thing no matter what we're doing in the
same<00:01:41.890> way<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:42.310> most<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.970> innovators<00:01:43.479> in

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
same way that most of the innovators in

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.990 
same way that most of the innovators in
this<00:01:44.049> industry<00:01:44.380> have<00:01:45.130> done<00:01:45.460> their<00:01:45.820> whole

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
this industry have done their whole

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.820 
this industry have done their whole
times<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:49.000> longer<00:01:49.450> we<00:01:49.600> do<00:01:49.810> it<00:01:49.960> better<00:01:50.619> we

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
times and the longer we do it better we

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.149 
times and the longer we do it better we
get<00:01:51.009> and<00:01:51.340> so<00:01:52.299> I<00:01:52.539> think<00:01:53.140> we<00:01:53.409> have<00:01:53.439> a<00:01:53.560> really<00:01:53.860> neat

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
get and so I think we have a really neat

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.670 
get and so I think we have a really neat
blend<00:01:54.640> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
blend of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.240 
blend of
consistency<00:01:56.680> in<00:01:57.520> for<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:59.350> constant

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
consistency in for and and constant

00:02:00.250 --> 00:03:15.480 
consistency in for and and constant
growth<00:02:00.460> innovation<00:02:00.969> in<00:02:01.390> law

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:24.650
