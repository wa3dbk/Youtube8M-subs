00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
Oh hi!

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.140
I've never really done this type of video before but

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.440
today I'm going to do a book haul video.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.620
Which means I am going to show you videos that I bought in the last month.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.520
The first is a second hand book, ~ahh~,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.680
It's called "Meanwhile" by H.G. Wells and look at how pretty it  is.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.820
And then the front looks like this. And it is really thin.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.740
[in English accent] "The picture of a lady"

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.080
I had to read a couple of books by H.G. Wells for my Edwardian class.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.660
So that plus the prettiness factor made me buy this book.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.180
Number two is the book that I bought in Paris

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.920
at Shakespeare and Company which you will probably see in a Paris video soon.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.240
And that is "The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.360
This edition is so beautiful!

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.360
And it is very, very pink on the inside.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.680
I figure at this point in my career of being an English

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.300
major I should probably read "The Picture of Dorian Gray".

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.520
And number three is "The Fountainhead" by...[haltingly] Ayn Rand?

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.660
John Green mentioned it in one of his videos once

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.060
and one of my friends Marion, link to her is in zee dooblee-doo,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.440
is making me read this.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.100
Also, I really love this cover.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.240
"1984" by George Orwell

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.780
I read "Animal Farm" when I was about...seventeen?

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.500
And with this book I guess it's kind of the same story as with "The Picture of Dorian Gray"

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.220
I just kind of have to read this.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.760
I've heard some good and some bad stories about this book but I'm excited to read it.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.040
And about two weeks ago I tweeted about getting a book voucher

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.820
from a mother whose son I tutored for an entire year

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.440
and I used that to buy the two final books that I'm going to show you in this video.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.760
The first one is "How to live safely in a science fictual universe" [sic] by Charles Yu

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.660
Have you seen the cuteness of all these lazer guns?

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.080
Plus the very neon pink inside.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.900
On the back it says

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.900
"My name is Charles Yu, I am a time machine repair man. In one minute I am going to murder myself. Again."

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.700
Two months ago when I asked you guys

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.720
for book review video responses one of you reviewed this book

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.840
and it sounded awesome. I stumbled upon it in the bookstore

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.880
And I thought, "Why not?" I'm always up for books about time travel.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.940
And the last book I bought was "To Kill a Mockingbird"

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.200
Also has a really pretty cover.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.140
And yes I do sometimes judge a book by its cover.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.680
It's another one of those classics I just really wanted to read.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.980
Leedavi just finished reading it, she said that she enjoyed it so that's why I bought it.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.340
I can already tell you that I'm not going to finish these books in the next month

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.880
But I do want to try and finish them in August or September.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.100
And of course if you have read any of these books I would love to know if you liked them or not.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.360
Also, you can also still vote for me in the Youtube Next Up competition

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.180
by going to youtube.com/nextup and clicking on the Netherlands and clicking on my face.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.700
and clicking like. And that was it, bye!
