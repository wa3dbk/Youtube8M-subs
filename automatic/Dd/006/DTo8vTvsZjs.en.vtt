00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
with them just a close-up of the design

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.099 
with them just a close-up of the design
they're<00:02:30.890> sort<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.430> got<00:02:31.579> them<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:32.450> rock<00:02:32.780> kind

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
they're sort of got them that rock kind

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.129 
they're sort of got them that rock kind
of<00:02:33.200> effect<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.799> then<00:02:34.609> you<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:35.870> lava

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139 
of effect and then you have that lava

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.470 
of effect and then you have that lava
like<00:02:36.769> really<00:02:37.190> like<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.519> effect<00:02:37.760> there<00:02:37.970> it's<00:02:38.419> a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
like really like the effect there it's a

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.780 
like really like the effect there it's a
little<00:02:38.660> bit<00:02:38.750> repetitive<00:02:39.049> on<00:02:39.410> some<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.769> the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
little bit repetitive on some of the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.290 
little bit repetitive on some of the
areas<00:02:41.629> you<00:02:41.810> can<00:02:41.989> see<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.790> same<00:02:44.030> kind<00:02:44.269> of

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
areas you can see the same kind of

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.080 
areas you can see the same kind of
graphic<00:02:44.659> being<00:02:44.900> used<00:02:45.200> but<00:02:46.099> I<00:02:46.310> think<00:02:46.760> once<00:02:46.970> you

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
graphic being used but I think once you

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.640 
graphic being used but I think once you
put<00:02:47.360> your<00:02:47.390> terrain<00:02:47.780> over<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.140> top<00:02:48.379> and<00:02:48.590> you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
put your terrain over the top and you

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.190 
put your terrain over the top and you
sort<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.040> lichens<00:02:49.220> stones<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:51.170> can

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
sort of lichens stones you can

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.770 
sort of lichens stones you can
compensate<00:02:52.010> for<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.610> quite<00:02:53.299> well<00:02:53.360> they<00:02:53.629> love

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
compensate for that quite well they love

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.119 
compensate for that quite well they love
us<00:02:53.810> or<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.200> larvae<00:02:54.530> design<00:02:54.799> in<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.920> middle

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
us or that larvae design in the middle

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.410 
us or that larvae design in the middle
should<00:02:55.250> look<00:02:55.400> really<00:02:55.519> nice<00:02:55.760> when<00:02:55.970> we<00:02:56.060> put<00:02:56.269> our

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
should look really nice when we put our

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.990 
should look really nice when we put our
cows<00:02:56.659> wasteland<00:02:57.519> terrain<00:02:58.519> on<00:02:59.150> top<00:02:59.780> of<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.080> so

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
cows wasteland terrain on top of that so

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.930 
cows wasteland terrain on top of that so
unique<00:03:02.000> design<00:03:02.510> but<00:03:03.580> certainly<00:03:04.580> nice<00:03:04.790> and
