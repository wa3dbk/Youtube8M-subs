definitely<00:00:50.190> does<00:00:50.340> look<00:00:50.579> pretty<00:00:50.820> sick

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
definitely does look pretty sick

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.069 
definitely does look pretty sick
although<00:00:52.199> um<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.820> only<00:00:53.940> thing<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:55.020> of

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
although um the only thing it kind of

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
although um the only thing it kind of
looked<00:00:55.289> odd<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.860> me<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.430> front<00:00:56.670> part<00:00:57.000> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
looked odd to me the front part it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.139 
looked odd to me the front part it
almost<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.920> looks<00:00:58.949> too<00:00:59.280> small<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.879> mean<00:01:00.000> it's

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
almost it looks too small it I mean it's

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.360 
almost it looks too small it I mean it's
a<00:01:00.210> chopper<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.899> would<00:01:01.050> think<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
a chopper you would think the the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.070 
a chopper you would think the the
handlebars<00:01:02.940> would<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.239> raised<00:01:03.510> up<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.899> little

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
handlebars would be raised up a little

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.070 
handlebars would be raised up a little
bit<00:01:04.309> but<00:01:05.309> besides<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.270> back<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.780> really

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
bit but besides that the back I really

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.109 
bit but besides that the back I really
do<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> just

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
do like the and I get this is just

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.490 
do like the and I get this is just
personal<00:01:09.450> preference<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.990> really<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.320> like

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
personal preference but I really do like

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.950 
personal preference but I really do like
the<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.670> know<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> chain<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.659> there

and the engine parts and stuff it does

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.780 
and the engine parts and stuff it does
look<00:01:15.960> pretty<00:01:15.990> sweet<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.520> said<00:01:17.580> in

bike<00:01:45.680> handling<00:01:46.680> no<00:01:47.220> pretty<00:01:47.520> decent<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.390> speed

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
bike handling no pretty decent the speed

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.469 
bike handling no pretty decent the speed
is<00:01:48.689> actually<00:01:48.960> not<00:01:49.140> bad<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:50.070> know<00:01:50.479> considering

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
is actually not bad you know considering

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.920 
is actually not bad you know considering
that<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.079> not<00:01:52.320> really<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:53.360> bike<00:01:54.360> known<00:01:54.630> for

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that it's not really a bike known for

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.959 
that it's not really a bike known for
speed<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.009> planning<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.579> doing

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
speed I'm not really planning on doing

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.090 
speed I'm not really planning on doing
any<00:01:57.149> tests<00:01:57.570> with<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:58.110> against<00:01:58.920> other

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
any tests with this one against other

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.249 
any tests with this one against other
bikes<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.880> if<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.149> guys<00:02:00.329> want<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.780> let<00:02:01.140> me

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
bikes but if you guys want to let me

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.350 
bikes but if you guys want to let me
know<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.250> know<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.640> work<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.939> out<00:02:03.000> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
know and you know we can work that out I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.730 
know and you know we can work that out I
don't<00:02:03.810> even<00:02:03.899> know<00:02:04.049> what<00:02:04.200> other<00:02:04.350> bikes<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
don't even know what other bikes I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.889 
don't even know what other bikes I
should<00:02:04.920> put<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.280> against<00:02:05.610> maybe<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
should put this against maybe like the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.369 
should put this against maybe like the
sovereign<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:09.000> think<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.110> don't

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
sovereign and I think it's the I don't

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.740 
sovereign and I think it's the I don't
know<00:02:10.530> what<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> other<00:02:11.270> bike<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.510> kind<00:02:12.720> of

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
know what the other bike that kind of

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.620 
know what the other bike that kind of
looks<00:02:12.930> similar<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.379> this

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
looks similar to this

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.590 
looks similar to this
it<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:14.050> called<00:02:14.320> but<00:02:15.090> that's<00:02:16.090> pretty<00:02:16.240> much<00:02:16.360> it

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
it is called but that's pretty much it

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.690 
it is called but that's pretty much it
guys<00:02:16.630> there's<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.530> chopper<00:02:17.920> there's<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.160> three

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.100 
guys there's the chopper there's a three
new<00:02:19.690> vehicles<00:02:20.820> despite<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:22.300> customization

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
new vehicles despite the customization

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.290 
new vehicles despite the customization
which<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.770> disappointing<00:02:24.340> again<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.150> way

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
which is disappointing again the way

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.090 
which is disappointing again the way
they<00:02:25.480> actually<00:02:25.660> look<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.680> know<00:02:26.800> I'm<00:02:26.950> pretty

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
they actually look you know I'm pretty

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.400 
they actually look you know I'm pretty
excited<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:28.060> only<00:02:28.330> one<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> don't<00:02:28.660> really<00:02:29.140> like

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
excited the only one I don't really like

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.120 
excited the only one I don't really like
the<00:02:29.650> look<00:02:30.100> overall<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.240> sports<00:02:32.080> bike<00:02:32.350> but

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
the look overall is the sports bike but

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.680 
the look overall is the sports bike but
it's<00:02:33.550> not<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.820> I<00:02:33.880> hate<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.300> it's<00:02:34.450> just<00:02:34.570> that

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
it's not that I hate it it's just that

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.630 
it's not that I hate it it's just that
it<00:02:34.930> doesn't<00:02:35.230> really<00:02:35.350> stand<00:02:35.950> out<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.460> doesn't

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
it doesn't really stand out it doesn't

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.700 
it doesn't really stand out it doesn't
doesn't<00:02:37.000> look<00:02:37.240> too<00:02:37.600> different<00:02:38.050> from<00:02:38.470> other

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
doesn't look too different from other

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.100 
doesn't look too different from other
bikes<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:39.340> that's<00:02:40.060> pretty<00:02:40.240> much<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.540> let<00:02:41.050> me

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
bikes but that's pretty much it let me
