00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.039 

this<00:00:02.070> bike<00:00:02.310> has<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.669> center<00:00:03.090> stand<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.929> we're

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
this bike has a center stand and we're

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.680 
this bike has a center stand and we're
going<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.259> clean<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.740> loop<00:00:04.859> this<00:00:05.009> chain<00:00:05.690> first

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
going to clean and loop this chain first

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.030 
going to clean and loop this chain first
so<00:00:06.899> I'm<00:00:06.990> going<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.170> put<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:07.379> up<00:00:07.500> on<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.770> center

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
so I'm going to put it up on the center

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:24.710 
so I'm going to put it up on the center
staff<00:00:19.160> bike<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> center<00:00:21.000> stand<00:00:23.720> you

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
staff bike up on the center stand you

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:42.630 
staff bike up on the center stand you
can<00:00:24.960> turn<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:27.289> put<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.439> chain<00:00:28.710> loop

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.639 

I<00:00:43.800> find<00:00:44.800> it<00:00:44.950> if<00:00:45.040> you<00:00:45.130> put<00:00:45.340> it<00:00:45.430> on<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.700> inside<00:00:46.649> it

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
I find it if you put it on the inside it

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.000 
I find it if you put it on the inside it
gets<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.399> outside<00:00:48.910> very<00:00:49.390> fast<00:00:49.690> so<00:00:50.230> I<00:00:50.500> just

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
gets to the outside very fast so I just

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.369 
gets to the outside very fast so I just
put<00:00:51.220> it<00:00:51.309> in<00:00:51.460> on<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:51.730> inside

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.579 

okay<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:59.690> the<00:01:00.690> chain<00:01:01.519> there's<00:01:02.519> really<00:01:02.910> loose

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
okay now the chain there's really loose

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.700 
okay now the chain there's really loose
on<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.650> spike<00:01:05.720> but<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.170> adjust<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
on that spike but you do not adjust the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.039 
on that spike but you do not adjust the
chain<00:01:07.979> while<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.490> off<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.659> ground<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
chain while it's up off the ground you

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.200 
chain while it's up off the ground you
have<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> chain<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.430> ground<00:01:11.850> so

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
have to have the chain on the ground so

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
have to have the chain on the ground so
that<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> swing<00:01:12.930> arm<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> proper

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that the swing arm is in the proper

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.249 
that the swing arm is in the proper
position<00:01:20.119> okay<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> bike<00:01:21.600> back<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
position okay with the bike back on the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.399 
position okay with the bike back on the
ground<00:01:22.470> we're<00:01:22.920> gonna<00:01:23.009> loosen<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.490> rear<00:01:23.670> axle

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
ground we're gonna loosen the rear axle

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.810 
ground we're gonna loosen the rear axle
I've<00:01:25.409> got<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.830> neutral<00:01:26.039> we<00:01:26.369> don't<00:01:26.549> want<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I've got it in neutral we don't want to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.960 
I've got it in neutral we don't want to
jam<00:01:27.030> up<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.270> gears<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.490> case<00:01:29.729> I'm

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970

close<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> metric<00:01:37.679> nuts<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.159> bolts<00:01:38.460> on

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
close to the metric nuts and bolts on

00:01:38.610 --> 00:02:17.259 
close to the metric nuts and bolts on
here<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.479> we're<00:01:39.929> going<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:40.110> loosen<00:01:40.289> this

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.589

approximately<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.900> inch<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.320> half

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
approximately the inch and a half

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.960 
approximately the inch and a half
deflection<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.280> you're<00:04:02.430> supposed<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.880> have

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
deflection that you're supposed to have

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.320 
deflection that you're supposed to have
in<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.600> chain<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.940> that's<00:04:06.090> under<00:04:08.330> sitting

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
in the chain and that's under sitting

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.720 
in the chain and that's under sitting
normal<00:04:09.930> when<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.710> get<00:04:10.920> on<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.220> bike<00:04:11.370> your

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
normal when you get on the bike your

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.250 
normal when you get on the bike your
bike's<00:04:11.910> going<00:04:12.210> to<00:04:12.270> set<00:04:12.450> down<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.690> little<00:04:12.930> bit<00:04:13.110> it

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
bike's going to set down a little bit it

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.410 
bike's going to set down a little bit it
gets<00:04:13.470> slightly<00:04:13.800> tighter<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.580> then<00:04:15.150> when<00:04:15.300> as

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
gets slightly tighter and then when as

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.030 
gets slightly tighter and then when as
it<00:04:15.540> goes<00:04:15.690> up<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.020> down<00:04:16.110> it'll<00:04:16.470> get<00:04:16.590> looser

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
it goes up and down it'll get looser

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.949 
it goes up and down it'll get looser
tighter<00:04:17.400> or<00:04:17.580> looser<00:04:17.760> tighter<00:04:18.270> or<00:04:18.450> looser<00:04:18.600> as

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
tighter or looser tighter or looser as

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.730 
tighter or looser tighter or looser as
the<00:04:19.230> swing<00:04:19.590> arm<00:04:19.770> goes<00:04:19.980> up<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.280> down<00:04:20.930> then<00:04:21.930> the

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
the swing arm goes up and down then the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.200 
the swing arm goes up and down then the
most<00:04:22.890> important<00:04:23.490> part<00:04:25.070> tighten<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:27.030> rear

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
most important part tighten the rear

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:40.750 
most important part tighten the rear
axle

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.940 

again<00:04:41.760> you<00:04:42.120> do<00:04:42.300> not<00:04:42.450> need<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:43.020> strip<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.620> bolts

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
again you do not need to strip the bolts

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.480 
again you do not need to strip the bolts
on<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.220> this<00:04:44.370> is<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.580> hardened<00:04:45.030> axle
