00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 good day all the crystals to me 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.350
 channel my pretty people who watch the videos 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.740
 Today I am going to present to you how to see the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.740
 implications 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.889
 the nation is eternal the microsd memory 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.160
 of 700 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.170
 to the settings here is a 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.730
 detail that has to be very ugly 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.130
 anyway storage here at 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.260
 principle in the factory and exposes 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.900
 default storage here 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.730
 notice that it will not put the storage 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.940
 internal because if they are not going to have them 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.280
 limited the memory of the applications 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.559
 notice and this one is always 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.360
 storage and option here if they put 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.550
 to the sd card do not forget that 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.170
 detail because if not they will not put their 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.440
 mind the application is because it has what 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.590
 feel internal 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.469
 what are the 2 gb here specifies that 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:05.770
 they are only 494 for applications so 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.049
 do not forget to move the option 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.490
 storage to determine the time 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.540
 to move them after this is very 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.580
 simple 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.409
 I before 2,000 sky and without avenues or 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.030
 account this penalty is that I am delivering 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.890
 because he wants to integrate some games 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.600
 they want me to try but if not 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.280
 could because the house plus the best up 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.649
 that I realized that script error that 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.340
 had not seen the rationing we're going to 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.340
 manage applications 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.490
 if you do not find three weapons in the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.380
 scope that tell us 424 free that is 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.840
 the seat that allows us internally 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.600
 those two gigabytes but as I already moved it 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.970
 of the card the option appeared 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.869
 and it appears that I have everything available 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.869
 for memory 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.820
 one 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.820
 ej 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.930
 But here it is 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:04.910
 but it's important to remember that they have 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.900
 that move that storage 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.390
 default if you are not going to have 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.740
 problems that will not get them out of 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.790
 Application solutions by 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.150
 example if they want to save a game 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.560
 great as the nova 3 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.560
 or the living room with normal 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.370
 to the career have a 27 if not bad 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:30.520
 memory is called a combat model 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:34.690
 x in addition they will not be able to have 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.490
 example only for the parts is stored 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.590
 in the cemetery and another part in the 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.680
 card but the most common is what 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.150
 moves of the card although they are the 24 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.610
 a thousand birds on the card 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.900
 and in the internal launch of the phone 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.870
 that brushed the 210 and under those 500s it gives 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.040
 a little more space 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.140
 Damascus 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.580
 of this team 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.580
 we search here before 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.950
 and weigh 12 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.950
 19 sorry with 22 thousand 90 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.050
 such forms 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.170
 those that come into existence but again 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.060
 remember to move the procedure 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.760
 to determine the memory card 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.210
 Do not forget them 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.319
 what it tells us a lot 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.790
 we search 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.769
 and we are with 2017 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.599
 because how does someone use things 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.510
 some things for example how to use 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.260
 some participations and has to be 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.260
 save a little 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.690
 10 mb / s 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.540
 one 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.770
 do not forget to remove them 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.360
 well that's for the moment back and 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:03.110
 then I remember the memory 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.110
 storage new cd law 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.010
 do not forget greetings in the next 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.010
 next video
