00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.730
 a while ago you were asking me questions through tools 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.730
 made this video about self tanner 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.369
 in this video you explain how many different themselves they were there late 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.369
 I see which two products I prefer to use 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.000
 the easiest self-tanners end up knowing that I myself think it too 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.700
 finest 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.540
 if you can by the direct knowledge it gives for the third time one 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.590
 easy to apply 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.900
 You see very well were nothing left 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.980
 and the tinted loos in his eyes washable handy if you made mistakes 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.350
 and you can finally enjoy a nice price color for a day 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.400
 but perhaps you would rather enjoy your tanned use of for longer 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.480
 for example yourself at myspace on wipes these products give your house within one 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.280
 a very nice brown color for a few hours 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.730
 in fact slowly declining 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.650
 the ret to give the most intense effect that the race to the self-tanner take 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.400
 especially the time to apply this 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.350
 last but not least, you also have body lotion software if it slows you down 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.410
 give your skin a tan, you can build up the club, because how often do you have more 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.260
 buy at nieuwpoort if you are satisfied with your color lubricate two to three times 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.310
 per week to maintain your tan 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.700
 care and the job in a very easy way 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.880
 I myself use little loved for my white milk bottles or tram and legs 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.730
 as you can see my arms and my head are always much browner than my legs 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.730
 so I'm going to take a look at them 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.960
 step and which we must shave, of course, first our legs hair 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.920
 free up 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 I almost always feel ashamed at Crystal Palace 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.370
 time comes the secure 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.580
 I do it with a special product fines can thereby also with 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.360
 do a washcloth i do you to remove the dead skin cells so you 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.360
 will soon get a nice even brown color 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.230
 focus mainly on your knees and ankles, which are often places to dry 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.130
 lubricate your entire workout with a light one every time 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.979
 and let the past I draw and then the next step goes for that nice smooth 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.540
 teacher myself I am you fit I use you by you when they blindly mark 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.540
 birdies mln extra time right and this immediately gives 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:23.979
 and I also think it is very easy that you can order in 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.589
 the water had fallen off each other but was 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:30.480
 and start it a bit scared because you are so that is a very strong color 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.680
 He can be seen a lot if you write it well and focus on your knees and on 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.080
 his knee cavity your ankles that gives a very nice child oriented 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.589
 the most expensive is also some time and sometimes a long time together at the children's council 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:46.149
 makes everything well remember viewers through the mirror on everything is successful 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.739
 here you see the difference between left and right, own legs and right 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.209
 but tanned legs don't forget to wash your hands either 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.209
 very important otherwise they will continue to train 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.239
 and then you see the end result, although in principle it was a bit of a shock 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.329
 has received from 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.890
 now see that it has dried up very nicely of course and this is in daylight 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.889
 my body is now a much more even brain 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.430
 do you prefer and drive yourself and take a body lotion then use one 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.499
 The farmer's self-tanner who also loreal to this he is also good at you 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:23.369
 this weather is very good certainly don't see well but you stay so take it too 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.859
 again the time and especially focuses on the elbows and the trade 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.599
 I have been attacked a few times by several consecutive days 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.539
 parkers paid products from your sublime bronze line 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:40.669
