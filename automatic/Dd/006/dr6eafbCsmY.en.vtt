improve the connection qualities it's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.030 
improve the connection qualities it's
not<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> make<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.990> perfect<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:31.920> it's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
not going to make it perfect but it's

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.560 
not going to make it perfect but it's
definitely<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.790> improve<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.360> now<00:01:33.509> you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
