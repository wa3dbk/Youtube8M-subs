 spear 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.899
 Hello Dear User per month to Aldi and Lidl 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.609
 today it is about MÃ¼nster WWU he is speaking himself silent but an idea 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.400
 at that time one wanted to continue 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.400
 we have 18 here 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.439
 All LEDs are off 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.869
 means in no line 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.100
 So I mean in a big circle 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.520
 it can be found 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.740
 3 a paper of service 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.780
 Gate in Bordeaux 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.190
 that is, experienced by everyone 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.809
 to cater to consumers in the last ten months 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.430
 and what each one is going against 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.140
 and not every other park 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.090
 So everyone can honestly 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.010
 then just stop 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.140
 what do I know about normal 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.760
 Forecasts about the forecasts continue to believe so 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.760
 but are subject to say from everyone but experienced 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.290
 exactly two years later 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.290
 Killzone increase 2 percent 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.400
 an artery the Resale print August 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.910
 and then we have Lienz 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.990
 the games of the switches 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.580
 and right the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.390
 to proudly meet to set Siemensstadt address 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.170
 Once the seal of approval Felix Moese once ready to laugh about it 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.720
 somebody has to 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.400
 around the LBB without 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.920
 and after big 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.620
 unfortunately US to Nowhere only approx 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.780
 and the tractor in mode numbers should 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.219
 it was a bit of sun again 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.670
 this canvas 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.670
 Before that I write it but now 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.060
 do my best sober but that is really loud ever since run 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.230
 here is the operation 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.140
 use without problems 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.229
 okay threaded next clip 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.229
 but money so curb 1 is great 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.849
 Carla 2 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.389
 and Karzai is blue 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.079
 and you can of course with that 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.450
 important are available 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.379
 why have to 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.579
 Farman risen and although one goes 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.789
 for example, then threatens 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.659
 Restaurants La gl 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.609
 By the way, yellow is 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.309
 I am bad but hold Premier League has its teachers 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.259
 still not one hundred percent 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.099
 then he knows that 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.520
 but it is not unlike many other Laer 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.079
 in my opinion the best points 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.079
 Another camera is popular 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.509
 very pleasing that it is technically quite extreme 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:59.769
 then have 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.519
 for example 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.519
 the box office 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.189
 Year as possible 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.849
 then I'll do something and no comparison 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.409
 between give 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.139
 Woodpecker 4 8 cents 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.349
 and a normal 5 millimeters into the game 56 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.879
 this will be first 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.539
 I set him 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.029
 five millimeters of e-paper 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:34.539
 with evil 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.189
 useful because self drive 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.189
 with rotation 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.649
 so clearly the result 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:47.649
 you can not really see the reasons anymore 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:51.629
 the Volkswagenwerk track will be as hard as anything 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.009
 then they can also be members of other drivers 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.269
 Earlier customers may be a bad example but need to 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.909
 you watch him 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.909
 Welsh was a lot of hands 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.639
 for a comparable doubt gl 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.680
 so that the money was 5 millimeters thick 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.479
 that's money from the star 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.479
 that's the difference or not yet telling us to 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.979
 okay then 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.979
 his partner Brad Pitt next places 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.789
 the difference between 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.789
 Schweich Enke left and new elections 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.870
 So the seven seats relatively clear 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.550
 It avenges First Date Sports Left 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.550
 The whole hall 5 mm headballs the power 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.720
 I'll try to know when we might get a little better 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.240
 can go 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.340
 and now with new ones 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.150
 Green everywhere 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.680
 all right 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.680
 the glittering money or regrets that I drive 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.559
 from everyone you experience getting along 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:06.559
 among others it's just like that 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.229
 we are threatening now 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.460
 Founder too 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.460
 the so-called must finally see 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:20.679
 That's just for any color specific LGS are meant 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.419
 so again 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.729
 the EHC was 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.729
 and maybe I know 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.029
 for others 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:45.620
 also in Wales 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.620
 This one looks like a bestseller 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.529
 if he himself in the next tip with fog again 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.669
 since then marketed driver with fog 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.110
 okay that's it then again 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:19.689
 Video clip about the movie 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.689
 Woodpecker Marbach are great Collect NPD 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:24.879
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.740
 I thank you for watching 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.110
 this is not a goal
