00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.700 
would be a lunatic to come and join
Chelsea<00:01:41.820> Chelsea<00:01:42.570> apparently<00:01:43.409> are<00:01:43.530> also

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
Chelsea Chelsea apparently are also

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.340 
Chelsea Chelsea apparently are also
prepared<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.399> table<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.299> third<00:01:45.540> bid<00:01:45.840> we've<00:01:46.229> had

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
prepared to table a third bid we've had

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
prepared to table a third bid we've had
one<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.619> 20<00:01:46.920> million<00:01:47.100> rejected<00:01:47.610> one<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.820> 26<00:01:48.270> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
one of 20 million rejected one of 26 I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.859 
one of 20 million rejected one of 26 I
think<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.130> 30<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:51.090> being<00:01:51.509> mooted

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
think and now one of 30 is being mooted

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.010 
think and now one of 30 is being mooted
and<00:01:52.829> Rios<00:01:53.700> come<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.329> basically<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.840> trying

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and Rios come in and basically is trying

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.780 
and Rios come in and basically is trying
to<00:01:55.079> rock<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> apple<00:01:55.590> boat<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.009> sanely<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.610> mad

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to rock the apple boat and sanely be mad

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.219 
to rock the apple boat and sanely be mad
to<00:01:56.939> come<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.210> chelsea<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.600> sit<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.810> our<00:01:57.990> bench

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
to come to chelsea and sit on our bench

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.319 
to come to chelsea and sit on our bench
so<00:01:58.460> I've<00:01:59.460> been<00:01:59.610> having<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.909> think<00:02:00.000> about<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
so I've been having to think about that

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.969 
so I've been having to think about that
and<00:02:00.450> I'm<00:02:00.570> kind<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.079> thinking<00:02:01.200> why<00:02:01.530> would<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.890> be

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and I'm kind of thinking why would it be

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.850 
and I'm kind of thinking why would it be
mad<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.840> Johnstone's<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.990> leave<00:02:04.170> Everton<00:02:04.530> and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
mad for Johnstone's to leave Everton and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.330 
mad for Johnstone's to leave Everton and
come<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> champion<00:02:07.229> ship<00:02:08.009> winning

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
come to you know a champion ship winning

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.100 
come to you know a champion ship winning
team<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:09.030> Chelsea<00:02:09.390> championship

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
team like Chelsea championship

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.870 
team like Chelsea championship
Premiership<00:02:10.679> champions<00:02:11.610> Chelsea

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
Premiership champions Chelsea

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.270 
Premiership champions Chelsea
Rio<00:02:13.810> obviously<00:02:14.290> once<00:02:14.470> stones<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:14.860> go<00:02:14.980> over<00:02:15.130> to

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
Rio obviously once stones to go over to

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.830 
Rio obviously once stones to go over to
united<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.030> fair<00:02:16.210> enough<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.540> probably

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
united and fair enough you probably

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.090 
united and fair enough you probably
could<00:02:17.020> walk<00:02:17.200> straight<00:02:17.470> into<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.740> team

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
could walk straight into that team

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.640 
could walk straight into that team
because<00:02:18.430> Smalling<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.540> jones<00:02:20.080> aren't<00:02:20.530> much

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
because Smalling and jones aren't much

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.260 
because Smalling and jones aren't much
of<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.890> defensive<00:02:21.310> pairing<00:02:21.700> where<00:02:21.940> if<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.090> comes

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
of a defensive pairing where if it comes

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.820 
of a defensive pairing where if it comes
to<00:02:22.420> chelsea's<00:02:22.810> gotta<00:02:23.050> contend<00:02:23.350> with<00:02:23.530> Terry

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
to chelsea's gotta contend with Terry

to chelsea's gotta contend with Terry
Zuma<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.430> Cahill<00:02:25.090> but<00:02:25.480> surely<00:02:25.690> long-term

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
Zuma and Cahill but surely long-term

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.480 
Zuma and Cahill but surely long-term
that's<00:02:26.440> got<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.680> be<00:02:26.770> good<00:02:26.860> for<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.070> long<00:02:27.220> players

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490
