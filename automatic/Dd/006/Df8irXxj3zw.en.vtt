like<00:00:43.860> Altair<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:45.330> you<00:00:45.540> but<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.440> situ

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
like Altair and as you but in a situ

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.970 
like Altair and as you but in a situ
it's<00:00:47.190> also<00:00:47.580> you<00:00:48.570> know<00:00:48.630> a<00:00:48.720> database<00:00:49.080> that<00:00:49.680> helps

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
it's also you know a database that helps

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.580 
it's also you know a database that helps
you<00:00:50.340> understand<00:00:51.120> whatever<00:00:51.990> you<00:00:52.200> need<00:00:52.470> about

you understand whatever you need about
the<00:00:52.860> world<00:00:53.040> right<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.970> moment<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.690> it's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the world right at that moment so it's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.290 
the world right at that moment so it's
smart<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.500> streamlined<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.550> won't<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.970> about

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
smart and streamlined it won't be about

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.750 
smart and streamlined it won't be about
fixed<00:00:57.780> menus<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.560> much<00:00:59.040> more<00:00:59.220> dynamic<00:00:59.670> than

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
fixed menus it's much more dynamic than

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.850 
fixed menus it's much more dynamic than
that<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.170> you're<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:01.320> see<00:01:01.470> that<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
that and you're going to see that the

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.830 
that and you're going to see that the
the<00:01:02.130> graphics<00:01:02.520> are<00:01:02.670> moving<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.630> some

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the graphics are moving and in some

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.080 
the graphics are moving and in some
cases<00:01:04.049> we're<00:01:04.409> taking<00:01:04.710> some<00:01:04.890> risks<00:01:05.309> because<00:01:05.909> we

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
cases we're taking some risks because we

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.249 
cases we're taking some risks because we
are<00:01:06.240> breaking<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.259> few<00:01:07.439> design<00:01:07.830> rules<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
are breaking a few design rules and

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.209 
are breaking a few design rules and
mixing<00:01:10.259> up<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> menus<00:01:10.799> when<00:01:10.979> you're<00:01:11.100> not

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219 
mixing up the menus when you're not

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.130 
mixing up the menus when you're not
supposed<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.609> typically<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.329> that<00:01:12.359> basically

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
supposed to typically do that basically

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.169 
supposed to typically do that basically
if<00:01:13.259> you're<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.499> front<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.979> any<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:15.030> the
