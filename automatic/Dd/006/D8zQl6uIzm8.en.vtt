won't get any kills shooting through
boxes<00:00:59.180> so<00:00:59.390> don't<00:00:59.659> try<00:01:01.000> this<00:01:02.000> gun<00:01:02.239> has<00:01:02.269> four

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
boxes so don't try this gun has four

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.740 
boxes so don't try this gun has four
bullets<00:01:03.019> per<00:01:03.229> clip<00:01:03.500> out<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.550> 24<00:01:05.300> and<00:01:05.449> reserves

bullets per clip out of 24 and reserves

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.100 
bullets per clip out of 24 and reserves
so<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:07.790> bullet<00:01:08.150> duration<00:01:08.659> on<00:01:08.750> this<00:01:08.900> gun

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
so you the bullet duration on this gun

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.440 
so you the bullet duration on this gun
is<00:01:09.350> not<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:09.950> great<00:01:10.220> you're<00:01:11.120> going<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:11.330> run

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
is not that great you're going to run

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.330 
is not that great you're going to run
out<00:01:11.630> of<00:01:11.690> bullets<00:01:11.870> put<00:01:12.409> your<00:01:12.500> fast<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.070> you're

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
out of bullets put your fast and you're

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.870 
out of bullets put your fast and you're
gonna<00:01:13.460> have<00:01:13.580> to<00:01:13.700> switch<00:01:13.940> to<00:01:14.210> your<00:01:14.450> secondary

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
gonna have to switch to your secondary

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.810 
gonna have to switch to your secondary
and<00:01:16.880> use<00:01:17.120> that

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
and use that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.010 
and use that
the<00:01:19.210> accuracy<00:01:19.570> on<00:01:19.930> this<00:01:20.050> gun<00:01:20.670> m700<00:01:21.670> that's<00:01:22.600> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
the accuracy on this gun m700 that's the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.360 
the accuracy on this gun m700 that's the
accuracy<00:01:23.440> basically<00:01:23.979> all<00:01:25.350> actions<00:01:26.370> pretty

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
accuracy basically all actions pretty

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.020 
accuracy basically all actions pretty
much<00:01:27.580> fine<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:29.440> range<00:01:29.680> on<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.580> range<00:01:30.790> is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
much fine the range on it the range is

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.610 
much fine the range on it the range is
fine

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
fine

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.000 
fine
the<00:01:33.520> range<00:01:33.730> can<00:01:34.570> be<00:01:34.600> compared<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.140> an<00:01:35.350> all<00:01:35.530> so

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
the range can be compared to an all so

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.340 
the range can be compared to an all so
that's<00:01:36.430> fine<00:01:38.640> another<00:01:39.640> thing<00:01:39.910> to<00:01:40.030> say<00:01:40.240> is<00:01:40.480> that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
that's fine another thing to say is that

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.920 
that's fine another thing to say is that
this<00:01:41.620> gun<00:01:41.890> doesn't<00:01:42.100> have<00:01:42.480> you<00:01:43.480> know<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:43.630> can't

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
this gun doesn't have you know you can't

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.410 
this gun doesn't have you know you can't
scope<00:01:44.260> in<00:01:44.440> two<00:01:44.650> times<00:01:44.890> with<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.160> so<00:01:45.550> you<00:01:46.240> can

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
scope in two times with it so you can

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.470 
scope in two times with it so you can
get<00:01:46.630> some<00:01:46.840> really<00:01:47.170> sick<00:01:47.620> crazy<00:01:48.180> trick<00:01:49.180> shots

get some really sick crazy trick shots
with<00:01:49.720> this<00:01:49.960> cause<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:50.980> can<00:01:51.130> zoom<00:01:51.340> in<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.520> really

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
with this cause you can zoom in a really

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.910 
with this cause you can zoom in a really
really<00:01:52.000> fast<00:01:52.300> with<00:01:52.510> this<00:01:52.660> thing<00:01:52.900> like<00:01:53.650> it's

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
times people have one already so it's

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.350 
times people have one already so it's
definitely<00:02:22.420> worth<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.810> GP<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:24.520> in<00:02:25.240> my

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
definitely worth the GP but in my

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.790 
definitely worth the GP but in my
opinion<00:02:25.480> they<00:02:25.960> shouldn't<00:02:26.260> have<00:02:26.350> put<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.650> as<00:02:26.770> a

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
opinion they shouldn't have put it as a

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.260 
opinion they shouldn't have put it as a
crate<00:02:27.160> gun<00:02:27.370> they<00:02:27.550> should<00:02:27.730> have<00:02:27.820> put<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.120> as<00:02:28.240> a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
crate gun they should have put it as a

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.190
