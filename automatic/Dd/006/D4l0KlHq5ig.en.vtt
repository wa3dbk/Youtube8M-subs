of you know partially composted leaves

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.650 
of you know partially composted leaves
and<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:25.700> was<00:02:25.970> how<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.510> left<00:02:26.810> things<00:02:26.900> and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
basically in this video I'm telling you

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.980 
basically in this video I'm telling you
the<00:02:31.100> lesson<00:02:31.490> I<00:02:31.580> have<00:02:31.760> learned<00:02:31.790> because<00:02:32.660> when<00:02:32.960> I

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
the lesson I have learned because when I

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.490 
the lesson I have learned because when I
came<00:02:33.110> over<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.770> my<00:02:34.100> homemade<00:02:34.760> tray<00:02:35.180> here<00:02:35.630> which

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
came over to my homemade tray here which

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.430 
came over to my homemade tray here which
is<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:37.370> know<00:02:37.460> a<00:02:37.880> one<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.870> those<00:02:38.960> things<00:02:39.290> I

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
is you know a one of those things I

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.350 
is you know a one of those things I
guess<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.710> would<00:02:39.830> put<00:02:40.010> sweaters<00:02:40.340> under<00:02:41.210> your

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
guess you would put sweaters under your

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.840 
guess you would put sweaters under your
bed<00:02:41.570> or<00:02:41.810> something<00:02:42.050> for<00:02:42.320> storage<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:43.670> was

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
bed or something for storage that was

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.170 
bed or something for storage that was
being<00:02:44.390> thrown<00:02:44.630> out<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.140> salvaged<00:02:46.180> but

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
being thrown out that I salvaged but

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.850 
being thrown out that I salvaged but
I've<00:02:47.300> been<00:02:47.480> using<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.900> down<00:02:48.050> here<00:02:48.320> for<00:02:48.530> making

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
I've been using it down here for making

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.680 
I've been using it down here for making
worm<00:02:49.310> compost<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:52.370> never<00:02:53.060> did<00:02:53.330> get<00:02:53.450> around

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
worm compost and I never did get around

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.720 
worm compost and I never did get around
to<00:02:53.840> putting<00:02:54.080> holes<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.710> top<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.190> ventilate

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
to putting holes in the top to ventilate

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.960 
to putting holes in the top to ventilate
it<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.960> totally<00:02:57.260> overfed<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.880> know

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.270 
recently and when I came over to it I
may<00:03:02.840> have<00:03:02.960> to<00:03:03.050> pause<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.500> video<00:03:03.590> for<00:03:03.770> a<00:03:03.980> moment

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
may have to pause the video for a moment

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
may have to pause the video for a moment

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
side but look at the thousands of worms

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.340 
side but look at the thousands of worms
up<00:03:21.560> around<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.220> edge<00:03:22.840> almost<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:24.200> they're

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
up around the edge almost like they're

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.050 
up around the edge almost like they're
trying<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.710> make<00:03:24.920> an<00:03:25.070> escape<00:03:25.370> some<00:03:25.820> kind<00:03:26.030> of

mass exodus here and you know I I think

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.890 
mass exodus here and you know I I think
I<00:03:30.410> just<00:03:30.440> had<00:03:30.830> over<00:03:31.160> fed<00:03:31.460> them<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.450> got<00:03:32.630> kind

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
I just had over fed them and it got kind

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.630 
I just had over fed them and it got kind
of<00:03:32.960> funny<00:03:33.260> smelling<00:03:33.770> and<00:03:33.890> look<00:03:34.040> at<00:03:34.160> all<00:03:34.370> these

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
of funny smelling and look at all these

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.020 
of funny smelling and look at all these
worms<00:03:34.910> all<00:03:35.210> the<00:03:35.450> way<00:03:35.540> around<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.900> edge<00:03:36.080> and

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
worms all the way around the edge and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.430 
worms all the way around the edge and
you<00:03:38.030> know<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.150> had<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.420> lid<00:03:38.630> on<00:03:38.810> top<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.140> just

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
you know I had the lid on top and just

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.440 
you know I had the lid on top and just
around<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.220> edge<00:03:40.370> would<00:03:40.670> be<00:03:40.790> that<00:03:40.940> one<00:03:41.150> spot

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
around the edge would be that one spot

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.240 
around the edge would be that one spot
where<00:03:41.870> they<00:03:41.990> could<00:03:42.140> get<00:03:42.320> some<00:03:42.530> fresh<00:03:42.800> air<00:03:43.040> away

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
where they could get some fresh air away

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.580 
where they could get some fresh air away
from<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.610> funky<00:03:44.150> smell<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.690> is<00:03:45.170> in<00:03:45.350> here<00:03:45.530> for

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
from the funky smell that is in here for

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.740 
from the funky smell that is in here for
the<00:03:45.770> first<00:03:45.800> time<00:03:46.270> normally<00:03:47.270> I<00:03:47.300> do<00:03:47.390> not<00:03:47.510> have

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
the first time normally I do not have

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.900 
the first time normally I do not have
any<00:03:47.930> real<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.680> know<00:03:48.770> significant<00:03:49.520> smell<00:03:49.760> at

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
any real you know significant smell at

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.720 
any real you know significant smell at
all<00:03:50.030> from<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.510> worm<00:03:50.870> bins<00:03:51.200> but<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.220> really<00:03:52.550> I

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
all from the worm bins but I really I

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.370 
all from the worm bins but I really I
think<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.209> over<00:03:53.570> fed<00:03:53.780> this<00:03:53.990> one<00:03:54.200> and

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
think I over fed this one and

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.130 
think I over fed this one and
particularly<00:03:54.950> this<00:03:55.130> bin<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.700> few<00:03:56.480> got<00:03:56.660> out<00:03:56.840> here

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
particularly this bin a few got out here

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.860 
particularly this bin a few got out here
just<00:03:57.440> as<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:57.740> opened<00:03:58.180> this<00:03:59.180> I'll<00:03:59.510> put<00:03:59.720> those

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
just as I opened this I'll put those

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.630 
just as I opened this I'll put those
back<00:04:00.140> in<00:04:00.170> in<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.560> minute<00:04:00.800> when<00:04:00.890> I'm<00:04:01.010> done<00:04:01.130> taping

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
back in in a minute when I'm done taping

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.660 
back in in a minute when I'm done taping
and<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:02.930> think<00:04:03.770> just<00:04:04.040> you<00:04:04.340> know<00:04:04.490> this

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
and I think just you know this

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.190 
and I think just you know this
non-ventilated<00:04:05.920> bin<00:04:06.920> of<00:04:07.420> was<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:08.810> know<00:04:08.900> the

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
non-ventilated bin of was you know the

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.320 
non-ventilated bin of was you know the
source<00:04:09.470> of<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.890> funky<00:04:10.340> smell<00:04:10.400> methane<00:04:11.120> or

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
source of that funky smell methane or

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.210 
source of that funky smell methane or
who<00:04:11.420> knows<00:04:11.630> what<00:04:11.870> but<00:04:12.140> look<00:04:12.590> at<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.770> meatiness

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
who knows what but look at the meatiness

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.000 
who knows what but look at the meatiness
of<00:04:13.400> these<00:04:14.000> forms<00:04:14.510> I'm<00:04:15.350> going<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.560> pick<00:04:15.740> up<00:04:15.860> a

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
of these forms I'm going to pick up a

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.410 
of these forms I'm going to pick up a
few<00:04:16.190> they're<00:04:16.400> really<00:04:16.609> kind<00:04:16.820> of<00:04:16.940> sticky<00:04:17.180> and

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
few they're really kind of sticky and

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.400 
few they're really kind of sticky and
slimy<00:04:18.130> but<00:04:19.130> normally<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.090> never<00:04:20.870> get<00:04:21.049> to<00:04:21.200> see

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
slimy but normally you never get to see

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.690 
slimy but normally you never get to see
them<00:04:21.590> in<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:21.859> way<00:04:22.040> because<00:04:22.250> they're<00:04:22.550> always

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
them in this way because they're always

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.530 
them in this way because they're always
in<00:04:23.030> amongst<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.780> compost<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.910> stuff<00:04:26.300> so

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
in amongst the compost and the stuff so

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.310 
in amongst the compost and the stuff so
you<00:04:26.660> see<00:04:26.870> a<00:04:26.900> little<00:04:27.080> tail<00:04:27.410> of<00:04:27.680> one<00:04:27.890> or

around to putting some holes in the lid
and<00:04:47.340> ventilating<00:04:47.970> it<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.300> obviously<00:04:48.720> that's

get done and you know meanwhile I'll put
these<00:04:56.010> worms<00:04:56.280> back<00:04:56.610> in<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:56.940> bin<00:04:57.180> I'll<00:04:58.370> get

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
these worms back in the bin I'll get

these worms back in the bin I'll get
some<00:04:59.580> good<00:04:59.760> air<00:04:59.970> or<00:05:00.300> I'll<00:05:00.450> spread<00:05:00.690> these<00:05:00.870> worms

out<00:05:01.410> to<00:05:01.680> some<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.310> other<00:05:02.460> bins<00:05:02.990> and<00:05:03.990> you

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
out to some of the other bins and you

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.130 
out to some of the other bins and you
know<00:05:05.070> poke<00:05:05.940> some<00:05:06.150> home<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:06.450> know<00:05:06.540> drill<00:05:06.960> some

know poke some home you know drill some

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.830 
know poke some home you know drill some
holes<00:05:07.170> in<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.650> lid<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:08.070> give<00:05:08.280> some<00:05:08.820> air<00:05:09.090> to

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
holes in the lid to give some air to

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.110 
holes in the lid to give some air to
this<00:05:09.960> particular<00:05:10.530> bin<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.010> I'll<00:05:11.820> be<00:05:11.970> more

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
this particular bin and I'll be more

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.090 
this particular bin and I'll be more
careful<00:05:12.390> in<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.810> future<00:05:12.840> about<00:05:13.350> not<00:05:13.590> over

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
careful in the future about not over

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.610 
careful in the future about not over
feeding<00:05:14.400> one<00:05:15.330> bin<00:05:15.600> at<00:05:15.750> a<00:05:15.870> time<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.290> reason<00:05:16.560> I

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
feeding one bin at a time the reason I

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.400 
feeding one bin at a time the reason I
have<00:05:16.830> three<00:05:17.190> bins<00:05:17.460> is<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:18.330> avoid<00:05:18.660> over<00:05:18.990> feeding

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
have three bins is to avoid over feeding

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.250 
have three bins is to avoid over feeding
because<00:05:19.910> we<00:05:20.910> generate<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.360> lot<00:05:21.540> of<00:05:21.570> kitchen

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
because we generate a lot of kitchen

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.610 
because we generate a lot of kitchen
scraps<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:22.830> such<00:05:23.570> so<00:05:24.570> that's<00:05:24.840> about<00:05:25.020> it

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
scraps and such so that's about it

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.590 
scraps and such so that's about it
here's<00:05:26.100> another<00:05:26.760> bunch<00:05:27.000> of<00:05:27.150> worms<00:05:27.300> I'm

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
here's another bunch of worms I'm

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.400 
here's another bunch of worms I'm
putting<00:05:27.870> them<00:05:27.960> on<00:05:28.080> in<00:05:28.290> that's<00:05:29.190> all
