00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.150
 the bug has acted well-detected fans and the 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.580

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.740
 four attempts 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.480
 if it does not work scott you better go 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.500
 kill your computer 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.500
 the offside player 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:47.019
 here it crossfire me 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.220
 first you have properties in 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.460
 direct in the game 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.030
 the first local doc try 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.030
 archive 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:02.620
 the first kind you're going to do is 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:05.199
 if it excluded xistra pacha all I did not 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.220
 I'll do from here because the prison was 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.250
 activated 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.180
 so I will not delete it will register 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:19.390
 for the time being the third attempt to 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:22.119
 that you go before opening the game in 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.570
 everything that is here everything that 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.130
 you have a shortcut you close and open the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.690
 game that normally does not go there 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:36.880
 why these files interrupt and the f 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:40.959
 digital tacumbÃº third attempt 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.500
 You're going to start a computer. 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:50.369
 my still loose or 28 only think and 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.369
 restart and restart the internet 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.860
 last attempt 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.860
 otherwise you will not come 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:12.900
 and uninstalling the crossfire in was 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.380
 again 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.780
 This is going to be the bad thing if none of this 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.420
 if you better buy the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.640
