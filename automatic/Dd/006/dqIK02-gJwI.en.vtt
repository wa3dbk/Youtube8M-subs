00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:05.049 

okay<00:00:01.379> so<00:00:01.439> here<00:00:01.889> we<00:00:02.040> are<00:00:02.510> taking<00:00:03.510> our<00:00:03.870> first

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:05.059 
okay so here we are taking our first

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:10.040 
okay so here we are taking our first
well<00:00:06.059> actually<00:00:06.299> we're<00:00:07.200> taking<00:00:07.619> the<00:00:09.050> what's

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
well actually we're taking the what's

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.140 
well actually we're taking the what's
the<00:00:10.290> FG<00:00:11.450> final<00:00:12.450> gravity<00:00:12.900> reading<00:00:14.000> so<00:00:15.000> we'll

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
the FG final gravity reading so we'll

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.439 
the FG final gravity reading so we'll
see<00:00:15.360> where<00:00:15.510> we're<00:00:15.600> at

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
see where we're at

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:25.790 
see where we're at
it's<00:00:18.449> got<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.599> nice<00:00:18.749> color<00:00:24.349> get<00:00:25.349> those<00:00:25.470> bubbles

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
it's got a nice color get those bubbles

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:47.220 
it's got a nice color get those bubbles
out<00:00:26.130> there<00:00:28.069> that's<00:00:29.069> right<00:00:29.249> now<00:00:29.429> we're

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.259 

probably<00:00:48.179> 1.0<00:00:50.039> 11.0<00:00:51.039> at<00:00:51.820> least<00:00:52.089> it<00:00:52.239> looks

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
probably 1.0 11.0 at least it looks

00:00:52.269 --> 00:01:08.670 
probably 1.0 11.0 at least it looks
tilted<00:01:03.420> at<00:01:04.420> that<00:01:04.690> one<00:01:05.049> is<00:01:05.460> 1.01<00:01:07.440> so<00:01:08.440> if<00:01:08.560> your

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
tilted at that one is 1.01 so if your

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.210 
tilted at that one is 1.01 so if your
one<00:01:08.920> line<00:01:09.100> below<00:01:09.460> that<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:10.240> goes<00:01:10.390> by<00:01:10.600> 2<00:01:10.659> so<00:01:10.960> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
one line below that it goes by 2 so the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.740 
one line below that it goes by 2 so the
0.12<00:01:12.250> or<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:15.070> got<00:01:15.850> me<00:01:17.490> that's<00:01:18.490> 2<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.149> 2<00:01:19.360> would<00:01:19.720> be

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
0.12 or I got me that's 2 the 2 would be

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:28.859 
0.12 or I got me that's 2 the 2 would be
point<00:01:20.340> 1.0<00:01:21.340> -<00:01:21.399> well<00:01:23.550> regardless<00:01:27.869> regardless

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
point 1.0 - well regardless regardless

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.169 
point 1.0 - well regardless regardless
it's<00:01:29.409> fermented<00:01:29.860> do<00:01:30.009> we<00:01:30.130> we're<00:01:30.729> way<00:01:30.940> below

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
it's fermented do we we're way below

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.510 
it's fermented do we we're way below
where<00:01:31.450> was<00:01:31.690> would<00:01:32.049> have<00:01:32.140> been<00:01:32.350> if<00:01:32.530> we<00:01:33.220> hadn't

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
where was would have been if we hadn't

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.850 
where was would have been if we hadn't
done<00:01:33.640> it<00:01:33.729> yet<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:38.350> was<00:01:38.470> just<00:01:38.649> from<00:01:38.799> the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
done it yet it was just from the

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.109 
done it yet it was just from the
beginning<00:01:38.979> because<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.520> just<00:01:39.700> opened<00:01:40.090> it

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
beginning because I just opened it

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:48.440 
beginning because I just opened it
secret<00:01:40.720> way<00:01:40.899> in<00:01:41.080> there<00:01:41.259> you<00:01:41.920> know<00:01:42.039> just<00:01:42.190> do<00:01:42.399> it

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:57.509 

I<00:01:49.450> told<00:01:50.049> you<00:01:54.119> burn<00:01:55.119> my<00:01:55.299> nose
