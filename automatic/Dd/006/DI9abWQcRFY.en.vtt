00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.140 
retweet it wasn't an endorsement we were
just<00:01:37.409> trying<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.680> put<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.430> article<00:01:38.909> out<00:01:39.000> to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
just trying to put this article out to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.789 
just trying to put this article out to
talk<00:01:39.270> about<00:01:39.420> inspirational<00:01:40.200> women<00:01:40.350> they've

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
talk about inspirational women they've

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.620 
talk about inspirational women they've
essentially<00:01:41.189> violated<00:01:41.850> their<00:01:41.970> own<00:01:42.090> policy

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
essentially violated their own policy

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.880 
essentially violated their own policy
and<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:42.899> think<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> big<00:01:43.740> deal

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and I do think that is a big deal

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.499 
and I do think that is a big deal
because<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.250> goes<00:01:44.399> against<00:01:44.700> sort<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> core

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
because it goes against sort of the core

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.580 
because it goes against sort of the core
