00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.410
 the belts from the shore line are 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.360
 actually allround harnesses I 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.880
 Climbing over sports climbing 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.010
 to alpine climbing outstanding 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.190
 benefit can happen 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.040
 these four straps on the mammoth two 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.650
 technology of railway technology 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.620
 the one we have by running webbing 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.780
 have and a second support wall that 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.730
 continuous webbing runs on the 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.010
 lower edge of the helps briefly the support wall 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.360
 At the top we reach 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.120
 a very even pressure distribution 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.829
 over the entire surface of the belt should 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.510
 comes that we have the space between the 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.540
 excellent use of both countries 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.239
 can create and breathability 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.880
 we rely on air-permeable 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.369
 mesh materials and perforated upholstery 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.729
 Foams allowing the strap to climb 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.100
 In addition, all are good breathes 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.889
 from the family with the well-known mammoth 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.659
 features equipped like that 

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:19.030
 protectors in plastic cushioned protection 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.740
 the two sleep connection or 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.270
 falling asleep before abrasion 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.409
 protected and thus the life of 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.299
 the hat massively increased 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.280
 a security feature is the 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.490
 indicator technology 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.500
 this comes just number of rain and in the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.409
 upper number bend for use 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.200
 the colder technology means that at 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.759
 excessive wear a red core to 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.069
 the fore is how to do it here for 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.500
 for example, a climber 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.539
 can see if 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.859
 this red core comes to light 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.780
 it actually indicates for the 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.859
 climber that it is high time the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.959
 to replace climbing harness 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.989
 besides these special mammut features 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.459
 The strap features classic harness 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.200
 features on how much material 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:07.489
 overslept so that I have enough material 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.079
 can transport and take off a ball 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.989
 Here I can either take my job away 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:13.849
 attach but also larger loads when 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.810
 alpine or big board fathers 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.810
 transport
