very very good free free design load I

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.070 
very very good free free design load I
think<00:05:40.300> you<00:05:40.360> get<00:05:40.479> a<00:05:40.510> couple<00:05:40.780> of<00:05:40.840> offline

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
think you get a couple of offline

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.029 
think you get a couple of offline
fractions<00:05:42.419> but<00:05:43.419> I<00:05:43.630> just<00:05:44.560> purchased<00:05:44.710> a<00:05:44.890> whole

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
fractions but I just purchased a whole

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.330 
fractions but I just purchased a whole
lot<00:05:45.190> is<00:05:45.340> 69p<00:05:46.060> upper<00:05:46.360> a<00:05:46.660> summoner<00:05:47.349> 69p<00:05:48.070> for<00:05:48.250> the

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
lot is 69p upper a summoner 69p for the

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.100 
lot is 69p upper a summoner 69p for the

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
common unit so it I think is about one

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.360 
common unit so it I think is about one
plane<00:05:50.289> eighty<00:05:50.470> or<00:05:50.650> so

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
plane eighty or so

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.930

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.250 
a bit harder to play on the iPhone if I
start<00:06:39.130> a<00:06:39.160> new<00:06:39.220> game<00:06:39.430> against<00:06:39.729> the<00:06:39.850> AI<00:06:40.260> anybody

to<00:06:41.320> do<00:06:41.440> and<00:06:42.330> obviously<00:06:43.330> you<00:06:43.479> can<00:06:43.630> see<00:06:43.810> that<00:06:44.050> the

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:44.289 
to do and obviously you can see that the

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.270 
to do and obviously you can see that the
icons<00:06:44.620> are<00:06:44.740> a<00:06:44.770> lot<00:06:44.950> smaller<00:06:45.250> and<00:06:45.789> playable<00:06:47.280> and

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
icons are a lot smaller and playable and

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.159 
icons are a lot smaller and playable and
you<00:06:48.400> get<00:06:48.520> a<00:06:48.550> full<00:06:48.760> view<00:06:49.000> of<00:06:49.030> the<00:06:49.120> cards<00:06:49.479> and

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
you get a full view of the cards and

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.300 
you get a full view of the cards and
what<00:06:50.350> there's<00:06:50.530> something<00:06:50.710> you<00:06:51.010> know<00:06:51.130> what

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
what there's something you know what

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.820 
what there's something you know what
their<00:06:51.430> values<00:06:51.729> are<00:06:52.110> but<00:06:53.110> it's<00:06:53.289> I<00:06:53.470> prefer<00:06:53.740> it<00:06:53.800> on

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
their values are but it's I prefer it on

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.500 
their values are but it's I prefer it on
the<00:06:53.949> iPad<00:06:54.310> I<00:06:54.520> probably<00:06:54.910> would<00:06:55.120> pay<00:06:55.270> to<00:06:55.330> lit

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.510 
the iPad I probably would pay to lit

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.909 
the iPad I probably would pay to lit
play<00:06:55.690> this<00:06:55.870> though<00:06:56.050> if<00:06:56.169> I<00:06:56.260> was<00:06:56.410> traveling<00:06:56.770> and

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 
play this though if I was traveling and

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:58.590 
play this though if I was traveling and
I<00:06:57.190> had<00:06:57.639> a<00:06:57.700> notification<00:06:57.940> saying<00:06:58.270> it<00:06:58.419> was<00:06:58.510> my

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
I had a notification saying it was my

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.420 
I had a notification saying it was my
turn<00:06:58.840> I<00:06:59.020> probably<00:06:59.200> would<00:06:59.440> just<00:06:59.470> crack<00:07:00.160> out<00:07:00.310> the

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
turn I probably would just crack out the

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:06.419 
turn I probably would just crack out the
iPhone<00:07:00.550> and<00:07:01.680> do<00:07:02.680> it<00:07:02.830> anyway<00:07:03.520> guys<00:07:03.700> enjoy
