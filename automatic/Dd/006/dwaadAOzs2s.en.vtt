Choo<00:00:59.719> these<00:01:00.719> gas<00:01:01.020> struts<00:01:01.440> I've<00:01:01.710> got<00:01:01.920> from

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
Choo these gas struts I've got from

sprats direct the same again just to get

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.929 
sprats direct the same again just to get
them<00:01:16.350> shipped<00:01:16.530> out<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:19.490> why<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> went<00:01:20.820> for

them shipped out here and why I went for

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.230 
them shipped out here and why I went for
these<00:01:21.210> struts<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.799> look<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> side

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.969 

these<00:01:27.240> particular<00:01:27.689> struts<00:01:28.229> came<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:29.540> 2<00:01:30.540> 1<00:01:30.979> mm

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
these particular struts came with 2 1 mm

gas<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> maximum<00:01:37.710> limit<00:01:38.240> what<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.659> do

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
gas to the maximum limit what you can do

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:49.910 
gas to the maximum limit what you can do
is<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.329> twist<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.259> release<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
is you can twist it and just release the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.210 
is you can twist it and just release the
gas<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.930> could<00:01:52.110> get<00:01:52.290> someone<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
gas and you could get someone on the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.959 
gas and you could get someone on the
other<00:01:53.250> side<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:54.180> release<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.780> gas<00:01:55.939> at<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
other side to release the gas at the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.010 
other side to release the gas at the
same<00:01:57.090> time<00:01:59.180> release<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> little<00:02:00.570> bit<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.780> gas

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
same time release a little bit of gas

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.600 
same time release a little bit of gas
push<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.680> down<00:02:02.060> see<00:02:03.060> how<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.270> goes

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.710 

the<00:02:10.000> way<00:02:10.950> I've<00:02:11.950> designed<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:13.030> geometry<00:02:15.720> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
the way I've designed the geometry the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.330 
the way I've designed the geometry the
mechanism<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:18.730> say<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.350> it's<00:02:20.350> easy<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:21.130> lift

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
mechanism you say that it's easy to lift

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.460 
mechanism you say that it's easy to lift
up<00:02:21.670> but<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.600> won't<00:02:22.870> blow<00:02:23.260> over<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:25.090> wind

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
up but it won't blow over in the wind

00:02:25.470 --> 00:03:21.110 
up but it won't blow over in the wind
and<00:02:26.470> kids<00:02:27.220> can't<00:02:27.550> really<00:02:27.880> push<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.150> over<00:02:28.660> but

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.490 

what's<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.390> Conner

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:52.530 

so<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.709> castle<00:03:41.250> it's<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.400> Disney<00:03:42.610> Castle

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:05:22.760 

I<00:03:53.189> don't<00:03:54.189> know<00:03:54.340> one<00:03:54.670> with<00:03:54.819> Mickey<00:03:55.150> Minnie

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:45.230 

where's<00:05:23.770> Mickey<00:05:42.840> are<00:05:43.840> you<00:05:43.960> giving<00:05:44.320> her<00:05:44.440> kiss

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
where's Mickey are you giving her kiss

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.730 
where's Mickey are you giving her kiss
look<00:05:46.240> in<00:05:46.600> the<00:05:46.720> picture<00:05:47.110> you're<00:05:47.289> doing<00:05:47.560> her

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
look in the picture you're doing her

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.070 
look in the picture you're doing her
