00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
about the did a review of the blade msl

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.009 
about the did a review of the blade msl
Rx<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.150> talked<00:00:12.389> about<00:00:12.450> getting<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.900> new

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
Rx and I talked about getting a new

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.540 
Rx and I talked about getting a new
transmitter<00:00:13.620> for<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.190> binding<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:15.210> a

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
transmitter for it binding it with a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.370 
transmitter for it binding it with a
dx6i<00:00:17.550> well<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.240> went<00:00:18.600> ahead<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.810> ordered<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
dx6i well I went ahead and ordered the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.939 
dx6i well I went ahead and ordered the
dx6i<00:00:20.060> and<00:00:21.060> I'm<00:00:22.050> gonna<00:00:22.170> do<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> little<00:00:22.650> quick

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
dx6i and I'm gonna do a little quick

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.929 
dx6i and I'm gonna do a little quick
unboxing<00:00:23.130> show<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.900> then<00:00:25.939> later

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
unboxing show it to you and then later

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.330 
unboxing show it to you and then later
on<00:00:27.090> I'll<00:00:27.539> do<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.140> quick<00:00:28.320> video<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.710> how<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.039> bind

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
on I'll do a quick video on how to bind

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.200 
on I'll do a quick video on how to bind
it<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.949> MSR<00:00:31.949> X<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.579> as<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.180> I

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
it to the MSR X and as you can see I

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.590 
it to the MSR X and as you can see I
also<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> blade<00:00:34.320> 120<00:00:34.860> s<00:00:35.010> R<00:00:35.250> ok<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.270> let's

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
also have the blade 120 s R ok so let's

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.790 
also have the blade 120 s R ok so let's
get<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.809> unboxing<00:00:36.930> because<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
get to the unboxing because that's the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:01:06.940 
get to the unboxing because that's the
cool<00:00:37.950> part<00:00:58.070> all<00:00:59.070> right

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.640 

it<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.310> also<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:10.550> Phoenix<00:01:11.660> v3<00:01:12.660> flight

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it was also the Phoenix v3 flight

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.340 
it was also the Phoenix v3 flight
simulator<00:01:14.070> because<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.880> figured<00:01:15.270> its<00:01:16.050> private

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
simulator because I figured its private

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.510 
simulator because I figured its private
the<00:01:16.410> best<00:01:16.530> way<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> learn<00:01:16.979> instead<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the best way to learn instead of

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.400 
the best way to learn instead of
crashing<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.270> having<00:01:18.600> my<00:01:18.720> wife<00:01:18.900> mad<00:01:19.170> at<00:01:19.290> me

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
crashing and having my wife mad at me

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.170 
crashing and having my wife mad at me
because<00:01:19.580> spending<00:01:20.580> too<00:01:20.729> much<00:01:20.760> money<00:01:20.910> on

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
because spending too much money on

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:38.170 
because spending too much money on
helicopters<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.010> got<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.400> good<00:01:24.000> deal<00:01:36.830> EXI

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
helicopters so I got this good deal EXI

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:52.620 
helicopters so I got this good deal EXI
and<00:01:39.180> let<00:01:39.600> me<00:01:39.690> go<00:01:39.810> ahead<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.050> just<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> camp

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.940

I'm<00:01:55.950> sure<00:01:56.190> this<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.550> not<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.880> first<00:01:57.090> unboxing

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
I'm sure this is not the first unboxing

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.389 
I'm sure this is not the first unboxing
of<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.410> particular<00:01:58.710> piece<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.220> equipment

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
of this particular piece of equipment

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.889 
of this particular piece of equipment
but<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.420> enjoy<00:02:01.369> videos<00:02:02.369> boxing<00:02:03.360> stuff<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.840> I

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
but I enjoy videos boxing stuff so I

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:15.740 
but I enjoy videos boxing stuff so I
figured<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.259> would<00:02:04.440> do<00:02:04.770> one<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:14.030> side<00:02:15.030> down<00:02:15.240> so

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
figured I would do one to side down so

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.210 
figured I would do one to side down so
that's<00:02:15.990> cool<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.590> comes<00:02:16.770> with<00:02:16.950> batteries

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
that's cool so it comes with batteries

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:27.760 
that's cool so it comes with batteries
and<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:20.160> charger<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:25.640> some<00:02:26.640> extra<00:02:27.000> parts

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
and the charger and some extra parts

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.070 
and the charger and some extra parts
sure<00:02:28.770> I'll<00:02:28.920> learn<00:02:29.220> what<00:02:29.459> they<00:02:29.580> are<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.450> then

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
sure I'll learn what they are and then

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.140 
sure I'll learn what they are and then
the<00:02:31.560> cool<00:02:31.830> cake<00:02:33.620> kick-ass<00:02:34.620> transmitter<00:02:35.280> okay

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
the cool cake kick-ass transmitter okay

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.730 
the cool cake kick-ass transmitter okay
so<00:02:36.209> there<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.950> I'm<00:02:37.950> gonna<00:02:38.069> go<00:02:38.220> ahead<00:02:38.340> and

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
so there it is I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.640 
so there it is I'm gonna go ahead and
put<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.830> batteries<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:42.270> then<00:02:43.080> find<00:02:43.470> it

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
put the batteries in it and then find it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.470 
put the batteries in it and then find it
with<00:02:43.800> my<00:02:44.099> two<00:02:44.160> helicopters<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.060> see<00:02:45.209> how<00:02:45.270> that

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
with my two helicopters and see how that

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.890 
with my two helicopters and see how that
works<00:02:45.660> out<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:46.800> you're<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> newbie<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.370> me<00:02:47.900> now

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
works out if you're a newbie like me now

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.370 
works out if you're a newbie like me now
you<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.500> see<00:02:49.920> how<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.130> bind<00:02:50.630> dx6i<00:02:51.630> spectrum

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
you can see how to bind dx6i spectrum

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.110 
you can see how to bind dx6i spectrum
transmitter<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:54.050> spectrum<00:02:55.050> receivers

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
transmitter to spectrum receivers

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.380 
transmitter to spectrum receivers
okay<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.489> I've<00:02:59.489> got<00:02:59.550> the<00:03:00.530> dx6i<00:03:02.000> out<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.180> box

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
okay so I've got the dx6i out of the box

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.460 
okay so I've got the dx6i out of the box
the<00:03:03.840> batteries<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:06.450> I'm<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:07.230> gonna

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
the batteries in it and I'm just gonna

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.400 
the batteries in it and I'm just gonna
go<00:03:07.680> ahead<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:07.890> show<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.430> how<00:03:08.690> really<00:03:09.690> easy<00:03:10.140> it

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
go ahead and show you how really easy it

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.589 
go ahead and show you how really easy it
is<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:11.510> bind<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:15.110> blade<00:03:16.110> 120<00:03:16.769> Sr<00:03:17.160> and

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
is to bind this to the blade 120 Sr and

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:23.630 
is to bind this to the blade 120 Sr and
to<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:19.670> MSR<00:03:20.670> X<00:03:22.010> I'll<00:03:23.010> tell<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.280> right<00:03:23.310> now<00:03:23.610> I

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
to the MSR X I'll tell you right now I

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.440 
to the MSR X I'll tell you right now I
went<00:03:24.000> ahead<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.269> this<00:03:24.870> was<00:03:25.260> already<00:03:25.440> bound

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
went ahead and this was already bound

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.449 
went ahead and this was already bound
but<00:03:27.450> I'll<00:03:27.599> I'll<00:03:28.260> just<00:03:28.560> demonstrate<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.430> then

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
but I'll I'll just demonstrate and then

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.850 
but I'll I'll just demonstrate and then
I<00:03:30.269> will<00:03:30.420> go<00:03:30.599> through<00:03:31.049> with<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.620> MS<00:03:32.250> rx

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
I will go through with the MS rx

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.420 
I will go through with the MS rx
actually<00:03:34.860> actually<00:03:35.579> bind<00:03:35.819> that<00:03:36.000> on<00:03:36.599> camera

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
actually actually bind that on camera

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.680 
actually actually bind that on camera
and<00:03:38.430> we'll<00:03:38.970> see<00:03:39.180> how<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.450> goes

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
and we'll see how it goes

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.080 
and we'll see how it goes
okay<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:41.180> it's<00:03:42.180> real<00:03:42.360> simple<00:03:44.720> any<00:03:45.799> aircraft

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
okay so it's real simple any aircraft

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.630 
okay so it's real simple any aircraft
with<00:03:48.650> spectrum<00:03:49.650> receiver<00:03:50.129> in<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:52.489> from<00:03:53.489> what

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
with spectrum receiver in it from what

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.150 
with spectrum receiver in it from what
I've<00:03:53.790> seen<00:03:53.819> on<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:55.140> on<00:03:55.500> YouTube

battery and I hope you can see it you
see<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.870> light<00:04:10.049> flashing<00:04:10.230> okay<00:04:10.950> it's<00:04:11.069> looking

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
see the light flashing okay it's looking

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.089 
see the light flashing okay it's looking
for<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.400> transmitter<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.720> on<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.590> transmitter

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
for a transmitter so on the transmitter

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.370 
for a transmitter so on the transmitter
what<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.400> do<00:04:14.549> is<00:04:14.730> you<00:04:14.849> have<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:16.079> trainer

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
the transmitter on and it'll start it'll

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.409 
the transmitter on and it'll start it'll
say<00:04:23.639> buy<00:04:23.849> into<00:04:24.150> what<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.360> can't<00:04:24.570> see<00:04:24.810> right

dx6i<00:04:46.700> you<00:04:47.700> have<00:04:47.849> the<00:04:47.970> aircraft<00:04:48.120> menu<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.260> as

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
dx6i you have the aircraft menu and as

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.370 
dx6i you have the aircraft menu and as
you<00:04:49.590> can<00:04:49.680> see<00:04:49.740> it's<00:04:50.039> it's<00:04:50.669> heli<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:52.110> says

you can see it's it's heli and it says

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.520 
you can see it's it's heli and it says
120<00:04:53.370> s<00:04:53.639> are<00:04:53.849> already<00:04:54.270> that's<00:04:55.080> because<00:04:55.410> I

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
120 s are already that's because I

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.250 
120 s are already that's because I
already<00:04:55.680> programmed<00:04:56.310> that<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.870> what<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.139> do

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
already programmed that so what you do

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.740 
already programmed that so what you do
is<00:04:58.349> you<00:04:58.440> go<00:04:58.560> into<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.800> menus<00:04:59.690> that<00:05:00.690> are

outlined<00:05:00.960> in<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.410> manual<00:05:02.120> name<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.300> aircraft

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
outlined in the manual name the aircraft

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.760 
outlined in the manual name the aircraft
before<00:05:05.070> you<00:05:05.159> bind<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.870> let's<00:05:06.870> assign<00:05:07.349> it<00:05:07.560> the

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
before you bind it let's assign it the

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.390 
before you bind it let's assign it the
number<00:05:08.370> 1<00:05:08.550> through<00:05:08.729> 10

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
number 1 through 10

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.560 
number 1 through 10
and<00:05:10.180> then<00:05:10.870> buying<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.830> aircraft<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.880> that's

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
and then buying the aircraft and that's

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.950 
and then buying the aircraft and that's
it<00:05:13.780> so<00:05:14.470> I'm<00:05:15.100> gonna<00:05:15.190> go<00:05:15.310> ahead<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:15.750> try<00:05:16.750> and

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
it so I'm gonna go ahead and try and

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.070 
it so I'm gonna go ahead and try and
find<00:05:17.949> the<00:05:18.220> MSR<00:05:20.699> x2<00:05:21.699> this<00:05:21.880> transmitter<00:05:22.419> all

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
find the MSR x2 this transmitter all

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.450 
find the MSR x2 this transmitter all
right<00:05:23.260> let's<00:05:23.650> see<00:05:23.800> how<00:05:23.949> it<00:05:24.040> goes

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
right let's see how it goes

00:06:58.719 --> 00:06:58.729 
flashing so then I'm gonna go ahead and

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.899 
flashing so then I'm gonna go ahead and

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:10.849 
let go and hopefully it'll bind and it

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:13.540 
let go and hopefully it'll bind and it

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
does and we'll go and test everything

does and we'll go and test everything
everything<00:07:14.240> works<00:07:16.000> and<00:07:17.000> let's<00:07:17.659> see<00:07:17.780> if<00:07:17.840> we<00:07:17.930> get

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
everything works and let's see if we get

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 
this arrival to come up and it's

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.689 
this arrival to come up and it's
generally<00:07:25.520> it's<00:07:25.669> good<00:07:25.819> to<00:07:25.909> go<00:07:26.060> I<00:07:27.490> can't<00:07:28.490> test

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:28.699 
generally it's good to go I can't test

fly<00:07:28.940> the<00:07:29.360> MSR<00:07:29.779> X<00:07:29.930> because<00:07:30.319> I<00:07:30.590> found<00:07:31.219> out<00:07:31.460> that

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 
fly the MSR X because I found out that

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:35.110 
fly the MSR X because I found out that
the<00:07:32.750> MSR<00:07:33.169> X<00:07:33.380> does<00:07:33.590> not<00:07:33.770> like<00:07:34.099> the<00:07:34.310> side<00:07:34.580> of

the MSR X does not like the side of

the MSR X does not like the side of

00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 
house with your MSR X you tend to damage

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:46.420 
house with your MSR X you tend to damage
the<00:07:43.759> linkage<00:07:44.300> ball<00:07:44.569> joint<00:07:44.960> at<00:07:45.469> the<00:07:45.529> rotor<00:07:46.099> head

in<00:07:46.909> fact<00:07:47.180> you<00:07:47.300> break<00:07:47.509> it<00:07:47.659> off<00:07:47.810> so<00:07:50.139> that's<00:07:51.139> going

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 
in fact you break it off so that's going

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.800 
in fact you break it off so that's going
on<00:07:51.529> so<00:07:51.740> I<00:07:52.129> have<00:07:52.430> replacement<00:07:53.210> parts<00:07:53.419> on<00:07:53.539> order

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:53.810 
on so I have replacement parts on order

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.360 
on so I have replacement parts on order
for<00:07:53.960> this<00:07:54.110> I<00:07:54.289> should<00:07:55.069> be<00:07:55.129> here<00:07:55.219> in<00:07:55.279> a<00:07:55.310> couple

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:55.370 
for this I should be here in a couple

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.339 
for this I should be here in a couple
days<00:07:55.669> and<00:07:55.729> I'll<00:07:55.940> get<00:07:56.060> this<00:07:56.180> up<00:07:56.360> in<00:07:56.449> flight<00:07:56.690> so

00:07:57.339 --> 00:07:57.349 
days and I'll get this up in flight so

00:07:57.349 --> 00:08:02.290 
days and I'll get this up in flight so
that<00:07:57.830> was<00:07:57.979> it<00:07:58.210> live<00:07:59.860> and<00:08:00.860> in<00:08:01.009> front<00:08:01.250> of<00:08:01.310> you<00:08:01.460> I

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:02.300 
that was it live and in front of you I

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.540 
that was it live and in front of you I
bound<00:08:03.199> the<00:08:03.879> spectrum<00:08:04.879> dx6i<00:08:05.539> to<00:08:06.199> the<00:08:06.620> MSR<00:08:07.099> X<00:08:07.310> and

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:07.550 
bound the spectrum dx6i to the MSR X and

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.750 
bound the spectrum dx6i to the MSR X and
it<00:08:07.969> was<00:08:08.150> simple
