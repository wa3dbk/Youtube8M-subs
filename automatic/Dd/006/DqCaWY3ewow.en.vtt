three key factors number one is the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.930 
three key factors number one is the
global<00:00:57.750> financial<00:00:58.109> crisis<00:00:58.940> governments

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
of dollars to try and solve this problem

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.750

but<00:01:03.870> that's<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> result<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.769> inflation

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
but that's going to result in inflation

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.539 
but that's going to result in inflation
and<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.180> will<00:01:06.330> ultimately<00:01:06.510> result<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.380> the
