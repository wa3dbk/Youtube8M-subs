00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.410
 world famous is ungrateful jimmy who wrote his first concerto at 4 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.320
 hours and who recomposes is a human truth 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.930
 I preferred to keep these scenes to know the man I knew 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.360
 on the other hand, this film tells a very sad story 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.870
 a talented young man who separates a half 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.510
 nick who feels unfortunately financially learned ruins himself from it all 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.590
 young age I speak here mostly about his mother 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.770
 in his life at 12 o'clock tel he is tormented there are a lot of 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.570
 difficulties to be close to people 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.570
 after so many years alone practicing and pushing too hard 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.060
 until now at the beginning i was telling myself that something was missing at 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.170
 movie other character who is surrounded by andré mathieu 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.799
 it took me hand in hand understands that the characters without warrant and 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.540
 maybe the second 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.530
 tmmc to be the enemy of that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.229
 women 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.620
 he pretends to be all that 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.930
 practically lost gaps and with reflection I realized how much 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.030
 little matter that was alone that he had always been 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.770
 this is a bet is a mage he chatted and accurate of the desired uefa 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.359
 who then drop you for the tgi 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.659
 there we pay dearly for all these dishes hands to attach to the people around him and 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.389
 especially at 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.719
 meters instead of doubting the quality of the director's work I understood 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.089
 the spark meaning he had probably wanted to leave it's a 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:17.750
 term to the series of his debts 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.670
 he has the constant charge yesterday late morning dish of being 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.300
 conceived to be famous as he had been once that he was everything 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.039
 young 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.979
 a big one is the story of a young prodigy 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.140
 who in adult age plays classical music at one time 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.220
 to the inner flap will be cameron 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.630
 so at one time besides the classical music is unfortunately 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.799
 they do not stop giving up of his public who did not disclose 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.139
 amazing now part of the heads all 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.929
 I liked the film because the music precisely 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:51.390
 3 a range place in the egg 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.810
 and Monday in tribute to this compo is a cd far too young 69 20 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.370
 usually we went well beyond 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.339
 fingering blackmail and musicians 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:03.230
 we spend a lot of time after 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.910
 to discuss their personal lives 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.379
 and he's not sending me some famous songs 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.819
 and then it stops there 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.039
 here yes we talk a lot about his personal life 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:15.949
 but the music 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.679
 the whole place attended Thursday at a hand 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:20.879
 to real when we stop 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.349
 more to attack is not known consorts deal a single film so is 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:25.310
 as I said 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.510
 they are characters 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.660
 those we stop 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.040
 nantes isabel richer the land rather French papineau 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.480
 mitsou gélinas karine vanasse india may supply them 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.480
 fuel costs definitely to the four main players 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.400
 either macha grenon marc labrèche 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.639
 and of course 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.499
 patrick drolet and young guillaume the banker two donkeys 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:49.379
 an incredible performance it is probably necessary 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.049
 so in terms of performance pck not star wars and music I 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.299
 proposes his films absolutely 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.230
 it's a dvd dropping stoner but France and 1 5 point and shells of both 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.789
 time 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:06.109
 supports are spain in french there is an english linping age for 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.630
 martin daoust year one hand in french 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.010
 the format of the image of 16 parnasse of points 35 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.279
 the film has a duration of about it only has 40 minutes 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:18.380
 in the supplements we find three flours removed 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.730
 and he knows that a discussion around andré mathieu with the artisans of 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.409
 after 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.899
 in conclusion we must absolutely see that the movie for the story she has 

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:26.740
 told 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.640
 and it is not allowed to mathieu not held on the history of Quebec eyi 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.740
 the music that left us 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.310
 if you put your feet but I propose my life in cinemascope of 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.599
 demystify too much 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.130
 bus palladium by christopher arterton 5 me 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.849
 and first date two goals each thiès 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.309
 all distributed by m aliens reached various themes 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:47.340
