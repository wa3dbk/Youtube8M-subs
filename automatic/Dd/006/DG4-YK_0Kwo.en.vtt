today<00:00:03.330> we<00:00:03.509> are<00:00:03.570> making<00:00:03.750> foolery<00:00:04.470> balls<00:00:05.000> we

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
today we are making foolery balls we

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.020 
today we are making foolery balls we
start<00:00:06.299> with<00:00:06.479> the<00:00:06.600> glory<00:00:06.960> mix

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.710 

add<00:00:11.540> a<00:00:11.600> little<00:00:11.990> bit<00:00:12.140> of<00:00:12.410> water<00:00:13.360> stir<00:00:14.360> it<00:00:14.540> up<00:00:14.660> a

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:14.720 
add a little bit of water stir it up a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.690 
add a little bit of water stir it up a
bit<00:00:14.840> about<00:00:15.590> one<00:00:15.860> cup

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:30.009 

heat<00:00:19.270> some<00:00:19.540> oil<00:00:20.310> Koharu

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.150 

and<00:00:30.199> it's<00:00:30.380> Tony

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.430 

drop<00:00:33.760> it<00:00:33.940> in

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
drop it in

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.890 
drop it in
by<00:00:35.980> the<00:00:36.040> teaspoon

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
by the teaspoon

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:46.720 
by the teaspoon
it<00:00:38.080> will<00:00:38.290> begin<00:00:38.440> to<00:00:38.620> sizzle

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.130 

and<00:00:47.150> what<00:00:47.300> it<00:00:47.420> floats<00:00:47.920> simply

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.030 

turn<00:00:51.770> it<00:00:51.920> over

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.020 

that<00:00:55.580> one<00:00:55.760> wasn't<00:00:55.970> ready<00:00:56.300> yet

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:49.420 

should<00:01:02.239> be<00:01:02.390> golden<00:01:02.780> brown

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:02:04.920 

perhaps<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.330> oil<00:01:50.570> is<00:01:50.750> not<00:01:50.840> hot<00:01:50.900> enough

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.810 

maybe<00:02:05.440> that's<00:02:05.710> better<00:02:05.890> now<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.370> I<00:02:06.400> turn<00:02:06.700> the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
maybe that's better now that I turn the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:18.729 
maybe that's better now that I turn the
fan<00:02:07.780> off<00:02:08.200> or<00:02:09.130> minimum

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.860 

the<00:02:19.219> longer<00:02:19.579> you<00:02:19.700> leave<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:20.060> polari<00:02:20.390> balls<00:02:20.689> in

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
the longer you leave the polari balls in

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.070 
the longer you leave the polari balls in
the<00:02:20.930> oil<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.769> more<00:02:21.950> oil<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.430> will<00:02:22.519> soak<00:02:22.819> up

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.839 

and<00:02:27.080> thus<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.380> more<00:02:27.530> gets<00:02:27.830> into<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.160> system

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.099 

so<00:02:34.359> ideally<00:02:35.109> the<00:02:35.379> oil<00:02:35.560> should<00:02:35.739> be<00:02:35.799> hot<00:02:36.930> well<00:02:37.930> to

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
so ideally the oil should be hot well to

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:43.680 
so ideally the oil should be hot well to
water<00:02:38.319> we<00:02:38.499> end<00:02:38.650> up<00:02:38.769> with<00:02:38.889> burnt<00:02:39.129> ones

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:58.460 

although<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.500> does<00:02:44.650> say<00:02:44.860> instant<00:02:45.340> polarities

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.190 

let's<00:02:59.070> take<00:02:59.250> one<00:02:59.400> out<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.760> see<00:02:59.940> how<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.240> would

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
let's take one out to see how it would

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
let's take one out to see how it would
turn<00:03:01.410> out

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.120 

hmm

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.630 

this<00:03:11.130> looks

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.680 

it<00:03:16.030> actually<00:03:16.270> is<00:03:16.600> cooked<00:03:16.900> believe<00:03:17.740> it<00:03:17.830> or<00:03:17.950> not

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
it actually is cooked believe it or not

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.110 
it actually is cooked believe it or not
don't<00:03:19.200> see<00:03:19.350> much<00:03:19.470> dough

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.890 

hmm

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.260 

me

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.309 

that<00:03:32.900> means<00:03:33.170> hmm

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
that means hmm

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.319 
that means hmm
that<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.010> rest<00:03:36.189> are<00:03:36.340> probably<00:03:36.819> ready<00:03:36.999> to<00:03:37.180> come

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
that the rest are probably ready to come

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:43.320 
that the rest are probably ready to come
out<00:03:37.450> now

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.830 

looks<00:03:43.900> like<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:44.230> just<00:03:44.800> forgot<00:03:45.040> in

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
looks like you just forgot in

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.900 
looks like you just forgot in
take<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.590> out<00:03:47.739> already

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.309 

test<00:03:52.910> it<00:03:53.060> out

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.050 

yes

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.870 

you<00:04:04.270> have<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.540> be<00:04:04.630> very<00:04:04.780> careful<00:04:05.290> with<00:04:05.380> hot<00:04:05.560> oil

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
you have to be very careful with hot oil

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:14.100 
you have to be very careful with hot oil
pick<00:04:06.880> up<00:04:07.030> at<00:04:07.180> any<00:04:07.270> time

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.199 

the<00:04:14.620> last<00:04:14.800> one<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.010> took<00:04:15.130> out<00:04:15.400> it<00:04:15.580> is<00:04:15.850> a<00:04:15.910> little

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
the last one I took out it is a little

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:27.030 
the last one I took out it is a little
bit<00:04:16.330> soft<00:04:16.950> it's<00:04:17.950> not<00:04:18.160> mushy<00:04:18.430> though

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.710 

while<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.730> next<00:04:27.910> set<00:04:28.060> will<00:04:28.210> even<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:28.540> for<00:04:28.690> a

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
while the next set will even it for a

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:36.540 
while the next set will even it for a
little<00:04:28.960> bit<00:04:29.050> more<00:04:29.280> think

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.440 

let's<00:04:37.150> try<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.330> next<00:04:37.419> batch

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:51.799 

golde<00:04:42.450> bubbling<00:04:42.840> ground

00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:51.809 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:54.429 

there's<00:04:52.319> me<00:04:52.409> just<00:04:52.589> separated<00:04:53.159> it<00:04:53.249> but

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439 
there's me just separated it but

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.689 
there's me just separated it but
hopefully<00:04:55.439> they'll<00:04:55.589> be<00:04:55.619> reunited<00:04:56.279> belly

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:11.840 

can't<00:04:59.300> wait

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.460 

if<00:05:12.850> some<00:05:13.120> does<00:05:13.360> fall<00:05:13.810> on<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:14.020> side<00:05:14.230> of<00:05:14.290> the

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
if some does fall on the side of the

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.350 
if some does fall on the side of the
poet<00:05:14.710> just<00:05:14.890> simply<00:05:15.520> scrape<00:05:15.760> it<00:05:15.940> off<00:05:16.090> with<00:05:16.120> a

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
poet just simply scrape it off with a

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.210 
poet just simply scrape it off with a
spoon

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.119 

it<00:05:19.640> shouldn't<00:05:19.940> stick<00:05:20.180> as<00:05:20.480> always

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.129 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:39.720 

good<00:05:24.639> things

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.580 

all<00:05:40.210> right<00:05:40.390> well<00:05:40.600> we'll<00:05:40.840> continue<00:05:40.960> with<00:05:41.350> pot

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
all right well we'll continue with pot

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.880 
all right well we'll continue with pot
to<00:05:41.800> a<00:05:42.100> little<00:05:42.760> bit
