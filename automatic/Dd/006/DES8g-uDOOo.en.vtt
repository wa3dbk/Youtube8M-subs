00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
and up to fine you see graphics as usual

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.619 
and up to fine you see graphics as usual
this<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> different<00:00:50.820> though<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.449> turn

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.490 
this is different though you can turn
your<00:00:52.110> inner<00:00:52.410> distance<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.309> extreme<00:00:54.320> which<00:00:55.320> is

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
your inner distance to extreme which is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.119 
your inner distance to extreme which is
very<00:00:55.800> very<00:00:55.920> far<00:00:56.399> or<00:00:56.989> tiny<00:00:57.989> which<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.039> way

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
very very far or tiny which is the way

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.380 
very very far or tiny which is the way
you<00:00:59.190> usually<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.730> but<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.210> come

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
you usually have but you can do come

you get a dude let's be letting you can
change<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> levels<00:01:10.200> were<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.560> true

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
change the levels were like it's true

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.590 
change the levels were like it's true
graphically<00:01:11.490> here<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.030> increase<00:01:12.479> your

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
graphically here you can increase your

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.260 
graphically here you can increase your
performance<00:01:13.220> always<00:01:14.220> put<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.549> max<00:01:14.790> FPS

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
performance always put it on max FPS

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.789 
performance always put it on max FPS
just<00:01:15.630> because<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> max

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
amount of FBS obviously you can change

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.350 
amount of FBS obviously you can change
all<00:01:20.130> kinds<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.460> things<00:01:20.640> around<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.210> turn
