00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
increase the performance and the frames

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.310 
increase the performance and the frames
in<00:00:10.019> daylight<00:00:10.710> so<00:00:11.150> in<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.269> tutorial<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:13.019> need

in daylight so in this tutorial you need
just<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.490> follow<00:00:14.849> what<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.570> do<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:16.320> don't<00:00:16.440> need

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
just to follow what I do you don't need

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.330 
just to follow what I do you don't need
to<00:00:16.830> download<00:00:17.070> anything<00:00:18.650> everything<00:00:19.650> will<00:00:20.100> be

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
to download anything everything will be

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.720 
to download anything everything will be
just<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:21.600> Edition<00:00:22.380> some<00:00:22.619> files<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.130> your<00:00:23.160> game

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
just it Edition some files in your game

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.480 
just it Edition some files in your game
so<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.660> first<00:00:24.900> step<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.619> go<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.130> folder<00:00:26.460> of

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
so the first step we go to the folder of

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:39.709 
so the first step we go to the folder of
our<00:00:26.789> game<00:00:27.119> our<00:00:27.359> die<00:00:27.660> light<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:39.300> folder

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
our game our die light so the folder

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.930 
our game our die light so the folder
where<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.320> pass<00:00:40.590> all<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> game<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.730> case

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
where you pass all the game so in case

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.770 
where you pass all the game so in case
you<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.280> legal<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.879> find<00:00:45.180> controller

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
you have the legal we find controller

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.889 
you have the legal we find controller
seen<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:47.520> other<00:00:47.700> guys<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.300> guys<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.780> our

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
seen the other guys the guys with our

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.750 
seen the other guys the guys with our
loops<00:00:49.200> Kaiser<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.800> find<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.219> whatever<00:00:50.430> they

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
loops Kaiser will find it whatever they

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.119 
loops Kaiser will find it whatever they
are<00:00:50.789> sold<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:52.140> after<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.739> we<00:00:52.920> go<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
are sold it so now after that we go to

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.630 
are sold it so now after that we go to
DW<00:00:54.170> folder<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:56.719> we<00:00:57.719> find<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.789> data<00:00:59.789> 0

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
DW folder and we find this one data 0

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.109 
DW folder and we find this one data 0
right<00:01:02.640> click<00:01:02.969> open<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.320> choose<00:01:05.119> the

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
winner so after that we click data and

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.780 
winner so after that we click data and
we<00:01:13.460> look<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.700> scripts<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:16.400> right<00:01:17.400> over<00:01:17.640> here

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
we look for scripts and right over here

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.980 
we look for scripts and right over here
is<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:19.740> trick<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> open<00:01:22.080> look<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:22.830> forest

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
is a trick so open look for forest

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.109 
is a trick so open look for forest
performance<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.259> forest<00:01:25.740> noise<00:01:28.880> well<00:01:29.880> I'm

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
performance and forest noise well I'm

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.090 
performance and forest noise well I'm
sorry<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> noise<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.650> hear

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.030 

so<00:01:36.090> vilest<00:01:37.640> performance

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:51.649 

right<00:01:44.090> here<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.509> forest<00:01:46.189> noise<00:01:47.240> Aries<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:51.479> we

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
right here and forest noise Aries so we

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.010 
right here and forest noise Aries so we
check<00:01:51.930> these<00:01:52.110> files<00:01:52.470> not<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.070> ones<00:01:53.340> with<00:01:53.610> this

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
check these files not the ones with this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.080 
check these files not the ones with this
STD<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.100> check<00:01:56.640> s<00:01:56.970> CR<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.789> we<00:01:59.789> click

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
STD you have to check s CR and we click

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.679 
STD you have to check s CR and we click
extract<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:02.929> here<00:02:03.929> we<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.530> look<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.729> go

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
extract and here we have to look for go

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:16.580 
extract and here we have to look for go
through<00:02:06.960> see<00:02:08.119> users<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:14.120> check<00:02:15.120> your<00:02:15.420> user<00:02:15.720> do

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
through see users you check your user do

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.360 
through see users you check your user do
user<00:02:16.799> you're<00:02:17.340> using<00:02:18.049> okay<00:02:19.049> it's<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.560> one<00:02:19.769> my

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
user you're using okay it's this one my

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
folder create a new folder name just one

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.970 
folder create a new folder name just one
scripts<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.970> extract<00:02:48.570> them<00:02:48.810> just<00:02:49.650> wipe

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980
