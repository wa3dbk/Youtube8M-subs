he's still gonna do his thing and that's
why<00:05:50.960> I<00:05:50.990> believe<00:05:51.409> that<00:05:51.439> the<00:05:52.039> Cavs<00:05:52.340> are<00:05:52.669> gonna

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:52.879 
why I believe that the Cavs are gonna

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.629 
why I believe that the Cavs are gonna
win<00:05:53.150> and<00:05:53.419> plus<00:05:54.139> the<00:05:54.349> hat<00:05:54.530> they<00:05:54.830> have<00:05:55.039> an<00:05:55.219> elite

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
win and plus the hat they have an elite

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.339 
win and plus the hat they have an elite
point<00:05:56.569> guard<00:05:56.930> in<00:05:57.199> Kyrie<00:05:57.710> Irving<00:05:58.340> now<00:05:59.150> hawks<00:05:59.719> vs

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
point guard in Kyrie Irving now hawks vs

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.740 
point guard in Kyrie Irving now hawks vs
warriors<00:06:01.449> whoops<00:06:02.449> hawks<00:06:03.080> vs<00:06:03.590> wizards<00:06:03.830> my<00:06:04.340> bad

warriors whoops hawks vs wizards my bad
so<00:06:05.750> I<00:06:06.110> believe<00:06:06.650> that<00:06:06.680> this<00:06:07.310> serious<00:06:08.060> is<00:06:08.210> gonna

so I believe that this serious is gonna

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.860 
so I believe that this serious is gonna
go<00:06:08.569> forth<00:06:08.990> to<00:06:09.169> three<00:06:09.469> as<00:06:09.590> well<00:06:10.569> because<00:06:11.569> you

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
go forth to three as well because you

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.629 
go forth to three as well because you
know<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.169> Hawks<00:06:12.439> they're<00:06:13.189> the<00:06:13.340> number<00:06:13.610> one

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
know the Hawks they're the number one

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.450 
know the Hawks they're the number one
seed<00:06:14.000> in<00:06:14.060> the<00:06:14.360> East<00:06:14.659> End<00:06:14.990> ever<00:06:15.860> since<00:06:16.219> the

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
for them and it's good for them that

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.209 
for them and it's good for them that

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:39.640 
advantage without john wall because Paul
Pierce<00:06:35.240> is<00:06:37.120> just<00:06:38.120> clutch<00:06:38.479> man<00:06:38.779> he's<00:06:39.050> the<00:06:39.259> truth

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
Pierce is just clutch man he's the truth

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.209 
Pierce is just clutch man he's the truth
and<00:06:40.210> he<00:06:41.210> hit<00:06:41.360> that<00:06:41.509> game-winner<00:06:42.379> against<00:06:42.949> the

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.219 
and he hit that game-winner against the

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:46.869 
and he hit that game-winner against the
the<00:06:43.430> hog<00:06:43.639> the<00:06:43.849> other<00:06:44.029> day<00:06:44.330> and<00:06:45.250> yeah<00:06:46.250> so<00:06:46.550> this

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:46.879 
the hog the other day and yeah so this

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:49.779 
the hog the other day and yeah so this
man<00:06:47.150> Paul<00:06:47.659> Pierce<00:06:48.020> a<00:06:48.229> veteran<00:06:48.710> he<00:06:49.310> can<00:06:49.490> teach

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
man Paul Pierce a veteran he can teach

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:53.550 
man Paul Pierce a veteran he can teach
the<00:06:50.569> younger<00:06:51.229> Wizards<00:06:51.830> how<00:06:52.159> to<00:06:52.219> you<00:06:53.000> know

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
the younger Wizards how to you know

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.749 
the younger Wizards how to you know
playoff<00:06:54.560> situations<00:06:55.250> and<00:06:55.370> stuff<00:06:55.550> like<00:06:55.699> that

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 
playoff situations and stuff like that

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:58.540 
playoff situations and stuff like that
so<00:06:56.120> I<00:06:56.569> do<00:06:56.719> believe<00:06:57.229> that<00:06:57.500> the<00:06:58.159> Wizards<00:06:58.460> are

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
so I do believe that the Wizards are

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.570 
so I do believe that the Wizards are
going<00:06:58.729> to<00:06:58.789> win<00:06:58.879> 4<00:06:59.210> to<00:06:59.240> 3<00:06:59.360> and<00:06:59.810> the<00:07:00.680> final<00:07:01.159> series

going to win 4 to 3 and the final series

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.790 
going to win 4 to 3 and the final series
