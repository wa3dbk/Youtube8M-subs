00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
would be the case that you know we have

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.120 
would be the case that you know we have
the<00:02:22.660> team<00:02:22.870> needed<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.350> spark<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.920> weren't

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130

getting<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.550> done<00:02:24.700> there<00:02:25.000> would<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.960> move

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
getting it done there would be a move

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.750 
getting it done there would be a move
back<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.530> coach<00:02:26.710> uh<00:02:26.890> yeah<00:02:27.280> definitely<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.730> think

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
back to coach uh yeah definitely I think

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.660 
back to coach uh yeah definitely I think
the<00:02:28.240> thing<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.630> whole<00:02:28.690> thing<00:02:28.960> was<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.860> what

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
the thing the whole thing was is what

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.280 
the thing the whole thing was is what
evers<00:02:30.850> no<00:02:31.210> hot<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.570> moment<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:31.990> think<00:02:32.170> that's

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
evers no hot the moment I think that's

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.170 
evers no hot the moment I think that's
the<00:02:32.380> biggest<00:02:32.530> deal<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.040> whoever's<00:02:33.760> got<00:02:34.150> the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
the biggest deal so whoever's got the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.730 
the biggest deal so whoever's got the
hot<00:02:34.390> hand<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.900> whoever<00:02:35.230> gives<00:02:35.350> her<00:02:35.560> best

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
hot hand and whoever gives her best

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
hot hand and whoever gives her best
chance<00:02:35.800> someone<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.220> think<00:02:36.280> that's<00:02:36.550> who<00:02:36.640> we
