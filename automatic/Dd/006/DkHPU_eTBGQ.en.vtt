 Hello everybody today, another 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.740
 issue for cyclists 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.800
 and today we look at such 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.050
 caps that are screwed on 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.939
 nipple and camera 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.380
 caps glowing and at night 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.780
 when will you go 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.079
 the wheels you will be so pretty 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.710
 interesting to shine when the wheels 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.130
 rotate creates a vibration and cap 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.530
 this one starts flashing then these 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.120
 Here are the light bulbs, respectively, when driving 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.700
 you see for pretty interesting 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.230
 let's take a closer look 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:01.910
 there are 5 LED caps made 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.970
 plastic cost of two caps 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.720
 about 2 dollars a reference will be in 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.720
 video description 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.590
 the cap itself is made of plastic 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.430
 completely this plastic is transparent it 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.430
 also plastic 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.049
 Also included are such ones 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.049
 adapters for thin nipples 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.550
 such a gasket is installed inside 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.380
 out of paper owl batteries do not sit down 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.750
 while the goods are in transit then the batteries 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.300
 set down like this 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:53.310
 plus sign it is set down then 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:57.620
 you twist here see fire 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.450
 LEDs 5 LEDs of different colors and 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.670
 this LED itself lights up 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.060
 only from vibration that's when 1 for the chest 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.730
 or here it is lit see turned off 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.250
 Now you need to make it light to 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.250
 there was some kind of movement or vibration 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.480
 But when vibrations are included, different 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.850
 modes of operation 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.430
 when the bike will just stand on 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.900
 the spot light bulbs will not work only 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.790
 when you go they will 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.720
 shine 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.510
 this is how it looks in the dark 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.150
 LEDs glow brightly enough 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.210
 even if you flip the other side 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.210
 microcircuit through it all the same these 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.220
 the LEDs shine so if
