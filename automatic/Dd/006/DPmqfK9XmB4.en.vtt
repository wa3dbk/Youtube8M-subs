using the strategy before because I

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.640 
using the strategy before because I
think<00:00:08.309> it's<00:00:08.610> really<00:00:09.030> cheap<00:00:09.450> but<00:00:10.139> with<00:00:10.380> all<00:00:10.530> the

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
think it's really cheap but with all the

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.959 
think it's really cheap but with all the
other<00:00:10.769> stuff<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.099> figured<00:00:11.370> hey<00:00:11.490> what<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.730> heck

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969

alright<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> first<00:00:12.870> thing<00:00:13.110> as<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.410> can

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
alright so the first thing as you can

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.350 
alright so the first thing as you can
see<00:00:13.740> my<00:00:14.009> pal<00:00:14.219> Ken<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:14.849> about<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.210> run<00:00:15.330> out

see my pal Ken is just about to run out
so<00:00:15.660> I'm<00:00:16.199> gonna<00:00:16.350> do<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.920> rise<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.730> action<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.660> I

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
so I'm gonna do a rise to action so I

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.509 
so I'm gonna do a rise to action so I
can<00:00:18.900> stay<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.199> it

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.140 

raisa<00:00:23.519> action<00:00:23.939> takes<00:00:24.119> about<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.660> key<00:00:24.900> bar<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
raisa action takes about one key bar and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.279 
raisa action takes about one key bar and
basically<00:00:27.150> restores<00:00:27.539> like<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> bar<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> half

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
now a few drawbacks to this when you're

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.420 
now a few drawbacks to this when you're
an<00:00:53.940> Kyle<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.600> take<00:00:54.809> 20%<00:00:55.170> more<00:00:55.620> damage<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
an Kyle can you take 20% more damage of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.580 
an Kyle can you take 20% more damage of
course<00:00:56.550> your<00:00:56.910> 20%<00:00:57.360> more<00:00:57.809> attack<00:00:58.020> output<00:00:58.469> as

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
course your 20% more attack output as

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.819 
course your 20% more attack output as
well<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.719> damage<00:01:01.170> differential

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
well but that that damage differential

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.319 
well but that that damage differential
is<00:01:02.039> something<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> want<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.699> keep<00:01:02.820> track<00:01:03.120> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
is something you want to keep track of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.050 
is something you want to keep track of
so<00:01:03.989> angry<00:01:04.979> shout<00:01:05.189> becomes<00:01:05.519> your<00:01:05.670> best<00:01:05.790> friend

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060

there<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.210> no<00:01:09.540> other<00:01:09.750> move<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.680> I've

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
there really is no other move that I've

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.890 
there really is no other move that I've
seen<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.280> far<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:12.119> help<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.689> restore

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
seen so far that can help you restore

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.710 
seen so far that can help you restore
key<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.590> way<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.770> can't<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:15.119> same<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:15.509> rise

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
key the way it can't the same with rise

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.840 
key the way it can't the same with rise
to<00:01:15.900> action<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.799> something<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> also<00:01:17.549> want<00:01:17.820> to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
to action so something you also want to

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.300 
to action so something you also want to
keep<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.150> mind<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.770> one<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.860> your<00:01:20.009> attacks

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
keep in mind is that one of your attacks

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.260 
keep in mind is that one of your attacks
is<00:01:20.670> well<00:01:21.390> two<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.750> your<00:01:21.869> attacks<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.380> are

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
is well two of your attacks really are

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.310 
is well two of your attacks really are
just<00:01:24.270> boosters<00:01:26.270> now<00:01:27.270> normally<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.689> use<00:01:28.020> might

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
just boosters now normally I use might

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.730 
just boosters now normally I use might
as<00:01:28.439> well<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:30.180> there's<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.020> V<00:01:31.200> soul<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.710> believe

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
as well but there's the V soul I believe

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.640 
as well but there's the V soul I believe
it's<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> G<00:01:32.400> dozy<00:01:32.820> soul<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.409> can't<00:01:34.409> remember

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
it's the G dozy soul I can't remember

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.050 
it's the G dozy soul I can't remember
the<00:01:34.770> name<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.130> off<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> top<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> my<00:01:35.850> head

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the name of it off the top of my head

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.569 
the name of it off the top of my head
but<00:01:36.840> basically<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.770> boosts<00:01:38.130> all<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.460> your

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
but basically it boosts all of your

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.359 
but basically it boosts all of your
stats<00:01:38.790> even<00:01:39.210> further<00:01:39.770> once<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.920> use<00:01:41.159> a

stats even further once you use a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.560 
stats even further once you use a
reinforcement<00:01:42.119> skill
