00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
see me loading up Marwin and i started

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.750 
see me loading up Marwin and i started
and<00:00:39.020> basically<00:00:40.020> about<00:00:40.559> 30<00:00:41.190> seconds<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and basically about 30 seconds to a

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.270 
and basically about 30 seconds to a
minute<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.690> happened<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.469> screen

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
minute in this happened the screen

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.130 
minute in this happened the screen
freezes<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> mouse<00:00:45.239> stops<00:00:45.600> moving

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
freezes and the mouse stops moving

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.979 
freezes and the mouse stops moving
usually<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> audio<00:00:47.579> freezes<00:00:48.000> as<00:00:48.149> well<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
usually the audio freezes as well and it

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.010 
usually the audio freezes as well and it
does<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.489> kind<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.640> noise<00:00:50.879> where<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.690> audio

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
does that kind of noise where the audio

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.080 
does that kind of noise where the audio
just<00:00:52.199> hangs<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:53.940> my

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
just hangs and as you can see then my

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.850 
just hangs and as you can see then my
computer<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.510> shuts<00:00:54.899> down<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.440> sometimes

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
computer just shuts down and sometimes

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.580 
computer just shuts down and sometimes
it<00:00:55.980> fails<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.370> boot<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:56.789> from<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.329> state<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.559> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
it fails to boot up from this state so I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.130 
it fails to boot up from this state so I
have<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> hard<00:00:59.039> reset<00:00:59.690> yes<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.930> kind<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
have to hard reset yes and that kind of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.319 
have to hard reset yes and that kind of
happens<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.590> other<00:01:01.770> games<00:01:02.100> as<00:01:02.309> well<00:01:02.609> not<00:01:03.059> so

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
happens for other games as well not so

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.630 
happens for other games as well not so
much<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.719> lower<00:01:04.470> intensity<00:01:04.949> games<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.549> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
much on lower intensity games but it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.890 
much on lower intensity games but it
still<00:01:05.880> happens<00:01:06.210> when<00:01:06.330> i'm<00:01:06.420> playing<00:01:06.540> Caesar

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
