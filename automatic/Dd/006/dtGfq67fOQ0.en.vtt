00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
if it's you know well enough to fit in

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.690 
if it's you know well enough to fit in
your<00:00:41.730> PC<00:00:42.270> you're<00:00:42.480> gonna<00:00:42.570> need<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> gaming<00:00:43.230> PC

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
your PC you're gonna need a gaming PC

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.250 
your PC you're gonna need a gaming PC
that's<00:00:44.700> what<00:00:44.879> i<00:00:45.000> recommend<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.930> fit<00:00:45.960> in

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
that's what i recommend so it can fit in

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.560 
that's what i recommend so it can fit in
your<00:00:46.289> case<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:47.280> also<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.969> power<00:00:48.239> cords

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
your case because also the power cords

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.350 
your case because also the power cords
are<00:00:48.660> located<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> top<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.860> card<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
are located on the top of the card and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.369 
are located on the top of the card and
what<00:00:51.360> that's<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> do<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.079> when<00:00:52.260> you're

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
what that's going to do is when you're

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.040 
what that's going to do is when you're
closing<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:52.800> case<00:00:53.570> it's<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> make<00:00:54.899> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
closing your case it's going to make it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.660 
closing your case it's going to make it
really<00:00:55.230> hard<00:00:55.260> unless<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> big<00:00:56.250> case

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
really hard unless you have a big case

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.389 
really hard unless you have a big case
that<00:00:56.879> could<00:00:56.969> hold<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.840> top<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.260> well<00:00:58.859> now

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that could hold on the top as well now

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.279 
that could hold on the top as well now
overall<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.090> graphics<00:01:00.780> card<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.079> pretty

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
overall this graphics card is pretty

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.460 
overall this graphics card is pretty
beast<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.719> it's<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:03.989> pretty<00:01:04.260> good

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
beast it's so on it's it's pretty good

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.490 
beast it's so on it's it's pretty good
but<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> need<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.110> put

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
but I really think that I need to put
out<00:01:07.650> more<00:01:07.890> bang<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> buck<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.820> I'm<00:01:08.880> going

arm this is stock gameplay at an

arm this is stock gameplay at an
overclock<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.240> much<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> overclocked<00:01:43.829> it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
overclock this much but I overclocked it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.330 
overclock this much but I overclocked it
and<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.420> say<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:45.979> pretty<00:01:46.979> good<00:01:47.280> i

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and I have to say it was pretty good i

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.660 
and I have to say it was pretty good i
mean<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.000> UM<00:01:48.680> gameplay<00:01:49.680> was<00:01:49.860> buttery<00:01:50.220> smooth

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
mean the UM gameplay was buttery smooth

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.870 
mean the UM gameplay was buttery smooth
everything<00:01:51.180> was<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:52.610> fluid<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
everything was you know fluid and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.389 
everything was you know fluid and
everything<00:01:54.720> felt<00:01:55.020> great<00:01:55.110> from<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:56.159> know<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
everything felt great from you know the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.370 
everything felt great from you know the
animations<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.540> guns<00:01:57.750> they<00:01:57.930> feel<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> lot

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
animations and the guns they feel a lot

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.840 
animations and the guns they feel a lot
better<00:01:58.560> when<00:01:58.860> you're<00:01:59.040> using<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.399> graphics<00:01:59.820> card

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
better when you're using a graphics card

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.819 
better when you're using a graphics card
I<00:02:00.119> could<00:02:00.270> handle<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.810> game<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.770> this

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
I could handle a game like this

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.859 
I could handle a game like this
especially<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.579> better<00:02:02.820> field<00:02:03.090> three<00:02:03.299> now

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
especially that better field three now

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.240 
especially that better field three now
the<00:02:03.930> thing<00:02:04.350> I've<00:02:04.500> been<00:02:04.649> thinking<00:02:04.920> about<00:02:05.009> is

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the thing I've been thinking about is

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.760 
the thing I've been thinking about is
running<00:02:05.670> SL<00:02:06.149> eyes<00:02:06.360> now<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:07.110> order<00:02:07.439> another

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
running SL eyes now I can order another

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.010 
running SL eyes now I can order another
one<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.310> SL<00:02:08.700> eyes<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.569> I'm<00:02:09.750> going<00:02:09.929> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
one and get SL eyes but I'm going to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.470 
one and get SL eyes but I'm going to
have<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.349> step<00:02:10.770> up<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:11.190> my<00:02:11.370> power<00:02:11.730> supply<00:02:11.940> cuz<00:02:12.360> I

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
have to step up in my power supply cuz I

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.040 
have to step up in my power supply cuz I
know

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
know

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.320 
know
it's<00:02:13.320> going<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.500> take<00:02:13.590> another<00:02:14.210> probably<00:02:15.210> a

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
it's going to take another probably a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.450 
it's going to take another probably a
thousand<00:02:15.750> should<00:02:16.290> be<00:02:16.800> enough<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.130> actually

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
thousand should be enough to actually

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.340 
thousand should be enough to actually
handle<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.630> 26<00:02:19.530> 70s<00:02:19.920> sli<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:21.110> i'll<00:02:22.110> probably

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
handle the 26 70s sli and i'll probably

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.450 
handle the 26 70s sli and i'll probably
have<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.560> get<00:02:22.710> them<00:02:22.830> different<00:02:23.190> motherboard

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
have to get them different motherboard

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.160 
have to get them different motherboard
as<00:02:23.760> well<00:02:23.940> because<00:02:24.240> my<00:02:24.270> motherboard<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.990> don't

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
as well because my motherboard I don't

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.830 
as well because my motherboard I don't
believe<00:02:25.380> it's<00:02:25.650> SLI<00:02:26.250> compatible<00:02:26.820> because<00:02:27.660> I

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
believe it's SLI compatible because I

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.750 
believe it's SLI compatible because I
did<00:02:28.020> try<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.230> run<00:02:28.530> five<00:02:28.740> 60s<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.490> stuff<00:02:29.670> like

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
did try to run five 60s and stuff like

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.400 
did try to run five 60s and stuff like
that<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.300> really<00:02:30.510> didn't<00:02:30.810> run<00:02:31.020> them<00:02:31.200> too

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
that and it really didn't run them too

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.700 
that and it really didn't run them too
well<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.880> did<00:02:33.120> okay<00:02:33.690> didn't<00:02:34.050> run<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.590> know<00:02:34.680> I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
well it did okay didn't run you know I

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.090 
well it did okay didn't run you know I
was<00:02:34.920> running<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.460> 560<00:02:36.090> sweet<00:02:36.990> tea<00:02:37.560> eyes<00:02:37.770> and

sucked be here so you guys can see stock
it<00:02:48.330> was<00:02:48.420> running<00:02:48.660> battlefield<00:02:49.140> 3<00:02:49.320> on<00:02:49.410> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
it was running battlefield 3 on the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.520 
it was running battlefield 3 on the
ultra<00:02:49.830> settings<00:02:50.070> epel<00:02:50.940> V<00:02:51.090> was<00:02:51.330> 90<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.050> I'm

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
ultra settings epel V was 90 and I'm

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.990 
ultra settings epel V was 90 and I'm
getting<00:02:52.710> around<00:02:53.100> average<00:02:53.720> FPS<00:02:54.720> stock<00:02:55.620> was<00:02:56.000> 46

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
getting around average FPS stock was 46

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.540 
getting around average FPS stock was 46
and<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.020> use<00:02:58.200> fraps<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.040> actually<00:02:59.370> give<00:02:59.520> me

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
and I use fraps to actually give me

and I use fraps to actually give me
that's<00:02:59.970> average<00:03:00.510> benchmark<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.490> I<00:03:02.930> agree<00:03:03.930> it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
that's average benchmark and I agree it

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.520 
that's average benchmark and I agree it
felt<00:03:04.380> like<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.740> average<00:03:04.920> FPS<00:03:05.520> on<00:03:05.760> ultra<00:03:06.530> was

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
felt like the average FPS on ultra was

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.290 
felt like the average FPS on ultra was
around<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.010> much<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.550> playing<00:03:08.910> i<00:03:09.090> played

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
around that much and playing i played

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.540 
around that much and playing i played
through<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.630> couple<00:03:09.900> maps<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.500> see<00:03:10.740> how<00:03:11.100> well<00:03:11.340> it

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
through a couple maps to see how well it

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.250 
through a couple maps to see how well it
did<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.760> how<00:03:11.970> efficient<00:03:12.480> when<00:03:12.960> you're<00:03:13.080> flying

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
did and how efficient when you're flying

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.050 
did and how efficient when you're flying
jets<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.830> stuff<00:03:13.980> like<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.130> it's<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.610> lot<00:03:14.850> you

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
jets and stuff like that it's a lot you

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.810 
jets and stuff like that it's a lot you
get<00:03:15.240> a<00:03:15.270> beast<00:03:15.780> amount<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.470> FPS<00:03:17.130> over<00:03:17.430> 100

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
get a beast amount of FPS over 100

even if it will run battlefield 3 at a
hundred<00:04:10.709> plus<00:04:10.950> frames<00:04:11.280> because<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:12.510> think

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
hundred plus frames because I think

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.380 
hundred plus frames because I think
that's<00:04:13.470> overkill<00:04:13.739> but<00:04:14.670> anyways<00:04:15.060> if<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.269> guys

battlefield all over 100 frames you know

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.420 
battlefield all over 100 frames you know
that's<00:04:18.660> all<00:04:18.810> good<00:04:19.109> but<00:04:19.320> I'm<00:04:20.040> definitely<00:04:20.160> not

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
that's all good but I'm definitely not

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.099 
that's all good but I'm definitely not
paying<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:20.790> thousand<00:04:21.090> dollars<00:04:21.299> for<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.600> but

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
paying a thousand dollars for it but

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.100 
paying a thousand dollars for it but
yeah<00:04:22.580> not<00:04:23.580> like<00:04:24.000> I'm<00:04:24.180> dissing<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.810> card<00:04:25.020> or

anything<00:04:25.260> it's<00:04:25.500> just<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.770> price<00:04:25.979> was

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
anything it's just the price was

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.969 
anything it's just the price was
hefty<00:04:26.729> price<00:04:26.940> tag<00:04:27.259> but<00:04:28.259> I<00:04:28.500> bet<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:28.949> a

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
hefty price tag but I bet it is a

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.070 
hefty price tag but I bet it is a
beastie<00:04:29.490> card<00:04:29.699> if<00:04:29.880> I<00:04:30.000> was<00:04:30.120> ever<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.449> get<00:04:30.990> my

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
beastie card if I was ever to get my

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.279 
beastie card if I was ever to get my
hands<00:04:31.289> on<00:04:31.440> it<00:04:31.500> for<00:04:31.770> free<00:04:31.949> I<00:04:32.990> probably<00:04:33.990> would

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
hands on it for free I probably would

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.990 
hands on it for free I probably would
play<00:04:34.440> battlefield<00:04:34.889> 3<00:04:35.070> non-stop<00:04:35.520> but<00:04:35.669> anyway

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
play battlefield 3 non-stop but anyway

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.850 
play battlefield 3 non-stop but anyway
so<00:04:36.060> let's<00:04:36.360> talk<00:04:36.539> some<00:04:36.750> more<00:04:36.870> about<00:04:36.930> this<00:04:37.199> 670

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
so let's talk some more about this 670

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.520 
so let's talk some more about this 670
how<00:04:38.430> it<00:04:38.639> does<00:04:38.820> overall<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.539> heavy<00:04:39.840> heavy<00:04:40.169> maps

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
how it does overall and heavy heavy maps

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.939 
how it does overall and heavy heavy maps
this<00:04:40.949> was<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.310> 48<00:04:41.759> man<00:04:42.360> server<00:04:42.630> in<00:04:42.900> 64<00:04:43.770> million

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
this was a 48 man server in 64 million

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.969 
this was a 48 man server in 64 million
server<00:04:44.220> is<00:04:44.490> still<00:04:45.150> um<00:04:45.449> can<00:04:46.139> hold<00:04:46.350> out<00:04:46.560> around

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
server is still um can hold out around

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.060 
server is still um can hold out around
40<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.759> 50<00:04:48.210> frames<00:04:48.419> on<00:04:48.720> stock<00:04:49.169> now<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.710> did

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
40 to 50 frames on stock now I did

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.870 
40 to 50 frames on stock now I did
actually<00:04:50.280> overclock<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.449> 1085<00:04:52.880> 1085

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
actually overclock it to 1085 1085

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.779 
actually overclock it to 1085 1085
megahertz<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:55.350> was<00:04:55.530> beast<00:04:56.070> I<00:04:56.340> was<00:04:56.490> getting

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
megahertz and it was beast I was getting

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.219 
megahertz and it was beast I was getting
around<00:04:57.650> 70-80<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:59.270> think<00:05:00.270> my<00:05:00.389> max<00:05:00.660> was<00:05:00.930> about

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
around 70-80 I think my max was about

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.939 
around 70-80 I think my max was about
110<00:05:02.099> on<00:05:02.449> frames<00:05:03.449> per<00:05:03.660> second<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.139> my<00:05:04.560> minimum

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.839 
benchmark on the arm over clock settings
but<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.740> overclock<00:05:14.130> settings<00:05:14.490> I've<00:05:14.699> been

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
but the overclock settings I've been

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.060 
but the overclock settings I've been
playing<00:05:15.090> having<00:05:15.599> too<00:05:15.750> much<00:05:15.900> fun<00:05:15.960> so<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:16.800> haven't

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
playing having too much fun so I haven't

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.650 
playing having too much fun so I haven't
really<00:05:17.310> got<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.669> time<00:05:17.880> to<00:05:17.910> benchmark<00:05:18.509> it

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
really got the time to benchmark it

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.600 
really got the time to benchmark it
because<00:05:18.930> it<00:05:19.080> feels<00:05:19.259> really<00:05:19.530> great<00:05:19.800> when<00:05:20.460> I'm

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
because it feels really great when I'm

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.939 
because it feels really great when I'm
playing<00:05:20.789> this<00:05:21.150> game<00:05:21.389> and<00:05:21.720> not<00:05:22.169> recording<00:05:22.740> but

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
playing this game and not recording but

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.740 
playing this game and not recording but
when<00:05:23.039> i'm<00:05:23.160> recording<00:05:23.310> i'm<00:05:24.060> taking<00:05:24.449> about<00:05:24.690> a

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
when i'm recording i'm taking about a

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.290 
when i'm recording i'm taking about a
fifteen<00:05:25.169> percent<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:26.009> twenty<00:05:26.310> percent<00:05:26.669> hit<00:05:27.060> on

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
fifteen percent to twenty percent hit on

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.379 
fifteen percent to twenty percent hit on
frames<00:05:27.660> and<00:05:27.960> um<00:05:28.860> you<00:05:29.340> know<00:05:29.370> it<00:05:29.699> doesn't<00:05:30.330> feel

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
frames and um you know it doesn't feel

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.830 
frames and um you know it doesn't feel
good<00:05:30.900> but<00:05:31.800> maybe<00:05:32.340> running<00:05:32.699> it<00:05:32.880> SLI<00:05:33.389> and<00:05:33.419> you

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
good but maybe running it SLI and you

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.180 
good but maybe running it SLI and you
know<00:05:33.930> beating<00:05:34.260> up<00:05:34.380> my<00:05:34.470> computer<00:05:34.620> a<00:05:34.860> little<00:05:35.070> bit

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
know beating up my computer a little bit

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.750 
know beating up my computer a little bit
i'll<00:05:35.699> be<00:05:35.880> able<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.180> get<00:05:36.330> some<00:05:36.510> better<00:05:36.720> actual

some more gameplay but i actually loved

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.540 
some more gameplay but i actually loved
using<00:05:41.909> this<00:05:42.240> card<00:05:42.800> overall<00:05:43.800> i'll<00:05:44.010> give<00:05:44.280> it<00:05:44.310> a

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
using this card overall i'll give it a

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.390 
using this card overall i'll give it a
solid<00:05:45.169> five<00:05:46.169> out<00:05:46.349> of<00:05:46.380> five<00:05:46.590> for<00:05:46.860> graphics<00:05:47.220> card

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
solid five out of five for graphics card

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.980 
solid five out of five for graphics card
for<00:05:47.610> especially<00:05:47.970> around<00:05:48.210> its<00:05:48.479> price<00:05:48.690> range

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
for especially around its price range

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.379 
for especially around its price range
for<00:05:49.169> 400<00:05:49.680> I<00:05:49.830> mean<00:05:50.010> I'm<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.880> only<00:05:50.970> graphics

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
for 400 I mean I'm the only graphics

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.830 
for 400 I mean I'm the only graphics
card<00:05:51.570> around<00:05:51.750> this<00:05:51.930> price<00:05:52.080> range<00:05:52.139> is<00:05:52.470> probably

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
card around this price range is probably

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.399 
card around this price range is probably
7850<00:05:54.949> if<00:05:55.949> i'm<00:05:56.130> not<00:05:56.280> mistaken<00:05:56.960> but<00:05:57.960> i'd<00:05:58.199> highly

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
7850 if i'm not mistaken but i'd highly

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.200 
7850 if i'm not mistaken but i'd highly
recommend<00:05:58.530> this<00:05:59.039> it<00:05:59.220> stays<00:05:59.430> pretty<00:05:59.759> cool<00:06:00.030> as

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
recommend this it stays pretty cool as

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.089 
recommend this it stays pretty cool as
well<00:06:00.240> i<00:06:00.419> mean<00:06:00.720> i<00:06:00.780> got<00:06:00.990> a<00:06:01.050> decent<00:06:01.380> case<00:06:01.710> i<00:06:01.919> got

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
well i mean i got a decent case i got

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.700 
well i mean i got a decent case i got
what<00:06:02.310> two<00:06:02.580> or<00:06:02.820> three<00:06:03.449> fans<00:06:03.690> i<00:06:03.870> got<00:06:04.139> two<00:06:04.470> things

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
what two or three fans i got two things

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.930 
what two or three fans i got two things
actually<00:06:04.860> in<00:06:05.130> there<00:06:05.280> right<00:06:05.430> now<00:06:05.580> because<00:06:05.820> the

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
actually in there right now because the

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.610 
actually in there right now because the
other<00:06:06.030> fan<00:06:06.300> was<00:06:06.599> actually<00:06:06.990> not<00:06:07.169> doing<00:06:07.440> much<00:06:07.560> of

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
other fan was actually not doing much of

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.120 
other fan was actually not doing much of
anything<00:06:07.830> so<00:06:08.430> i<00:06:08.610> just<00:06:09.180> took<00:06:09.240> that<00:06:09.419> out<00:06:09.479> um<00:06:10.130> but

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
anything so i just took that out um but

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.920 
anything so i just took that out um but
yeah<00:06:11.639> it<00:06:11.849> stayed<00:06:12.120> pretty<00:06:12.180> cool<00:06:12.599> as<00:06:12.720> well<00:06:12.750> i

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
yeah it stayed pretty cool as well i

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.969 
yeah it stayed pretty cool as well i
think<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.349> maximum<00:06:14.750> heat<00:06:15.949> or<00:06:16.949> the

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
think the maximum heat or the

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.249 
think the maximum heat or the
temperature<00:06:17.789> that<00:06:17.940> it<00:06:18.060> did<00:06:18.270> increase<00:06:18.840> to<00:06:19.080> was

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
temperature that it did increase to was

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.350 
temperature that it did increase to was
79<00:06:19.620> and<00:06:20.039> that's<00:06:20.580> because<00:06:20.699> i<00:06:20.849> was<00:06:20.970> running<00:06:21.120> it

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
79 and that's because i was running it

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.629 
79 and that's because i was running it
all<00:06:21.570> day<00:06:21.840> and<00:06:22.110> it's<00:06:22.349> pretty<00:06:22.620> hot<00:06:22.949> out<00:06:23.159> here<00:06:23.220> but

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
all day and it's pretty hot out here but

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.700 
all day and it's pretty hot out here but
when<00:06:23.789> i<00:06:23.820> have<00:06:23.940> my<00:06:24.030> AC<00:06:24.240> turned<00:06:24.659> on<00:06:24.870> it<00:06:25.440> stays

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
when i have my AC turned on it stays

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.360 
when i have my AC turned on it stays
around<00:06:25.979> 53<00:06:26.610> which<00:06:27.180> is<00:06:27.330> not<00:06:27.479> bad<00:06:27.509> um<00:06:28.050> and<00:06:28.949> I<00:06:29.159> wish

but the stats that you're seeing are the
FPS<00:06:37.710> and<00:06:38.010> then

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
FPS and then

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.700 
FPS and then
the<00:06:38.780> runtime<00:06:39.780> of<00:06:39.810> the<00:06:40.110> video<00:06:40.409> and<00:06:40.740> then<00:06:41.520> the

the runtime of the video and then the
amount<00:06:43.710> of<00:06:43.800> space<00:06:44.159> that<00:06:44.219> is<00:06:44.520> taken<00:06:44.849> actually

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
amount of space that is taken actually

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.839 
amount of space that is taken actually
when<00:06:46.229> i'm<00:06:46.349> recording<00:06:46.469> so<00:06:47.280> don't<00:06:47.759> pay

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849 
when i'm recording so don't pay

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:49.100 
when i'm recording so don't pay
attention<00:06:47.969> to<00:06:48.240> anything<00:06:48.479> on<00:06:48.659> the<00:06:48.719> bottom<00:06:48.960> just

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
attention to anything on the bottom just

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.200 
attention to anything on the bottom just
the<00:06:49.289> top<00:06:49.500> left<00:06:49.770> numbers<00:06:50.490> that<00:06:50.639> keep<00:06:50.819> moving

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
the top left numbers that keep moving

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.920 
the top left numbers that keep moving
are<00:06:51.449> the<00:06:51.599> FPS<00:06:52.139> which<00:06:52.439> is<00:06:52.620> pretty<00:06:53.009> decent<00:06:53.310> and

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
are the FPS which is pretty decent and

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.140 
are the FPS which is pretty decent and

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:13.429 
you'll get you know really good frames
but<00:07:12.270> I'm<00:07:12.389> really<00:07:12.509> considering<00:07:12.900> running<00:07:13.169> this

00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:13.439 
but I'm really considering running this

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:15.830 
but I'm really considering running this
SLI<00:07:14.069> so<00:07:14.610> I<00:07:14.639> could<00:07:14.819> get<00:07:14.939> the<00:07:14.969> most<00:07:15.240> out<00:07:15.569> of<00:07:15.629> my

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
SLI so I could get the most out of my

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.390 
SLI so I could get the most out of my
graphics<00:07:16.590> card<00:07:16.650> but<00:07:16.919> it's<00:07:17.039> going<00:07:17.159> to<00:07:17.219> be<00:07:17.279> very

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 
graphics card but it's going to be very

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.830 
graphics card but it's going to be very
expensive<00:07:17.699> because<00:07:18.060> I'll<00:07:18.240> have<00:07:18.449> to<00:07:18.569> change<00:07:18.779> my

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
expensive because I'll have to change my

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.200 
expensive because I'll have to change my
motherboard<00:07:19.379> and<00:07:19.469> stuff<00:07:19.620> like<00:07:19.710> that<00:07:20.210> anyways

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210 
motherboard and stuff like that anyways

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.480

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.490
