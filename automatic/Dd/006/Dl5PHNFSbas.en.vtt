00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
chord and it's really really simple if

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.410 
chord and it's really really simple if
you<00:00:30.970> pay<00:00:31.240> attention<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.969> don't<00:00:34.149> let<00:00:34.300> your

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
you pay attention so don't let your

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.260 
you pay attention so don't let your
attention<00:00:34.719> slip<00:00:35.320> on<00:00:35.590> you<00:00:35.910> while<00:00:36.910> we're<00:00:37.120> going

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
attention slip on you while we're going

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.200 
attention slip on you while we're going
through<00:00:37.420> this<00:00:37.929> and<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:39.219> reason<00:00:39.579> I<00:00:39.670> make<00:00:39.879> the<00:00:40.059> B

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
through this and the reason I make the B

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.139 
through this and the reason I make the B
7th<00:00:40.629> the<00:00:40.809> way<00:00:41.019> that<00:00:41.320> I<00:00:41.350> do

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
7th the way that I do

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.639 
7th the way that I do
the<00:00:43.149> fact<00:00:43.390> that<00:00:43.480> we<00:00:43.629> reason<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:44.050> make<00:00:44.230> all<00:00:44.469> the

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
the fact that we reason to make all the

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.149 
the fact that we reason to make all the
chords<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.159> way<00:00:45.309> that<00:00:45.550> I<00:00:45.579> do<00:00:45.699> is<00:00:46.089> because

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
chords the way that I do is because

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.160 
chords the way that I do is because
these<00:00:48.159> are<00:00:48.359> transitional<00:00:49.359> chords<00:00:49.929> their

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
these are transitional chords their

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.369 
these are transitional chords their
transitional<00:00:50.859> patterns<00:00:51.460> I<00:00:51.760> use<00:00:52.690> triad

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
transitional patterns I use triad

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.349 
transitional patterns I use triad
patterns<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.249> the<00:00:54.309> reason<00:00:54.579> I<00:00:54.670> do<00:00:54.730> that<00:00:54.940> is

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
patterns and the reason I do that is

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.259 
patterns and the reason I do that is
because<00:00:56.109> it<00:00:56.649> makes<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:57.039> transition<00:00:57.339> from<00:00:57.969> one

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
because it makes the transition from one

00:00:58.269 --> 00:00:59.489 
because it makes the transition from one
chord<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.929> next

00:00:59.489 --> 00:00:59.499 
chord to the next

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:04.680 
chord to the next
a<00:00:59.620> total<00:01:00.519> snap<00:01:01.379> totally<00:01:02.379> easy<00:01:02.620> I<00:01:03.360> was<00:01:04.360> shown

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
a total snap totally easy I was shown

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.860 
a total snap totally easy I was shown

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
get there from your II so it's let's get

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.179 
get there from your II so it's let's get
our<00:02:02.979> fingers<00:02:03.399> into<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.759> e<00:02:03.789> position<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:05.189> then

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
our fingers into the e position and then

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.020 
our fingers into the e position and then
I'm<00:02:06.340> going<00:02:06.549> to<00:02:06.670> move<00:02:07.030> my<00:02:07.830> first<00:02:08.830> finger<00:02:09.310> up<00:02:09.520> I

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
should say down one string but it's

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
should say down one string but it's
actually<00:02:13.569> up<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.940> fourth<00:02:16.930> string

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350

first fret of the fourth string so that

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.570 
first fret of the fourth string so that
makes<00:03:31.760> this<00:03:31.940> sound

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:48.990 

see<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.900> there's<00:03:46.110> at<00:03:46.260> seventh<00:03:46.710> sound<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.280> it

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
see so there's at seventh sound to it
