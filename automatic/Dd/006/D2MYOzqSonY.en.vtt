00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.210
 with our new horex pro style is us 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.910
 a cutting tool succeeded that 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.630
 offers you the maximum performance 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.190
 at an ultimate low price 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.460
 This tool has a 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.809
 eccentric behind cut on one 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.970
 unequal division axial as well as radial 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.100
 on top of that is a specially mechanical one 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.800
 still post-processed him as a coating 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.800
 the performance in addition 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.840
 supports the basis of this 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.300
 tool is a completely new 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.020
 developed has with wood places a 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.070
 extremely high toughness and a good core 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.770
 hardness 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.750
 As a result, they are extremely high 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.080
 idle times from this tool 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:20.000
 We can get the tools out 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.820
 in the size of 31 25 available for them in 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.430
 short in the standard length and in the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.490
 overlong variation in the standard and 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.340
 The tools have overlong variants 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.060
 all a wood free turn on what kind of 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.549
 you once again optimized the operation 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.729
 to use it yourself with our new 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.189
 rolex profile can achieve you optimal 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.450
 Results for all machining 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:50.360
 method, for example, when milling into 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:55.460
 full we have an asymmetric here 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.659
 spiral milled to max movements of the xy 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.640
 Achieve axis 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.680
 this has the consequence that the tool 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.080
 Constantly pulling and compressing stresses 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.659
 The tool remains exposed 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.910
 still very very quiet they can 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:14.209
 outline or when milling or also tpc 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.150
 eat this stanza is dual milling 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:21.230
 Even with this tool without problems 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.410
 possible if we take the test series and 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.100
 see reigned royalty proudly 45 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:32.600
 eat at the folks once the then see 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.310
 we stood up to 40 50 meters all 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.550
 three market companions still halfway 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.810
 but could keep up with every meter 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.140
 vrees away more they dropped off significantly 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.959
 We have the milled after 135 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.060
 we stopped for three 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.500
 hall ex pro game the sanding 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.860
 limit has not yet reached ours 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.239
 test 3 2 feeding in lesioned steel 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.599
 in 42 chrome 4 our rolex profile could 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.700
 a total life of 180 meters 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.069
 to reach 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.680
 the test with our market companions 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:17.850
 we had to stop because we were strong 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.370
 Outbreaks had to cut off and 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.980
 another tip from the experts they span 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.130
 their hall ex post will be at 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.860
 Milling in full from size 16 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.410
 in the forests feed them reach 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.200
 by clamping out the middle one 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.319
 support of unequal division and 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.000
 have a tremendously good run 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.190
 eat in full the new hole ex-profi 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.040
 to increase their machining 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.040
 performance now available for you
