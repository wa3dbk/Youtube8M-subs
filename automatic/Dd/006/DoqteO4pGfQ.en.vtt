on the floor behind me these are

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.810 
on the floor behind me these are
materials<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.450> snake<00:00:13.139> racks<00:00:13.490> one<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.519> would

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
materials for snake racks one I would

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.620 
materials for snake racks one I would
consider<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.360> medium<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:16.320> large<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.570> so<00:00:18.570> I'm

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
consider a medium to large and so I'm

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.269 
consider a medium to large and so I'm
going<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.080> start<00:00:19.380> putting<00:00:19.650> these<00:00:19.770> bad<00:00:20.039> boys

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279

so I think this is a v70 the size of
each<00:00:37.330> tank

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
this diagram you're going to run out of

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.930 
this diagram you're going to run out of
heat<00:03:55.900> cable<00:03:56.319> before<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.769> get<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.280> top<00:03:57.760> of

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
heat cable before you get to the top of

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.640 
heat cable before you get to the top of
your<00:03:58.090> wrap<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.470> what<00:04:00.130> I<00:04:00.160> did<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:01.410> looked<00:04:02.410> on

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
your wrap so what I did I looked on

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.110 
your wrap so what I did I looked on
YouTube<00:04:02.860> for<00:04:03.280> somebody<00:04:03.550> that<00:04:03.700> had<00:04:03.790> put<00:04:03.970> these

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
YouTube for somebody that had put these

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.000 
YouTube for somebody that had put these
racks<00:04:04.420> together<00:04:04.810> before<00:04:05.200> I<00:04:05.410> had<00:04:05.590> never<00:04:05.769> done

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
racks together before I had never done

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.120 
racks together before I had never done
this<00:04:06.160> size<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.730> basically<00:04:07.660> you<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.500> do<00:04:08.799> three

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
this size and basically you can do three

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.120 
this size and basically you can do three
large<00:04:09.370> coils<00:04:09.910> go<00:04:10.180> in<00:04:10.390> go<00:04:10.630> out<00:04:10.780> then<00:04:11.620> loop

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
large coils go in go out then loop

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.660 
large coils go in go out then loop
around<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:13.060> top<00:04:13.390> of<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:14.110> neck<00:04:14.290> strap<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:15.400> your

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
around the top of the neck strap so your

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.240 
around the top of the neck strap so your
tubs<00:04:15.940> are<00:04:16.180> never<00:04:16.390> making<00:04:16.660> contact<00:04:17.320> with<00:04:17.620> this

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
tubs are never making contact with this

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.810 
tubs are never making contact with this
heat<00:04:18.489> cable<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:20.049> I've<00:04:20.380> got<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.890> this<00:04:21.459> smaller

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
heat cable so I've got of this smaller

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.020 
heat cable so I've got of this smaller
rack<00:04:22.090> which<00:04:22.330> is<00:04:22.360> a<00:04:22.479> v35<00:04:23.200> step<00:04:24.010> one<00:04:24.250> get<00:04:24.910> the

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
rack which is a v35 step one get the
