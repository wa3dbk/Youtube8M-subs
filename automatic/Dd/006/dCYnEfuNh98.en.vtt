this is important it's important that

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.990 
this is important it's important that
you<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.900> good<00:01:28.140> flow<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.530> air<00:01:28.710> as<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.549> species

you get good flow of air as this species

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.810 
you get good flow of air as this species
requires<00:01:30.479> quite<00:01:30.960> high<00:01:31.170> level<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.439> humidity

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
around sixty to eighty percent should be

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.530 
around sixty to eighty percent should be
maintained<00:01:34.590> without<00:01:35.369> good<00:01:35.670> ventilation<00:01:35.939> you

maintained without good ventilation you

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.819 
maintained without good ventilation you
risk<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> accumulation<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.890> stagnant<00:01:38.729> air

don't<00:02:59.470> use<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> basking<00:03:00.129> light<00:03:00.159> or<00:03:00.459> when<00:03:00.549> a<00:03:00.579> UV

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
don't use a basking light or when a UV

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.030 
don't use a basking light or when a UV
lighting<00:03:01.120> however<00:03:02.049> I<00:03:02.139> know<00:03:02.379> several<00:03:02.620> keepers

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
lighting however I know several keepers

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.610 
lighting however I know several keepers
that<00:03:03.189> do<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.609> several<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.239> dump<00:03:04.480> some<00:03:05.290> argue

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
that do and several that dump some argue

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.349 
that do and several that dump some argue
that<00:03:05.650> they<00:03:06.010> get<00:03:06.189> UV<00:03:06.519> light<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:06.849> the<00:03:06.909> wild<00:03:07.209> so

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
that they get UV light in the wild so

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.479 
that they get UV light in the wild so
they<00:03:07.510> provide<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.139> their<00:03:08.590> enclosures<00:03:09.010> and

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
they provide it in their enclosures and

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.429 
they provide it in their enclosures and
as<00:03:09.609> argue<00:03:09.939> that<00:03:10.389> with<00:03:10.689> them<00:03:10.870> being<00:03:11.079> nocturnal

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:11.439 
as argue that with them being nocturnal

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.089 
as argue that with them being nocturnal
they're<00:03:12.280> not<00:03:12.459> exposed<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.939> these<00:03:13.030> UV<00:03:13.389> rays

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
they're not exposed to these UV rays

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.039 
they're not exposed to these UV rays
personally<00:03:15.099> I<00:03:15.220> don't<00:03:15.340> use<00:03:15.669> the<00:03:15.849> UV<00:03:16.180> lights<00:03:16.389> we

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
personally I don't use the UV lights we

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.080 
personally I don't use the UV lights we
had<00:03:17.199> live<00:03:17.410> plants<00:03:17.769> in<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:17.949> enclosure<00:03:18.190> as<00:03:18.489> they

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
had live plants in the enclosure as they

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.809 
had live plants in the enclosure as they
don't<00:03:19.209> tend<00:03:19.419> to<00:03:19.510> do<00:03:19.629> well<00:03:19.810> without<00:03:19.900> them<00:03:20.819> also

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
don't tend to do well without them also

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.360 
don't tend to do well without them also
heat<00:03:22.750> lamp<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.079> not<00:03:23.230> really<00:03:23.470> necessary<00:03:23.919> the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
heat lamp is not really necessary the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.909 
heat lamp is not really necessary the
enclosure<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:24.940> warm<00:03:25.120> enough<00:03:25.209> for<00:03:25.359> that<00:03:25.569> one

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
enclosure is warm enough for that one

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.140 
enclosure is warm enough for that one
however<00:03:26.919> I<00:03:26.949> have<00:03:27.069> been<00:03:27.310> told<00:03:27.459> by<00:03:27.699> experienced

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
however I have been told by experienced

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.599 
however I have been told by experienced
keepers<00:03:28.510> but<00:03:29.319> they're<00:03:29.530> lizards<00:03:29.889> they

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
keepers but they're lizards they

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.729 
keepers but they're lizards they
obviously<00:03:30.780> often<00:03:31.780> see<00:03:31.930> those<00:03:32.109> it's<00:03:32.349> basking

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
obviously often see those it's basking

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.890 
obviously often see those it's basking
under<00:03:32.859> the<00:03:33.069> heat<00:03:33.159> lamps<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:34.299> yeah<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:34.810> think

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
under the heat lamps so yeah I think

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.250 
under the heat lamps so yeah I think
personal<00:03:35.530> preference<00:03:35.799> really<00:03:36.209> but<00:03:37.230> with<00:03:38.230> a

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
personal preference really but with a

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.619 
personal preference really but with a
plastic<00:03:38.590> box<00:03:39.190> like<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.419> you<00:03:40.419> won't<00:03:40.479> be

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
plastic box like this you won't be

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.750 
plastic box like this you won't be
careful<00:03:40.989> that<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.260> doesn't<00:03:41.440> melt<00:03:42.159> or<00:03:42.370> walk<00:03:42.639> the

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129
