00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
embraced this theology so what we need

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.730 
embraced this theology so what we need
to<00:05:17.600> say<00:05:17.900> about<00:05:18.320> this<00:05:19.100> is<00:05:19.610> that<00:05:20.169> if<00:05:21.169> it's<00:05:21.500> not

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
to say about this is that if it's not

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.040 
to say about this is that if it's not
well<00:05:21.979> grounded<00:05:22.010> in<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:22.970> exegesis<00:05:23.570> of<00:05:23.930> the

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
well grounded in the exegesis of the

well grounded in the exegesis of the
Bible<00:05:24.500> it<00:05:24.650> should<00:05:25.100> not<00:05:25.250> be<00:05:25.310> embraced<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.240> in

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
Bible it should not be embraced and in

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.980 
Bible it should not be embraced and in
fact<00:05:26.810> it<00:05:27.139> isn't<00:05:27.800> there<00:05:28.070> is<00:05:28.250> no<00:05:28.450> theology<00:05:29.450> of

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
fact it isn't there is no theology of

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.990

I like to say about all this is the

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.880 
I like to say about all this is the
left-behind<00:05:34.900> theology<00:05:35.900> needs<00:05:36.140> to<00:05:36.320> be<00:05:36.500> wait
