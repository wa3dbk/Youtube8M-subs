00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.870
 first of all voted for me would like to associate with this estate damage 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.809
 unanimous that were made they found what counts 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.299
 this Thursday it's a kit in the political world to go to accomplish its 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.480
 destiny it's soon easterly indeed 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.710
 and we wanted to give him a little tribute to our way too so 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.029
 our little song 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.779
 we're going to kill my little blue rabbit 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.779
 but to win 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.619
 the danger is there 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.610
 tandja 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
 the alternation 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.200
 if the party 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.010
 teheran 25 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 thirty-nine of them is 1 2 3 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.610
 bourgeois 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.570
 the military leader nearly 182 days of psychodrama 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.820
 we finally have this government so we can stop this show 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.640
 the American builder confirmed the vote only one can wonder if 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.150
 it was well worth the wait so long for that 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.290
 failing to relieve the budget of this government 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.429
 probably relieves great on the term 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:51.470
 we know it very well 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.630
 it's a long story since the shooting is scheduled for October 10 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.740
 but you may be able to ask why we had to wait nine months to have 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.240
 this ice hockey result for the time to find the right people 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.500
 the right conditions to lead this country after the elections could not 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.630
 take anyone as his opponent 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.770
 so I'm pretty happy in everyone who promises new people the 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.360
 conditions and the very very big game match as government is getting ready 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.000
 to lean boldly 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.850
 we find all the parties of government michèle cadusseau that the 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.569
 ecologists but hey we used to 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.930
 the blades of air either but that we do not care there is the ps the mr and cdh cd &amp; v 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.470
 high it really needed 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.050
 nine months to get there 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.820
 in addition to paris you do not even have standard program on an awning for them 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.470
 This is the main point of agreement on the number of 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.250
 ministers she wanted to scream think it's not a program of 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.079
 government in five years 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.079
 we found the fatah bordeaux or snow but for the camp ouattara 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.759
 indeed actions were jostling us we are now in the company of 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.369
 didier reynders closes on m sir barely to be a very important member 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:48.290
 ap ap ap the positive application i am so happy to find all my 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.379
 comrades in the us around me all the program of the mr is found in 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.349
 the government court I think the government is watching this first of his 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.469
 establishment in the record of the very admission of you is not prime minister 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.659
 make sure you're not common sense as that ah well yeah that will not be the 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.339
 government and the first in friends we talk about the government the term 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.319
 foreground to control reassure me do not forget that the 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.779
 conclusions and if you knew but at least he government is hammering this 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.609
 number of months 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.659
 we are going to take a little tour now on the side of the Socialist Party 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.659
 the untruths do not pass like that 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.099
 because when you are going to be delighted to take current courses 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:25.729
 then after each electoral defeat we end up with three positions of 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:29.829
 ministers I'm right in addition all the ps program find themselves 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.989
 in the government agreement of your identity but when he wanted to celebrate 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.989
 it strongly encourages the next electoral defeat 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.979
 even on the side of cdh was also relieving stations and mitchell 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.059
 could evolve throughout these two days in the balance 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:47.919
 only one problem the name is to know which serious face to choose 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.889
 what I read in the press 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.669
 the fact that it's against the party president must be fought that jose 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.909
 wash true family history 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.909
 I always at the outside joint to challenge him 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:02.790
 the meeting that the government 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.739
 when the management of jean paul cézanne 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.589
 including the contrary European laurent wauquiez at 14 hours 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:11.579
 while 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.650
 we're going to do something that I think is going to have consequences 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.650
 on the roads 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:21.819
 ap 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:26.360
 at the foot of the gala air support mast excuse me for bothering you rejected to 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.689
 the advanced stop hand ap 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:31.570
 I tell you very serenely 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.610
 the ptr he will judge at least the post in this government for them the last 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.380
 panel able to turn the page that these fascists worth worthy of the games 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.050
 of the circus about cancer it's not because these fascists bother to 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.420
 win his bet that the wd can not be there if the pcf does not fit at least at 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.080
 post of prime minister we will discover the bell of alarmed the 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.170
 disaster plan that we will call madam laurent but what can we 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.340
 do from 2005 that this is not enough I tell you very 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.310
 serenely deschamps on vacation I withdraw my breath we will work for 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.120
 do not give yourself a prime minister position a little to give them back a 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.720
 small position of secretary of state 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.039
 from the station 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.889
 kamagaté except one that is dear to him 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.089
 Stadium 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:15.089
 the budget for the week of January 1st 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:19.389
 Valliot
