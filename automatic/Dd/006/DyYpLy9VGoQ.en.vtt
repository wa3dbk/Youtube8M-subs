 and good as pink and purple I 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.989
 I like it a lot I decided to buy it 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.590
 and the next shirt from there that I 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.830
 I bought was this one that is blue and it puts 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.830
 to see 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.070
 then I went outside the same version and I 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.290
 I bought this nice that puts maris 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.280
 and well I like many hats 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.040
 although I do not have many so I decided 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.130
 buy one 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.130
 Y 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.210
 then I went to urban outfitters and there I 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.380
 I bought first I bought this shirt 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.380
 of suspenders also 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.470
 is blue and I liked it very much and 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.920
 then you can buy two masses is that the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.920
 eat 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.400
 but good in English is called mason 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.820
 keys so I bought two because one 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.960
 is for me and the other is for Maria and 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.210
 maria alice who is here on youtube 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.370

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.930

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.220
 point of reaching the thousand subscribers 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.220
 so subscribe subscribe and well that 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.430
 it's hers 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.310
 This is mine and that's what I bought 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.470
 in urban outfitters after I went to a 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.360
 parapharmacy that is a place where there 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.480
 medicines but there are also products 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.980
 of makeup and good and for hair 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.620
 I also created this 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:37.150
 I do not know whether to serve well I bought this 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.099
 cream of nokia matters and it is a cream 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.720
 for the hair for after the shower 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:46.540
 and this serves to control the frizz 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.220
 I mean, if this shower comes out, not you 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.129
 you do not want to dry it with the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.150
 dryer you can put this cream 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.150
 then it does not fit like 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:02.299
 and also makes it softer and good 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:05.930
 if the flow I bought I bought a shampoo and a 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:10.099
 conditioner john frieda and these 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:13.000
 are from the full repair range and that's how 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:17.130
 the little bottle 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.130
 and well this what it does is reinforce 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.020
 what it does is reinforce and repair the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.940
 hair and I also bought the 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.800
 conditioner 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:36.480
 and follow what used the shampoo also 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.770
 but I use it more the conditioner and 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.770
 for now it works well 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.540
 brandy in what the project understands 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.040
 of makeup was this maybelline 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:56.490
 and this is the corner and good is a base 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.280
 that removed the pores lid but I want 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:03.060
 I do not have many anymore, they do not see me either 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.280
 and but good if you need it because it goes very 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.130
 well and from as the skin of the face more 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.470
 soft then I went to victoria's secret and 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.680

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.600

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.810
 because I did not have in almost any toiletry 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:28.350

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.120
