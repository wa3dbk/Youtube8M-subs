00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:13.540
 Yes here any way to identify it in the topographical map 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.480
 I would like to talk about 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.730
 8 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.009
 I think the harmful side will come somehow known and Well go Yatteku climbing I Onett valley 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.239
 But it is a look at the actual juice 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:31.789
 Where is the person who is not accustomed to fine the first of me or of such other in the ridge everyone's 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:33.830
 Which it is is very bothering I Is Let's see to and to speak of Toka this 9 Onega 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.500
 It is in the form, such as Tteyuu Is 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.800
 Quite easily 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:45.809
 It does not stick to the package that distinguish it is the person who is not seen a topographic map 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:51.220
 More specifically, where is the low place and where is the peak The flower pattern of the summit is a quick glance 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.280
 Who does not get used it after all Well it is the side you may be so that there is no 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.860
 Even though you get used to it 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.190
 There is a way to get the tips as quickly as possible and easy to understand, so I want to make that blue flower artisan incense 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.519
 I think 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:10.189
 I would like to see this map a little 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:17.330
 It is this natural classroom of here west Tanzawa have river flows here sour or that generally he is a 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:19.149
 It is marked with blue line in the earth, too, and a swamp called Higashizawa flows here 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.770
 It is natural 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:28.020
 It's roughly the altitude is written in this neighborhood since the topographic map 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:34.740
 It is written as 750m here 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.380
 Day east wind 660 m If you say to Kandadan , this one is higher and this one is lower. 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.540
 Sawa is high 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.750
 It is flowing 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:48.070
 It is rough from this side and from the inside, but in this Nishitanzawa nature classroom area 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:52.960
 Some differences seem to merge and become more and more river and say to flow downstream 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.840
 Because it is a form, naturally the place where the water is flowing naturally is good 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.940
 I will be Tanizawa 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:04.390
 Yes in it is that kind of place 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.290
 Basically, not everything in the house is painted in blue with all the others 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.050
 by myself 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.729
 It is a swamp along this is it I'll go painted in Oy pen 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.729
 Ne'm tricks was this change Tte 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.970
 As a point 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.920
 I'm biting into the high 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:27.450
 By the way, if you go with this map, which side is easy to understand, so it may be easy to understand this side 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.540
 May not 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.620
 The elevation is lower on the left side 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.740
 Here the anti to the higher it is high towards the right 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.360
 I 'm biting in. This v It is a letter v 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.360
 Here I guess this is Tanira 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.450
 If you do not try to actually go and say whether or not this Well actually go to the site you are here to water flow 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.220
 I do not know I do, but I'm there Datte This others to such Fu 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.220
 It has become to have enough in this such Fu 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.880
 It is this way 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.430
 In such Fu 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:08.690
 Another thing is that they are biting into the high one and another point is that others are 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.690
 Because the slope is steep 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.690
 This bite 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.010
 This is the text of the words 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.770
 It is sharp and so are all things like this one 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.170
 Line in has become the valley 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:29.459
 I'm cutting into pieces 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.459
 Since the reverse of that good ridge is basically flat where there are many in Te
