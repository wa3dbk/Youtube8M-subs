00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.460
 and once again post in the new year 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.230
 newest product here you want 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.580
 maybe you can see it directly from children 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.599
 what is in it I just take it already 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.130
 let's go the iris m 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.980
 I would say look the shoulder 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.870
 and see what's in it 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.150
 yes then we also go directly 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.580
 with the canon eos mm of the first 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.920
 system camera from home canon up 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.760
 now the only model to find that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.699
 we first up here advertising brochure 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.289
 moderately from all over the world know iris m 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.210
 objective and so on and so forth 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.210
 simplify the srk what, of course 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.020
 first not so much to offer but has 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.940
 Well, of course, it is clearly at 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.860
 software cd and again a bit 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.149
 longer instructions that are still here 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:53.969
 cards and which clutter so for the first time 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:57.230
 the paperwork, so to speak here in the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.359
 offer inter alia German short 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.100
 user manual looks but relatively 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.899
 in detail so that's already here 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.119
 almost 100 pages 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.890
 there are definitely shorter things 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.330
 in the market but I think come 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.150
 now for the interesting part 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.140
 and that is the iris m course itself 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.420
 I now want a number on it here 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:25.409
 typing on the back feels the greatest 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.990
 also relatively difficult to silva nunes 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.979
 Model we got here 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.470
 that looks or is from the size ago 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.119
 not too different from the noble ones 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.729
 compact cameras one has so one 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.439
 brandserie also consciously think so 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.930
 made him remember that but you 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.460
 Of course , he already sees that in front here 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.799
 it is definitely not flat rate anymore 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.479
 is because interchangeable objectively and 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.770
 sensor in aps c is therefore essential 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.430
 bigger than a compact camera 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:00.210
 on it before stopline comes here otherwise 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.479
 we are of course with us 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.600
 to properly test her with the 18th 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.009
 55mm guess you saw it was fitting 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.800
 very good color here the other one 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.020
 Variation that here in silver so yes me 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.459
 think that will look pretty good later 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.819
 but that in our test again exactly 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.980
 Of course, no longer look the color 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:24.900
 here with the exactly one more flash 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.910
 speedlite 90 can be like canon 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.800
 Usually just beautiful here on the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.750
 if you look at the main school 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.400
 not too stupid as I am 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.860
 exactly what is on it are also nice 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.690
 Of course you can also go up here 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.120
 So the standard hot shoe is from 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.440
 canon make every other blitz on 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.600
 even if it is now from the signal or otherwise 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.040
 rihm is the fit on it so that is 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:54.750
 everything remained the connection ago 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:56.400
 yes, what's coming out so big 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.340
 remaining accessories 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.330
 Here we are once I'm great here 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.989
 The strap must be comfortable too 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.790
 power cable I think that 's exactly 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.730
 for the battery charger 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.799
 you can already see from the battery is not a 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:24.600
 we have a little different year 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:27.239
 also here that the battery once look 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.970
 with the capacity we find 63 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.269
 watt hours so yeah I guess that 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.970
 should last a while and the last 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.320
 still in there 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.180
 USB cable mini usb cable for connection 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.130
 to the pc 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.870
 nice also really normal mini 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.340
 USB connection not proprietary you 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.720
 You can also use another cable 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.640
 That's not the case with other manufacturers 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.079
 so there have the special connection cables 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.870
 it has to be lost for a lot of money 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.340
 buy a special feature we now 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.860
 still have 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.459
 even with to get tested 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.190
 the adapter to ef and ef s objective of 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.239
 to be able to connect the ism 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.550
 because you only have one here 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.010
 connection for ef lenses so it 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.920
 especially for the system cameras of canon 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.379
 made they can simply times here 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.070
 Build directly here then you will 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:19.530
 can look and that in the 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.290
 to be alfred biolek 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.919
 have something prepared 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:28.760
 the camera then the adapters you can 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.800
 virtually all objectively 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.760
 rage is inside and you then see already 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.800
 that's a bit forward 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.729
 the whole thing enlarges a bit 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.740
 to turn in 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.720
 with it receives normal lens afterwards 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:48.000
 can anyone with 750 millimeters objective 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.910
 from sigma there and then actually runs 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.120
 forever you have both here the times 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:58.410
 red dots you can see the set 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.789
 you turn on the whole and 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.789
 already have this commitment new standard 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.200
 objectively ism connected looks now 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.289
 perhaps only a bit unwieldy 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.240
 out but do not actually could 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.139
 so that pretty much everything has to do 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.900
 to solve again 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.389
 So all my thoughts point to that 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.500
 thing for people who already dslr cameras 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.360
 from canon have accordingly 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.220
 you can deal with them fairly 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.840
 cheap is a smaller travel camera 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.660
 if you get your big the swr 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.400
 do not want to drag along more then 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.120
 later a proper test in the sense 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.990
 first know 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.990
 we'll meet
