not to push too hard when you're
polishing<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.109> because<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:02.130> know<00:03:02.519> that's<00:03:02.819> what

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
polishing it because I know that's what

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.750 
polishing it because I know that's what
she<00:03:03.120> said<00:03:03.359> but<00:03:03.769> seriously<00:03:04.769> discussed<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.639> from

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
she said but seriously discussed it from

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.190 
she said but seriously discussed it from
just<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.090> cloth<00:03:06.450> which<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:06.930> kind<00:03:07.170> of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
just this cloth which is kind of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
just this cloth which is kind of
retarded<00:03:08.030> guess<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.239> got<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> cheap<00:03:09.690> finish<00:03:10.049> I

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
retarded guess it's got a cheap finish I

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.370 
retarded guess it's got a cheap finish I
but<00:03:11.220> again<00:03:11.670> overall<00:03:11.970> it's<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.299> great<00:03:12.380> great

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
but again overall it's a great great
