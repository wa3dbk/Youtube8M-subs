00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.760
 Hello, everyone is Ikawa 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.600
 The last time is in the table indi. 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.520
 Is there 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.459
 We introduce big make and today is 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:11.439
 Yeah 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.329
 What kind of microphone is there by being sent two microphones 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:14.919
 I think 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.369
 I would like to introduce you 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.089
 Apply compared to Maiko 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.189
 It is these two 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.739
 It was with such a microphone 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.900
 Makotoko, I mean 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.909
 It is such a bike 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:28.230
 Which also 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.440
 My pace of interviewing is a little different 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.780
 Let us introduce 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.410
 At first it is this microphone, but it is made of metal 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 Deco to cable-tethering phase 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.470
 Become a person 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.470
 There is about s1 in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.720
 How can you hear the voice you use 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.290
 Wintering 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.400
 Often 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.510
 My when accepting and using that decoder and candidate 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.640
 is not it 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.850
 Yeah 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.420
 If someone comes in like this 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.740
 Back right 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.770
 In the way 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.110
 with everyone 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.570
 It is a microphone used when interviewing everyone 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.960
 Speaking of the reception rate, if you are here for the team 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.090
 Even if 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.880
 I can hear it to some extent 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.220
 It is said that even when this microphone is pointed 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.500
 It is a microphone for everyone to use 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.250
 No, this happened once before I think 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.100
 The other one is the microphone of beauty and also this one 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.960
 Head of one 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 It is a microphone used to make public money 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.960
 Offer a pin microphone and a container Always carry to your hometown 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.870
 It is the ability to put on 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.870
 Are out 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.130
 I am doing both. 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.510
 It will rain, hey, the sound is good from here 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.350
 There is also a hole on the side 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.240
 With dividend from the side 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.359
 Small 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:10.899
 This microphone- 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.899
 I'll take a big compromise and go for tips 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.389
 In 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.389
 Necktie pin 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:22.409
 Decision 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.409
 Put on buds 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.019
 This is a battery case, let's finish 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.069
 Kotobuki 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.759
 We are positioned in the US 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:46.749
 Universal introduction 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.749
 Onishi's moment 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.539
 The diode glows 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:57.069
 If you buy as much light as purchasing is happening with a level battery 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.689
 It means that if you get well 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.289
 With electricity biller 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:02.859
 Out 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.870
 I think that high diode Kim Mong Jin recorded 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.149
 Do things that will be over soon in the field 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:10.709
 See you then 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.629
 Actually I put it on myself 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.619
 Connect the cable 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.619
 Cable connection 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.689
 Let the ashes of the ashes actually find yourself etf 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.509
 US Freescale but 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:36.419
 It's a cable 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.629
 This is a good thing because it is not very cool when it gets fat 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.629
 I'll make sure that you are issued 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.759
 I do not have much to attach to myself 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.709
 Second person from the right 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.930
 It is a cable when attached 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.220
 It does not appear in the camera 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.959
 This is beautiful 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.039
 Wintering 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.940
 Recent 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.990
 Interview microphone 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.979
 Unlike here 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.240
 This microphone is a person 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.279
 I only take my voice 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:35.490
 But my voice is 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.310
 Sounds from the side, light and light will be reduced to 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.870
 So much to make 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.440
 Because I put it out 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.210
 Unplug the mokkomoko and hold the microphone 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.599
 Prefecture is quite important 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.550
 Of course there are also voices that you think I'm looking at my mouth 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.699
 I took it clean 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.319
 It becomes small these days when I want to expand the station 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.430
 Acting is very important 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.550
 station 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.460
 I see this bike often 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.080
 University professor who can be found in unhealthy programs or science programs 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.240
 I'm sending it high. 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.860
 I use it when interviewing just a bad feeling 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.719
 I lose 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:14.389
 Voice of the person Takeo 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.699
 Do this 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.689
 Then winter bike 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:23.529
 Let's compare them a little with the nature of each as a table 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.089
 This mic is this mic 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:39.139
 Approximately 720 yen 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.879
 It is a dynamic one 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.339
 It's a dynamic kind of microphone 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:44.689
 Power supply 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:46.520
 This war 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.349
 Station configuration 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.969
 There is no function of losing sugar of the loser. 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:55.550
 Sounds like a circle, even in the unbeatable direction 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.499
 Now i 

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:00.729
 It is called 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.279
 Pretty cool mic 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.360
 I have a hard time in the future 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.699
 It is called a US condenser microphone 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.740
 pcm 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.189
 To 66 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:11.650
 It's called 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.860
 Power supply 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.349
 Is required 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.360
 AA batteries can not be found 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.069
 Or external power supply 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:19.619
 I need it already 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:22.360
 There are high school girls 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.669
 Losing response 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.520
 Take big 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.009
 Said 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:28.930
 Two microphones 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.949
 I introduced a town using a different microphone 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.199
 So I project the picture 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.199
 Last but not least, 

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:41.580
 I'm Mike 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.779
 Allies 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:43.909
 Delicate 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:45.129
 it's close 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:46.039
 That is 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.999
 Catch the vibration of the air 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:51.619
 It is an opportunity to turn it into an electrical signal. 

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.699
 It is broken when the force above the vibration is applied 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.499
 Too big signal 

00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:01.379
 I will send it on the 20th of the previous day 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.010
 Need to be careful 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.360
 I have not put it down or hit it This is absolutely 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.000
 Please stop breaking Mr. 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 I get damage to the camera and so on 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:15.099
 Whether the microphone is connected 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:16.979
 Whether you can hear it properly 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:20.479
 I want to listen but I'm addicted 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.699
 There are 61 people but please stop it 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.800
 Wintering 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.110
 Large drums are produced when using a microphone 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.339
 People laugh 

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:33.839
 In the other side of the camera I hear the sound with headphones 

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:35.529
 I said that I wanted to convey my experience 

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:38.379
 Then, this increasingly low 

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:41.969
 It makes a very loud sound, so if you use the previous year 

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:43.610
 Hurt my ears 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.580
 I'm sorry for the camera 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.619
 Please never do a typhoon 

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:51.169
 Then this cable 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:54.169
 I'm getting rid of the cable 

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:56.740
 Even then 

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.680
 There is a time when there is no signal that is very large and flows 

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.680
 When listing in employment, always 

00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:04.679
 I also focused on exchanges 

00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:07.679
 Then make sure that you have the microcomputer standing up 

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.660
 Today's US micron establishment is over
