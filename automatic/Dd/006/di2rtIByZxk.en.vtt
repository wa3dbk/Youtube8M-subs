00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi everyone welcome to a new one 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.330
 video 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.590
 then as you have seen from the title e 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.170
 as you can see from the frame 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.650
 we'll talk about harry potter tree of 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.900
 I made chopsticks for the potters 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.439
 I am entirely made of wood 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.630
 except some details like that 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:29.640
 can notice when I'm done with 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.050
 hot glue very simple commissioning 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.090
 wand for example of bad off that is 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.829
 still define I have to give myself a pass 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.670
 of black and then with walnut brown while 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.750
 with the glue I was still came out 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.089
 stuck the glue with the other hand I turned 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.350
 beautiful now I'm not going to explain then 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.620
 will announce its method 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.289
 then this is the piton wand it is 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.079
 beautiful this would seem short for long 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.210
 35 centimeters 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.929
 I wanted to do it longer but then it was 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.750
 this agreement may be too long 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.650
 silent and also quite long 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.720
 look at him who will chase it 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.300
 in the frame these 47 centimeters 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920
 realize almost half a meter and then 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.710
 I need to know how long the 3 is too long 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.660
 I make chopsticks are a little shorter 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.490
 really this is hermione 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.190
 for example and I did the same 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.160
 technique here with the hot glue I was 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.190
 I stopped and turned only then I have here 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.650
 made the leaves then unpublished special 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.080
 nothing special with calm patience e 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:41.210
 you then put yourself with experience that is 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.210
 habit is one thing will be one thing 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.600
 normal then 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.260
 now I will explain you in material I have 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.120
 used then all the wood he used 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.260
 is this is the year of the stick of 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.220
 broom 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.680
 this is the broom I used down 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.850
 of the discovery already broken or that it is me 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.710
 makes you break the bass 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.860
 only of the purpose of these mother is known 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.860
 never 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.850
 then I took the traced stick 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.300
 the measures is i cut i not having the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.150
 hacksaw I cut with a knife from 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.670
 kitchen that isn't even very sharp 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.590
 so i put on as much sweat and 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.030
 take away so look very difficult 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.220
 that this door if you have a 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.709
 bag or some other material not 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:40.590
 I know the dremel that costs a lot but before or 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.769
 then I'll take it once it's always done 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:48.239
 with this sign and go to love 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:51.630
 of the area first is the technique you use 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.580
 when it is done with a knife and which one was 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.130
 for a long time 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.060
 however this however as we say 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:04.650
 that the bastion of the wooden broom 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.209
 hard enough so I cut it now 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.709
 I'm not cutting because it's one thing 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.750
 now he wants a lot of patience and time 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.329
 however it is good enough to see 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.060
 that this els you see just that one 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.670
 broom stick and with the knife ho 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.290
 made all these details here too 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:28.049
 if it is very large but is the thinnest 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.230
 threatens to break up and then with with 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.230
 this file which is a specific line 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.100
 for the n it is very big there are the stairs 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.560
 valid are very large and pointed and 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.230
 I went to smooth all round 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.109
 here he could do this part 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.590
 characterizes the malfoy wand 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:53.040
 also here to dates that of vito also e 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.640
 this is almost square and square 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.640
 part here 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:04.020
 then with the famous sandpaper before 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.390
 coarse and then fine-grained smiles 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:12.990
 some differences I went to smooth out 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.270
 you listen to all the perfections then give 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.200
 to this dissident wand now 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.390
 let's go into detail 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.070
 I took this I did it I have not 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.900
 made with passion because of the broom 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:27.690
 as you can see it is bigger and 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.940
 passion of the broom this part e 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:36.840
 so I did it with a piece with a 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.820
 square wood with a square base and then with 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.230
 a specific own machine that 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:47.460
 now I don't know what it's called 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:52.410
 let's say kind of a pretty flex 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:55.830
 big fixed on the wall with a lot of 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.660
 patience and calm I kind of like one 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.600
 large sandpaper would be because it is 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.870
 I went to get them all 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.210
 these details did not come here 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.580
 perfect pretty crooked as you can 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.000
 see why that wood was there was a little 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.460
 split but it doesn't matter 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.050
 then all these holes with the drill or with 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.350
 whatever 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.880
 it is enough that you then hole this temple to a 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.350
 piece of paper I made the genius 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.630
 glued with hot glue o 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.810
 paste with any other type of 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.810
 pol 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:34.590
 oh well I can say more used and lots 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.710
 fantasy for example here in the wand 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.080
 of piton here if you go to see in 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.350
 detail how it is made to understand nothing 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.260
 because they are too many details so I have 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.510
 here with the hot glue I put two 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.730
 lines like that while many lines 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.980
 intertwined with each other then how 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.450
 see if you look closely 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.940
 if looked closely and I don't know if yes 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.880
 see it's all tangled 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:05.880
 but you don't understand anything from afar a 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:07.410
 a good effect is also good the glue a 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.630
 warm hand hardens remains public 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:17.040
 quite soft and is also beautiful from 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:18.930
 keep in mind however this said vi 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.270
 thank you for watching it if you have 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.070
 some uncertainty 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.920
 write a comment maybe make a 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.690
 video tutorial of how to answer on which 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.780
 in which I will explain in detail how 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.600
 make this technique use this technique 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.840
 what we say is my technique because 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:40.990
 because why don't I think carpenters 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:45.970
 done so work in wood anyway 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:48.570
 need more videos sign up filled 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.570
 I like it 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.600
 said this hello to everyone and to the next 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.600
 video
