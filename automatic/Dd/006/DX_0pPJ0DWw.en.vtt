should be on the top facing up again I'm

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.480 
should be on the top facing up again I'm
using<00:01:27.780> one<00:01:28.110> hand<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:30.799> when<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:31.920> prying<00:01:32.250> this

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
using one hand so when I'm prying this

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.460 
using one hand so when I'm prying this
you<00:01:32.729> will<00:01:32.880> see<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.360> accidentally<00:01:33.930> drop<00:01:34.200> it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
you will see that I accidentally drop it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.800 
you will see that I accidentally drop it
but<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.130> didn't<00:01:35.460> do<00:01:35.549> any<00:01:35.729> harm<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.689> be

but it didn't do any harm so just be

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.200 
but it didn't do any harm so just be
careful<00:01:37.310> now<00:01:38.310> we're<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:39.000> removing

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
careful now we're going to be removing

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.960 
careful now we're going to be removing
these<00:01:40.049> retainer<00:01:40.650> Clips<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.250> retainer<00:01:41.670> clips

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
these retainer Clips this retainer clips

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.690 
these retainer Clips this retainer clips
or<00:01:42.180> what<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.659> causing<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> noise<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:44.670> has

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
or what is causing the noise it has

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.999 
or what is causing the noise it has
shifted<00:01:45.119> from<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.990> center<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.860> is

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
shifted from the center and it is

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.090 
shifted from the center and it is
actually<00:01:47.630> touching<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.320> brake<00:01:49.649> rotor

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
actually touching the brake rotor

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.469 
actually touching the brake rotor
whenever<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.090> turning<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:53.299> there<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
whenever it is turning and so there is a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.679 
whenever it is turning and so there is a
new<00:01:54.780> part<00:01:55.049> number<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.969> but<00:01:56.969> I'm<00:01:57.390> going

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
new part number for this but I'm going

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.870 
new part number for this but I'm going
to<00:01:57.719> try<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.380> reuse<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:58.979> old<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.610> since

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
to try and just reuse the old one since

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.230 
to try and just reuse the old one since
by<00:02:00.060> cleaning<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.899> recenter<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.619> and

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
by cleaning it and recenter it and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.120 
by cleaning it and recenter it and
applying<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.950> m77<00:02:05.270> paste<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.600> hopefully<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
applying the m77 paste and hopefully the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.700 
applying the m77 paste and hopefully the
noise<00:02:08.670> won't<00:02:08.970> come<00:02:09.210> back<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.900> if<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.200> did<00:02:10.470> I

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
noise won't come back but if it did I

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.460 
noise won't come back but if it did I
would<00:02:10.890> replace<00:02:11.250> them<00:02:11.550> with<00:02:11.870> paid<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.260> new

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
would replace them with paid for new

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.760 
would replace them with paid for new
retainers<00:02:16.820> so<00:02:17.820> go<00:02:18.120> ahead<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.630> clean<00:02:19.590> them

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
retainers so go ahead and clean them

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.230 
retainers so go ahead and clean them
