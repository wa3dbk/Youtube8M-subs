him develop his chocolate craft what I

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.130 
him develop his chocolate craft what I
love<00:00:21.270> about<00:00:21.420> him<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.869> he's<00:00:21.990> got<00:00:22.110> a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
love about him is that he's got a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.530 
love about him is that he's got a
background<00:00:22.439> as<00:00:22.860> a<00:00:22.890> blacksmith<00:00:23.700> so<00:00:24.330> I've<00:00:24.420> been

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
background as a blacksmith so I've been

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.940 
background as a blacksmith so I've been
calling<00:00:24.779> him<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> blacksmith<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.590> cacao

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
calling him the blacksmith of cacao

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.069 
calling him the blacksmith of cacao
because<00:00:26.910> he's<00:00:27.090> actually<00:00:27.300> taken<00:00:27.810> some<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.050> that

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
because he's actually taken some of that

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.069 
because he's actually taken some of that
technology<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:29.329> metallurgy<00:00:30.329> into<00:00:30.720> cacao

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
technology of metallurgy into cacao

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.810 
technology of metallurgy into cacao
production<00:00:31.680> and<00:00:31.770> a<00:00:31.829> big<00:00:32.009> discrepancy<00:00:32.700> between

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
production and a big discrepancy between

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.630 
production and a big discrepancy between
chocolate<00:00:33.780> earing<00:00:34.350> acids<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.280> been<00:00:35.430> done

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
chocolate earing acids as it's been done

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.040 
chocolate earing acids as it's been done
in<00:00:35.790> its<00:00:35.940> more<00:00:36.090> traditional<00:00:36.600> sense

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
in its more traditional sense

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.470 
in its more traditional sense
since<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.590> 1800s<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.550> then<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.300> raw

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
since the 1800s and then the raw

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.540 
since the 1800s and then the raw
chocolate<00:00:39.960> which<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> lot<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.399> people

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
chocolate which is like a lot of people

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.369 
chocolate which is like a lot of people
who<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:41.850> raw<00:00:42.000> foodist<00:00:42.390> he<00:00:42.930> got<00:00:43.109> into

who are raw foodist he got into

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.040 
who are raw foodist he got into
chocolate<00:00:43.940> started<00:00:44.940> mixing<00:00:45.120> paste<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.840> you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
chocolate started mixing paste and you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.500 
chocolate started mixing paste and you
know<00:00:46.170> powder<00:00:46.620> together<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.309> their<00:00:47.550> kitchen<00:00:48.420> or

know powder together in their kitchen or
whatever<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.019> develop<00:00:49.769> chocolate<00:00:50.250> products

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
whatever and develop chocolate products

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.619 
whatever and develop chocolate products
that<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:50.910> gone<00:00:51.000> into<00:00:51.179> the<00:00:51.300> raw<00:00:51.390> food

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
that have gone into the raw food

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.750 
that have gone into the raw food
community<00:00:51.679> but<00:00:52.679> weren't<00:00:52.859> made<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.489> some<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
community but weren't made with some of

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.099 
community but weren't made with some of
the<00:00:53.850> knowledge<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.300> wisdom<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> old

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
the knowledge and wisdom that the old

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.689 
the knowledge and wisdom that the old
chocolate<00:00:55.350> tears<00:00:55.710> had<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.519> like

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
chocolate tears had and what I like

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.740 
chocolate tears had and what I like
about<00:00:56.730> what<00:00:57.000> they're<00:00:57.120> doing<00:00:57.359> here<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.629> they

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

about what they're doing here is they
understand<00:00:58.379> some<00:00:58.589> the<00:00:58.679> older<00:00:58.769> things<00:00:59.070> like

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
understand some the older things like

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.130 
understand some the older things like
tempering<00:01:00.089> maybe<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.750> tell<00:01:00.870> us<00:01:00.929> a<00:01:01.019> little

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
tempering maybe you can tell us a little

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.360 
tempering maybe you can tell us a little
bit<00:01:01.260> about<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.859> tempering<00:01:02.339> chocolate

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
bit about what is tempering chocolate

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.390 
bit about what is tempering chocolate
sure<00:01:02.999> so<00:01:03.359> what<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.929> do<00:01:04.050> here<00:01:04.080> cherry<00:01:05.010> chocolate

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
sure so what we do here cherry chocolate

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.910 
sure so what we do here cherry chocolate
basically<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.180> taking<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.290> crystals<00:01:07.800> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
basically is taking the the crystals the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.740 
basically is taking the the crystals the
fat<00:01:08.130> crystals<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.640> already<00:01:09.060> exist<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
fat crystals that already exist and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.070 
fat crystals that already exist and
bringing<00:01:10.620> them<00:01:10.770> together<00:01:11.010> into<00:01:11.550> form<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.900> it's

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
bringing them together into form so it's

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.120 
bringing them together into form so it's
like<00:01:13.200> when<00:01:13.620> I'm<00:01:13.710> always<00:01:13.860> talking<00:01:14.040> about

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
like when I'm always talking about

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.500 
like when I'm always talking about
structuring<00:01:14.700> water<00:01:14.970> you're<00:01:15.180> talking<00:01:15.450> about

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
structuring water you're talking about

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.510 
structuring water you're talking about
structuring<00:01:16.410> mats<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> fats<00:01:17.220> yeah

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
structuring mats and the fats yeah

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.890 
structuring mats and the fats yeah
structure<00:01:17.940> them<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> crystals<00:01:18.780> if

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
structure them that the crystals if

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.780 
structure them that the crystals if
there's<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.380> six<00:01:20.160> to<00:01:20.340> seven<00:01:20.670> different

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
there's like six to seven different

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.050 
there's like six to seven different
stages<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.480> tempering<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.950> they're<00:01:23.850> all<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
stages of tempering and they're all a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.810 
stages of tempering and they're all a
different<00:01:24.330> stage<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.950> stone<00:01:26.190> you<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.670> do

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
different stage on the stone you can do

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.550 
different stage on the stone you can do
chocolate<00:01:27.030> anyway<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.720> always<00:01:28.020> forms<00:01:28.350> some

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
chocolate anyway it always forms some

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.690 
chocolate anyway it always forms some
kind<00:01:29.010> of<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.160> temper

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
kind of a temper

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.540 
kind of a temper
soon<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> fats<00:01:30.630> harden<00:01:31.130> they<00:01:32.130> get<00:01:32.280> tight

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
soon as the fats harden they get tight

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.630 
soon as the fats harden they get tight
the<00:01:32.730> contract<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.720> come<00:01:33.900> together

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
the contract can come together

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.520 
the contract can come together
whereas<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.910> a<00:01:35.970> stone<00:01:36.450> something<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.380> I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
whereas on a stone something like this I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.900 
whereas on a stone something like this I
have<00:01:37.560> more<00:01:37.920> control<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.400> what's<00:01:38.700> actually

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
have more control of what's actually

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.480 
have more control of what's actually

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.140 
until what 1840 I think yeah yeah when
they<00:05:05.950> are<00:05:06.040> first<00:05:06.190> learned<00:05:06.490> how<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:06.670> take<00:05:06.970> the

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
they are first learned how to take the

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.120 
they are first learned how to take the
oils<00:05:07.540> out<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:07.840> separate<00:05:08.260> them<00:05:08.380> before<00:05:08.920> that

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
oils out and separate them before that

cacao is mostly used as a drink and so

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.520 
cacao is mostly used as a drink and so
now<00:05:11.980> we<00:05:12.040> have<00:05:12.370> this<00:05:12.550> ability<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.450> use<00:05:13.690> cacao<00:05:14.350> in

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
now we have this ability to use cacao in

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.500 
now we have this ability to use cacao in
this<00:05:14.680> way<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:15.400> deliver<00:05:15.730> medicine<00:05:16.150> into<00:05:16.480> the

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
this way to deliver medicine into the
