now<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.420> first<00:00:12.809> part<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.380> inserting<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.980> knob

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
now the first part of inserting the knob

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.220 
now the first part of inserting the knob
side<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.580> actually<00:00:14.759> extremely<00:00:15.389> easy<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
side is actually extremely easy the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.810 
side is actually extremely easy the
first<00:00:16.440> thing<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.680> need<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.859> do<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.340> take<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
first thing you need to do is take the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.150 
first thing you need to do is take the
knob<00:00:18.000> side<00:00:18.240> your<00:00:18.390> bus<00:00:18.600> line<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
knob side your bus line it up in the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.099 
knob side your bus line it up in the
exact<00:00:20.520> same<00:00:20.850> place<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.390> had<00:00:21.570> lined<00:00:21.900> up

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
exact same place that you had lined up

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.679 
exact same place that you had lined up
the<00:00:22.560> loop<00:00:23.369> side<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.789> your<00:00:23.910> bus<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> other

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the loop side of your bus on the other

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.439 
the loop side of your bus on the other
side<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.590> what<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.310> had<00:00:26.519> done<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> had<00:00:26.970> measured

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
side so what I had done I had measured

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.960 
side so what I had done I had measured
the<00:00:27.779> placement<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.890> measured<00:00:29.820> that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the placement of it and I measured that

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.970 
the placement of it and I measured that
it<00:00:30.210> was<00:00:30.330> 2<00:00:30.599> centimeters<00:00:31.109> from<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.349> top<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.830> 2

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
it was 2 centimeters from the top and 2

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.530 
it was 2 centimeters from the top and 2
centimeters<00:00:32.460> from<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> bottom<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.149> was<00:00:33.270> just

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
centimeters from the bottom it was just

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.389 
centimeters from the bottom it was just
centered<00:00:33.840> right<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.050> there<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.920> I'm<00:00:35.370> not

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
centered right in there so I'm not

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.030 
centered right in there so I'm not
actually<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.329> sew<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.960> buskin<00:00:37.320> right

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
actually going to sew the buskin right

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.569 
actually going to sew the buskin right
now

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
now

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.459 
now
all<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.120> do<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.540> put<00:00:40.050> these<00:00:40.200> two

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
all I'm going to do is put these two

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.610 
all I'm going to do is put these two
panel<00:00:41.190> pieces<00:00:41.340> together<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.780> sew<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.230> right

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
panel pieces together and sew that right

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.069 
panel pieces together and sew that right
down<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:45.140> stitching<00:00:46.140> line<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:48.079> extending

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
down this stitching line here extending

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.920 
down this stitching line here extending
right<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> top<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.190> bottom

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
right to the top and to the bottom

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.240 
right to the top and to the bottom
completely<00:00:51.930> closed<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.440> I'm<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.070> do

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
completely closed and I'm going to do

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.860 
completely closed and I'm going to do
that<00:00:53.430> two<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:53.699> three<00:00:54.000> times<00:00:54.180> because<00:00:54.629> once

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
that two or three times because once

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.200 
that two or three times because once
again<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.620> bus<00:00:55.770> holds<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.309> lot<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.640> tension<00:00:57.030> and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
again the bus holds a lot of tension and

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.569 
again the bus holds a lot of tension and
they<00:00:57.270> want<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.719> part<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> corset<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> be

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
they want this part of the corset to be

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.850 
they want this part of the corset to be
extremely<00:01:00.030> strong<00:01:02.870> remember<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:04.320> first<00:01:04.589> two

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
extremely strong remember my first two

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.340 
extremely strong remember my first two
panels<00:01:05.070> fashion<00:01:05.850> panel<00:01:06.150> 1<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.570> lining<00:01:07.049> panel

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
panels fashion panel 1 and lining panel

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.859 
panels fashion panel 1 and lining panel
1<00:01:07.530> are<00:01:07.890> repaired<00:01:08.460> exactly<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> same<00:01:09.299> way<00:01:09.540> so

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
1 are repaired exactly the same way so

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.660 
1 are repaired exactly the same way so
they're<00:01:10.049> identical<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.860> mirror<00:01:11.159> images<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
they're identical but mirror images of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940 
they're identical but mirror images of
one<00:01:11.790> another<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.930> don't<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
one another you don't have to do this I

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.050 
one another you don't have to do this I
just<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.700> way

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
just like it this way

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.120 
just like it this way
even<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.110> don't<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.710> way<00:01:16.920> at

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
even if you don't do it this way at

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.039 
even if you don't do it this way at
least<00:01:17.340> half<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.060> flat<00:01:18.360> lines<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.869> both

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
least half go to you flat lines to both

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.020 
least half go to you flat lines to both
your<00:01:19.200> fashion<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.770> lining<00:01:20.100> panels<00:01:20.460> because

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
your fashion and lining panels because

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270 
your fashion and lining panels because
the<00:01:21.360> bus<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.750> after<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> bone<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.100> want

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the bus is after all a bone and you want

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.280 
the bus is after all a bone and you want
it<00:01:23.400> surrounded<00:01:23.880> by<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> tight<00:01:24.360> weave<00:01:24.600> fabric<00:01:25.020> so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it surrounded by a tight weave fabric so

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.510 
it surrounded by a tight weave fabric so
that<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.650> will<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.920> less<00:01:26.070> likely<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that it will be less likely to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.429 
that it will be less likely to
eventually<00:01:27.150> poke<00:01:27.360> through<00:01:27.689> from<00:01:27.930> continued

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
eventually poke through from continued

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.090 
eventually poke through from continued
stress<00:01:30.079> right<00:01:31.079> now<00:01:31.110> I'm<00:01:31.470> sewing<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> two

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
stress right now I'm sewing the two

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.700 
stress right now I'm sewing the two
first<00:01:32.430> panels<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:33.210> sides<00:01:33.540> together<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
first panels right sides together at the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.710 
first panels right sides together at the
stitching<00:01:34.950> line<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.490> I'm<00:01:35.909> lock<00:01:36.150> stitching<00:01:36.600> it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
stitching line and I'm lock stitching it

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.539 
stitching line and I'm lock stitching it
that<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.200> stitching<00:01:37.650> at<00:01:37.890> multiple<00:01:38.340> times

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
that is stitching at multiple times

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.550 
that is stitching at multiple times
using<00:01:38.880> different<00:01:39.360> stitch<00:01:39.600> lengths<00:01:39.990> each<00:01:40.200> time

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
using different stitch lengths each time

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.440 
using different stitch lengths each time
so<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.490> very<00:01:41.729> difficult<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.329> pull<00:01:42.509> apart

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
so that is very difficult to pull apart

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.300 
so that is very difficult to pull apart
okay<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.509> as<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:46.079> see<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.680> now<00:01:46.890> triple

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
okay so as you can see it is now triple

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.100 
okay so as you can see it is now triple
stitched<00:01:47.549> along<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> stitching<00:01:48.390> line<00:01:48.600> no<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
stitched along the stitching line no I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.219 
stitched along the stitching line no I
don't<00:01:49.500> think<00:01:49.560> triple<00:01:50.100> stitching<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.549> overkill

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
don't think triple stitching is overkill

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.590 
don't think triple stitching is overkill
now<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.829> need<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.070> do<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.460> press<00:01:54.390> this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
now all you need to do is press this

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.440 
now all you need to do is press this
open<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.289> then<00:01:55.740> press<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.179> it's

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
knobs through one reason for this is

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.570 
knobs through one reason for this is
that<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.960> don't<00:03:39.170> want<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:39.590> have<00:03:39.800> made<00:03:40.280> all

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
that you don't want to have made all

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.310 
that you don't want to have made all
your<00:03:40.820> holes<00:03:41.150> and<00:03:41.510> then<00:03:41.660> find<00:03:41.990> that<00:03:42.140> you've

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
your holes and then find that you've

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.290 
your holes and then find that you've
accidentally<00:03:42.920> misaligned<00:03:43.550> a<00:03:43.730> hole<00:03:43.940> with<00:03:44.120> its

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
accidentally misaligned a hole with its

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.960 
accidentally misaligned a hole with its
knob<00:03:44.510> at<00:03:45.050> that<00:03:45.440> point<00:03:45.710> the<00:03:45.980> hole<00:03:46.160> is<00:03:46.430> permanent

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
knob at that point the hole is permanent

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.030 
knob at that point the hole is permanent
and<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.720> would<00:03:47.870> be<00:03:47.990> very<00:03:48.230> difficult<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.800> cover

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
and it would be very difficult to cover

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.620 
and it would be very difficult to cover
up<00:03:49.280> especially<00:03:49.880> since<00:03:50.090> it's<00:03:50.270> right<00:03:50.450> at<00:03:50.600> the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
up especially since it's right at the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.120 
up especially since it's right at the
front<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:51.140> corset<00:03:53.560> another<00:03:54.560> reason<00:03:54.980> is

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
front of the corset another reason is

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.100 
front of the corset another reason is
that<00:03:55.160> some<00:03:55.640> fabrics<00:03:56.090> depending<00:03:56.720> on<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.930> weave

this is because I always though seams of

my corset with a fashion fabric facing

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.890 
my corset with a fashion fabric facing
up<00:05:21.009> so<00:05:21.250> I<00:05:21.580> can<00:05:21.819> be<00:05:21.970> sure<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.509> seams<00:05:22.750> are

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
up so I can be sure that the seams are

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.689 
up so I can be sure that the seams are
neat<00:05:23.169> and<00:05:23.289> straight<00:05:23.710> on<00:05:23.860> the<00:05:23.949> outside

the busk go slowly and keep your seams

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.010 
the busk go slowly and keep your seams
straight<00:05:44.669> just<00:05:45.669> as<00:05:45.789> with<00:05:45.970> the<00:05:46.000> loop<00:05:46.270> side<00:05:46.599> you

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
straight just as with the loop side you

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.839 
straight just as with the loop side you
only<00:05:47.199> have<00:05:47.530> to<00:05:47.680> stitch<00:05:47.889> this<00:05:48.099> once<00:05:48.400> because

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
only have to stitch this once because

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.279 
only have to stitch this once because
it's<00:05:49.060> not<00:05:49.240> a<00:05:49.270> tension<00:05:49.690> holding<00:05:50.199> seam<00:05:51.930> so<00:05:52.930> now

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
it's not a tension holding seam so now

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:54.749 
it's not a tension holding seam so now

you want to make sure it doesn't leave a

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.379 
you want to make sure it doesn't leave a
stain<00:06:11.190> so<00:06:12.190> just<00:06:12.490> put<00:06:12.669> a<00:06:12.699> little<00:06:12.909> bit<00:06:13.120> of<00:06:13.270> the

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
stain so just put a little bit of the

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.300 
stain so just put a little bit of the
fray<00:06:13.599> block<00:06:13.870> around<00:06:14.259> each<00:06:14.500> of<00:06:14.680> the<00:06:14.800> knobs<00:06:15.009> and

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
fray block around each of the knobs and

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.959 
fray block around each of the knobs and
then<00:06:15.490> wait<00:06:15.759> a<00:06:15.789> bit<00:06:16.029> to<00:06:16.360> allow<00:06:16.569> it<00:06:16.690> to<00:06:16.719> dry

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.329 

and<00:06:21.419> now<00:06:21.929> it's<00:06:22.110> time<00:06:22.289> to<00:06:22.349> test<00:06:22.709> out<00:06:22.949> the<00:06:23.099> fit<00:06:23.309> of

00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:23.339 
and now it's time to test out the fit of

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.029 
and now it's time to test out the fit of
the<00:06:23.489> busk<00:06:23.729> make<00:06:24.569> sure<00:06:24.779> it's<00:06:24.959> even<00:06:25.379> and<00:06:25.739> one

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
the busk make sure it's even and one

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:27.769 
the busk make sure it's even and one
side<00:06:26.249> isn't<00:06:26.519> higher<00:06:26.939> or<00:06:27.269> lower<00:06:27.479> than<00:06:27.719> the

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779 
side isn't higher or lower than the

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:29.989 
side isn't higher or lower than the
other<00:06:27.899> preferably<00:06:28.829> it<00:06:29.069> should<00:06:29.159> be<00:06:29.429> all<00:06:29.610> even

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:29.999 
other preferably it should be all even

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:31.969 
other preferably it should be all even
and<00:06:30.239> make<00:06:30.809> sure<00:06:30.989> the<00:06:31.169> loops<00:06:31.349> and<00:06:31.559> knobs<00:06:31.739> are

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
and make sure the loops and knobs are

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.859 
and make sure the loops and knobs are
both<00:06:32.129> clear<00:06:32.610> of<00:06:32.819> fabric<00:06:33.209> so<00:06:33.360> that<00:06:33.539> they<00:06:33.689> can

00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:33.869 
both clear of fabric so that they can

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:38.479 
both clear of fabric so that they can
cleanly<00:06:34.319> clasp<00:06:36.019> and<00:06:37.019> there<00:06:37.860> we<00:06:38.009> go

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:38.489 
cleanly clasp and there we go

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:41.119 
cleanly clasp and there we go
so<00:06:38.819> that<00:06:39.179> concludes<00:06:39.689> the<00:06:40.139> tutorial<00:06:40.379> on<00:06:40.829> bus

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
so that concludes the tutorial on bus

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:46.560 
so that concludes the tutorial on bus
insertion

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:59.890
