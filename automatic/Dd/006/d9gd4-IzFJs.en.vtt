00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.870
 now her colleagues colleague merz 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.500
 warmly welcome to one 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.500
 press conference after the game 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.910
 first congratulations for fc lucerne and for 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.880
 the coach 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.820
 because the players coach and sometimes it 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.200
 is not to be easily trainer I 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.910
 am a colleague and congratulations to him 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.670
 yes I can not be satisfied with that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.270
 team we have all knew 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.340
 exactly how is the situation and above 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.899
 we talked a lot but that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.140
 Team does not have the good answer 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.140
 given 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:57.140
 I can say other side, I believe 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.640
 not that the team did not want 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.210
 today the team could not 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.930
 perhaps 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.960
 we have so much against ebay 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.630
 we were over the border against ebay and 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.159
 three days later than it is difficult again 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.290
 to make such a game 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.979
 we do not have this maturity yet 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.689
 this constancy and we have seen on 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.450
 At the beginning of the game we were not there 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.229
 have lost the bouts we have 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.890
 many unnecessary balls lost too and 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.079
 yes the 1 0 was quite normal then have 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.240
 we played a little better until old 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.759
 See that was alright we have 2 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.280
 by chance have had two good actions 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:45.119
 shown two part time a little bit like that 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.610
 wanted to leave but 10 is always 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.180
 dangerous and we do not take risk 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.560
 so much could not do so much then 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.270
 we bothered a little provoked 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.240
 not only the second is that 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.770
 anecdotal but i hate those 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.770
 situation where 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:11.400
 As a coach you have to encourage them 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.490
 players who lie on the ground for giving 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.440
 that does not bother much this 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.600
 situation on the side the second one after all 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.940
 because it is lazy at which he was but 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.780
 he too remains he stops 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.890
 he does not go down he does not scream 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.920
 and the referee did not whistle 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.290
 and that gives the second gate that is one 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.860
 exotic but for me as a coach 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.830
 Such a situation I hate this one 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.820
 this football where you have to be on the ground and 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.370
 scream to get free kick 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.570
 I generally do not object to this 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.790
 fc lucerne 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.430
 I speak also of fc in this 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.350
 situation and this way 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.050
 I do not like it at all I do not want to 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.950
 next week say the mary you have to go to 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.410
 go ground 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.040
 The interest is not as a trainer I want 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.280
 not that one 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.700
 but that bothers me a lot but that is 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.680
 only anecdotal at the end this is 21 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.530
 this book is here and we only have one 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.230
 Tor won wonder maybe 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.050
 we lose a point but we are 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.090
 First we have the game 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.600
 not lost rather difficult very 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.550
 sure i do not want to read at a couple 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.830
 journalists at the Schall sound and 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.220
 death against difficult against his 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.220
 Team first has to be clear 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:51.690
 thanks for the comment richard 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:56.100
 communicate home victory I congratulate 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.310
 team in front of a team that is 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.680
 this is earned through commitment 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.390
 and it's still not efficient 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.950
 as I would imagine and 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.659
 that we have what we would like 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.810
 Meanwhile , we have since 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:13.019
 maybe one more goal to shoot 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.180
 and he has the team and the fans 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.100
 then of course the situation is important that 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.079
 you only together 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.269
 we have to do that we have something there 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.590
 that the crew yes us that the fans 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.020
 support us because we have yes 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.080
 fantastic fans that's that's it 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.080
 so 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.280
 yes that was a game we won 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.340
 He goes on and I do not want to 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.900
 say a lot because I think that's what 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.610
 the men appealed then goes there 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.770
 me also certain things exactly on the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.470
 Palm or bring me to the palm 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.030
 I do not want to comment on that 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.080
 but everyone has a little fun and 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.449
 the joy of journalists and everything there 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:05:01.080
 Now we talk about honesty 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:05.090
 and work and ok me then i want to 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.090
 the round open for questions about the game 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.229
 there are questions about the game is not the 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.720
 case 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.150
 then I wish you all a nice one 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.800
 evening many thanks we will briefly 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.800
