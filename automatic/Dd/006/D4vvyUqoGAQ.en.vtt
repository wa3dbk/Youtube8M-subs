device your phone your cellular service

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.140 
device your phone your cellular service
I<00:01:37.250> guess<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.430> could<00:01:38.460> search<00:01:39.200> video<00:01:40.200> games<00:01:41.150> top

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150

I guess you could search video games top
five<00:01:42.420> week<00:01:42.689> number<00:01:42.810> three<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.320> think

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
five week number three and I think

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.490 
five week number three and I think
they'll<00:01:43.680> probably<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:45.290> don't<00:01:46.290> want<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
they'll probably be it so don't want to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.139 
they'll probably be it so don't want to
leave<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.649> mobile<00:01:47.159> device<00:01:47.369> people<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:47.790> but
