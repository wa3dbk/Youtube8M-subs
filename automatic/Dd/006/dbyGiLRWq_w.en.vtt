compartment and then it'll like diffuse
the<00:01:11.549> oil<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.570> those<00:01:12.720> are<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.320> complete

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the oil so and those are just a complete

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.740 
the oil so and those are just a complete
waste<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.400> time<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.850> smell<00:01:15.090> anything<00:01:15.630> for

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
waste of time you can smell anything for

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.359 
waste of time you can smell anything for
now<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:15.960> they<00:01:16.080> ended<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.590> discontinuing<00:01:17.220> those

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
now so they ended up discontinuing those
like<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.820> think<00:01:17.880> maybe<00:01:18.570> two<00:01:18.840> or<00:01:18.930> three<00:01:18.990> years

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290

like I think maybe two or three years
ago<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.850> being<00:01:21.030> said<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.619> oils<00:01:22.890> are

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979

decrease so you know what else but this

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.590 
decrease so you know what else but this
is<00:05:29.390> pretty<00:05:29.600> much<00:05:29.770> it<00:05:30.770> for<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:31.730> oils<00:05:32.090> they're

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
is pretty much it for the oils they're
