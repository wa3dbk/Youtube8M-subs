00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.069
 engineering maintenance 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.580
 between the flights we look at 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.529
 the technical condition of the vehicles 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.109
 has many technical maintenance we do 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.029

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.970
 all that matters 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.410
 4 safety can affect that 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.270
 have to check 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.550
 inspect the engine or one 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.410
 layer is completely good well of course I am 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:49.149
 also to the state of the landing gear 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.149
 the wheels the tires the brakes 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.170
 see if they are still irregularities 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.100

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.280
 greeting gerard nice menu the checklist 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.990
 how to finish inside the plane 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.100
 are you going well good two and two was 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.710

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.920
 at 10 o'clock in I think it will 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.840
 is possible 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.000
 so that the plane could be earlier 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:28.880
 must fly than origin in the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:33.350
 planning was going ahead and get busy there 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.390
 A leak has occurred here 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.090
 you just have to see if I 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.300
 wages of good where we find oppressed 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.300
 to become 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.450
 you have to do everything you have to 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.830
 can grab and you need that code 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.720
 system can operate 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.270
 but you also need a toilet, for example 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.010
 can resolve complaints or an oven 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.250
 which does not work properly 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.920
 all we in the operation of one 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.490
 plane prevents that you have to 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.490
 can grab 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.660

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.170
 can indicate 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.410
 technically quite the operation 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.700
