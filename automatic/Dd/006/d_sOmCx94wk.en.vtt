 true 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.610
 after 13 years 7 wear 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.129
 jalkh to forgive but do not forgive 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.349
 I've let myself get a little bit just bought me a fantastic lumf gf3 well 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.320
 that of them from the front 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.300
 I'm sorry I'm sorry 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.300
 you're kidding they're not very well assured 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.689
 I'm going to show you something 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.500
 you know how are really good cameras can be big bulky and 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.519
 They weigh a lot what they have done to sony that is to eliminate the mirror 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.250
 nor have they removed the viewer 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.860
 that's why this interchangeable lens camera is one of the most 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.800
 small and light of the world 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.530
 why not with weight tests 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.230

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.060
 fantastic b 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.790
 You have seen such a large LCD screen and it is also tactile that you can 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.600
 control all functions such as exposure exposure ratio 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.010
 there the shutter speed looks I give you an example when you want to focus 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 it is just enough to aim at the object 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.260
 if You see her 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.900
 the camera was used in mode and pa the mode every is an automatic mode 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.500
 intelligent from that shell 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.500
 goods that prove it macro mode 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.040
 finish 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.700

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.830
