00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
again here's one there's two three and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.889 
again here's one there's two three and
four<00:00:57.030> edges<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.829> we're<00:00:58.829> done<00:00:58.980> here

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
four edges and we're done here

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.330 
four edges and we're done here
totally<00:01:00.899> Temagami<00:01:01.260> knife<00:01:01.530> we've<00:01:02.100> got<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
totally Temagami knife we've got the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.240 
totally Temagami knife we've got the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
same hashed wig as before close-up here

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.520 
same hashed wig as before close-up here
so<00:01:06.240> there's<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:07.260> two<00:01:08.360> edges<00:01:10.100> three<00:01:11.100> edges<00:01:11.520> and
