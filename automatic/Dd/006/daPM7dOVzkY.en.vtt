to the gas station at the gas station
what<00:04:03.000> you're<00:04:03.090> gonna<00:04:03.180> do<00:04:03.390> is<00:04:03.660> put<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.110> battery

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
what you're gonna do is put the battery

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.650 
what you're gonna do is put the battery
in<00:04:04.710> over<00:04:05.070> here<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.520> now<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:06.030> have<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.330> wait<00:04:06.630> a

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
in over here and now you have to wait a

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.510 
in over here and now you have to wait a
while<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:07.170> if<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.680> have<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.800> crawler<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.310> will

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
while so if you have a crawler it will

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.160 
while so if you have a crawler it will
work<00:04:08.670> best<00:04:08.880> because<00:04:09.030> on<00:04:09.450> zombie<00:04:09.810> rounds<00:04:10.080> of

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
work best because on zombie rounds of

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.080 
work best because on zombie rounds of
zombies<00:04:10.200> will<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.740> course<00:04:10.890> go<00:04:11.160> for<00:04:11.460> it<00:04:11.580> and<00:04:11.670> try

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
zombies will of course go for it and try

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:21.170 
zombies will of course go for it and try
to<00:04:12.150> destroy<00:04:19.489> you<00:04:20.489> could<00:04:20.670> also<00:04:20.790> use<00:04:20.940> the

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
to destroy you could also use the

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.850 
to destroy you could also use the
ambulance<00:04:21.540> trap<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.930> stop<00:04:22.140> them<00:04:22.410> but<00:04:22.650> either

way when you're done the battery will

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.780 
way when you're done the battery will
turn<00:04:25.170> red<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.620> now<00:04:26.130> we're<00:04:26.280> going<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.490> go<00:04:26.610> back

turn red and now we're going to go back

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.430 
turn red and now we're going to go back

gonna do from here is activate the

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.860 
gonna do from here is activate the
instigator<00:04:50.520> alligator<00:04:51.090> trap<00:04:51.390> I<00:04:51.540> believe<00:04:51.780> you

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
instigator alligator trap I believe you

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.510 
instigator alligator trap I believe you
have<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:52.110> break<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.500> glass<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.920> actually<00:04:53.250> find

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
have to break the glass to actually find

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.950 
have to break the glass to actually find
this<00:04:53.640> trap<00:04:53.910> but<00:04:54.210> this<00:04:54.330> part<00:04:54.540> is<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.660> little<00:04:54.870> bit

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
this trap but this part is a little bit

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.420 
this trap but this part is a little bit
tricky<00:04:55.230> so<00:04:55.260> make<00:04:55.650> sure<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:55.890> paying<00:04:56.130> very

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
tricky so make sure you paying very

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.160 
tricky so make sure you paying very
close<00:04:56.610> attention<00:04:56.990> hopefully<00:04:57.990> I'm<00:04:58.080> not

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
close attention hopefully I'm not

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.930 
close attention hopefully I'm not
talking<00:04:58.470> too<00:04:58.590> fast<00:04:58.740> for<00:04:59.040> you<00:04:59.100> guys<00:04:59.250> but<00:04:59.520> yeah

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
talking too fast for you guys but yeah

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.760 
talking too fast for you guys but yeah
like<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.240> said<00:05:00.270> once<00:05:00.930> again<00:05:01.050> you're<00:05:01.470> going<00:05:01.680> to

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
like I said once again you're going to

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.830 
like I said once again you're going to
activate<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.340> instigator<00:05:02.850> alligator<00:05:03.450> track

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
activate the instigator alligator track

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.870 
activate the instigator alligator track
essentially<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.620> idea<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:05.040> this<00:05:05.160> is<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:05.610> shoot

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
essentially the idea of this is to shoot

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.700 
essentially the idea of this is to shoot
the<00:05:06.030> alligator<00:05:06.480> when<00:05:06.840> he<00:05:06.990> comes<00:05:07.230> up<00:05:07.380> to<00:05:07.500> kill

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
the alligator when he comes up to kill

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.320 
the alligator when he comes up to kill
the<00:05:07.830> zombies<00:05:08.190> so<00:05:08.400> pretty<00:05:08.730> much<00:05:08.850> just<00:05:09.060> try<00:05:09.270> to

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
the zombies so pretty much just try to

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.990 
the zombies so pretty much just try to
run<00:05:09.630> small<00:05:10.110> size<00:05:10.410> trains<00:05:10.860> or<00:05:11.190> just<00:05:11.580> save<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.790> few

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
run small size trains or just save a few

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.340 
run small size trains or just save a few
zombies<00:05:12.330> at<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.510> end<00:05:12.630> of<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:12.780> round<00:05:12.930> so<00:05:13.320> that

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
zombies at the end of the round so that

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.050 
zombies at the end of the round so that
you<00:05:13.530> don't<00:05:13.710> get<00:05:13.800> overrun<00:05:14.190> but<00:05:14.580> you<00:05:14.670> can<00:05:14.820> still

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
you don't get overrun but you can still

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.090 
you don't get overrun but you can still
fire<00:05:15.300> at<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.600> alligator<00:05:16.170> and<00:05:16.440> they're<00:05:17.040> gonna

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
fire at the alligator and they're gonna

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.650 
fire at the alligator and they're gonna
kind<00:05:17.400> of<00:05:17.430> a<00:05:17.550> track<00:05:17.910> the<00:05:18.120> alligator<00:05:18.450> so

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
kind of a track the alligator so

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.870 
kind of a track the alligator so
eventually<00:05:19.140> after<00:05:19.530> you<00:05:19.920> shot<00:05:20.190> the<00:05:20.400> alligator

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
eventually after you shot the alligator

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.270 
eventually after you shot the alligator
enough<00:05:21.360> he's<00:05:21.720> going<00:05:21.900> to<00:05:22.020> drop<00:05:22.320> a<00:05:22.500> zombie<00:05:23.100> arm

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
enough he's going to drop a zombie arm

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.040 
enough he's going to drop a zombie arm
for<00:05:23.670> some<00:05:23.850> reason<00:05:24.210> this<00:05:24.390> is<00:05:24.450> going<00:05:24.570> to<00:05:24.720> act<00:05:24.840> as

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
for some reason this is going to act as

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.990 
for some reason this is going to act as
a<00:05:25.110> key<00:05:25.350> card<00:05:25.590> pick<00:05:25.920> this<00:05:26.040> zombie<00:05:26.430> arm<00:05:26.610> up<00:05:26.820> and

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
a key card pick this zombie arm up and

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.640 
a key card pick this zombie arm up and
now<00:05:27.330> you<00:05:27.390> can<00:05:27.570> go<00:05:27.660> back<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.170> Swan<00:05:28.410> and

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
now you can go back to the Swan and

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.740 
now you can go back to the Swan and
place<00:05:28.920> the<00:05:29.100> zombies<00:05:29.430> arm<00:05:29.670> inside<00:05:30.420> of<00:05:30.660> the

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
place the zombies arm inside of the

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.810 
place the zombies arm inside of the
keypad<00:05:31.170> and<00:05:31.320> this<00:05:31.710> safe<00:05:31.980> right<00:05:32.190> over<00:05:32.520> here

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
keypad and this safe right over here

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.730 
keypad and this safe right over here
will<00:05:33.270> open<00:05:33.630> up<00:05:33.720> and<00:05:33.960> inside<00:05:34.200> you<00:05:34.260> will<00:05:34.590> be<00:05:34.680> able

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
will open up and inside you will be able

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.950 
will open up and inside you will be able
to<00:05:34.890> find<00:05:35.040> a<00:05:35.220> key<00:05:35.520> card<00:05:35.730> so<00:05:36.000> take<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.510> key<00:05:36.720> card
