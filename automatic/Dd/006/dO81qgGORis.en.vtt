first round you know sort of paid off
all<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.600> hard<00:01:36.750> work<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:37.200> been<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> good<00:01:37.530> year

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
all that hard work it's been a good year

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.710 
all that hard work it's been a good year
so<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:37.890> I've<00:01:38.009> had<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> big<00:01:38.880> preseason<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.509> think

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
so if I've had a big preseason I think

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.630 
so if I've had a big preseason I think
we<00:01:39.900> are<00:01:40.049> looking<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.530> good<00:01:40.650> shape<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:41.009> lot<00:01:41.159> lot

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
we are looking in good shape a lot lot

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.880 
we are looking in good shape a lot lot
better<00:01:41.820> than<00:01:42.000> where<00:01:42.119> last<00:01:42.360> year<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.560> things

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
better than where last year and I things

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.039 
better than where last year and I things
going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> big<00:01:44.280> season<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.700> us<00:01:44.990> look<00:01:45.990> I

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
going to be a big season for us look I

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.920 
going to be a big season for us look I
think<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.290> can't<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.560> past<00:01:46.740> uni<00:01:47.360> always<00:01:48.360> have

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
think you can't go past uni always have

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.120 
think you can't go past uni always have
a<00:01:48.960> lot<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.140> depth<00:01:49.350> through<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> club<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.040> then

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
a lot of depth through the club and then

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.980 
a lot of depth through the club and then
again<00:01:50.340> you've<00:01:50.490> got<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.990> traditionally

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
again you've got to be a traditionally

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.289

there's probably eight clubs this year
that<00:02:01.229> are<00:02:01.350> real<00:02:01.530> contenders<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.090> take

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
