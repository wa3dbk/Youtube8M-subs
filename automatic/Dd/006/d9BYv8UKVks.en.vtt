compound object list make sure that the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.220 
compound object list make sure that the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
duration type is set for subtraction n

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.759 
duration type is set for subtraction n
minus<00:02:48.829> B<00:02:49.040> as<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:50.000> object<00:02:50.510> pick<00:02:50.989> route<00:02:51.290> we

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
minus B as the object pick route we

00:02:51.769 --> 00:03:06.449 
minus B as the object pick route we
excluded<00:02:52.250> before

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.869 

so<00:03:07.420> this<00:03:07.659> is<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.930> road<00:03:08.170> now<00:03:09.069> we<00:03:09.129> will<00:03:09.400> add<00:03:09.549> some

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
so this is a road now we will add some

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:19.640 
so this is a road now we will add some
curves<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.810> sides

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:08.940 

let's<00:05:01.150> move<00:05:01.390> it<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:01.960> it'll<00:05:02.140> be<00:05:02.320> done<00:05:07.770> by<00:05:08.770> using

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
let's move it and it'll be done by using

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.340 
let's move it and it'll be done by using
loft<00:05:09.400> it's<00:05:10.060> easy<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.540> add<00:05:10.690> mapping<00:05:11.110> in<00:05:11.260> the

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
loft it's easy to add mapping in the

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.130 
loft it's easy to add mapping in the
future<00:05:11.590> just<00:05:12.460> go<00:05:12.730> to<00:05:12.790> surface<00:05:13.360> parameters<00:05:13.900> and

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
future just go to surface parameters and

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:22.909 
future just go to surface parameters and
check<00:05:15.070> apply<00:05:15.430> mapping

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.100 

notice<00:05:23.919> that<00:05:24.280> by<00:05:24.460> using<00:05:24.669> loft<00:05:25.060> curve<00:05:25.810> is

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
notice that by using loft curve is

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:33.720 
notice that by using loft curve is
straight<00:05:26.500> on<00:05:26.740> every<00:05:27.220> place

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.910 

what<00:05:34.730> can<00:05:34.940> we<00:05:35.060> do<00:05:35.180> now<00:05:35.360> is<00:05:35.630> add<00:05:36.080> some<00:05:36.110> loops<00:05:36.620> and

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
what can we do now is add some loops and

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
what can we do now is add some loops and
make<00:05:36.970> our<00:05:37.970> rope<00:05:38.210> a<00:05:38.420> little<00:05:38.720> concave

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:06:19.050 

you

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.450 

so<00:06:19.750> here<00:06:20.200> it<00:06:20.350> is<00:06:20.470> we<00:06:20.770> have<00:06:20.890> a<00:06:20.980> bumpy<00:06:21.160> terrain

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
so here it is we have a bumpy terrain

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.650 
so here it is we have a bumpy terrain
with<00:06:22.090> nicely<00:06:22.480> pitted<00:06:22.780> road<00:06:24.240> that's<00:06:25.240> all<00:06:25.390> for

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
with nicely pitted road that's all for

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.390 
with nicely pitted road that's all for
