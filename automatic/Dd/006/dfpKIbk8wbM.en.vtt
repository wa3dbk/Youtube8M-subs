of the most responsive and fast and most
stable<00:00:30.210> boards<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.779> I've<00:00:30.929> ever<00:00:31.080> seen<00:00:31.260> capita

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
stable boards that I've ever seen capita

put<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.309> especially<00:00:32.809> from<00:00:33.809> years<00:00:34.050> past<00:00:34.140> like

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
put out especially from years past like

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.220 
put out especially from years past like
this<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.399> most<00:00:35.610> beefy<00:00:36.180> nas<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.750> think<00:00:37.020> that

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
this is the most beefy nas I think that

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.110 
this is the most beefy nas I think that
there<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> now<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.399> designed<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.910> course

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
there is now it's designed of course

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.549 
there is now it's designed of course
like<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.360> said<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:39.750> those<00:00:39.870> big<00:00:40.050> footed<00:00:40.260> riders

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
so if you have a size 11 foot you're

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.400

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
classic camber profile and this is one

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.750 
classic camber profile and this is one
quick<00:01:00.750> deck<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.530> overall<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.670> be

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
quick deck and overall it's going to be

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.219 
quick deck and overall it's going to be
very<00:01:03.059> very<00:01:03.300> stable<00:01:03.629> because<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
very very stable because of the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.100 
very very stable because of the
fluctuating<00:01:04.769> now<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.549> thing<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.930> almost<00:01:06.930> as

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
fluctuating now this thing is almost as

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.740 
fluctuating now this thing is almost as
stiff<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.380> an<00:01:07.830> oak<00:01:08.010> door<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.610> kid<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.150> it's

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
stiff as an oak door I kid you not it's

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.200 
stiff as an oak door I kid you not it's
really<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.439> hard<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:11.220> compress<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.970> lay

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
really really hard to compress and lay

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.240 
really really hard to compress and lay
into<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> turn<00:01:12.810> unless<00:01:13.290> you're<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.770> really

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
into a turn unless you're going really

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340 
into a turn unless you're going really
really<00:01:14.369> fast<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.720> plan<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.020> ride

really fast so if you plan to ride

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.920 
really fast so if you plan to ride
really<00:01:16.890> slow<00:01:17.189> runs<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.909> NAS<00:01:18.119> may<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
really slow runs the NAS may not be the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.960 
really slow runs the NAS may not be the
best<00:01:18.960> choice<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.430> screaming

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
best choice but if you like screaming

best choice but if you like screaming
past<00:01:21.360> everyone<00:01:21.750> running<00:01:22.290> through<00:01:22.530> those<00:01:22.680> slow

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
past everyone running through those slow

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.710 
past everyone running through those slow
signs<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.420> an<00:01:24.509> awesome

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
signs this is going to be an awesome

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.359 
signs this is going to be an awesome
board<00:01:25.110> overall<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> think<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> flex<00:01:26.189> rating

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
board overall I think the flex rating

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.670 
board overall I think the flex rating
honestly<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.299> right<00:01:27.540> around<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:28.080> nine<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
honestly is right around a nine on the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.950 
honestly is right around a nine on the
one<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> 10<00:01:29.250> flex<00:01:29.579> rating<00:01:29.790> scale<00:01:30.180> it's<00:01:30.780> kind

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
one the 10 flex rating scale it's kind

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.770 
one the 10 flex rating scale it's kind
of<00:01:31.079> interesting<00:01:31.409> though<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:31.770> well

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
of interesting though because well

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.890 
of interesting though because well
besides<00:01:33.780> some<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.470> basic<00:01:35.030> glass<00:01:36.030> wood

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
besides some really basic glass wood

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.249 
besides some really basic glass wood
core<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.439> laminates<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.640> kind<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:38.970> wonder<00:01:39.259> why

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
core in laminates you kind of wonder why

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.350 
core in laminates you kind of wonder why
it's<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.650> stiff<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.610> instance<00:01:41.850> there's<00:01:42.299> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it's so stiff for instance there's a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.910 
it's so stiff for instance there's a
reef<00:01:42.600> or<00:01:42.810> sat<00:01:43.020> poplar<00:01:43.350> wood<00:01:43.380> core<00:01:43.740> that's

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.569 
pretty standard in the lot of boards
it's<00:01:45.899> been<00:01:46.110> wrapped<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.619> by<00:01:46.799> ax<00:01:47.009> fiberglass

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it's been wrapped in a by ax fiberglass

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.149 
it's been wrapped in a by ax fiberglass
and<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:47.970> there's<00:01:48.180> carbon<00:01:48.750> fiber<00:01:49.079> beans<00:01:49.470> that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
and then there's carbon fiber beans that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.310 
and then there's carbon fiber beans that
rest<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.060> between<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.479> insert<00:01:51.750> packs<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
rest in between the insert packs and the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.010 
rest in between the insert packs and the
rails<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.770> between<00:01:53.490> each<00:01:53.700> contact<00:01:54.570> point<00:01:54.869> that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
rails in between each contact point that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.330 
rails in between each contact point that
run<00:01:55.229> pretty<00:01:55.439> much<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> whole<00:01:55.740> length<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
run pretty much the whole length of the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.969 
run pretty much the whole length of the
board<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.790> both<00:01:57.119> edges<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:58.619> kind<00:01:58.920> of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
board on both edges so that's kind of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.800 
board on both edges so that's kind of
interesting<00:01:59.250> because<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.149> board<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.479> really

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
interesting because the board is really

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.899 
interesting because the board is really
stiff<00:02:01.079> really<00:02:01.439> stable<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.040> very<00:02:02.070> very<00:02:02.549> quick

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
stiff really stable and very very quick

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.880 
stiff really stable and very very quick
edge<00:02:03.030> edge<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.750> offers<00:02:04.200> lots<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.710> holy

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
edge edge and offers lots of a holy

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830 
edge edge and offers lots of a holy
power<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:06.030> components<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> deck

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
power but the components of the deck

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.749 
power but the components of the deck
seems<00:02:07.200> pretty<00:02:07.409> simple<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.129> have<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.729> feeling

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
seems pretty simple and I have a feeling

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.270 
seems pretty simple and I have a feeling
that's<00:02:09.509> because<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.500> camber<00:02:10.860> profile

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
that's because of the camber profile

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.230 
that's because of the camber profile
overall<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
overall so if you like a

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.910 
overall so if you like a
and<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.630> want<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.900> quick<00:02:14.140> board<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.740> might

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and you want a quick board you might

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.170 
and you want a quick board you might
want<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.190> check<00:02:15.310> out<00:02:15.460> some<00:02:15.610> camber<00:02:15.970> decks

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
want to check out some camber decks
