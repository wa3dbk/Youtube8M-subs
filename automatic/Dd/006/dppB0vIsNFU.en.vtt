Cummins<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:04.230> goes<00:02:04.380> right<00:02:04.590> through<00:02:04.620> here<00:02:05.160> and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
Cummins it goes right through here and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.990 
Cummins it goes right through here and
so<00:02:05.970> we<00:02:06.150> had<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.450> move<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.530> bulb<00:02:07.740> over<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.610> we

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
so we had to move the bulb over so we

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.390 
so we had to move the bulb over so we
went<00:02:09.210> with<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> different<00:02:09.630> grill<00:02:10.250> you'll<00:02:11.250> see

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400

I'm thinking about taking these out and
putting<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.820> spacer<00:04:09.300> in<00:04:09.330> there<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:09.990> I<00:04:10.050> can

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
putting a spacer in there so that I can

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.240 
putting a spacer in there so that I can
still<00:04:10.440> shut<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.740> TV<00:04:15.800> the<00:04:16.800> only<00:04:16.860> thing<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.100> had

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
still shut the TV the only thing I had
