similar to zenmaines you know that's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.700 
similar to zenmaines you know that's
what<00:01:00.539> I'm<00:01:00.629> as<00:01:00.719> me<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.079> course<00:01:01.350> both<00:01:01.530> in

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
what I'm as me because of course both in

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.100 
what I'm as me because of course both in
rank<00:01:02.250> 3<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.760> also<00:01:03.510> kind<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.930> like

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
rank 3 and also kind of this like

prevent<00:01:04.500> destruction<00:01:05.309> thing<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.909> right

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
prevent destruction thing going on right

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.480 
prevent destruction thing going on right
now<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.510> guess<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.500> some<00:01:07.650> ways<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.220> good

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
now I guess in some ways is not as good

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.649 
now I guess in some ways is not as good
as<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.850> may<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.210> know<00:01:09.299> because<00:01:09.450> he<00:01:09.540> also

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
as in may and you know because he also

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.840 
as in may and you know because he also
gets<00:01:09.810> drug<00:01:10.049> cards<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.560> stuff<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.580> still

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
gets drug cards and stuff but I still

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.280 
gets drug cards and stuff but I still
really<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.390> car<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.810> has<00:01:13.020> some

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
really like this car this has some

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.420 
really like this car this has some
potential<00:01:13.560> that's<00:01:14.010> what<00:01:14.100> I'm<00:01:14.189> lying<00:01:14.340> about

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
potential that's what I'm lying about

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.100 
potential that's what I'm lying about
this<00:01:14.549> number<00:01:14.790> hunter<00:01:15.060> set<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.420> far<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.869> see

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
this number hunter set so far I see

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.380 
this number hunter set so far I see
pretty<00:01:16.890> much<00:01:16.979> potential<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.610> all<00:01:17.939> these<00:01:18.180> new

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
pretty much potential in all these new

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.940 
pretty much potential in all these new
cards<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.869> these<00:01:18.990> new<00:01:19.140> exceeds<00:01:19.470> coming<00:01:19.830> out

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
cards all these new exceeds coming out

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.520 
cards all these new exceeds coming out
so<00:01:20.880> yeah<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.840> though<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
so yeah what I like though is that it

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.660 
so yeah what I like though is that it
can<00:01:22.740> protect<00:01:22.950> other<00:01:23.159> monsters<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> can

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
can protect other monsters you can

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.570 
can protect other monsters you can
target<00:01:23.820> itself<00:01:24.299> making<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:25.020> strong

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
target itself making it really strong

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.580 
target itself making it really strong
also<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.820> how<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.479> generic<00:01:28.049> that's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
also like and how it is generic that's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.170 
also like and how it is generic that's
probably<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> best<00:01:29.549> thing<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> mean

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
probably the best thing and what I mean

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.760 
probably the best thing and what I mean
by<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.079> does<00:01:31.229> not<00:01:31.290> require<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
by that is that it does not require a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.530

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
zenmaines but it makes already budget

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.840 
zenmaines but it makes already budget

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
car I think it's pretty awesome I think

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.160 
car I think it's pretty awesome I think
there's<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.820> few<00:01:54.270> strategies<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.869> could<00:01:55.020> use

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
there's a few strategies you could use

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.200 
there's a few strategies you could use
with<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.439> car<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> think<00:01:56.280> maybe<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.670> few<00:01:57.119> people

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
with this car I think maybe a few people

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.910 
with this car I think maybe a few people
that<00:01:57.509> want<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.750> try<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.680> pretty

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that want to try it out it's it's pretty

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.609 
that want to try it out it's it's pretty
cool<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.159> mean<00:01:59.280> any<00:01:59.579> deck<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.030> can<00:02:00.180> also<00:02:00.810> abuse

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.499 
cool I mean any deck that can also abuse
attack<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.189> defense<00:02:02.520> position<00:02:02.670> cards<00:02:03.329> like

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
attack in defense position cards like

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.120 
attack in defense position cards like
you<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.780> at<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> clown<00:02:04.229> control<00:02:04.649> which

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
and I guess you could use it with that

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.990 
and I guess you could use it with that
you<00:02:11.780> know<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.050> don't<00:02:12.140> know<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.680> would<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.670> could

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
you know I don't know it would you could

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.040 
you know I don't know it would you could
come<00:02:14.120> up<00:02:14.180> with<00:02:14.330> some<00:02:14.450> treasures<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:14.780> I'm

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
come up with some treasures that I'm

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.300 
come up with some treasures that I'm
trying<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.319> think<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.500> some<00:02:15.680> cool<00:02:15.890> ideas<00:02:15.980> and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
trying to think of some cool ideas and

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.710 
trying to think of some cool ideas and
there<00:02:16.819> there<00:02:17.120> could<00:02:17.270> be<00:02:17.300> some<00:02:17.510> interesting

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
there there could be some interesting

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.540 
there there could be some interesting
strategies<00:02:18.260> with<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:18.890> yeah<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.220> mean<00:02:19.280> you

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
strategies with that so yeah I mean you

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.240 
strategies with that so yeah I mean you
could<00:02:19.730> do<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.450> see<00:02:21.290> climb<00:02:21.800> control<00:02:22.100> of

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
could do that I see climb control of

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.340 
could do that I see climb control of
being<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.459> little<00:02:22.610> bit<00:02:22.730> more<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.300> fun<00:02:23.959> option

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
being a little bit more of a fun option

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.890 
being a little bit more of a fun option
though<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:24.920> would<00:02:25.040> be<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.880> I'm<00:02:26.360> tempted<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.780> do

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
though it would be and I'm tempted to do

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.430 
though it would be and I'm tempted to do
that<00:02:27.110> now<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:28.850> course<00:02:28.910> we<00:02:29.780> have<00:02:29.959> a<00:02:29.989> chaos

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
that now and of course we have a chaos

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.960 
that now and of course we have a chaos
version<00:02:30.950> because<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.400> gotta<00:02:31.550> have<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.760> cast

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
version because you gotta have the cast

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.550 
version because you gotta have the cast
version<00:02:32.090> all<00:02:32.390> these<00:02:32.510> exceeds<00:02:32.840> which<00:02:33.230> is

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
version all these exceeds which is

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.930 
version all these exceeds which is
pretty<00:02:34.190> awesome<00:02:34.340> let's<00:02:34.970> see<00:02:35.560> CHC<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.940> mech

reason<00:02:41.630> it's<00:02:41.930> hard<00:02:42.080> for<00:02:42.170> me<00:02:42.230> say<00:02:42.380> it's<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.560> got

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
reason it's hard for me say it's I got

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.440 
reason it's hard for me say it's I got
mouthful<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.040> say<00:02:43.160> on<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.459> let's<00:02:44.030> see<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.300> is

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
mouthful to say on that let's see it is

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.490 
mouthful to say on that let's see it is
a<00:02:44.630> rank<00:02:45.530> for<00:02:45.950> dark<00:02:46.670> fairy<00:02:47.510> monster<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.230> has

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
a rank for dark fairy monster it has

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.880 
a rank for dark fairy monster it has
2,600<00:02:49.489> attack<00:02:49.810> 1,600<00:02:50.810> offense<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.620> that's<00:02:51.739> not

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
2,600 attack 1,600 offense so that's not

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.860 
2,600 attack 1,600 offense so that's not
too<00:02:51.950> bad<00:02:52.070> on<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.400> stats<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.760> course<00:02:53.000> it

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
too bad on the stats of course it

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.050 
too bad on the stats of course it
requires<00:02:54.019> three<00:02:54.890> level<00:02:55.250> 4<00:02:55.280> monsters<00:02:55.880> to

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
requires three level 4 monsters to

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.090 
requires three level 4 monsters to
exceed<00:02:56.300> seven<00:02:56.540> into<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.870> but<00:02:57.080> of<00:02:57.170> course<00:02:57.380> this

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
exceed seven into it but of course this

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.850 
exceed seven into it but of course this

we don't know on the exact amount of
damage<00:03:30.260> I'm<00:03:30.440> saying<00:03:30.769> 500<00:03:31.370> damage<00:03:31.489> because

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
damage I'm saying 500 damage because

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.819 
damage I'm saying 500 damage because
that<00:03:31.880> was<00:03:32.030> what<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.299> did<00:03:32.450> in<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.690> anime<00:03:33.110> so<00:03:33.680> I'm

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
that was what it did in the anime so I'm

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.370 
that was what it did in the anime so I'm
gonna<00:03:33.980> assume<00:03:34.790> that<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.570> damage<00:03:35.900> count<00:03:36.260> will

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
gonna assume that the damage count will

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.720 
gonna assume that the damage count will
be<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.530> same<00:03:36.709> but<00:03:36.860> it<00:03:36.980> could<00:03:37.130> be<00:03:37.250> different<00:03:37.430> so

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
be the same but it could be different so

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.819 
be the same but it could be different so
remember<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.420> know<00:03:38.510> keep<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:38.840> on<00:03:38.959> as

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
remember that you know keep that on as

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.800 
remember that you know keep that on as
well<00:03:40.370> you<00:03:40.609> know<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.850> it<00:03:41.060> could<00:03:41.299> change<00:03:41.540> that

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
well you know that it could change that

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.250 
well you know that it could change that
but<00:03:42.530> other<00:03:42.769> than<00:03:42.950> that<00:03:43.040> uh<00:03:43.880> yeah<00:03:44.540> I<00:03:44.840> like<00:03:45.230> this

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
but other than that uh yeah I like this

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.990 
but other than that uh yeah I like this
card<00:03:45.680> it's<00:03:45.890> another<00:03:46.070> one<00:03:46.280> this<00:03:46.700> is<00:03:46.790> one<00:03:46.910> that

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
card it's another one this is one that

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.940 
card it's another one this is one that
few<00:03:47.150> times<00:03:47.359> where<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:47.540> feel<00:03:47.690> like<00:03:47.780> in<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:48.049> way<00:03:48.079> the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
few times where I feel like in a way the

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.789 
few times where I feel like in a way the
original<00:03:49.250> one<00:03:49.670> is<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.420> little<00:03:51.079> bit<00:03:51.170> more<00:03:51.290> useful

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
original one is a little bit more useful

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.650 
original one is a little bit more useful
than<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.340> chaos<00:03:52.579> version<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.329> happen

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
than the chaos version and that happen

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.259 
than the chaos version and that happen
very<00:03:53.780> often<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:54.620> like<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.549> how<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.790> can<00:03:56.030> change

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
very often I like the how you can change

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.930 
very often I like the how you can change
the<00:03:56.480> position<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.739> fence<00:03:57.950> monsters<00:03:58.459> you

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
the position of the fence monsters you

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.800 
the position of the fence monsters you
know<00:03:59.030> it's<00:03:59.120> likely<00:03:59.329> come<00:03:59.450> in<00:03:59.510> handy<00:03:59.630> if<00:03:59.750> you're

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810

very<00:04:34.480> good<00:04:34.690> unfortunate<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:36.640> yeah<00:04:36.790> tell<00:04:37.210> me

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
very good unfortunate so yeah tell me

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.430 
very good unfortunate so yeah tell me
what<00:04:37.420> you<00:04:37.540> guys<00:04:37.690> think<00:04:37.750> about<00:04:38.020> both<00:04:38.260> these

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
what you guys think about both these

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.590 
what you guys think about both these
cards<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:39.010> really<00:04:39.610> do<00:04:39.730> think<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:40.180> the

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
cards I really do think that the

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.810 
cards I really do think that the
original<00:04:40.840> version<00:04:41.200> of<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:41.620> is<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.430> pretty<00:04:42.640> cool

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
original version of it is a pretty cool

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.700 
original version of it is a pretty cool
card<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.210> will<00:04:43.420> actually<00:04:43.630> see<00:04:43.930> play<00:04:44.170> the

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
card that will actually see play the

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.210 
card that will actually see play the
chaos<00:04:45.990> unfortunately<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.260> like<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.890> chaos

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
chaos unfortunately I like the chaos

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.520 
chaos unfortunately I like the chaos
version<00:04:48.760> I'd<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.510> idea<00:04:49.810> about<00:04:49.930> it<00:04:50.170> how<00:04:50.290> you'd

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
version I'd the idea about it how you'd

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.520 
version I'd the idea about it how you'd
be<00:04:50.620> harder<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.860> stall<00:04:51.280> against<00:04:51.700> it<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.530> how

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
be harder to stall against it and how

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.720 
be harder to stall against it and how
you<00:04:53.560> can<00:04:53.800> even<00:04:53.920> if<00:04:54.100> like<00:04:54.280> damage<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.670> your

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
you can even if like damage to your

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.250 
you can even if like damage to your
opponent<00:04:54.790> when<00:04:55.330> if<00:04:55.420> you<00:04:55.510> detach<00:04:55.900> II<00:04:55.930> seen
