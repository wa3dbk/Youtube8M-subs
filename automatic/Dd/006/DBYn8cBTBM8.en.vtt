front doesn't look that different from

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.320 
front doesn't look that different from
its<00:01:15.840> predecessor<00:01:16.740> except<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.759> has<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> much

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
its predecessor except it has a much

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.170 
its predecessor except it has a much
nicer<00:01:18.600> navigation<00:01:19.500> pad<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.490> completely

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
nicer navigation pad and a completely

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.539 
nicer navigation pad and a completely
different<00:01:21.600> keyboard<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.259> guess<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.130> means<00:01:23.280> it

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
different keyboard I guess that means it

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.460 
different keyboard I guess that means it
does<00:01:23.729> look<00:01:23.970> different<00:01:24.150> than<00:01:24.540> its<00:01:24.750> predecessor

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
does look different than its predecessor

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.160 
does look different than its predecessor
huh<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.520> new<00:01:26.759> keyboard<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.420> much<00:01:27.810> better

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
than the first one in fact even though

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.230 
than the first one in fact even though
we've<00:01:31.380> only<00:01:31.680> been<00:01:31.979> using<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.610> phone<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.210> a

of interesting changes one of which it

the upper web browser that's kind of

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.949 
the upper web browser that's kind of
confusing<00:03:22.409> because<00:03:23.189> this<00:03:23.939> actually<00:03:24.150> has<00:03:24.629> two

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
confusing because this actually has two

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.670 
confusing because this actually has two
sets<00:03:25.259> of<00:03:25.439> menus<00:03:25.859> one<00:03:26.579> under<00:03:26.909> action<00:03:27.449> and<00:03:27.689> 100

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
does one thing it doesn't open up a menu

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.399 
does one thing it doesn't open up a menu
we<00:03:41.669> thought<00:03:41.939> that<00:03:41.970> since<00:03:42.419> this<00:03:42.720> features<00:03:43.169> both

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
we thought that since this features both

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.439 
we thought that since this features both
the<00:03:43.590> upper<00:03:43.680> browser<00:03:44.099> and<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:45.000> Internet

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
the upper browser and the Internet

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.390 
the upper browser and the Internet
Explorer<00:03:45.870> browser<00:03:46.049> that<00:03:46.829> we<00:03:47.009> could<00:03:47.189> do<00:03:47.370> a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
Explorer browser that we could do a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.210 
Explorer browser that we could do a
speed<00:03:47.849> test<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.449> a<00:03:48.540> render<00:03:48.870> test<00:03:49.139> on<00:03:49.349> them<00:03:49.560> so

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
speed test and a render test on them so

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.939 
speed test and a render test on them so
why<00:03:51.060> don't<00:03:51.269> we<00:03:51.329> go<00:03:51.569> to<00:03:51.629> phone<00:03:51.959> scoop<00:03:52.379> on<00:03:52.590> each

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
why don't we go to phone scoop on each

00:03:52.949 --> 00:04:09.350 
why don't we go to phone scoop on each
and<00:03:53.250> see<00:03:53.459> how<00:03:53.609> it<00:03:53.759> works

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.650 

so<00:04:09.930> far<00:04:10.230> in<00:04:10.530> my<00:04:10.800> own<00:04:10.950> personal<00:04:11.190> test<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.940> found

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
so far in my own personal test I found

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.450 
so far in my own personal test I found
the<00:04:12.870> Opera<00:04:13.320> browser<00:04:13.440> to<00:04:13.920> be<00:04:14.070> a<00:04:14.100> little<00:04:14.340> bit

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
the Opera browser to be a little bit

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.630 
the Opera browser to be a little bit
faster<00:04:15.180> but<00:04:16.049> we'll<00:04:16.350> see<00:04:16.620> how<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:17.010> works<00:04:17.250> for

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
faster but we'll see how this works for

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:30.080 
faster but we'll see how this works for
everybody<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.820> we're<00:04:26.820> loading<00:04:28.760> or<00:04:29.760> getting

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
everybody so we're loading or getting

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:37.490 
everybody so we're loading or getting
close<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:34.730> there<00:04:35.730> we<00:04:35.880> have<00:04:35.910> it<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.510> now<00:04:37.440> we

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
close and there we have it and now we

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.190 
close and there we have it and now we
can<00:04:37.830> scroll<00:04:38.160> through<00:04:38.220> phonescoop<00:04:39.000> it's<00:04:39.480> in<00:04:40.080> a

can scroll through phonescoop it's in a

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.520 
can scroll through phonescoop it's in a
single<00:04:40.590> column<00:04:40.950> mode<00:04:40.980> as<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.550> can<00:04:41.730> see<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:45.530> on

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
single column mode as you can see and on

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.100 
single column mode as you can see and on
both<00:04:47.430> versions<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:49.710> allows<00:04:50.610> us<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.270> change<00:04:51.870> how

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
I don't believe that we've been to

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.659 
I don't believe that we've been to
phonescoop<00:05:30.000> yet<00:05:30.390> on<00:05:30.570> this<00:05:30.990> phone<00:05:31.680> so<00:05:32.580> let's

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
phonescoop yet on this phone so let's

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:59.330 
phonescoop yet on this phone so let's
give<00:05:35.669> this<00:05:35.970> a<00:05:36.030> shot

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.240 

as<00:05:59.400> you<00:06:00.060> can<00:06:00.240> see<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.870> seems<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:01.710> take<00:06:01.889> a<00:06:01.949> little

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
as you can see it seems to take a little

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.340 
as you can see it seems to take a little
bit<00:06:02.430> longer<00:06:02.760> to<00:06:03.120> load<00:06:03.270> an<00:06:03.510> internet<00:06:04.020> explorer

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
bit longer to load an internet explorer

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.689 
bit longer to load an internet explorer
so<00:06:07.350> far<00:06:07.620> we<00:06:07.770> haven't<00:06:07.979> gotten<00:06:08.280> very<00:06:08.430> far<00:06:08.699> Oh

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
so far we haven't gotten very far Oh

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.550 
so far we haven't gotten very far Oh
actually<00:06:11.699> I<00:06:12.270> believe<00:06:12.630> I<00:06:12.750> was<00:06:12.900> just<00:06:13.199> proven

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
actually I believe I was just proven

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.159 
actually I believe I was just proven
wrong<00:06:13.740> it<00:06:14.070> looks<00:06:14.729> like<00:06:14.820> this<00:06:15.270> loaded<00:06:15.690> faster

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
wrong it looks like this loaded faster

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:17.960 
wrong it looks like this loaded faster
and<00:06:16.320> Internet<00:06:16.800> Explorer<00:06:17.310> than<00:06:17.580> it<00:06:17.729> did<00:06:17.910> in

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
and Internet Explorer than it did in

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.050 
and Internet Explorer than it did in
Opera<00:06:18.570> and<00:06:18.800> we've<00:06:19.800> got<00:06:20.040> the<00:06:20.220> same<00:06:20.460> thing<00:06:20.699> here

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
Opera and we've got the same thing here

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.850 
Opera and we've got the same thing here

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
where we're set to single column mode

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.520 
where we're set to single column mode
but<00:06:23.729> if<00:06:23.880> we<00:06:24.060> want<00:06:24.300> we<00:06:26.000> can<00:06:27.000> go<00:06:27.150> into<00:06:27.540> a<00:06:27.900> desktop

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
but if we want we can go into a desktop

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.070 
but if we want we can go into a desktop
view<00:06:28.800> that<00:06:29.520> lets<00:06:29.790> us<00:06:30.000> scroll<00:06:30.330> left<00:06:30.600> and<00:06:30.810> right
