00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
and this is the touch magic learning bus

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.490 
and this is the touch magic learning bus
from<00:00:10.620> leapfrog<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.969> touch<00:00:12.210> magic<00:00:12.690> line<00:00:12.930> uses

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
from leapfrog the touch magic line uses

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.290 
from leapfrog the touch magic line uses
touch<00:00:13.800> technology<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.060> toy

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
touch technology so that the toy

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.170 
touch technology so that the toy
recognizes<00:00:16.110> every<00:00:16.380> tap<00:00:16.650> touch<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.400> swipe<00:00:17.760> and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
recognizes every tap touch and swipe and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.600 
recognizes every tap touch and swipe and
it<00:00:18.540> really<00:00:18.750> brings<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.290> toy<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.710> life<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
it really brings the toy to life the

mode you touch a letter you'll hear the
name<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.519> letter<00:00:38.699> the<00:00:38.820> sound<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.359> makes<00:00:39.539> an

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
name of the letter the sound it makes an

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.389 
name of the letter the sound it makes an
object<00:00:40.199> that<00:00:40.289> starts<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.859> letter<00:00:40.980> as

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
object that starts with that letter as

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.069 
object that starts with that letter as
well<00:00:41.430> as<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> fun<00:00:42.030> sound<00:00:42.269> effect<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.840> let's<00:00:42.960> see

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
well as a fun sound effect so let's see

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.770 
well as a fun sound effect so let's see
what<00:00:43.199> we<00:00:43.289> could<00:00:43.440> do<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:44.160> thee<00:00:47.300> now<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.480> game

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
what we could do with thee now in game

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.200 
what we could do with thee now in game
mode<00:00:49.160> it's<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> ask<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> question

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
mode it's going to ask you a question

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.840 
mode it's going to ask you a question
and<00:00:51.600> then<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.230> use<00:00:52.640> sounds<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
and then you have to use sounds and the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.610 
and then you have to use sounds and the
objects<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.390> letters<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.870> find<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> answer

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
objects and letters to find the answer

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.619 
objects and letters to find the answer
so<00:00:55.859> let's<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:57.059> question<00:00:57.480> we'll

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
so let's see what what question we'll

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.169 
so let's see what what question we'll
get<00:00:57.780> okay<00:00:59.179> the<00:01:00.179> picture<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.929> makes<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.559> sound

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
get okay the picture that makes it sound

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.280 
get okay the picture that makes it sound
cool<00:01:03.179> so<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.719> find<00:01:03.839> a<00:01:03.929> picture<00:01:04.080> that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
cool so I have to find a picture that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.649 
cool so I have to find a picture that
makes<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.800> sound<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.280> sounds<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> siren

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
makes that sound it sounds like a siren

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.670 
makes that sound it sounds like a siren
I'm<00:01:06.840> gonna<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.230> with<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.860> firetruck<00:01:08.370> I<00:01:09.560> think<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
I'm gonna go with a firetruck I think I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.480 
I'm gonna go with a firetruck I think I
got<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.040> right

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
got it right

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.120 
got it right
so<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.150> music<00:01:12.630> mode<00:01:12.840> that's<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.590> last<00:01:13.800> mode

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
