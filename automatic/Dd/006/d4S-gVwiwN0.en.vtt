now this doesn't work with the cubby you
to<00:02:49.350> distribution<00:02:50.100> because<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.670> tried<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.060> out

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
to distribution because I tried it out

with<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.990> definitely<00:02:52.620> know<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:53.010> sure

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
with that I definitely know for sure

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.570 
with that I definitely know for sure
that<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.670> works<00:02:54.420> with<00:02:54.660> with<00:02:55.020> cub<00:02:55.230> Ian<00:02:55.410> now<00:02:56.370> for

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
that it works with with cub Ian now for

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.670 
that it works with with cub Ian now for
the<00:02:56.670> for<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.910> minuses<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.990> board<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.440> that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
the for the minuses of the board is that

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.550 
the for the minuses of the board is that
going<00:02:59.220> back<00:02:59.550> to<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.880> USB<00:03:03.870> receiver<00:03:04.050> is

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
going back to the the USB receiver is

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.640 
going back to the the USB receiver is
that<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.250> not<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.640> bluetooth<00:03:06.650> adapter

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
that this is not a bluetooth adapter

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.160 
that this is not a bluetooth adapter
it's<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.860> special<00:03:08.430> USB<00:03:09.150> receiver<00:03:09.450> that's<00:03:09.840> meant

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
only for logitech keyboard so if I'm

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.930 
only for logitech keyboard so if I'm
thinking<00:03:12.960> about<00:03:13.190> using<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.490> with<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> cubby

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
thinking about using this with the cubby

won't work without this adapter plugged

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.090 
won't work without this adapter plugged
in<00:03:25.160> another<00:03:26.160> minus<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.820> that<00:03:27.830> compared<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:29.010> my

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
in another minus is that compared to my

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.770 
in another minus is that compared to my
regular<00:03:29.430> desktop<00:03:29.670> keyboard<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:32.640> k400<00:03:33.360> is

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
regular desktop keyboard the k400 is

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.650 
regular desktop keyboard the k400 is
significantly<00:03:34.530> smaller<00:03:35.209> it's<00:03:36.209> like<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.450> keys

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
significantly smaller it's like the keys

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.480 
significantly smaller it's like the keys
are<00:03:36.810> smaller<00:03:37.200> they're<00:03:37.500> closer<00:03:37.770> together<00:03:38.040> and

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
are smaller they're closer together and

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.400 
are smaller they're closer together and
so<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:38.940> don't<00:03:39.150> have<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.570> spacious<00:03:40.200> keyboard

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
so I don't have that spacious keyboard

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.190 
so I don't have that spacious keyboard
the<00:03:41.310> size<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.030> space<00:03:42.360> bar<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.810> also

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
the size of the space bar is also

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.310 
the size of the space bar is also
reduced<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.660> also<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.690> have<00:03:45.870> this<00:03:46.020> extra

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
reduced and also I have this extra

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.440 
reduced and also I have this extra
function<00:03:46.860> key<00:03:47.040> which<00:03:47.310> makes<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.910> space<00:03:48.060> board

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
function key which makes the space board

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.260 
function key which makes the space board
and<00:03:48.810> smaller<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.500> I'm<00:03:50.040> not<00:03:50.430> really<00:03:50.640> fond<00:03:51.060> of

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
and smaller so I I'm not really fond of

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.110 
and smaller so I I'm not really fond of
the<00:03:51.630> keyboard<00:03:52.080> size<00:03:52.620> compared<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.220> my<00:03:53.430> regular

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
the keyboard size compared to my regular

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.710 
the keyboard size compared to my regular
desktop<00:03:54.500> keyboard<00:03:58.850> now<00:03:59.850> this<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.060> not<00:04:00.330> from

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
desktop keyboard now this is not from

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.449 
desktop keyboard now this is not from
the<00:04:00.900> experience<00:04:01.320> of<00:04:01.380> using<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.920> cubby<00:04:02.160> board

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
the experience of using the cubby board

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.280 
the experience of using the cubby board
to<00:04:02.640> but<00:04:02.880> using<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.209> different<00:04:03.540> device<00:04:03.750> but<00:04:04.080> if

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
to but using a different device but if

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.270 
to but using a different device but if
this<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.390> far<00:04:06.390> enough<00:04:06.630> away<00:04:06.810> from<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.800> USB

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
this is a far enough away from the USB

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.229 
this is a far enough away from the USB
dongle<00:04:09.020> it<00:04:10.020> will<00:04:10.170> have<00:04:10.320> problems<00:04:11.000> picking<00:04:12.000> up

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
dongle it will have problems picking up

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.630 
dongle it will have problems picking up
keyboard<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:13.020> mouse<00:04:13.170> movements<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.130> what<00:04:14.610> I

keyboard and mouse movements and what I

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.190 
keyboard and mouse movements and what I
have<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.940> find<00:04:15.120> like<00:04:15.570> for<00:04:15.750> example<00:04:15.780> if<00:04:16.109> you

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
have to find like for example if you

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.289 
have to find like for example if you
have<00:04:16.380> this<00:04:16.500> on<00:04:16.680> your<00:04:16.799> lap<00:04:16.980> I'd<00:04:17.280> have<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.120> find

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
have this on your lap I'd have to find

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.779 
have this on your lap I'd have to find
that<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.450> have<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.930> kind<00:04:19.080> of<00:04:19.169> angle<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.650> up<00:04:19.830> so<00:04:20.760> I

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
that I have to kind of angle it up so I

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.770 
that I have to kind of angle it up so I
I'm<00:04:21.660> assuming<00:04:22.410> that<00:04:22.560> there's<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:23.100> a<00:04:23.780> receiver

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
I'm assuming that there's a a receiver

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.330 
I'm assuming that there's a a receiver
built<00:04:25.530> in<00:04:25.800> on<00:04:26.039> the

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
built in on the

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.820 
built in on the
side<00:04:26.580> here<00:04:26.940> so<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:27.780> have<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.260> actually<00:04:28.440> pick

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
side here so I have to actually pick

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.360 
side here so I have to actually pick
this<00:04:29.040> up<00:04:29.220> off<00:04:29.520> my<00:04:29.970> lap<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:31.710> it<00:04:32.040> would<00:04:32.190> actually

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
this up off my lap so it would actually

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.480 
this up off my lap so it would actually
recognize<00:04:33.030> mouse<00:04:33.300> movements<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.190> I<00:04:35.190> also

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
recognize mouse movements and I also

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.920 
recognize mouse movements and I also
think<00:04:35.790> that's<00:04:36.030> also<00:04:36.300> true<00:04:36.449> for<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.660> keyboard

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
think that's also true for the keyboard

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.360 
think that's also true for the keyboard
but<00:04:37.050> it's<00:04:37.290> harder<00:04:37.650> for<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.860> keyboard<00:04:38.010> with

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
but it's harder for the keyboard with

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.000 
but it's harder for the keyboard with
you<00:04:38.490> camp<00:04:38.790> lifting<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:39.330> up<00:04:39.449> and<00:04:39.889> trying<00:04:40.889> to

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
you camp lifting it up and trying to

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.500 
you camp lifting it up and trying to
type<00:04:41.190> on<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.400> it's<00:04:41.820> easier<00:04:42.120> with<00:04:42.240> it<00:04:42.389> without

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
type on it it's easier with it without

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.290 
type on it it's easier with it without
using<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.169> mouse<00:04:46.430> so<00:04:47.430> you<00:04:47.550> can<00:04:47.940> pick<00:04:48.060> this<00:04:48.240> up

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
using the mouse so you can pick this up

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.930 
using the mouse so you can pick this up
for<00:04:48.750> about<00:04:49.050> thirty<00:04:49.530> dollars<00:04:49.949> at<00:04:50.280> retail
