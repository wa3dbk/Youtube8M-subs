and what I've got for you is a single
point<00:00:38.430> between<00:00:39.080> deaths<00:00:40.550> Istomin<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
point between deaths Istomin and the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.260 
point between deaths Istomin and the
great<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.440> Roger<00:00:43.800> Federer<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.580> you<00:00:45.150> know

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
great one Roger Federer and you know

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.119 
great one Roger Federer and you know
what<00:00:45.449> we're<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> talk<00:00:45.989> about<00:00:46.290> in<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.770> point

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
what we're to talk about in this point

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.720 
what we're to talk about in this point
is<00:00:47.400> how<00:00:48.059> Federer<00:00:49.040> shows<00:00:50.040> us<00:00:50.519> really<00:00:51.510> how<00:00:51.750> to

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
is how Federer shows us really how to

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.360 
is how Federer shows us really how to
maximize<00:00:53.839> topspin<00:00:54.839> on<00:00:54.900> the<00:00:55.110> four<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.800> think

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
maximize topspin on the four in I think

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.950 
maximize topspin on the four in I think
too<00:00:56.550> often<00:00:56.790> what<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.420> about<00:00:57.659> with

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
too often what we think about with

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.740 
too often what we think about with
topspin<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.420> kind

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
topspin is just it's just you know kind

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.820 
topspin is just it's just you know kind
of<00:01:00.809> brute<00:01:01.260> raw<00:01:01.589> strength<00:01:02.100> spin<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.409> opposed<00:01:04.409> to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
of brute raw strength spin as opposed to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.149 
of brute raw strength spin as opposed to
the<00:01:05.339> shape<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.360> shot<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.260> want<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the shape of the shot that we want the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.030 
the shape of the shot that we want the
trajectory<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:09.090> take<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.770> rather

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
trajectory to take and you know rather

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.940 
trajectory to take and you know rather
than<00:01:11.190> thinking<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:12.290> topspin<00:01:13.290> as<00:01:13.500> being<00:01:13.740> sort

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
than thinking of topspin as being sort

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.070 
than thinking of topspin as being sort
of<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.070> drive<00:01:14.460> what<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> want<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> think

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
of a drive what I want you to think

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.440 
of a drive what I want you to think
about<00:01:16.260> here<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.920> how<00:01:17.280> could<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.729> go<00:01:17.880> over<00:01:17.909> here

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
about here is how could you go over here

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.620 
about here is how could you go over here
like<00:01:18.630> Federer<00:01:19.020> does<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.830> shot<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.630> use

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
like Federer does on this shot and use

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.250 
like Federer does on this shot and use
your<00:01:21.960> forehand<00:01:22.680> topspin<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.720> try<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> create

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
your forehand topspin to try to create

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.109 
your forehand topspin to try to create
some<00:01:25.530> shape<00:01:25.799> or<00:01:26.040> its<00:01:26.219> it<00:01:26.340> i<00:01:26.490> wouldn't<00:01:26.969> call

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
some shape or its it i wouldn't call

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.840 
some shape or its it i wouldn't call
it's<00:01:27.359> not<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.539> lob<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> flat<00:01:29.490> Drive

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
it's not a lob it's not a flat Drive

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.170 
it's not a lob it's not a flat Drive
with<00:01:30.659> topspin<00:01:31.369> but<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.490> more<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.909> roller

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
with topspin but it's more of a roller

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.590 
with topspin but it's more of a roller
and<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.780> roller<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.469> kind<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.039> probe<00:01:35.460> back<00:01:36.299> in

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and the roller is kind of probe back in

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.810 
and the roller is kind of probe back in
this<00:01:36.780> area<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.469> for<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.039> rest<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.429> us<00:01:38.579> it's

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
this area and for the rest of us it's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.209 
this area and for the rest of us it's
more<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.359> know<00:01:39.390> let's<00:01:39.719> probe<00:01:40.140> into<00:01:40.619> an

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
more you know let's probe into an

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.789 
more you know let's probe into an
opponent's<00:01:41.759> backhand<00:01:42.420> with<00:01:43.109> a<00:01:43.140> ball<00:01:43.500> that

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
opponent's backhand with a ball that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.219 
opponent's backhand with a ball that
really<00:01:44.070> travels<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.359> a<00:01:45.390> nice<00:01:45.840> height

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
really travels you know a nice height

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.830 
really travels you know a nice height
over<00:01:46.679> the<00:01:46.829> top<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> net<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.509> lands

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
over the top of the net and that lands

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.980 
over the top of the net and that lands
deep<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.979> what<00:01:50.280> their<00:01:50.549> reaction<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.359> or

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
deep and see what their reaction is or

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.510 
deep and see what their reaction is or
to<00:01:52.109> see<00:01:52.259> two<00:01:52.469> of<00:01:52.649> them<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.890> point<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.429> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to see two of them at this point and the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.450 
to see two of them at this point and the
first<00:01:53.789> one<00:01:54.030> Roger<00:01:54.810> gets<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.380> ball<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.249> we

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
first one Roger gets the ball up and we

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.749 
first one Roger gets the ball up and we
can<00:01:56.609> see<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.030> dive<00:01:57.570> down<00:01:57.960> now<00:01:58.799> lands<00:01:59.189> literally

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
can see it dive down now lands literally

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.969 
can see it dive down now lands literally
halfway<00:02:00.030> here<00:02:00.689> between<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.259> service<00:02:01.619> line<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
halfway here between the service line of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.910 
halfway here between the service line of
the<00:02:02.039> baseline<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.600> ends<00:02:03.929> up<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.799> know

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the baseline but it ends up you know

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.330 
the baseline but it ends up you know
getting<00:02:05.280> up<00:02:05.899> on<00:02:06.899> instrument<00:02:07.679> who<00:02:07.859> you<00:02:08.250> know

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
getting up on instrument who you know

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040 
getting up on instrument who you know
has<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.789> play<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.149> up<00:02:09.270> pretty<00:02:09.509> high<00:02:09.630> back

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
has to play it up pretty high back

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.320 
has to play it up pretty high back
shoulder<00:02:10.440> high<00:02:10.590> from<00:02:10.860> back<00:02:11.039> there<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.940> point

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
shoulder high from back there the point

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.290 
shoulder high from back there the point
develops<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.560> what<00:02:14.430> we're<00:02:14.610> seeing<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.030> one

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
develops and what we're seeing is one

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.170 
develops and what we're seeing is one
more<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.780> these<00:02:15.930> off<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.310> shot<00:02:17.610> coming<00:02:17.940> in

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
more of these off of this shot coming in

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.660 
more of these off of this shot coming in
right<00:02:18.360> here<00:02:18.870> where<00:02:19.380> Roger<00:02:19.590> gets<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.160> ball<00:02:20.340> and

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
right here where Roger gets a ball and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.180 
right here where Roger gets a ball and
he<00:02:20.700> does<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.150> same<00:02:21.360> thing<00:02:21.690> rather<00:02:22.500> than<00:02:22.710> think

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
he does the same thing rather than think

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.490 
he does the same thing rather than think
I'm<00:02:23.370> going<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.610> drive<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.330> up<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.870> line<00:02:25.050> for<00:02:25.440> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
I'm going to drive it up the line for a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.500 
I'm going to drive it up the line for a
winner<00:02:25.740> he<00:02:26.460> takes<00:02:26.790> us<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.240> rolls<00:02:27.660> rolls<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.770> up

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
winner he takes us in rolls rolls it up

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.289 
winner he takes us in rolls rolls it up
high<00:02:30.510> over<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.930> net<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.730> now<00:02:32.730> he's<00:02:33.030> going<00:02:33.209> to

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
high over the net and now he's going to

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.400 
high over the net and now he's going to
react<00:02:33.720> Rogers<00:02:34.260> going<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.530> sort<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.799> Adam

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.100 
high over the net lands to our opponents
backhand<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.580> then<00:03:13.030> really<00:03:13.450> see<00:03:13.690> how<00:03:13.870> they

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
backhand and then really see how they

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.890 
backhand and then really see how they
react<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.860> terms<00:03:15.490> of<00:03:15.790> if<00:03:15.940> they<00:03:16.120> step<00:03:16.360> backwards

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
react in terms of if they step backwards

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.770
