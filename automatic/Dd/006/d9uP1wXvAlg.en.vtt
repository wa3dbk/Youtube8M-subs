okay so we've gone through and we've hit

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.159 
okay so we've gone through and we've hit
the<00:05:34.370> one<00:05:34.580> a<00:05:34.610> few<00:05:34.850> points<00:05:35.300> I'm<00:05:35.720> now<00:05:35.960> going<00:05:36.110> to

the one a few points I'm now going to

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.560 
the one a few points I'm now going to

just going to gather dirt and grime and

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.080 
just going to gather dirt and grime and
actually<00:06:38.260> increase<00:06:38.650> the<00:06:39.070> wear<00:06:39.250> when<00:06:40.000> you

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
actually increase the wear when you

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.000 
actually increase the wear when you
drive<00:06:40.300> through<00:06:40.570> it<00:06:40.630> so<00:06:41.380> make<00:06:41.560> sure<00:06:41.590> to<00:06:41.860> go<00:06:41.980> back

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
drive through it so make sure to go back
