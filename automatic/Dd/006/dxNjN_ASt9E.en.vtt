carbs<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.420> 30%<00:02:15.930> protein<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> good<00:02:16.860> idea<00:02:17.129> but

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
and maybe think about things in a little

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.900 
and maybe think about things in a little
bit<00:02:26.160> different<00:02:26.430> way<00:02:26.550> that's<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.150> good<00:02:27.330> idea<00:02:27.420> as

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
bit different way that's a good idea as

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.970 
bit different way that's a good idea as
we<00:02:29.910> moved<00:02:30.090> over<00:02:30.540> from<00:02:30.569> Romanian<00:02:31.500> deadlifts

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
we moved over from Romanian deadlifts

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.470 
we moved over from Romanian deadlifts
over<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.370> front<00:02:33.060> loaded<00:02:33.450> reverse<00:02:33.780> lunges<00:02:34.319> and

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
over to front loaded reverse lunges and

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.430 
over to front loaded reverse lunges and
you<00:02:36.480> see<00:02:36.720> I'm<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.930> little<00:02:37.200> bit<00:02:37.290> off-balance

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
you see I'm a little bit off-balance

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.870 
you see I'm a little bit off-balance
here<00:02:37.980> that's<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.400> reasons<00:02:38.640> why<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.790> do

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
here that's one of the reasons why I do

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.430 
here that's one of the reasons why I do
these<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.330> because<00:02:39.540> I'm<00:02:39.810> trying<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.080> work<00:02:40.230> on

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
these is because I'm trying to work on

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.120 
these is because I'm trying to work on
my<00:02:40.530> balance<00:02:41.120> but<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:43.200> know<00:02:43.290> there's<00:02:43.709> my<00:02:43.890> last

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
my balance but you know there's my last

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.180 
my balance but you know there's my last
set<00:02:44.370> here<00:02:44.580> after<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> long<00:02:44.940> day<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.420> squats<00:02:45.690> and

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
set here after a long day of squats and

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.589 
set here after a long day of squats and
trying<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.250> build<00:02:47.370> up<00:02:47.489> my<00:02:47.670> core<00:02:47.940> strength<00:02:48.060> with

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
trying to build up my core strength with

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.320 
trying to build up my core strength with
that<00:02:48.780> front<00:02:49.110> rack<00:02:49.349> position<00:02:49.590> what<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.519> think<00:02:51.030> is

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
that front rack position what I think is

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.140 
that front rack position what I think is
best<00:02:52.319> way<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.800> build<00:02:53.310> up<00:02:53.489> your<00:02:53.610> strength<00:02:53.760> for

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
best way to build up your strength for

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.759 
best way to build up your strength for
anything<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:55.050> work<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.410> front<00:02:55.620> rack

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
anything is to work the front rack

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.490 
anything is to work the front rack
position<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.459> any<00:02:56.580> lifts<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.269> these<00:02:58.170> reverse

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
position in any lifts and these reverse

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500 
position in any lifts and these reverse
lunges<00:02:58.860> are<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.069> good<00:02:59.280> way<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.459> do<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.850> another

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
lunges are a good way to do that another

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.000 
lunges are a good way to do that another
