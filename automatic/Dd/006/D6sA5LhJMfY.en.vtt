fish<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:49.020> the<00:03:49.050> new<00:03:49.260> era<00:03:49.470> makes<00:03:49.830> it<00:03:49.980> feel<00:03:50.250> like

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
fish of the new era makes it feel like

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.210 
fish of the new era makes it feel like
the<00:03:50.730> supernovas<00:03:51.660> are<00:03:51.810> all<00:03:52.050> at<00:03:52.350> some<00:03:52.710> level<00:03:53.040> on

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
the supernovas are all at some level on

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.370 
the supernovas are all at some level on
the<00:03:53.400> same<00:03:53.610> team<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.210> few<00:03:54.450> chapters<00:03:54.720> ago<00:03:54.990> felt

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
the same team a few chapters ago felt

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.990 
the same team a few chapters ago felt
like<00:03:55.530> trafalgar<00:03:56.010> law<00:03:56.040> was<00:03:56.280> just<00:03:56.310> using<00:03:56.760> the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
like trafalgar law was just using the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.240 
like trafalgar law was just using the
straw<00:03:57.270> hats<00:03:57.510> as<00:03:57.660> pawns<00:03:57.960> and<00:03:58.260> nothing<00:03:58.890> more<00:03:59.070> and

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
straw hats as pawns and nothing more and

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.800 
straw hats as pawns and nothing more and
the<00:03:59.370> Alliance<00:03:59.820> might<00:04:00.030> not<00:04:00.240> even<00:04:00.480> really

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
the Alliance might not even really

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.020 
the Alliance might not even really
happen<00:04:01.410> but<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.770> shafter<00:04:02.250> was<00:04:02.370> reassuring<00:04:02.820> it

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
happen but the shafter was reassuring it

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.370 
happen but the shafter was reassuring it
makes<00:04:03.180> me<00:04:03.300> feel<00:04:03.510> like<00:04:03.540> law<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.050> luffy<00:04:04.140> are

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
makes me feel like law and luffy are

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.990 
makes me feel like law and luffy are
