to change an inner tube easily and

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.080 
to change an inner tube easily and
quickly<00:00:20.650> before<00:00:21.650> we<00:00:21.890> get<00:00:21.980> started<00:00:22.130> let's<00:00:22.880> make

quickly before we get started let's make

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.190 
quickly before we get started let's make
sure<00:00:23.119> you<00:00:23.300> have<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.599> right<00:00:23.630> tools<00:00:23.990> for<00:00:24.080> the

sure you have the right tools for the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.650 
sure you have the right tools for the
job<00:00:24.400> you<00:00:25.400> will<00:00:25.550> need<00:00:25.700> some<00:00:25.910> Thai<00:00:26.119> levers<00:00:26.509> a

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
job you will need some Thai levers a

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.069 
job you will need some Thai levers a
pump<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:27.320> a<00:00:27.710> new<00:00:27.860> inner<00:00:28.099> tube<00:00:28.779> when<00:00:29.779> doing

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
pump and a new inner tube when doing

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.479 
pump and a new inner tube when doing
something<00:00:30.380> like<00:00:30.500> this<00:00:30.680> it's<00:00:30.980> always<00:00:31.220> a<00:00:31.310> good

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
something like this it's always a good

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.370 
something like this it's always a good
idea<00:00:31.550> to<00:00:31.880> wear<00:00:32.090> protective<00:00:32.419> clothing<00:00:32.599> like

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
idea to wear protective clothing like

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.650 
idea to wear protective clothing like
rubber<00:00:33.620> gloves<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.100> an<00:00:34.340> apron

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.990 

firstly<00:00:39.620> before<00:00:40.130> doing<00:00:40.310> anything<00:00:40.579> to<00:00:40.880> the

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
firstly before doing anything to the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.390 
firstly before doing anything to the
tire<00:00:41.210> we<00:00:41.750> need<00:00:41.930> to<00:00:42.020> remove<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.440> wheel<00:00:42.620> the

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
tire we need to remove the wheel the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.070 
tire we need to remove the wheel the
simplest<00:00:43.670> way<00:00:43.880> to<00:00:43.910> do<00:00:44.150> this<00:00:44.300> is<00:00:44.360> by<00:00:44.660> shifting

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
simplest way to do this is by shifting

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.870 
simplest way to do this is by shifting
the<00:00:45.140> rear<00:00:45.440> derailleur<00:00:45.710> into<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.520> smallest

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
the rear derailleur into the smallest

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.940 
the rear derailleur into the smallest
cog<00:00:47.120> this<00:00:47.989> will<00:00:48.200> take<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.470> tension<00:00:48.680> off<00:00:48.890> the

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
cog this will take the tension off the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.799 
cog this will take the tension off the
radio<00:00:49.280> alia<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:49.820> make<00:00:50.180> removing<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.690> wheel

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
radio alia and make removing the wheel

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.710 
radio alia and make removing the wheel
easier

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.990 

once<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.560> have<00:00:55.590> done<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.860> undo<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.790> quick

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
once you have done this undo the quick

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.090 
once you have done this undo the quick
release<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.480> drop<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> wheel<00:00:58.200> out

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.880 

before<00:01:02.000> trying<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:02.359> remove<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:02.809> tire<00:01:03.050> ensure

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
before trying to remove the tire ensure

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.170 
before trying to remove the tire ensure
you<00:01:04.009> have<00:01:04.040> removed<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:04.549> lock<00:01:04.670> ring<00:01:04.729> and
