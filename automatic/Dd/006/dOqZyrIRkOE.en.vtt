00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.560 

this<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.650> just<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.040> show<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.340> how<00:00:35.790> quickly<00:00:36.210> you

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
this is just to show you how quickly you

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.930 
this is just to show you how quickly you
can<00:00:36.630> create<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.320> effect<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> glass<00:00:38.250> so

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
can create the effect of the glass so

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.000 
can create the effect of the glass so
you<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.630> do<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> small<00:00:40.050> hatching<00:00:40.650> like<00:00:40.830> this

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
you just do a small hatching like this

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.840 
you just do a small hatching like this
and<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:42.330> you<00:00:42.480> remember<00:00:42.720> to<00:00:43.380> do<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.460> way<00:00:44.610> that

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
and if you remember to do in a way that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.340 
and if you remember to do in a way that
looks<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.320> like<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:47.270> check<00:00:48.270> mark<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:49.050> press

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
looks like like a check mark you press

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.799 
looks like like a check mark you press
on<00:00:49.580> down<00:00:50.580> here<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.059> go<00:00:54.570> let<00:00:55.140> go<00:00:55.580> see

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
on down here and you just go let go see

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.110 
on down here and you just go let go see
you<00:00:57.809> could<00:00:57.960> also<00:00:58.110> go<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.940> make<00:00:59.940> sure

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
you could also go like this make sure

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.410 
you could also go like this make sure
that<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.449> doesn't<00:01:00.600> look<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> pattern

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
that it doesn't look like a pattern

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
that it doesn't look like a pattern
otherwise<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.660> could<00:01:04.020> be<00:01:04.050> into

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
otherwise it could be into

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.410 
otherwise it could be into
misinterpreted<00:01:05.190> as<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.820> fabric<00:01:06.270> or

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
misinterpreted as that fabric or

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:28.990 
misinterpreted as that fabric or
something

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.690 

this<00:01:29.750> is<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.020> other<00:01:30.170> window<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:31.190> is<00:01:31.340> just<00:01:31.520> to

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
this is the other window this is just to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.550 
this is the other window this is just to
indicate<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.570> some<00:01:32.810> kind<00:01:33.050> of<00:01:33.140> reflection

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
indicate to you some kind of reflection

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.000 
indicate to you some kind of reflection
from<00:01:34.100> either<00:01:34.460> behind<00:01:34.730> or<00:01:36.010> revealing

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
from either behind or revealing

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.980 
from either behind or revealing
something<00:01:37.460> from<00:01:37.640> inside<00:01:37.850> it<00:01:38.390> depends<00:01:38.750> on<00:01:38.810> what

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
something from inside it depends on what

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.940 
something from inside it depends on what
you<00:01:39.110> want<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.380> do<00:01:39.530> with<00:01:39.680> it

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.880 

now<00:01:42.950> here<00:01:43.250> I'm<00:01:43.400> going<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.640> assign<00:01:44.090> as<00:01:44.590> we<00:01:45.590> spoke

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
now here I'm going to assign as we spoke

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.920 
now here I'm going to assign as we spoke
before<00:01:46.070> I'm<00:01:46.580> going<00:01:46.730> to<00:01:46.850> assign<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.390> light

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
before I'm going to assign a light

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.660 
before I'm going to assign a light
source<00:01:48.290> coming<00:01:48.650> maybe<00:01:48.980> from<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:49.490> direction

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
source coming maybe from this direction

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.350 
source coming maybe from this direction
so<00:01:50.210> from<00:01:50.930> this<00:01:51.080> direction<00:01:51.290> here<00:01:51.700> on<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.760> 45

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
so from this direction here on a 45

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.050 
so from this direction here on a 45
degree<00:01:53.510> is<00:01:53.780> approximately<00:01:54.530> angle<00:01:55.060> anything

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
degree is approximately angle anything

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.200 
degree is approximately angle anything
that<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:56.440> protruding<00:01:57.670> or<00:01:58.670> anything<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.090> is

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
that is protruding or anything that is

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.359 
that is protruding or anything that is
raised<00:01:59.600> against<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.260> light<00:02:00.470> would<00:02:01.190> look

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
raised against the light would look

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.440 
raised against the light would look
darker<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.060> here<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:03.200> could<00:02:03.380> use<00:02:03.530> an<00:02:04.240> ruler<00:02:05.240> like

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
darker so here I could use an ruler like

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.800 
darker so here I could use an ruler like
this<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.869> then<00:02:06.410> just<00:02:06.650> do<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:07.070> line<00:02:07.310> like<00:02:07.520> this

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
this and then just do a line like this

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.270 
this and then just do a line like this
the<00:02:08.810> line<00:02:08.840> like<00:02:09.229> this<00:02:09.490> is<00:02:10.490> good<00:02:10.670> at<00:02:11.920> times<00:02:12.920> I

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the line like this is good at times I

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.870 
the line like this is good at times I
could<00:02:13.400> do<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.330> vertical<00:02:15.080> line<00:02:15.230> here<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.730> a

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
could do so a vertical line here and a

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.539 
could do so a vertical line here and a
vertical<00:02:20.090> line

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.670 

then<00:02:25.549> finished<00:02:26.120> see<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:27.049> now<00:02:27.260> looks<00:02:27.590> like

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
then finished see that now looks like

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.759 
then finished see that now looks like
this<00:02:28.459> frame<00:02:28.939> of<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.480> window<00:02:29.599> is<00:02:29.989> higher<00:02:30.379> than

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
this frame of the window is higher than

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.119 
this frame of the window is higher than
that<00:02:31.219> glass<00:02:31.549> would<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.569> agree<00:02:33.730> yes<00:02:34.730> or<00:02:34.909> no

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
that glass would you agree yes or no

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.250 
that glass would you agree yes or no
okay<00:02:37.129> now<00:02:38.090> I'm<00:02:38.269> going<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.540> continue<00:02:38.719> with<00:02:39.139> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
okay now I'm going to continue with the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.610 
okay now I'm going to continue with the
rest<00:02:39.439> of<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.709> this<00:02:40.249> is<00:02:40.310> also<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.879> piece<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.620> it

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
rest of it this is also a piece of it

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.099 
rest of it this is also a piece of it
could<00:02:42.799> be<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.639> brick<00:02:44.180> or<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.569> could<00:02:44.750> be<00:02:44.870> any

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
could be a brick or it could be any

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.429 
could be a brick or it could be any
gypsum<00:02:45.879> material<00:02:46.879> it's<00:02:47.480> also<00:02:47.750> raised<00:02:48.139> and

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
gypsum material it's also raised and

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.949 
gypsum material it's also raised and
higher<00:02:48.620> than<00:02:48.859> the<00:02:49.010> level<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:50.569> surface

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
higher than the level of the surface

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.289 
higher than the level of the surface
underneath<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:52.030> considering<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.120> light

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
underneath so considering the light

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.759 
underneath so considering the light
source<00:02:53.599> again<00:02:53.959> coming<00:02:54.200> from<00:02:54.290> this<00:02:54.590> direction

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
source again coming from this direction

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.069 
source again coming from this direction
and<00:02:55.700> when<00:02:55.939> I<00:02:55.969> also<00:02:56.180> create<00:02:57.139> some<00:02:57.650> shading<00:02:58.189> here

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
and when I also create some shading here

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.699 
and when I also create some shading here
in<00:03:00.079> this<00:03:00.469> angle<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.629> then<00:03:02.629> mind<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.139> the

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
in this angle and then mind you the

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.069 
in this angle and then mind you the
amount<00:03:04.069> of<00:03:04.250> shading<00:03:04.579> is<00:03:04.849> proportional<00:03:05.599> to<00:03:05.629> the

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
amount of shading is proportional to the

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.459 
amount of shading is proportional to the
thickness<00:03:06.319> or<00:03:06.859> the<00:03:07.819> height<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.329> the<00:03:08.480> piece<00:03:08.659> so

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:09.469 
thickness or the height of the piece so

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.300 
thickness or the height of the piece so
here<00:03:09.829> it's<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.519> bit<00:03:10.699> thicker<00:03:11.510> than<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:13.040> frame

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
here it's a bit thicker than the frame

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.380 
here it's a bit thicker than the frame
of<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.599> glass<00:03:15.489> see<00:03:16.489> that

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.250 

so<00:03:19.960> now<00:03:20.170> it's<00:03:20.380> coming<00:03:20.590> way<00:03:21.490> up<00:03:21.730> this<00:03:22.690> here<00:03:23.050> is<00:03:23.230> a

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
so now it's coming way up this here is a

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.920 
so now it's coming way up this here is a
bit<00:03:23.500> higher<00:03:23.800> this

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.339 

this<00:03:28.500> here<00:03:28.799> is<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.040> bit<00:03:29.340> taller<00:03:30.140> similar<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.260> the

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
this here is a bit taller similar to the

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.930 
this here is a bit taller similar to the
one<00:03:31.500> on<00:03:31.530> top<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.950> again<00:03:35.220> only<00:03:35.370> from<00:03:35.730> one<00:03:35.909> side

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
one on top and again only from one side

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:44.690 
one on top and again only from one side
only<00:03:37.670> three<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:41.280> one<00:03:41.760> little<00:03:42.000> piece<00:03:42.870> here<00:03:43.700> and

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
only three and one little piece here and

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.470 
only three and one little piece here and
it<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:46.040> finished<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:47.280> in<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.819> matter<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.180> minutes

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
it is finished so in a matter of minutes

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.949 
it is finished so in a matter of minutes
that<00:03:49.470> flat<00:03:49.860> shape<00:03:50.250> of<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.610> window<00:03:50.940> appears<00:03:51.750> to

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
that flat shape of the window appears to

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.619 
that flat shape of the window appears to
be<00:03:52.110> almost<00:03:52.950> three-dimensional<00:03:53.760> who<00:03:54.510> are

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
be almost three-dimensional who are

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.589 
be almost three-dimensional who are
coming<00:03:54.959> at<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.790> now<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.819> have<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> little<00:03:57.450> trick

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
coming at you now I have a little trick

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.380 
coming at you now I have a little trick
to<00:03:57.659> share<00:03:58.079> with<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.650> shortcut<00:03:59.069> I<00:03:59.549> took<00:04:00.359> a

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
to share with you a shortcut I took a

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.210 
to share with you a shortcut I took a
piece<00:04:00.629> of<00:04:00.780> paper<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.769> with<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:03.480> cutter

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
piece of paper and with the the cutter

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.920 
piece of paper and with the the cutter
with<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.400> exacto<00:04:05.879> knife<00:04:06.060> or<00:04:06.090> whatever<00:04:06.540> cutter

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
with the exacto knife or whatever cutter

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.729 
with the exacto knife or whatever cutter
you<00:04:07.109> have<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.560> cut<00:04:08.430> a<00:04:08.670> little<00:04:08.730> hole<00:04:09.030> here<00:04:09.540> that

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
you have I cut a little hole here that

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.190 
you have I cut a little hole here that
represents<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:11.069> brick<00:04:11.810> represent<00:04:12.810> some

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
represents the brick represent some

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.259 
represents the brick represent some
shell<00:04:13.409> type<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:13.859> brick<00:04:14.129> and<00:04:14.489> then<00:04:15.000> I'm<00:04:15.120> going

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
shell type of brick and then I'm going

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.879 
shell type of brick and then I'm going
to<00:04:15.329> put<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.599> here<00:04:15.629> and<00:04:15.959> use<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.260> as<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.410> template

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
to put it here and use it as a template

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.120 
to put it here and use it as a template
to<00:04:17.130> create<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.090> effect<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.139> brick<00:04:19.380> so<00:04:19.829> I

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
to create the effect of the brick so I

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.279 
to create the effect of the brick so I
put<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:20.669> like<00:04:20.699> this<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.209> when<00:04:21.750> all<00:04:21.900> they<00:04:22.139> need

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
put it like this and when all they need

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.840 
put it like this and when all they need
to<00:04:22.320> do<00:04:22.500> really<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.979> press<00:04:23.190> like<00:04:23.400> this<00:04:23.580> and

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
to do really is to press like this and

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.820 
to do really is to press like this and
just<00:04:23.880> go<00:04:24.330> very<00:04:24.780> quickly<00:04:25.229> see<00:04:26.360> really<00:04:27.360> quickly

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
just go very quickly see really quickly

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.310 
just go very quickly see really quickly
and<00:04:28.830> then<00:04:29.100> BAM<00:04:29.639> you<00:04:29.910> remove<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.449> then<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.199> have

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
and then BAM you remove it then you have

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.580 
and then BAM you remove it then you have
two<00:04:31.950> bricks<00:04:32.160> of<00:04:32.430> them<00:04:32.610> see<00:04:32.940> that<00:04:33.289> voila

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
two bricks of them see that voila

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.610 
two bricks of them see that voila
okay<00:04:35.280> now<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:35.520> another<00:04:36.090> one<00:04:38.060> like<00:04:39.060> this<00:04:39.090> here

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
okay now you another one like this here

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.440 
okay now you another one like this here
and<00:04:40.620> with<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:40.889> little<00:04:41.070> space

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.220 

and<00:04:47.170> this<00:04:47.650> is<00:04:47.770> another<00:04:48.040> effect<00:04:48.460> so<00:04:49.270> I<00:04:49.630> could<00:04:50.110> do

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
and this is another effect so I could do

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:59.830 
and this is another effect so I could do
a<00:04:50.260> few<00:04:50.530> pieces<00:04:50.770> here

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.159 

then<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.530> leave<00:05:00.800> a<00:05:00.830> space

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.960 

anyone<00:05:07.340> see<00:05:08.340> that<00:05:09.919> now<00:05:10.919> as<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.190> can<00:05:11.340> see<00:05:11.400> I<00:05:11.639> add

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
anyone see that now as you can see I add

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.080 
anyone see that now as you can see I add
a<00:05:12.000> few<00:05:12.360> more<00:05:12.560> to<00:05:13.560> just<00:05:13.919> give<00:05:14.190> you<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:14.430> and

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
a few more to just give you that and

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.650 
a few more to just give you that and
beyond<00:05:15.419> so<00:05:15.570> that<00:05:15.840> effect<00:05:16.320> of<00:05:16.650> of<00:05:17.490> bricks<00:05:17.910> now

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
beyond so that effect of of bricks now

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.070 
beyond so that effect of of bricks now
again<00:05:19.229> if<00:05:19.380> I<00:05:19.530> may<00:05:19.560> remind<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.340> of<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:21.780> light

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
again if I may remind you of the light

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.439 
again if I may remind you of the light
source<00:05:22.470> each<00:05:23.250> one<00:05:23.580> of<00:05:23.729> these<00:05:23.820> bricks<00:05:24.210> is

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
source each one of these bricks is

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.960 
source each one of these bricks is
higher<00:05:24.870> than<00:05:25.139> the<00:05:25.320> surface<00:05:25.740> so<00:05:26.340> each<00:05:26.639> one<00:05:26.880> of

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
higher than the surface so each one of

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.060 
higher than the surface so each one of
them<00:05:27.090> deserve<00:05:27.479> a<00:05:27.630> little<00:05:27.870> bit<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.139> shading

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
them deserve a little bit of shading

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.879 
them deserve a little bit of shading
here<00:05:29.400> on<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:29.610> corner<00:05:30.380> opposite<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.740> light

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
here on the corner opposite to the light

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:32.300 
here on the corner opposite to the light
source

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
source

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.150 
source
so<00:05:32.610> here<00:05:32.940> is<00:05:33.120> one<00:05:33.360> here's<00:05:34.169> another<00:05:34.440> one<00:05:34.830> see

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
so here is one here's another one see

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.830 
so here is one here's another one see
that<00:05:36.440> see<00:05:37.880> now<00:05:38.880> the<00:05:38.970> brick<00:05:39.270> also<00:05:39.479> looks

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
that see now the brick also looks

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.409 
that see now the brick also looks
different<00:05:40.290> as<00:05:41.220> compared<00:05:41.790> I<00:05:41.880> can<00:05:42.090> pair<00:05:42.270> this

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
different as compared I can pair this

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.240 
different as compared I can pair this
one<00:05:42.630> for<00:05:42.810> example<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:43.380> this<00:05:43.530> this<00:05:43.830> is<00:05:43.979> flat

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
one for example to this this is flat

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.520 
one for example to this this is flat
looks<00:05:44.760> like<00:05:44.910> it's<00:05:45.060> painted<00:05:45.389> on<00:05:45.479> the<00:05:45.630> wall<00:05:45.780> but

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
looks like it's painted on the wall but

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.980 
looks like it's painted on the wall but
the<00:05:46.650> moment<00:05:47.010> I<00:05:47.130> put<00:05:47.340> that<00:05:47.460> l-shape<00:05:48.229> shadow

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
the moment I put that l-shape shadow

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.440 
the moment I put that l-shape shadow
then<00:05:51.990> it<00:05:52.169> become<00:05:52.470> raised<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.760> same<00:05:54.000> thing<00:05:54.210> in

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
then it become raised the same thing in

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.719 
then it become raised the same thing in
this<00:05:54.750> corner<00:05:55.110> so<00:05:55.139> I'm<00:05:55.380> going<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.620> continue<00:05:55.889> to

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
this corner so I'm going to continue to

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.580 
this corner so I'm going to continue to
do<00:05:56.910> this<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:58.650> show<00:05:58.950> you<00:05:58.979> what<00:05:59.190> it<00:05:59.340> looked<00:05:59.520> like
