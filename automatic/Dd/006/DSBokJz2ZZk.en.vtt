can<00:01:43.790> see<00:01:43.820> i<00:01:44.030> increase<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.450> grain<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.810> little

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
can see i increase the grain a little

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.980 
can see i increase the grain a little
bit<00:01:45.200> more<00:01:45.440> each<00:01:45.500> time<00:01:45.650> and<00:01:46.450> increase<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.720> size

bit more each time and increase the size
a<00:01:48.020> bit<00:01:48.409> more<00:01:48.680> of<00:01:48.799> my<00:01:48.950> brush<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:49.580> my<00:01:50.360> houses<00:01:50.750> get

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
a bit more of my brush and my houses get

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.460 
a bit more of my brush and my houses get
a<00:01:51.229> little<00:01:51.950> clearer<00:01:52.280> little<00:01:52.670> bigger<00:01:53.470> we'll

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
a little clearer little bigger we'll

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.740 
a little clearer little bigger we'll
keep<00:01:54.620> doing<00:01:54.860> this<00:01:55.070> couple<00:01:55.430> more<00:01:55.580> times<00:01:55.790> but

keep doing this couple more times but
can<00:01:56.930> you<00:01:56.960> imagine<00:01:57.110> how<00:01:57.680> much<00:01:57.830> time<00:01:58.190> you're

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369

saving using this to paint all these
little<00:02:02.000> buildings<00:02:02.570> instead<00:02:03.260> of<00:02:04.030> trying<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.090> do

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
little buildings instead of trying to do

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.089 
little buildings instead of trying to do
it<00:02:05.530> by<00:02:06.530> hand<00:02:08.200> let's<00:02:09.200> get<00:02:09.379> those<00:02:09.560> buildings<00:02:10.039> a

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
it by hand let's get those buildings a

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.410 
it by hand let's get those buildings a
little<00:02:10.310> bigger

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
little bigger

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.300 
little bigger
and<00:02:11.569> then<00:02:12.020> at<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.230> last<00:02:12.470> here<00:02:12.920> I'm<00:02:13.099> going<00:02:13.220> to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
and then at the last here I'm going to

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.040 
and then at the last here I'm going to
go<00:02:13.430> ahead<00:02:13.459> and<00:02:13.700> increase<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.450> grain<00:02:14.690> all<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
go ahead and increase the grain all the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.410 
go ahead and increase the grain all the
way<00:02:15.310> up<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.520> still<00:02:16.730> want<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:16.940> just<00:02:17.180> slightly

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
way up I still want it just slightly

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.790 
way up I still want it just slightly
below<00:02:17.810> because<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.200> want<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.410> little<00:02:18.530> bit<00:02:18.739> of

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
below because I want a little bit of

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.880 
below because I want a little bit of
atmosphere<00:02:19.489> in<00:02:19.970> here<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.840> I'll<00:02:21.200> use<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.650> to

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
atmosphere in here and I'll use this to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.220 
atmosphere in here and I'll use this to
increase<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.430> size<00:02:22.640> quite<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.239> bit<00:02:23.510> larger<00:02:24.050> and

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
increase the size quite a bit larger and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.040 
increase the size quite a bit larger and
my<00:02:25.010> last<00:02:25.250> row<00:02:25.520> of<00:02:25.550> buildings<00:02:25.760> here<00:02:26.300> come<00:02:26.840> into

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
my last row of buildings here come into

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.050 
my last row of buildings here come into
the<00:02:27.170> front<00:02:27.470> now<00:02:28.069> there<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.280> have<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.640> whole

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
the front now there you have a whole

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.690 
the front now there you have a whole
hillside<00:02:29.569> for<00:02:30.290> example<00:02:30.800> in<00:02:30.890> San<00:02:31.100> Francisco<00:02:31.640> or

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
hillside for example in San Francisco or

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.460 
hillside for example in San Francisco or
somewhere<00:02:32.120> I'm<00:02:32.810> going<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.140> put<00:02:33.319> in<00:02:33.440> some

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
somewhere I'm going to put in some

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.949 
somewhere I'm going to put in some
swallows<00:02:34.250> flight<00:02:34.730> across<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.180> just<00:02:35.660> at<00:02:35.810> the

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
swallows flight across the just at the

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.710 
swallows flight across the just at the
end<00:02:36.250> take<00:02:37.250> them<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.430> little<00:02:37.580> smaller<00:02:38.000> here<00:02:38.480> and

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
end take them a little smaller here and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.259 
end take them a little smaller here and
if<00:02:38.989> one<00:02:39.170> stroke<00:02:39.500> across<00:02:39.860> that's<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.790> little<00:02:40.910> too

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
if one stroke across that's a little too

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.140 
if one stroke across that's a little too
bright<00:02:42.170> for<00:02:42.319> my<00:02:42.709> liking<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:43.580> will<00:02:43.970> go<00:02:44.000> ahead

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
bright for my liking so I will go ahead

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.509 
bright for my liking so I will go ahead
and<00:02:44.600> lower<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.380> grain<00:02:45.709> just<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.160> little<00:02:46.400> bit

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
and lower the grain just a little bit

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.809 
and lower the grain just a little bit
now<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.090> grain<00:02:47.420> works<00:02:47.810> based<00:02:48.319> on<00:02:48.819> the

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
now the grain works based on the

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.759 
now the grain works based on the
secondary<00:02:50.299> color<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.019> this<00:02:51.140> case<00:02:51.380> I've<00:02:51.620> got

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
secondary color so in this case I've got

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.680 
secondary color so in this case I've got
the<00:02:51.920> second<00:02:52.280> date<00:02:52.430> color<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.420> primary

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
the second date color and the primary

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.750 
the second date color and the primary
color<00:02:54.080> set<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.709> whatever<00:02:55.100> my<00:02:55.280> background

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
color set to whatever my background

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.000 
color set to whatever my background
color<00:02:56.000> well<00:02:56.840> that's<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.260> image<00:02:57.380> shows<00:02:57.650> that's

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
color well that's the image shows that's

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.300 
color well that's the image shows that's
how<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.250> can<00:02:58.580> use<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.819> to<00:02:59.180> paint<00:02:59.660> things<00:03:00.530> that

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
how you can use it to paint things that

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.759 
how you can use it to paint things that
would<00:03:01.430> take<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.670> great<00:03:01.910> deal<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.180> time<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:02.900> a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
regular fashion if you were to paint
