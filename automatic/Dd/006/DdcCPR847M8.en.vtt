go up to an eighth of an inch you can

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.330 
go up to an eighth of an inch you can
also<00:01:16.070> use<00:01:16.250> a<00:01:16.780> 560<00:01:17.780> force<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.829> problem<00:01:19.219> with

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
also use a 560 force the problem with

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
also use a 560 force the problem with
the<00:01:19.490> smaller<00:01:20.290> diameter<00:01:21.290> cables<00:01:21.710> is<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.610> a

the smaller diameter cables is that a
lot<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.899> times<00:01:24.079> you<00:01:24.229> get<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.409> lot<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.619> droop<00:01:24.950> in

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
lot of times you get a lot of droop in

lot of times you get a lot of droop in
your<00:01:25.250> loop<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.729> it's<00:01:26.090> hard<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.810> hard<00:01:27.799> to<00:01:28.009> place

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
your loop and it's hard to hard to place

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.249 
your loop and it's hard to hard to place
it<00:01:28.549> just<00:01:28.700> exactly<00:01:29.149> where<00:01:29.509> you<00:01:29.600> want<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:29.990> so

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
it just exactly where you want it so

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.660

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
beavers the 3 30 seconds is the way to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.039 
beavers the 3 30 seconds is the way to
go<00:01:36.789> just<00:01:37.789> as<00:01:37.939> an<00:01:38.090> example<00:01:38.240> with<00:01:38.750> different

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
go just as an example with different

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.310 
go just as an example with different
