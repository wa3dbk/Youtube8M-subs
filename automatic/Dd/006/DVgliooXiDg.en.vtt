gravity<00:01:10.049> destroyer<00:01:10.350> Perseus<00:01:11.189> derivative

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630

kind<00:02:15.920> of<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.330> black<00:02:17.330> charcoal<00:02:18.110> II<00:02:18.319> I'm<00:02:19.280> not

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
kind of a black charcoal II I'm not

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.770 
kind of a black charcoal II I'm not
really<00:02:19.549> sure<00:02:19.760> what<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.060> call<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.360> color<00:02:20.510> but

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
really sure what to call that color but

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.259 
really sure what to call that color but
looks<00:02:21.709> kind<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:21.980> sharp<00:02:22.250> that's<00:02:22.940> not<00:02:23.060> just

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
looks kind of sharp that's not just

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.850 
looks kind of sharp that's not just
solid<00:02:23.480> black<00:02:23.600> it's<00:02:23.959> got<00:02:24.110> similar<00:02:24.380> like<00:02:24.620> the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
solid black it's got similar like the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.800 
solid black it's got similar like the
sparkles<00:02:25.549> or<00:02:25.700> whatever<00:02:25.880> engrained<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.510> do<00:02:26.690> it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
sparkles or whatever engrained and do it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.440 
sparkles or whatever engrained and do it
gives<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.500> nice<00:02:27.709> look<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.100> think<00:02:28.340> not<00:02:29.120> sure<00:02:29.329> if

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
gives it a nice look I think not sure if

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.170 
gives it a nice look I think not sure if
this<00:02:29.570> one<00:02:29.750> chips<00:02:30.320> in<00:02:30.590> battle<00:02:31.070> or<00:02:31.130> not<00:02:31.370> if<00:02:31.940> it

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
this one chips in battle or not if it

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.849 
this one chips in battle or not if it
wears<00:02:32.329> away<00:02:32.630> or<00:02:32.810> not<00:02:32.959> if<00:02:33.170> it's<00:02:33.320> like<00:02:33.440> painted

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
wears away or not if it's like painted

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.190 
wears away or not if it's like painted
or<00:02:33.980> what<00:02:34.250> exactly<00:02:34.760> but<00:02:35.000> we'll<00:02:35.840> probably<00:02:35.959> find

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
or what exactly but we'll probably find

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.330 
or what exactly but we'll probably find
that<00:02:36.350> out<00:02:36.500> pretty<00:02:36.680> soon<00:02:36.829> when<00:02:36.950> we<00:02:37.010> do<00:02:37.160> some

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
that out pretty soon when we do some

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.490 
that out pretty soon when we do some
battles<00:02:37.670> with<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:37.910> guy

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
battles with this guy

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.930 
battles with this guy
then<00:02:39.500> there's<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.950> 1:45<00:02:40.790> spin<00:02:41.209> track<00:02:41.680> and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
then there's the 1:45 spin track and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.360 
then there's the 1:45 spin track and
performance<00:02:43.940> tip<00:02:44.269> D<00:02:45.010> defense<00:02:47.859> so<00:02:48.859> get<00:02:49.250> this

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
performance tip D defense so get this

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.520 
performance tip D defense so get this
assembled<00:02:50.030> quickly<00:02:50.510> here<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.810> take<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.350> look

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
assembled quickly here and take a look

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.809 
assembled quickly here and take a look
at<00:02:54.769> fully<00:02:55.640> assembled

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.520 

see<00:03:01.450> if<00:03:01.540> we<00:03:01.629> can<00:03:01.750> do<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.049> without<00:03:02.110> even<00:03:02.439> using

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
see if we can do so without even using

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.089 
see if we can do so without even using
the<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.840> assembly<00:03:05.470> tool<00:03:07.379> come<00:03:08.379> on<00:03:08.590> there<00:03:08.920> we

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
the the assembly tool come on there we

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.300 
the the assembly tool come on there we
go<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:10.420> now<00:03:10.629> can<00:03:11.230> be<00:03:11.260> fully<00:03:11.530> tight<00:03:11.769> but<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.189> is

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
go so now can be fully tight but this is

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.710 
go so now can be fully tight but this is
show<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.549> fully<00:03:12.730> assembled<00:03:12.879> it<00:03:13.390> works<00:03:13.540> just

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
show it fully assembled it works just

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.929 
show it fully assembled it works just
fine<00:03:13.980> looks<00:03:14.980> pretty<00:03:15.280> decent<00:03:15.430> without<00:03:15.819> the

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939 
fine looks pretty decent without the

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.160 
fine looks pretty decent without the
stickers<00:03:16.269> even<00:03:16.480> I<00:03:16.510> think<00:03:16.750> I'll<00:03:17.019> probably

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
stickers even I think I'll probably

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.960 
stickers even I think I'll probably
still<00:03:17.530> stick<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:17.920> stickers<00:03:18.250> on<00:03:18.400> there<00:03:18.670> so<00:03:18.940> I

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
still stick the stickers on there so I

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.580 
still stick the stickers on there so I
finally<00:03:19.180> started<00:03:19.510> doing<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:19.840> with<00:03:20.200> my<00:03:20.409> more

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
finally started doing that with my more

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.550 
finally started doing that with my more
recent<00:03:20.620> videos<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.750> guess<00:03:23.140> that's<00:03:23.230> actually

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
recent videos so I guess that's actually

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.140 
recent videos so I guess that's actually
cut<00:03:23.739> away<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.220> put<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.430> stickers<00:03:24.700> on<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:24.940> see

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
cut away and put the stickers on and see

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.819 
cut away and put the stickers on and see
how<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.390> looks<00:03:25.450> all<00:03:25.840> fully<00:03:26.230> assembled<00:03:26.709> and

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
how it looks all fully assembled and

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.479 
how it looks all fully assembled and
stick<00:03:27.190> Erised<00:03:28.950> well<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:29.980> should<00:03:30.250> take<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.370> look

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
stick Erised well I should take a look

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.429 
stick Erised well I should take a look
at<00:03:30.579> these<00:03:30.640> directions<00:03:31.239> here<00:03:31.540> maybe<00:03:32.349> the

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
at these directions here maybe the

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.440 
at these directions here maybe the
stickers<00:03:32.680> are<00:03:32.829> so<00:03:33.040> small<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.370> going<00:03:34.180> multiple

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
stickers are so small and going multiple

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.319 
stickers are so small and going multiple
layers<00:03:34.629> and<00:03:34.799> have<00:03:35.799> we<00:03:35.980> can<00:03:36.159> really<00:03:36.519> see<00:03:36.849> once

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
layers and have we can really see once

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.720 
layers and have we can really see once
it's<00:03:37.510> assembled<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:38.290> alright<00:03:39.010> sight<00:03:39.250> not<00:03:39.549> to

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
it's assembled so alright sight not to

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.460 
it's assembled so alright sight not to
put<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:39.940> stickers<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.359> for<00:03:40.659> this<00:03:40.750> one<00:03:40.959> could

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
put the stickers on for this one could

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.319 
put the stickers on for this one could
just<00:03:41.620> look<00:03:41.709> too<00:03:42.129> complicated<00:03:42.519> for<00:03:42.790> me<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.239> my

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
just look too complicated for me and my

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.539 
just look too complicated for me and my
larger<00:03:43.750> fingers<00:03:44.079> and<00:03:44.200> that<00:03:44.319> so<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.889> think<00:03:45.370> the

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
larger fingers and that so I think the

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.680 
larger fingers and that so I think the
bay<00:03:45.639> looks<00:03:45.819> pretty<00:03:46.030> good<00:03:46.180> nice<00:03:46.359> without

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
bay looks pretty good nice without

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.660 
bay looks pretty good nice without
stickers<00:03:47.139> for<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.409> one<00:03:47.590> it's<00:03:48.280> got<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.549> nice

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
stickers for this one it's got the nice

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.670 
stickers for this one it's got the nice
little<00:03:48.909> silver<00:03:49.090> detailing<00:03:49.540> some<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.590> the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
little silver detailing some of the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.930 
little silver detailing some of the
stickers<00:03:50.920> actually<00:03:51.190> go<00:03:51.340> over<00:03:51.370> like<00:03:51.819> the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
stickers actually go over like the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.729 
stickers actually go over like the
silver<00:03:52.239> dots<00:03:52.420> on<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.659> sides<00:03:52.900> which<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.680> don't

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
silver dots on the sides which I don't

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:54.629 
silver dots on the sides which I don't
know<00:03:53.859> why<00:03:53.950> they<00:03:54.069> make<00:03:54.190> them<00:03:54.310> stuff<00:03:54.489> in<00:03:54.579> the

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
know why they make them stuff in the

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.789 
know why they make them stuff in the
first<00:03:54.790> place<00:03:55.060> then<00:03:55.329> but<00:03:55.599> like<00:03:56.319> this<00:03:56.470> one<00:03:56.620> looks

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799

setup<00:04:06.190> here<00:04:06.400> for<00:04:06.579> this<00:04:06.699> but<00:04:06.940> let's<00:04:07.180> just<00:04:07.299> do<00:04:07.389> a

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
setup here for this but let's just do a

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.300 
setup here for this but let's just do a
quick<00:04:07.629> little<00:04:07.720> spin<00:04:08.199> test<00:04:08.470> here<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:08.769> see<00:04:09.190> how

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
quick little spin test here and see how

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.839 
quick little spin test here and see how
it<00:04:09.430> looks<00:04:09.459> in<00:04:09.819> action<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:12.430> I'll<00:04:12.549> move<00:04:12.699> the

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
it looks in action and I'll move the

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.550 
it looks in action and I'll move the
camera<00:04:13.120> after<00:04:13.449> ice<00:04:13.540> launch<00:04:13.870> here<00:04:14.079> so<00:04:14.290> three

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
camera after ice launch here so three

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.779 
camera after ice launch here so three
two<00:04:14.739> one<00:04:15.010> let<00:04:15.400> it<00:04:15.549> rip<00:04:17.160> so<00:04:18.160> it's<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.400> defensive

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
two one let it rip so it's the defensive

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.240 
two one let it rip so it's the defensive
type<00:04:18.910> base<00:04:19.180> so<00:04:19.590> although<00:04:20.590> it's<00:04:20.709> not<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:20.859> matte

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
type base so although it's not a matte

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.010 
type base so although it's not a matte
type<00:04:21.400> it's<00:04:22.240> kinda<00:04:22.389> like<00:04:22.449> the<00:04:22.570> next<00:04:22.810> step

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020
