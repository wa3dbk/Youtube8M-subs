00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.450
 and the first clan is the clan black clan is very 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.900
 successfully almost in the first places 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.380
 passed from the qualifying rounds and here he is in 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.380
 group b and so the clan has already found it will be registered 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.600
 garlic here is not very much 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.010
 the guys did see right away they are not at all 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.130
 plays less here 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.020
 than in the courtyards is very cool base 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.329
 already ran looked very quickly 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:38.109
 go over a lot of clans so much 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.719
 not a lot of resources in fact and 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:44.030
 they are of course in diamonds there mine 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.550
 plus exit here with us 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.819
 refractory ki speed potion lie 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.769
 climb up 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:54.800
 intermarried here such a small hall on 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.559
 i really like it and 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.600
 nothing scary and this is such a base 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.370
 outwardly it does not violate in any way 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.350
 the rules are gray mister fuke here 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.659
 Here are the bases and does not violate she spent 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.759
 trails all cool go to what the clans 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.979
 and the next clan is so long lay and not 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.759
 will be pretty at the end almost set 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.960
 taken but in this tournament on this 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.060
 the stages are still very good 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.509
 results is in second place 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.880
 our rating is bad sr in the list of horses 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:30.430
 but on the resource is actually not very 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.430
 climb steeply up 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:44.810
 let's rise and here we have this 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.210
 and for a very cool base just respect them 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.730
 they don't have much resources but 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.100
 basic just gorgeous to the next pain 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.770
 and the next clan take long as a not 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.320
 pvp only sewed directly on how 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.510
 Ukraine is actually won and maybe 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.850
 be a video then here's one here 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.900
 base they came out and leaders in principle 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.210
 qualifying round 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.850
 They were in statistics who sawed 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.360
 Alex ment guys handsome guys can 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.780
 dragged leading done very cool by 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.320
 they donâ€™t have much resources , but personal ones 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.570
 chests 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.220
 all diamond sets they are now on them 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.290
 because the guys just got back in p 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.520
 here they are all broken durant for 400 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:31.239
 our youth durant handsome so 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.239
 fast fast fast but honest 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.730
 such here such here they will try 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.310
 up go up here so upstairs 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.290
 they study for a lot of hilke chests 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.660
 hell they are all right cook for 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.130
 so that you can abruptly leave and start 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.760
 semi are written handsome 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.470
 and above they still have a cup worth but 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.130
 we will leave the base and see how it looks 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.260
 on top of 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.870
 this is such a base outside of them too 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.790
 very cool done of course perhaps 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.980
 first base first who up 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.350
 This showed for the better abruptly but also 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.690
 Respect you guys go to the next 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.580
 bayer if still clan so online fest 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.100
 they showed very cool results by 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.130
 least we thought slex because 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.260
 would be better but bagel and other guys 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.900
 They are still guys top oldies 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.190
 they can probably be found to slow down a little 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.380
 turns on the chests I ran over them 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.870
 not very much just here as a whole will show 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.180
 smaller than the other clans are not very 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.510
 okay all decomposed as far as i know 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.290
 guys problems with communication in general 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:41.110
 I donâ€™t know what caused it so far 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.230
 they said this is their base 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.900
 go out the base here is beautiful 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.570
 just made the signs like this 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.910
 base guys such turrets are very cool 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.380
 base hook cool made the guys from the text 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.790
 clan of tornado here such here they have 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.220
 chests at the moment guys cubed us 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.239
 direct attack so you pore such 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.239
 they have no things 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:14.069
 here in principle we will not be a person 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.069
 here we have it all clear here and 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.400
 the base 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:27.840
 externally 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:30.060
 and so here is the bar 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.699
 outwardly the same is done base 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.060
 pretty much all done about any 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.530
 we have such any on high-sky steel 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.150
 made they were rydvanova like this 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.449
 next clan-war 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.090
 this clanâ€™s insane resources are 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.820
 business is not very much and the guys are many 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.169
 time just wasted 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.940
 but so here it looks at the moment 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.130
 them things though mother ash and others 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.110
 guys they were once tops on 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.410
 this moment apparently it is no longer 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.760
 so I just draw conclusions based on 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.620
 the results of the trail on the street like this 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.000
 it looks like their base is not very base 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.340
 big not so cool 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.940
 compared to the rest, well, not really 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.639
 I understand why this is how it is 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.820
 the next clan last plan is who 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.669
 Anyone who has diamond feeds they 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.850
 trying to do something trying to happen 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.820
 foot unhappiness they are quite far from 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.780
 his dogs and fellow now such 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.780
 here v.p.
