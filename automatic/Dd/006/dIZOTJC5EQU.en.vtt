but i think it's going to be fun to to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.859 
but i think it's going to be fun to to
get<00:02:08.550> see<00:02:08.729> something<00:02:09.030> different<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.539> know<00:02:09.690> if

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
get see something different you know if

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.920 
get see something different you know if
i<00:02:09.989> can<00:02:10.050> i<00:02:10.380> can<00:02:10.770> conquer<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.630> synthetic

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
i can i can conquer it on on synthetic

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.600 
i can i can conquer it on on synthetic
and<00:02:13.470> then<00:02:13.590> try<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.860> figure<00:02:13.950> out<00:02:14.220> what<00:02:14.489> the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
and then try to figure out what the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.309 
and then try to figure out what the
moves<00:02:14.819> are<00:02:15.000> going<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> be<00:02:15.300> instead<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.050> it

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
moves are going to be instead of it it

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.809 
moves are going to be instead of it it
hooking<00:02:16.709> like<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.130> on<00:02:17.160> wood<00:02:17.459> it's<00:02:17.610> going<00:02:17.760> to

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
hooking like it it on wood it's going to

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.430 
hooking like it it on wood it's going to
carry<00:02:18.300> down<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:18.959> going<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.200> see<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.349> whole

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
carry down so it's going to see a whole

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.229 
carry down so it's going to see a whole
different<00:02:19.920> type<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.099> player<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.790> whole
