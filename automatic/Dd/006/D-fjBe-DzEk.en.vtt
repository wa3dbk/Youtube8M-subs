it just a little better right there and
is<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.270> thing<00:02:07.709> there<00:02:08.709> you<00:02:08.799> go<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.190> hand<00:02:09.429> is

is the thing there you go the hand is
thing<00:02:09.850> again<00:02:11.130> up<00:02:13.080> up<00:02:14.080> up<00:02:15.810> go<00:02:16.810> faster<00:02:17.200> maybe

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:31.040 

all<00:02:21.510> fail<00:02:24.240> fail<00:02:25.240> times<00:02:25.540> two<00:02:25.780> loaded<00:02:28.680> loaded

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
all fail fail times two loaded loaded

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.940 
all fail fail times two loaded loaded
there<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.140> go<00:02:32.490> be4<00:02:33.490> glitch<00:02:33.960> enhanced<00:02:34.960> engaged

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
there you go be4 glitch enhanced engaged

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.500 
there you go be4 glitch enhanced engaged
onward<00:02:36.700> okay<00:02:38.910> basically<00:02:39.910> this<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.120> your<00:02:40.330> best

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
onward okay basically this is your best

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.240 
onward okay basically this is your best
bet<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.810> getting<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:41.140> cinematic<00:02:41.740> now<00:02:42.010> another

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
bet of getting a cinematic now another

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.070 
bet of getting a cinematic now another
thing<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.640> i<00:02:42.880> pressed<00:02:43.300> states<00:02:43.480> earlier<00:02:43.870> but

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
thing is i pressed states earlier but

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.690 
thing is i pressed states earlier but
you<00:02:44.200> want<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.530> do<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.770> in<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.980> hardcore<00:02:45.310> mode

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
you want to do it in a hardcore mode

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.550 
you want to do it in a hardcore mode
because<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.120> don't<00:02:46.270> have<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.420> mini<00:02:46.720> map<00:02:46.930> which

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
because you don't have a mini map which

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.650 
because you don't have a mini map which
is<00:02:47.800> most<00:02:48.280> likely<00:02:48.580> something<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.270> don't<00:02:49.480> want

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
is most likely something you don't want

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.770 
is most likely something you don't want
in<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.900> cinematic<00:02:50.410> like<00:02:50.860> hey<00:02:51.040> what's<00:02:51.250> up<00:02:51.510> all<00:02:52.510> up

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
in a cinematic like hey what's up all up

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.120 
in a cinematic like hey what's up all up
on<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.930> little<00:02:53.200> left<00:02:53.350> side<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.560> your<00:02:53.620> screen<00:02:53.680> and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
on a little left side of your screen and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.290 
on a little left side of your screen and
if<00:02:54.280> you're<00:02:54.400> not<00:02:54.460> recording<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.940> higher<00:02:55.270> than

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
if you're not recording it higher than

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.120 
if you're not recording it higher than
like<00:02:55.480> 1080<00:02:55.990> then<00:02:56.440> stretching<00:02:57.010> out<00:02:57.100> your

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
like 1080 then stretching out your

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.600 
like 1080 then stretching out your
screen<00:02:57.370> won't<00:02:57.730> look<00:02:57.880> as<00:02:58.030> good<00:02:59.370> another<00:03:00.370> thing

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
screen won't look as good another thing

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.670 
screen won't look as good another thing
is<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.810> also<00:03:02.050> called<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.320> unlimited

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
is this is also called the unlimited

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.080 
is this is also called the unlimited
super<00:03:03.040> glitch<00:03:03.250> where<00:03:03.550> you<00:03:03.640> thought<00:03:03.910> before

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
super glitch where you thought before

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.480 
super glitch where you thought before
everywhere<00:03:04.810> but<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.830> downside<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.340> this<00:03:06.430> is

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
everywhere but the downside to this is

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.280 
everywhere but the downside to this is
if<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:06.850> start<00:03:07.120> talking<00:03:07.300> for<00:03:07.690> everywhere<00:03:07.990> you

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
if you start talking for everywhere you

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.670 
if you start talking for everywhere you
can't<00:03:08.500> blow<00:03:09.070> up<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.280> c4<00:03:09.670> after<00:03:10.240> so<00:03:10.960> that's<00:03:11.440> an

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
can't blow up the c4 after so that's an

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.220 
can't blow up the c4 after so that's an
ugly<00:03:11.800> reminder<00:03:12.480> another<00:03:13.480> tip<00:03:13.660> about<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:14.080> is

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
ugly reminder another tip about it is

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.770 
ugly reminder another tip about it is
that<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.710> can<00:03:14.890> still<00:03:15.130> use<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:16.390> rest<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:16.720> your

another<00:04:37.200> tip<00:04:37.410> is<00:04:37.590> when<00:04:38.100> doing<00:04:38.430> this<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.820> want

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
another tip is when doing this you want

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.700 
another tip is when doing this you want
to<00:04:39.090> crouch<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:39.750> it<00:04:39.960> makes<00:04:40.170> you<00:04:40.260> lower<00:04:40.470> the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
to crouch and it makes you lower the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.950 
to crouch and it makes you lower the
most<00:04:40.920> objects<00:04:41.520> around<00:04:41.880> you<00:04:42.390> but<00:04:42.690> when<00:04:42.930> you

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
most objects around you but when you

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.310 
most objects around you but when you
crouch<00:04:43.230> you<00:04:43.470> go<00:04:43.560> smoother<00:04:44.480> compared<00:04:45.480> to<00:04:45.630> when

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
crouch you go smoother compared to when

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.020 
crouch you go smoother compared to when
you're<00:04:46.470> walking<00:04:46.680> or<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.460> wobble<00:04:48.500> nothing

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
you're walking or a wobble nothing

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.370 
you're walking or a wobble nothing
another<00:04:51.030> way<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.300> get<00:04:51.450> good<00:04:51.630> cinematics<00:04:52.170> would

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
another way to get good cinematics would

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.670 
another way to get good cinematics would
be<00:04:52.640> let's<00:04:53.640> say<00:04:53.820> you're<00:04:54.390> behind<00:04:54.690> an<00:04:54.870> enemy<00:04:55.260> or<00:04:55.440> a

teammate and you're recording them and

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.170 
teammate and you're recording them and
you're<00:04:58.830> behind<00:04:59.190> them<00:04:59.400> best<00:04:59.670> thing<00:04:59.760> to<00:04:59.880> do<00:04:59.970> is

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
you're behind them best thing to do is

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.690 
you're behind them best thing to do is
run<00:05:00.690> behind<00:05:00.840> them<00:05:01.080> with<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:01.230> c4<00:05:01.620> glitch<00:05:01.800> shows

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
run behind them with a c4 glitch shows

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.430 
run behind them with a c4 glitch shows
the<00:05:02.970> camera<00:05:03.390> motion<00:05:03.540> as<00:05:03.810> if<00:05:03.930> you're<00:05:04.050> running

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
the camera motion as if you're running

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.470 
the camera motion as if you're running
and<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:05.550> gives<00:05:05.670> a<00:05:05.760> little<00:05:05.910> wiggle<00:05:06.180> that

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
and it gives a little wiggle that

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.700 
and it gives a little wiggle that
natural<00:05:06.900> wiggle<00:05:07.140> in<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.260> games<00:05:07.440> you<00:05:07.590> don't

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
natural wiggle in the games you don't

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.650
