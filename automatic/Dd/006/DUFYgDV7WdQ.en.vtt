00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.869

 I'm talking about concentration 510 last time is 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.610
 It seemed to be here in this video it was 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.480
 absolutely wonderful soup cream soup from 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.099
 champignon 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.950
 if you look at today's release on 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.780
 the tablet does not need to grit its teeth in all 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.149

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.960

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:42.469
 video description so now summer and now 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.149

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.579
 sweet aromatic tomatoes 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.710
 and in the winter of tomatoes whether my all 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.719
 plastic tomatoes and such 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.969
 nonsense happens not only in the edge of a dream 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.789
 green tomatoes and throughout the Mediterranean 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.579
 and local residents have long mastered 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.530
 awesome way to harvest these 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.320
 elite kids and bushes tomatoes for the winter 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.780
 they tie them up and keep them 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.120
 dried in bags as much as 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.250
 need and when you want 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.690
 enjoy this summer taste poured 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.060
 olive oil add a little 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.520
 spice quarrel and happy cod 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.580
 two weeks later in our area in the summer 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.950
 the heat is under 40 degrees so they 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.410
 tied for a couple of weeks just under 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.490
 bright sun shielded from down of course if 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.950
 same your edges 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.990
 the weather years will make her a way 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.460
 Cope quickly go to the workers 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.590
 I will tell all the places and show them to start 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.710
 a couple of words about tomatoes for tying 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.630
 best mrs you and varieties in 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.000
 which is little juice and 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.080
 a lot of pulp here are swept 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.240
 quite good 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.490
 it is important to choose tomatoes for tying 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.660
 integers with no signs of decay or 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.730
 god forbid mold 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.220
 one such spoiled tomato 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.200
 infect the whole bag with spores therefore 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.240
 choose carefully to start tomatoes 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.040
 need to be thoroughly washed and already done 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.500
 now an important point 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.750
 when drying the tomato skin outside 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.490
 dries quickly to lightly notice 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.950
 this process and so the difference between 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.800
 the inside of the tomato is softer 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.340
 And the pelt on dryness was not such 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.560
 perceptible 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.020
 I grease all tomatoes with olive oil 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.230
 without fanaticism if you brought these 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.550
 tomatoes for perpetual storage and 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.440
 going to keep dry 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.990
 you don’t need to lubricate anything now 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.270
 cut into quarters 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.320
 these digging places can be cut off 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.459
 but you can not touch as you more 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.040
 like the next stage if you have 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.820
 tomatoes are very fleshy and juice them 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.790
 Molotovs 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.420
 this stage is skipping my juice 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.060
 a bit too much 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.900
 so I will remove the core leaving 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.480
 only these 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.520
 Mrs you and skins and all the insides 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.040
 later I will shred a blender and fell to 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.480
 thickening our cast perfectly 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.110
 calmly you can buy already for dried 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.550
 tomatoes and I met on sale as 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.320
 core soldiers with seeds and without 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.720
 it, I recommend you try 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.030
 half cooked without seeds 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.959
 And second plan seeds and choose later 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.320
 what do you like more 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.989
 By the way, you can not tile with a knife 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.140
 just with your fingers like that 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:18.560
 all seeds with excess liquid from 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.680
 tomato she is faster and more pulp on 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.150
 tomatoes will remain see for yourself how 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.500
 you are more comfortable in general 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.200
 I lay a baking sheet of paper and lay out 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.560
 I have a lot of tomatoes , so I’ll put 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.560
 more tightly 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.180
 On our sun tomatoes can be quite 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.370
 dry in the dehydrator if someone 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.990
 missed for this video this in detail 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.730
 He was shown all told about him 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.950
 they dry about one in it 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.190
 week in the oven of course everything is much 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.710
 faster hours five or six enough immediately 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.840
 add salt and especially salt to participate 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.400
 no further options 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.010
 if you live in a hot climate 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.200
 are you going to dry them in the sun then right 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.810
 now they can be sprinkled with spices 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.660
 if you do it in the oven 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.910
 now you should not add spices 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.520
 the temperature is too high for them and them 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.530
 lose the lion's share of their flavor 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.980
 I put in the oven temperature 95 100 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.630
 degrees not very fan on 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.700
 do not let the door completely close 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.920
 there will be a little chelochka then wet 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.900
 the air will go away 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.540
 the drying process has begun only remains 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.460
 wait recommend you dry them immediately 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.020
 a large number of scores all 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.760
 baking under the string because 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.220
 it turns out the tomatoes are very tasty and 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.100
 eaten not outrageously quickly passed 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.440
 5 hours see what happened if you 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.850
 immediately going to pour oil on 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.860
 my taste is not worth listening to 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.260
 victory will be too 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.560
 hard feel for the middle ground 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.920
 which you like more smell 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.920
 fine 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:03.919
 now they have a very bright taste here and 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:07.939
 sugar and sour and salt well, right 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.530
 there is almost no water left 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:14.090
 jar 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:20.439
 sprinkle each layer 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.439
 basil and oregano 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.930
 basil 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.810
 and the region to stack them better by denser 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.300
 mk and now it remains only to fill 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.940
 about fragrant olive oil 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.520
 in three in five days and butter 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.990
 soaked with all these flavors and 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.200
 tomatoes oil is absorbed and you can 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.270
 will eat right here I have miserable 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:53.820
 leftover real tomatoes previous 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:57.490
 party awesome taste just baldin and 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.410
 one makes absolutely beautiful 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.100
 pizza filling 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.220
 they can be added to bread dough and 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.380
 it turns out just fantastic 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:11.400
 on the basis of these tomatoes are obtained 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.590
 absolutely amazing pasta sauces 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.120
 for example, if someone has not seen this 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.250
 video I showed how to make sauce 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.380
 marinara based marinara sauce 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.810
 just adding there red sharp 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.940
 pepper it turns out a cool hookah 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:29.410
 sauce radiator I once looked like 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.170
 quite class italian sometimes by us 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.450
 about him I have said John lasso then 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.550
 did this very orbit guys in translation 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.890
 from Italian means angry it 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.800
 analogue of our evil that is fast pasta 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:44.290
 so here he did this very operation not 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.630
 from fresh tomato adding pepper 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.840
 but from such clay I will also try 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:53.020
 so make just fantastic so 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.699

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:57.000

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.250
 Now I say for sure there are never such 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.220
 tomatoes did not try to cook 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:13.460
 and try this fantasy you will fall in love 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.260
