over the USB port now we're going to do

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.850 
over the USB port now we're going to do
a<00:01:59.670> safe<00:01:59.850> open<00:02:00.119> pry<00:02:00.149> tool<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.750> begin<00:02:01.649> lifting

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
a safe open pry tool and begin lifting

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.420 
a safe open pry tool and begin lifting
this<00:02:02.100> plastic<00:02:02.610> cover<00:02:02.820> around<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.780> battery

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
this plastic cover around the battery

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.710 
this plastic cover around the battery
you<00:02:05.430> don't<00:02:05.580> want<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> fully<00:02:05.910> remove<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.509> as

you don't want to fully remove this as

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.830 
you don't want to fully remove this as
the<00:02:07.410> battery<00:02:07.680> connection<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:09.030> folded<00:02:09.450> above

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the battery connection is folded above

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.449 
the battery connection is folded above
this<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.380> we'll<00:02:10.530> need<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.860> remove<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.160> battery

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
this so we'll need to remove the battery

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.020 
this so we'll need to remove the battery
first<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:12.570> by<00:02:12.690> lifting<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:14.430> housing<00:02:14.790> up<00:02:14.940> a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
first but by lifting the housing up a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.160 
first but by lifting the housing up a
little<00:02:15.209> bit<00:02:15.300> it'll<00:02:15.510> give<00:02:15.660> us<00:02:15.720> better<00:02:15.870> access

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
little bit it'll give us better access

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.810 
little bit it'll give us better access
to<00:02:16.440> release<00:02:17.130> some<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> adhesive

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
to release some of the adhesive

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.380 
to release some of the adhesive
underneath<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.720> battery<00:02:20.120> I'll<00:02:21.120> make<00:02:21.239> sure

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
underneath the battery I'll make sure

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.880 
underneath the battery I'll make sure
not<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.600> bend<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.930> battery<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.320> any<00:02:22.440> sort<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.830> way

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
most adhesives release we just bend it

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.409 
most adhesives release we just bend it
backwards<00:04:42.380> there<00:04:42.669> then<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.820> final<00:04:43.970> step<00:04:44.090> will

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
backwards there then the final step will

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.580 
backwards there then the final step will
be<00:04:44.449> to<00:04:44.630> release<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.889> power<00:04:46.550> button<00:04:46.699> up<00:04:47.060> here
