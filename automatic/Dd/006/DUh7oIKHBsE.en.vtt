00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
assassination missions similar to what

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.039 
assassination missions similar to what
we<00:01:53.399> did<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> story<00:01:54.270> mode<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:54.869> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
we did have in the story mode with that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.660 
we did have in the story mode with that
Lester<00:01:55.439> guy<00:01:55.590> I'd<00:01:55.770> imagine<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:56.549> of

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
Lester guy I'd imagine and then of

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.249 
Lester guy I'd imagine and then of
course<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:57.030> do<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.570> highest<00:01:57.750> which<00:01:58.049> we

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
course we do have the highest which we

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.249 
course we do have the highest which we
are<00:01:58.530> expecting<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.729> 2014<00:02:00.479> anyway<00:02:00.840> now

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
are expecting to have in 2014 anyway now

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.800 
are expecting to have in 2014 anyway now
with<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.619> DLC<00:02:02.130> assassination<00:02:03.030> missions<00:02:03.689> i

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
with this DLC assassination missions i

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.289 
with this DLC assassination missions i
would<00:02:04.020> imagine<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.860> may<00:02:05.130> possibly<00:02:05.640> create<00:02:06.180> a

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
would imagine this may possibly create a

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.210 
would imagine this may possibly create a
new<00:02:06.509> story<00:02:06.990> i<00:02:07.290> think<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.799> would<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:07.950> pretty

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
new story i think it would be pretty

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.609 
new story i think it would be pretty
awesome<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:09.000> course<00:02:09.179> when<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.390> do

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
awesome because of course when you do

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.760 
awesome because of course when you do
assassinations<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.739> do<00:02:10.920> earn<00:02:11.160> money

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
assassinations you do earn money

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.650 
assassinations you do earn money
so<00:02:11.890> if<00:02:11.950> this<00:02:12.040> will<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.370> course<00:02:12.520> up<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.210> stock

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
so if this will of course up the stock

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.660 
so if this will of course up the stock
market<00:02:14.020> in<00:02:14.140> GTA<00:02:14.530> online<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.220> it's<00:02:15.430> another

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
market in GTA online and it's another

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.550 
market in GTA online and it's another
way<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.150> make<00:02:16.300> more<00:02:16.690> money<00:02:16.810> because<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.410> know<00:02:17.470> a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
way to make more money because I know a

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.260 
way to make more money because I know a
lot<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.830> people<00:02:17.920> are<00:02:18.340> actually<00:02:18.520> saying<00:02:18.940> that

already<00:02:20.830> in<00:02:21.100> GTA<00:02:21.520> online<00:02:21.550> because<00:02:22.120> they're

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
already in GTA online because they're

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.030
