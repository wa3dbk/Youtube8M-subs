00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:15.424
 Apply base by spreading across face and pressing 

00:00:21.448 --> 00:00:23.440
 With a darker base begin to work around some areas of the face 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.622
 As well as the lateri of the nose, around the forehead, bone of the apple and bone of the jaw 

00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:32.475
 Spread well with the fingers giving a shade in the places 

00:00:32.693 --> 00:00:34.568
 Well then I'll be afraid if someone talks to me about the following 

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:36.922
 'This crap does not work, give me back my money! Now I can spend the money in bullets' 

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:39.071
 Use the dirty base sponge and lightly press on the shading 

00:00:44.487 --> 00:00:46.564
 Begin to illuminate the center of the nose with illuminator 

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:48.854
 Center of forehead, chin and under the eyes 

00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:53.127
 Spread well 

00:00:55.382 --> 00:00:57.683
 Do not forget this guy here, and use it gently on the illuminator 

00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:08.641
 Use the powder spreading across the face and fixing the make 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.516
 Put the concealer on the eyeball including the eyebrow bone 

00:01:22.397 --> 00:01:24.862
 Take the dark green shade and apply it to the outer corner of the eyes 

00:01:24.862 --> 00:01:27.343
 Once applied, just vanish towards the center 

00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:31.183
 Then use a little bit on the lower part of the eyes to fade towards the center 

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:38.235
 Take a lighter green and apply the other half by fading up the dark green 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.728
 Put a little in the lower part of the eyes on the dark green and 

00:01:41.728 --> 00:01:44.566
 Now with a proper brush to fade, precisely blurs the shadow from the inner corner to the outer 

00:01:45.474 --> 00:01:47.344
 Beware of blurring, the intention is to let your deeper look 

00:01:47.344 --> 00:01:50.157
 A small mistake can turn from deep eyes to sleepy eyes 

00:01:54.068 --> 00:01:56.175
 Apply a little black over the dark green 

00:01:57.062 --> 00:01:59.324
 At the bottom also, fading towards the center 

00:01:59.998 --> 00:02:02.646
 Take back your own brush to fade and prepare to really fade 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.047
 Pick up the dark green again 

00:02:09.047 --> 00:02:10.962
 Now apply it over black getting darker green 

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:13.521
 Mix the colors and blend well 

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:20.407
 Add a little white in the center of the eyes then spread a little 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.992
 Put a little on the eyebrow bone 

00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:26.063
 And now it blows it down breaking a little with the strong tone of the green 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.255
 Pull a thin line from the inner corner to the outer eye 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.440
 Also apply underneath following the black shadow 

00:02:41.913 --> 00:02:44.084
 Fill the water line 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.807
 Curl Eyelashes 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.518
 Cut the false eyelashes in half and glue at the end of the eye in the outer corner 

00:02:59.107 --> 00:03:01.133
 Take the eyeliner back 

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:03.628
 And apply over glued lashes covering the traces of glue 

00:03:08.075 --> 00:03:10.492
 Use the mascara on top to further enlarge the eyelashes 

00:03:10.492 --> 00:03:12.726
 In the lower part also 

00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:14.829
 Put your finger in there and ... I was just brinks 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.162
 Just return with the black shadow and do not forget to lick your finger 

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:18.312
 Draw a thin eyebrow like this 

00:03:18.312 --> 00:03:20.164
 Letting the end of it more erased and thin than the beginning of it 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:22.833
 Take these two shadows again 

00:03:23.554 --> 00:03:25.408
 First apply dark green at the beginning of the eyebrow 

00:03:25.408 --> 00:03:27.730
 Slowly merging colors and vanishing at the end 

00:03:28.463 --> 00:03:30.241
 'Chartreuse (name of the green shadow) I choose you!' 

00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:32.583
 Apply over the entire eyebrow by mixing the colors 

00:03:37.422 --> 00:03:39.543
 Use the blush at the top of the nose thus shading the sides of it 

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:43.302
 And of course apply in regions that were also shaded 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:52.098
 Draw your lips smaller than normal 

00:03:57.792 --> 00:03:59.620
 Just take some of the gloss 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.739
 Then apply on the lips giving brighter 

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:05.545
 Our black shadow friend wants to lend a hand 

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:07.482
 Add shade to the sides of the mouth 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.020
 Press the golden shadow in the center of the lips 

00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:17.760
 Use this again 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.124
 Now pass a concealer around the mouth giving an illuminated 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.798
 Take the sponge with base and mix the concealer with the base 

00:04:22.798 --> 00:04:24.711
 Pressing the sponge on it 

00:04:29.858 --> 00:04:31.763
 Mix the two aqua color creating that shade of green 

00:04:31.763 --> 00:04:33.586
 Add color to a thin pincushion and remove excess 

00:04:33.586 --> 00:04:36.554
 Now draw several clear V-shaped sheets with the color 

00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:39.529
 Now apply more green on the brush but without removing the excess 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.730
 And apply again giving an intensified color 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:44.693
 Add more black color in the blend creating that darker shade 

00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:48.083
 Draw more sheets randomly giving more realism to the painting 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.616
 Can not you draw a perfect circle? 

00:04:57.301 --> 00:04:59.264
 Then take the cap of aqua color 

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:01.261
 Which by the way has a circular format and do it here 

00:05:02.092 --> 00:05:03.012
 Daora this here right? 

00:05:03.012 --> 00:05:04.262
 Only not 

00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:06.352
 Fill in the red color leaving the part near the top and the bottom without coloring 

00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:10.777
 Take the black color and mix it a little with the red one creating a darker tone 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.319
 Apply the color on the sides 

00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:16.346
 Clean the brush before reusing 

00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:18.032
 And blow the color to the center before it dries completely 

00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:26.588
 It's a shame when the eyeliner finishes, at least now we have his brush that is useful 

00:05:26.588 --> 00:05:30.703
 Illuminate with the aqua white color on the bottom at the top and the most blurred areas 

00:05:35.027 --> 00:05:36.458
 Lightly faint the color as it was made with red 

00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:37.796
 But without erasing the white dot on the top and the surrounding lines 

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.188
 Do not be mad if you miss this step, just reapply the color in this case 

00:05:43.198 --> 00:05:44.741
 Do the same thing that was done with the red ball 

00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:46.815
 Pick up the white again 

00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:50.074
 Go back to the leaves and start to light them. 

00:05:54.834 --> 00:05:56.067
 Do you still remember that sponge? 

00:05:56.067 --> 00:05:58.874
 Press it with white color, giving texture and creating a snow effect 

00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.491
 Add a few dots on the painting 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:11.307
 Now give a magic touch with glitter 

00:06:13.697 --> 00:06:15.938
 Put on the cap and gloves, so it is finished!
