00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
have relations outside of your marriage

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.560 
have relations outside of your marriage
stuff<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.480> would

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
stuff like this and as you would

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.150 
stuff like this and as you would
probably<00:00:51.690> imagine<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> lot<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.590> being<00:00:52.710> Muslim

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
probably imagine a lot of being Muslim

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.920 
probably imagine a lot of being Muslim
rulers<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.850> Imams<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.510> stuff<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.750> that

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
rulers the Imams and stuff like that

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.569 
rulers the Imams and stuff like that
much<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.320> Christian<00:00:55.739> rulers<00:00:56.070> would

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
much like the Christian rulers would

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.310 
much like the Christian rulers would
very<00:00:56.910> often<00:00:57.149> indulge<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.989> things<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.199> they

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
very often indulge in things that they

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.740 
very often indulge in things that they
probably<00:00:58.949> shouldn't<00:00:59.309> have<00:00:59.430> what<00:01:00.210> happens<00:01:00.600> in

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
probably shouldn't have what happens in

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.590 
probably shouldn't have what happens in
this<00:01:01.140> case<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:02.070> Muslim<00:01:02.399> rulers<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.210> here

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
this case with Muslim rulers is up here

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.929 
this case with Muslim rulers is up here
where<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.989> little<00:01:04.170> grapevine<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.489> I

like a gloved hand and right here is the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.679 
like a gloved hand and right here is the
decadent<00:01:13.920> meter<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.850> see<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.570> can

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
decadent meter now as you see as you can

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.719 
decadent meter now as you see as you can
see<00:01:15.869> I'm<00:01:15.960> actually<00:01:16.200> gaining<00:01:16.890> decadence<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.580> bit

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
see I'm actually gaining decadence a bit

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.120 
see I'm actually gaining decadence a bit
but<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> way<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.900> lose<00:01:19.229> decadence<00:01:19.890> is

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
but the way that you lose decadence is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.340 
but the way that you lose decadence is
you<00:01:20.369> want<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> make<00:01:20.729> sure<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.150> were<00:01:21.479> family

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
you want to make sure that were family

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.440 
you want to make sure that were family
members<00:01:22.710> are<00:01:23.009> not<00:01:23.280> decadent<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> begin<00:01:24.270> with

members are not decadent to begin with
that<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.200> say<00:01:25.320> they<00:01:25.439> don't<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.710> traits

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
that is to say they don't have traits

that is to say they don't have traits
which<00:01:26.759> are<00:01:26.909> unappealing<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.470> head<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
which are unappealing to the head and

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.890 
this is probably the most effective way
if<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.740> can<00:03:03.890> afford<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.460> to<00:03:05.450> get<00:03:05.750> rid<00:03:05.870> of

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
if you can afford it to get rid of

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.930 
if you can afford it to get rid of
decadence<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.710> is<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:07.040> merely<00:03:07.370> give

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
decadence and that is to merely give

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.940 
decadence and that is to merely give
someone<00:03:08.570> at<00:03:08.690> County<00:03:09.080> so<00:03:09.530> for<00:03:09.650> instance<00:03:09.860> we

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
someone at County so for instance we

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.260 
someone at County so for instance we
don't<00:03:10.070> have<00:03:10.190> any<00:03:10.310> we<00:03:10.580> don't<00:03:10.760> have<00:03:10.850> an<00:03:10.910> example

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
don't have any we don't have an example

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.610 
don't have any we don't have an example
here<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.420> don't<00:03:11.600> actually<00:03:11.750> have<00:03:11.930> any<00:03:12.080> decadent

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
here I don't actually have any decadent

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.780 
here I don't actually have any decadent
relatives<00:03:12.950> that's<00:03:13.160> what<00:03:13.250> my<00:03:13.340> decadence<00:03:13.730> is

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
relatives that's what my decadence is

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.850 
relatives that's what my decadence is
that<00:03:13.910> 2%<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:14.990> let's<00:03:15.230> see<00:03:15.320> I<00:03:15.350> had<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.620> relative

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
that 2% but let's see I had a relative

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.990 
that 2% but let's see I had a relative
here<00:03:16.280> okay

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
here okay

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.520 
here okay
I<00:03:17.030> could<00:03:17.480> actually<00:03:17.540> right<00:03:17.870> click<00:03:17.900> on<00:03:18.230> him<00:03:18.380> and

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
I could actually right click on him and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.930 
I could actually right click on him and
if<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.740> had<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:18.920> county<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.430> give<00:03:19.580> him<00:03:19.730> I<00:03:19.790> could

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
if I had a county to give him I could

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.160 
if I had a county to give him I could
give<00:03:20.120> him<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.360> County<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:20.930> would<00:03:21.050> get

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
give him that County and that would get

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.800 
give him that County and that would get
rid<00:03:21.320> of<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.470> decadence<00:03:21.830> rating<00:03:22.390> right<00:03:23.390> away<00:03:23.630> I

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
rid of the decadence rating right away I

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.840 
rid of the decadence rating right away I
don't<00:03:23.870> know<00:03:24.230> why<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.620> is<00:03:24.830> maybe<00:03:25.490> because

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
don't know why that is maybe because

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.190 
don't know why that is maybe because
he's<00:03:25.970> since<00:03:26.270> he's<00:03:26.390> in<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.570> position<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.990> power

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
he's since he's in a position of power

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.920 
he's since he's in a position of power

his uh you know his negative traits
don't<00:03:30.170> really<00:03:30.440> matter<00:03:30.680> as<00:03:30.860> much<00:03:30.890> anymore<00:03:31.250> but

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
don't really matter as much anymore but

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.790 
don't really matter as much anymore but
a<00:03:31.850> lot<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.120> times<00:03:32.360> you'll<00:03:32.510> get<00:03:32.600> negative

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
a lot of times you'll get negative

and it's a lot easier to do that as a

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.550 
and it's a lot easier to do that as a
Muslim<00:04:05.480> because<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:05.780> can<00:04:05.900> imprison<00:04:06.170> just
