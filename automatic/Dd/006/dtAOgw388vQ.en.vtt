00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 the sporting aspect is a social aspect 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 but honestly we are also linked by the tt because we eat 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.590
 in some chords with or false face you were hoping for a lot of haiti not 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.749
 we were really 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:17.020
 I mean a project with sandy houses that you have that one of the poorest countries in the 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.720
 world I vote after three awards Brazil made a friendly 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.000
 centers years ago by tt d must still station even the civil war than now 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.739
 there is no more 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.079
 really such a poor country without the structure 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.730
 be hit an earthquake so lightning really a station 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.089
 tremendous for that 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:37.789
 younicef ​​would miss anything but you that moments that can contribute so much 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:38.490
 this 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.440
 to this emergency is certainly the flora von san francesco ravenna crif 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 important element who 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 is a would like and certainly contribute a present body that knows a lot 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.960
 sensitive click it nuto deflation my 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.730
 instead coming to football played 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.750
 a great victory but above all an important signal launched to the whole 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.350
 seven days from the worm 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.250
 looking to draw is taking for us sincerely I believe that 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.520
 the team every day I put a codec something have several event wins 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.470
 important 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.090
 and of great intelligence a behavior we say extraordinary from 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.320
 part of all the hotels that what our signal 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.070
 match after match 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.380
 emmmm now makes it to be above mind derby the inter film 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.039
 league name rankings 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:28.309
 for so long I believe it is bad not to think of our own city game 

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:29.250
 to maintain 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.400
 our game and after the accounts 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.490
 they always make the end but what do you fear most leonardo inter e 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.660
 his temperament his steel character his physical strength o 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.050
 simply milito 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.940
 but certainly within a team that all that 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.900
 what he said 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.990
 oo I believe what I count in these games are little details why 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.899
 have left in let's say of great tradition regardless also the 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:54.890
 position in 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.190
 in the ranking of the two teams in which cc excrement deck we compare the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.040
 moment that we are closer than I respect anna first Rome I believe it is 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.509
 are those games that do not have an almost trim history and the one that decks 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.890
 don't be focused on what we have to do apple releases aren't 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.600
 a takeover game a question on so many savona milan sarzana download in 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.180
 rebirth revival 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.240
 now, you too, a really wonderful place 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.029
 six counterparts 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:24.639
 look we are all happy and kate that 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:29.209
 the milan in primis secret a complaint give not exceed a continuity of 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.479
 extraordinary performance and I joked feels like that was missing and golf 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:37.879
 and the fairies made the one really prof 5 in two partitions 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.310
 weight is not very important given also how it is affecting 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:47.189
 hymns about the matches also because regardless of him there is really a 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.119
 let's dine single 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:53.779
 % of possibilities are really performance story behaviors 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.619
 extraordinary for what you think those and important results 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:00.139
 studio gino will come you should have a common interview in rome 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.619
 aldil &amp; agrave scandal that maybe we can talk about an interview - 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.869
 of novaledo let's hear in a moment to leonardo I wanted to ask you first 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:07.630
 one thing 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.310
 on the level of the game, even if once I remembered it I didn't love it 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.740
 it was particularly welcome it seems to me that the inter will be a little bit 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.310
 it can be said by copying the milan does not play with three attackers plus one player 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.500
 behind 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.389
 7 wait for this 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.799
 I have a sunday evening I think you never have a game in which we live 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.069
 also have a result 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.430
 in addition I was waiting for you, who can also aim for a draw, even if he recovers some 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.090
 what does it have to do to change a little 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.389
 also the common parts scheme 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.769
 but because there are so many inter 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.829
 empate alternatives I believe that so many possibilities of deployment for that 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.239
 I do not know later they will be other things to consider spam on their part than me 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:44.939
 I do not know 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.440
 but you have played many instruments in many ways 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.520
 results even when playing in different ways in modules 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.489
 there is to see to yield as it will behave not really because the thing 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.999
 more important to think about what we're doing focus on kos 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:05.499
 week we have before the derby id work try to be really 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:07.059
 all also in der der cognition 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.609
 we see it rovaldi we do not do it as such it is definitely leonardo I can 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.429
 comment before he runs off with you in the shoes round 

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:17.459
 okay because we wanted Romagna land before the daidaidaidai rooted vine 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.629
 I feel better like cakes in Barcelona 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.080
 you're right 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.360
 I feel very special coins of my life 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.889
 in my career 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.259
 I feel loved ones later when the crow arrives 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.270
 everything is alright 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.930
 9 goals scorer of this team a perfect offensive form you in the 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.930
 ideal location all perfect in this milan for now 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.259
 we have 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.599
 nos copy piles must work 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.150
 still a lot. 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.990
 no because 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.290
 contest the title but can have a bubble contest we can go far 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.669
 in all three packs 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.530
 see something has changed since last year was not the same in all wine 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:01.860
 they talk about the clubs in the evenings there had been that promise 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.180
 fatal president, what changes for verona - last year this year 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.689
 agreed 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.120
 norton given much I feel loved 2 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.080
 people had been great to me 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.080
 people like me 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.210
 happy by law to do without evil 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.879
 I still have text 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.740
 step of the moment who is marked when you arrive those 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.020
 the make the food of Milan happy 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.580
 before playing your old farm but come to San Siro 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.099
 to celebrate 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.839
 even before I play now I feel happy playing this move 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:41.919
 but g. now the derby the special game because the inter must be afraid 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.800
 of this milan 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.039
 within the strongest teams in the world 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.750
 the strongest trainer in the world is waiting for the exam 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:56.199
 it is our best with very respecto I have to slow to continue working like this 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.520
 congratulations 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.280
 but only one thing to make a beautiful here is the summary here if it is really 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.660
 I want to say this if you want I put a lot of necks on love and love 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:11.440
 friendship let's say the locker room synthesis can be represented ache 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.979
 throat 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.619
 from the recovery of this player 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:18.710
 I believe that love based on everything regardless of what we now have 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.630
 prop forget these remastered you had been born for some time now I have to 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.430
 weighing a reality title is making you that you have already recovered so many things 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.400
 mainly this tested smile let's say its trademark 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.150
 throughout his career because his joy also infected him 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.480
 all of us in have some of you for so many years just because it transmits a 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:39.129
 something very special today 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.900
