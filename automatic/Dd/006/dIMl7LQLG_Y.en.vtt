to<00:02:35.190> do<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> higher<00:02:35.610> MP<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:37.190> had<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.670> tested<00:02:39.510> it

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
to do a higher MP but I had I tested it

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.350 
to do a higher MP but I had I tested it
out<00:02:39.810> its<00:02:40.110> if<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.640> had<00:02:41.760> better<00:02:41.940> gear<00:02:42.150> would<00:02:42.239> be

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
out its if I had better gear would be

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.280 
out its if I had better gear would be
honestly<00:02:43.319> it'd<00:02:43.470> be<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> faster<00:02:44.099> way<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.250> farm

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
honestly it'd be a faster way to farm

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.220 
honestly it'd be a faster way to farm
but<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.319> have<00:02:46.560> not<00:02:46.769> found<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.610> gear

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
but I have not found that gear

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.960 
but I have not found that gear
especially<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:50.099> peace<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.730> set

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
especially like the for peace in a set

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.570 
especially like the for peace in a set
which<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.360> could<00:02:51.510> have<00:02:51.599> put<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:52.130> but<00:02:53.130> i<00:02:53.370> would

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
which I could have put on but i would

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:03.880 
which I could have put on but i would
have<00:02:53.610> had<00:02:53.849> less<00:02:54.180> damage<00:02:54.830> so<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.870> we<00:02:57.989> just<00:02:58.170> run

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.170 

and<00:03:04.890> that's<00:03:05.220> about<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.489> let's<00:03:05.790> see<00:03:05.910> if<00:03:05.970> we<00:03:06.090> can

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
and that's about it let's see if we can

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:14.240 
and that's about it let's see if we can
get<00:03:06.269> anything<00:03:06.510> from<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:06.870> gob<00:03:12.110> nothing<00:03:13.250> so

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
get anything from this gob nothing so

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.710 
get anything from this gob nothing so
also<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:14.880> good<00:03:15.120> build<00:03:15.329> if<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.569> guys

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
also this is a good build if you guys

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.500 
also this is a good build if you guys
are<00:03:15.900> running<00:03:16.019> low<00:03:16.470> on<00:03:16.500> gold<00:03:17.040> uh<00:03:17.400> maybe<00:03:18.150> if<00:03:18.390> you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
are running low on gold uh maybe if you

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.300 
are running low on gold uh maybe if you
can<00:03:18.630> get<00:03:18.810> some<00:03:18.989> pickup<00:03:19.349> radius<00:03:19.769> like<00:03:19.980> crafts

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
can get some pickup radius like crafts

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.970 
can get some pickup radius like crafts
and<00:03:20.459> items<00:03:21.329> with<00:03:21.420> pickup<00:03:21.720> radius<00:03:22.079> it's<00:03:22.739> a<00:03:22.799> good

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
and items with pickup radius it's a good

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.069 
and items with pickup radius it's a good
way<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.190> be<00:03:24.000> able<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.239> get<00:03:24.420> gold<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:26.870> lot<00:03:27.870> faster

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
way of be able to get gold a lot faster

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.479 
way of be able to get gold a lot faster
because<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.650> won't<00:03:28.860> have<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.160> worry<00:03:29.370> about

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
because you won't have to worry about

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.660 
because you won't have to worry about
like<00:03:29.819> for<00:03:30.030> me<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.420> would<00:03:30.930> have<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.200> run<00:03:31.920> right

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
like for me I would have to run right

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.039 
like for me I would have to run right
over<00:03:32.730> top<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.390> if<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.780> have<00:03:33.870> pick<00:03:34.019> up

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
over top of it if you have pick up

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.849 
over top of it if you have pick up
radius<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:36.139> you'd<00:03:37.139> be<00:03:37.260> able<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.500> pick<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.680> up

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
radius of you'd be able to pick it up

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.449 
radius of you'd be able to pick it up
from<00:03:38.010> wider<00:03:38.790> ranges<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.720> that's<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:40.310> that's<00:03:41.310> the

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
from wider ranges so that's a that's the

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:53.830 
from wider ranges so that's a that's the
best<00:03:41.670> part<00:03:41.880> about<00:03:42.060> it

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.929 

what<00:03:54.840> didn't<00:03:55.140> open<00:03:55.890> socket<00:03:56.099> and<00:03:56.459> I<00:03:56.700> know<00:03:56.760> that

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
what didn't open socket and I know that

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.250 
what didn't open socket and I know that
somebody<00:03:57.299> asked<00:03:57.569> you<00:03:57.659> know<00:03:57.780> why<00:03:57.930> do<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.110> want

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
somebody asked you know why do you want

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.649 
somebody asked you know why do you want
to<00:03:58.319> open<00:03:58.439> socket<00:03:58.879> so<00:03:59.879> that<00:03:59.909> you<00:04:00.299> could<00:04:00.450> put

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
to open socket so that you could put

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.360 
to open socket so that you could put
crit<00:04:01.140> damage<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.620> there<00:04:01.739> because<00:04:01.860> this<00:04:01.980> is<00:04:02.189> you

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
crit damage on there because this is you

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.350 
crit damage on there because this is you
know<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.579> is<00:04:02.849> a<00:04:02.879> CD<00:04:03.329> base<00:04:04.700> CC<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:06.000> cd-based

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
know it is a CD base CC and cd-based

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.559 
know it is a CD base CC and cd-based
build<00:04:06.840> with<00:04:07.530> low<00:04:07.709> attack<00:04:08.040> speed<00:04:08.420> I'm<00:04:09.420> you

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
build with low attack speed I'm you

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.170 
build with low attack speed I'm you
definitely<00:04:09.900> want<00:04:10.019> to<00:04:10.049> have<00:04:10.230> life<00:04:10.500> steal<00:04:10.890> um

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
that's going to make a lot of this build

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:19.159 
that's going to make a lot of this build
much<00:04:16.919> easier<00:04:17.400> for<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.209> won't<00:04:18.509> be

much easier for you so you won't be

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.770 
much easier for you so you won't be

this northern breeze you could actually
do<00:05:18.419> tailwind<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.229> you'd<00:05:20.099> be<00:05:20.250> able<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.580> move<00:05:20.760> at

do tailwind and you'd be able to move at
fifty<00:05:21.539> percent<00:05:21.900> basically<00:05:22.760> almost<00:05:26.539> and<00:05:28.039> then

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
fifty percent basically almost and then

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.980 
fifty percent basically almost and then
you<00:05:29.699> would<00:05:29.820> be<00:05:29.849> able<00:05:30.210> to<00:05:30.330> change<00:05:30.570> up<00:05:30.720> inter

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
so let's take a look at the build one

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.570 
so let's take a look at the build one
more<00:05:41.400> time<00:05:41.639> I<00:05:42.110> use<00:05:43.110> fists<00:05:43.500> of<00:05:43.800> thunder<00:05:44.400> with

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
more time I use fists of thunder with

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.060 
more time I use fists of thunder with
thunderclap<00:05:45.289> tempest<00:05:46.289> Russian<00:05:46.530> I<00:05:46.590> put<00:05:46.770> on<00:05:46.860> our

two<00:05:47.280> because<00:05:47.490> it's<00:05:47.669> a<00:05:47.729> lot<00:05:47.970> easier<00:05:48.210> just<00:05:48.570> to

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
two because it's a lot easier just to

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.180 
two because it's a lot easier just to

with northern breeze because it does

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.550 
with northern breeze because it does
reduce<00:05:52.530> the<00:05:52.889> cost<00:05:53.099> of<00:05:53.340> the<00:05:53.810> tender<00:05:54.810> siraj<00:05:55.080> 28
