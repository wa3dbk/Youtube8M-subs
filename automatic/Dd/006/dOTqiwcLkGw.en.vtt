settings and you want to scroll down to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.979 
settings and you want to scroll down to
security<00:00:40.949> you<00:00:41.940> want<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.210> make<00:00:42.329> sure<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.750> have

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
security you want to make sure you have

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.160 
security you want to make sure you have
unknown<00:00:43.500> sources<00:00:44.280> checked<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.539> way<00:00:45.780> it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
unknown sources checked that way it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.689 
unknown sources checked that way it
allows<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> install<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:47.520> this

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
allows you to install this because this

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.509 
allows you to install this because this
is<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:48.000> an<00:00:48.239> app<00:00:48.390> store<00:00:48.539> official<00:00:49.350> app<00:00:49.530> so

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
is not an app store official app so

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.310 
is not an app store official app so
that's<00:00:50.670> why<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.140> then

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
that's why you have to do that so then

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.689 
that's why you have to do that so then
what<00:00:52.500> you're<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.649> want<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
what you're gonna want to do is go to

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.389 
what you're gonna want to do is go to
your<00:00:54.420> web<00:00:54.719> browser<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> poem<00:00:56.190> this
