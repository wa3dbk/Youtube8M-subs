 any game the truth that I do not 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.860
 which interest I entered because this 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.360
 the only thing that changes is the 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.160
 candidate while there comes in a good 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.280
 part as by sea and that's when 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.810
 people start entering and two came out 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.300
 people because you see that there were few 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.220
 people but there it filled up very fast 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.530
 good yes but the server and now I'm going to 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.090
 start counting and how to repeat 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.620
 clean up the description now what 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.120
 explaining is how is this and also 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.690

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.620
 battle so compete using the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.590
 inventory and knows what the creative is 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.850
 you know that but in the urine mini 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.310
 explanation of how this is basically 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.660
 it's vile battle and wait more players 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.140
 we are minimum 4 frames and we are 11 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.599
 us things starting in 5 4 3 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.459
 21 and start guys now what's going for us 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.800
 to say is that for example build a 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.110
 come to the right appears god forgiveness 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.660
 below left appears to us 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.900
 opposite in the game its stability 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.770
 maps forest creative good luck luck 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.000
 where the right seems to eat time that 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.770
 we have five minutes left 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.020
 popcorn players 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.950
 11 good let's see it for example color 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.950
 Red 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.720
 so let's grab white wool 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.870
 all right 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.400
 h 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 h 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.780
 Y 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.160
 to spend 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.460
 good as you can see we're done 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.590
 now we are all since we 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.030
 let's go and well what I do not like 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.940
 because he moved us and left us in this 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.800
 place but good as I say now 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.320
 we started to vote and how to buy we have 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.310
 super pop we have pop we have 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:42.610
 we have good and ethical good legendary 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:45.639
 good to see this honestly not 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.020
 we also have known the origin and 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.719
 this would be basically and now they come 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.520
 voting by a rapid camera 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:53.610
 because neither to be here in this 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.919
 room but 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.400
 and well let's see more or less what happens 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.400
 with people 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:12.139
 Y 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.139
 i 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.470
 yes 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.199
 because in the end as you can see they appear 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.479
 computers appear first jonathan 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:39.990
 second and third but they are perfectly 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.990
