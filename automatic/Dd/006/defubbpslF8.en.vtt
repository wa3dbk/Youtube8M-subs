something<00:03:11.940> right<00:03:12.390> now<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:12.900> that's<00:03:13.140> why<00:03:13.320> my

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
something right now so that's why my

Wi-Fi<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.670> little<00:03:15.450> bit<00:03:15.600> slower<00:03:15.930> but<00:03:17.660> that's

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
Wi-Fi is a little bit slower but that's

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.150 
Wi-Fi is a little bit slower but that's
the<00:03:18.930> browser<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.880> phone<00:03:21.390> app<00:03:21.810> actually<00:03:22.620> looks

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
the browser the phone app actually looks

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.080 
the browser the phone app actually looks

see<00:03:38.760> what<00:03:39.090> else<00:03:39.239> do<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.510> need<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.870> talk<00:03:40.110> about

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
see what else do I need to talk about

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.020 
see what else do I need to talk about
I've<00:03:40.709> already<00:03:40.950> talked<00:03:41.310> about<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.670> camera

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
I've already talked about the camera

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.590 
I've already talked about the camera
this<00:03:42.239> thing<00:03:42.480> has<00:03:42.750> eco<00:03:43.380> mode<00:03:43.680> which<00:03:44.489> is<00:03:45.060> like<00:03:45.570> a

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
this thing has eco mode which is like a

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.890 
this thing has eco mode which is like a
power<00:03:45.930> saving<00:03:46.470> mode<00:03:46.500> which<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.579> by<00:03:47.910> default<00:03:48.150> it

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
power saving mode which on by default it

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.199 
power saving mode which on by default it
kicks<00:03:49.290> in<00:03:49.560> at<00:03:49.769> twenty<00:03:50.190> percent<00:03:50.640> whenever<00:03:51.090> the

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
kicks in at twenty percent whenever the

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.380 
kicks in at twenty percent whenever the
battery<00:03:51.510> reaches<00:03:51.989> twenty<00:03:52.290> percent<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.430> I

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
battery reaches twenty percent and I

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.560 
battery reaches twenty percent and I
think<00:03:55.079> I've<00:03:55.230> only<00:03:55.410> had<00:03:55.739> it<00:03:55.799> go<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.790> eco<00:03:57.299> mode

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
think I've only had it go to eco mode

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.830 
think I've only had it go to eco mode
probably<00:03:58.610> once<00:03:59.610> or<00:03:59.790> twice<00:04:00.000> since<00:04:00.420> I've<00:04:00.630> had

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
probably once or twice since I've had

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.819 
probably once or twice since I've had
this<00:04:01.079> phone<00:04:01.790> so<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.720> battery<00:04:04.079> actually<00:04:04.320> does

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
this phone so the battery actually does

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.210 
this phone so the battery actually does
pretty<00:04:05.130> good<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:07.459> it<00:04:08.459> comes<00:04:08.730> with<00:04:09.079> Google+

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
pretty good and it comes with Google+

but it does have an actual voicemail app
which<00:04:49.770> is<00:04:50.039> pretty<00:04:50.250> cool<00:04:51.740> but<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:53.180> really<00:04:54.180> don't

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
which is pretty cool but I really don't

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.939 
which is pretty cool but I really don't
know<00:04:54.479> what<00:04:54.629> else<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.870> say<00:04:55.110> it's<00:04:55.319> a<00:04:55.440> good<00:04:55.680> phone

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
know what else to say it's a good phone

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.420 
know what else to say it's a good phone
I'd<00:04:56.639> probably<00:04:56.940> give<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.569> six<00:04:57.930> or<00:04:58.199> seven<00:04:58.680> out

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
I'd probably give it a six or seven out

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.809 
I'd probably give it a six or seven out
of<00:04:59.490> ten<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.710> that's<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.830> reason<00:05:02.220> for<00:05:02.639> that<00:05:02.669> is

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
of ten and that's the reason for that is

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:09.020 
of ten and that's the reason for that is
um<00:05:06.139> instead<00:05:07.139> of<00:05:07.169> like<00:05:08.039> a<00:05:08.069> five<00:05:08.669> megapixel

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
um instead of like a five megapixel

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.899 
um instead of like a five megapixel
camera<00:05:09.840> like<00:05:10.020> most<00:05:10.430> virgin<00:05:11.430> mobile<00:05:11.460> phones

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
camera like most virgin mobile phones

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.570 
camera like most virgin mobile phones
come<00:05:12.180> with<00:05:12.210> this<00:05:12.539> only<00:05:12.810> has<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.110> 3.2<00:05:13.800> megapixel

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
light sensor which you probably can't

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.110 
light sensor which you probably can't
see<00:05:44.039> in<00:05:44.310> the<00:05:44.430> video<00:05:44.699> and<00:05:45.319> on<00:05:46.319> top<00:05:46.919> it<00:05:47.219> has<00:05:47.250> a<00:05:47.400> 3.5

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
see in the video and on top it has a 3.5

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.950 
see in the video and on top it has a 3.5
millimeter<00:05:48.979> headphone<00:05:49.979> jack<00:05:50.639> the<00:05:51.479> power

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
millimeter headphone jack the power

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.040 
millimeter headphone jack the power
button<00:05:52.349> the<00:05:53.190> speaker<00:05:53.880> is<00:05:53.909> right<00:05:54.509> on<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:54.840> back
