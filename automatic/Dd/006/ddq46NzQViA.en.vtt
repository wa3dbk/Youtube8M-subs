00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.110 

it's<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.890> twist<00:02:00.130> out<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.580> did<00:02:00.730> on<00:02:00.820> dry<00:02:01.090> hair

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
it's a twist out that I did on dry hair

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.920 
it's a twist out that I did on dry hair
I've<00:02:01.570> always<00:02:02.580> done<00:02:03.580> my<00:02:03.610> twist<00:02:04.060> outs<00:02:04.270> on<00:02:04.570> wet

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
I've always done my twist outs on wet

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.510 
I've always done my twist outs on wet
hair<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.350> couldn't<00:02:05.710> figure<00:02:05.800> out<00:02:05.950> why<00:02:06.190> exactly

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
hair and couldn't figure out why exactly

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.200 
hair and couldn't figure out why exactly
I<00:02:06.790> didn't<00:02:07.060> like<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.240> but<00:02:08.110> I've<00:02:08.380> learned<00:02:09.210> and

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
I didn't like it but I've learned and

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.770 
I didn't like it but I've learned and
then<00:02:10.420> my<00:02:10.600> hair<00:02:10.960> is<00:02:11.260> more<00:02:11.590> fuller<00:02:11.920> on

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
then my hair is more fuller on

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.660 
then my hair is more fuller on
withdrawing<00:02:13.780> twist<00:02:14.080> outs<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.650> looks<00:02:15.370> longer

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
withdrawing twist outs it looks longer

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.330 
withdrawing twist outs it looks longer
because<00:02:16.510> my<00:02:16.720> hair<00:02:16.960> is<00:02:16.990> so<00:02:17.320> much<00:02:17.680> prone<00:02:18.070> to

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
because my hair is so much prone to

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.450 
because my hair is so much prone to
shrinkage<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:20.080> just<00:02:20.830> didn't<00:02:21.130> look<00:02:21.160> great

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
shrinkage that it just didn't look great

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.730 
shrinkage that it just didn't look great
it<00:02:22.060> made<00:02:22.210> my<00:02:22.330> hair<00:02:22.480> look<00:02:22.750> really<00:02:23.140> short<00:02:23.500> and

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
it made my hair look really short and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.880 
it made my hair look really short and
made<00:02:23.920> my<00:02:24.070> hair<00:02:24.630> have<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.660> lot<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.900> spaces<00:02:26.320> and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
made my hair have a lot of spaces and

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.740 
made my hair have a lot of spaces and
gaps<00:02:27.160> when<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.550> part<00:02:27.940> my<00:02:27.970> hair<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.480> could<00:02:28.570> see

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
gaps when I part my hair you could see

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.840 
gaps when I part my hair you could see

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
if I tried to pick it out too much then

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.610 
if I tried to pick it out too much then
it<00:02:33.280> wasn't<00:02:33.850> curly<00:02:34.510> enough<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:35.440> get

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
pressed it so that i can trim it and

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.560 
pressed it so that i can trim it and
when<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.730> trimmed<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:26.730> no<00:03:27.730> where's<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:28.420> piece

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
when I trimmed it no where's that piece

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.840 

it<00:03:34.720> seems<00:03:35.110> like<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.740> was<00:03:35.860> shorter<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:36.670> it's

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
it seems like it was shorter so it's

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.070 
it seems like it was shorter so it's
grown<00:03:37.150> back<00:03:37.180> already<00:03:38.880> my<00:03:39.880> imbrose<00:03:40.240> really

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
really fast but you can't tell if it's

wet or if I'm doing a wet look just

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.700 
wet or if I'm doing a wet look just
because<00:03:45.670> my<00:03:46.330> hair<00:03:46.510> shrinks<00:03:46.840> up<00:03:46.960> so<00:03:47.200> much<00:03:47.380> but

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
like it's run overnight but they just

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.420 
like it's run overnight but they just
don't<00:03:57.370> realize<00:03:57.490> that<00:03:58.240> it's<00:03:59.170> not<00:03:59.380> growing<00:04:00.220> any

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430

faster<00:04:00.850> than<00:04:01.030> any<00:04:01.180> other<00:04:02.100> hair<00:04:03.100> but<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.240> just

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
faster than any other hair but it just

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.570 
faster than any other hair but it just
appears<00:04:05.230> different<00:04:05.770> all<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:05.980> time<00:04:06.160> just

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
appears different all the time just

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.410 
appears different all the time just
because<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.140> shrinkage<00:04:08.140> um<00:04:09.270> let's<00:04:10.270> see

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
this side no I'm sorry this side is

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.190 
this side no I'm sorry this side is
longer<00:04:49.390> and<00:04:50.550> more<00:04:51.550> fuller<00:04:51.880> than<00:04:52.270> on<00:04:52.690> this<00:04:52.930> side

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
longer and more fuller than on this side

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.890 
longer and more fuller than on this side
and<00:04:53.560> that's<00:04:53.950> because<00:04:54.220> when<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.210> lady<00:04:55.420> trim<00:04:55.750> my

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
and that's because when the lady trim my

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.920 
and that's because when the lady trim my
hair<00:04:55.930> last<00:04:56.410> March<00:04:57.270> she<00:04:58.270> trimmed<00:04:58.510> it<00:04:58.630> in<00:04:58.750> layers

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
hair last March she trimmed it in layers

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.850 
hair last March she trimmed it in layers
but<00:04:59.560> this<00:04:59.830> side<00:05:00.070> was<00:05:00.540> shorter<00:05:01.650> for<00:05:02.650> some

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
but this side was shorter for some

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.530 
but this side was shorter for some
reason<00:05:03.190> she<00:05:03.310> didn't<00:05:03.490> cut<00:05:03.610> it<00:05:03.730> even<00:05:04.030> at<00:05:04.120> all<00:05:04.270> and

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
reason she didn't cut it even at all and

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.250 
reason she didn't cut it even at all and
so<00:05:05.350> when<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:05.590> pressed<00:05:06.430> my<00:05:06.550> help<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.990> layers

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
so when I pressed my help the layers

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.980 
so when I pressed my help the layers
were<00:05:08.710> really<00:05:09.040> pretty<00:05:09.280> but<00:05:10.150> it<00:05:10.330> was<00:05:10.540> lopsided

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
were really pretty but it was lopsided

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.700 
were really pretty but it was lopsided
and<00:05:11.680> I<00:05:11.800> don't<00:05:12.010> think<00:05:12.250> that<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:12.430> want<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:13.380> even<00:05:14.380> it

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
and I don't think that I want to even it

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.590 
and I don't think that I want to even it
out<00:05:14.830> just<00:05:15.070> right<00:05:15.310> now<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:15.760> maybe<00:05:15.970> once<00:05:16.270> my<00:05:16.420> hair

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
out just right now so maybe once my hair

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.540 
out just right now so maybe once my hair
grows<00:05:16.900> longer<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:17.620> it's<00:05:17.740> to<00:05:17.980> my<00:05:18.130> shoulders

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
grows longer and it's to my shoulders

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.790 
grows longer and it's to my shoulders
I'll<00:05:18.700> feel<00:05:18.880> more<00:05:19.060> comfortable<00:05:19.390> cutting<00:05:20.380> it<00:05:20.650> at

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
I'll feel more comfortable cutting it at

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.600 
I'll feel more comfortable cutting it at
that<00:05:21.040> point<00:05:21.400> but<00:05:21.760> not<00:05:22.660> right<00:05:22.870> now<00:05:22.900> um<00:05:23.610> let's

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610
