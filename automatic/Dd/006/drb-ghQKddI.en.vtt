pretty much just a single player
football<00:01:11.430> game<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.409> there<00:01:13.409> are<00:01:13.500> where<00:01:13.770> some

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799

enhancements made to this to make it

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.999 
enhancements made to this to make it
simpler<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.220> choose<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:19.200> think

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
simpler if you so choose but I think

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.770 
simpler if you so choose but I think
that<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> lot<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> critics<00:01:21.150> out<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.600> have

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that a lot of the critics out there have

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.109 
that a lot of the critics out there have
neglected<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.439> understand<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.850> has

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
neglected to understand that this has

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.600

all<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.360> standard<00:01:24.689> Madden<00:01:25.409> modes<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
all the standard Madden modes in it and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
all the standard Madden modes in it and
you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.570> control<00:01:28.140> everything

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
you can can you can control everything

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.050 
you can can you can control everything
with<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.310> traditional<00:01:30.290> Madden<00:01:31.290> scheme<00:01:32.060> which

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
with a traditional Madden scheme which

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.550 
with a traditional Madden scheme which
is<00:01:33.090> how<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> choose<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.110> play<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.500> game<00:01:36.560> but

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
have is an option and it is in the lower

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.890 
have is an option and it is in the lower

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
screen so you can't see right now you

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.140 
screen so you can't see right now you
can<00:02:21.050> choose<00:02:21.260> between<00:02:21.410> 11<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.130> 11<00:02:22.160> or<00:02:22.580> 5<00:02:22.760> on<00:02:22.970> 5

simplification I was telling you about

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.260 
simplification I was telling you about
so<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:27.920> choose<00:02:28.100> 11<00:02:28.520> on<00:02:28.640> 11<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.090> it's

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
so just choose 11 on 11 and it's

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.420 
so just choose 11 on 11 and it's
standard<00:02:29.750> football<00:02:30.530> standard<00:02:31.070> Madden

so here we are in the new Cowboys
Stadium<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:52.420> this<00:02:53.420> game<00:02:53.630> has<00:02:53.660> some<00:02:54.050> very<00:02:54.350> very

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
Stadium and this game has some very very

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.120 
Stadium and this game has some very very
good<00:02:54.920> 3d<00:02:55.730> effects<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.480> think<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.620> people<00:02:57.860> have

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
good 3d effects I think that people have

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.460 
good 3d effects I think that people have
criticized<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.150> 3d<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.780> this<00:02:59.960> game<00:03:00.170> because

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
criticized the 3d in this game because

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.680 
criticized the 3d in this game because
it<00:03:00.590> is<00:03:00.710> very<00:03:00.980> intense<00:03:01.520> because<00:03:01.850> there<00:03:02.600> are

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
it is very intense because there are

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.380 
it is very intense because there are
some<00:03:02.900> strong<00:03:04.570> variations<00:03:05.570> between

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
some strong variations between

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.850 
some strong variations between
foreground<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.810> background<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.560> things

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
foreground and background and things

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.010 
foreground and background and things
like<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.670> titles<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.240> logos<00:03:11.630> that<00:03:11.840> come

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
like that the titles and logos that come

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.550 
like that the titles and logos that come
up<00:03:12.170> like<00:03:12.350> these<00:03:12.590> are<00:03:13.960> really<00:03:14.960> in<00:03:15.200> your<00:03:15.290> face

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
up like these are really in your face

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.850 
up like these are really in your face
and<00:03:15.830> then<00:03:16.490> it<00:03:16.820> has<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> really<00:03:18.110> strong<00:03:18.170> depth<00:03:18.710> of

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
and then it has a really strong depth of

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.710 
and then it has a really strong depth of
field<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.220> goes<00:03:19.340> off<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:19.880> actually<00:03:20.270> enjoy

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
field that goes off I actually enjoy

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.700 
field that goes off I actually enjoy
that<00:03:20.750> very<00:03:21.140> much

we're just mainly focusing on graphics
here<00:03:50.090> so

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.350

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
you can see the polygon count and the

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.020 
you can see the polygon count and the
graphical<00:04:01.330> capabilities<00:04:01.570> have<00:04:03.030> increased

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
graphical capabilities have increased

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.080 
graphical capabilities have increased
tremendously<00:04:04.710> over<00:04:05.710> what<00:04:05.890> we<00:04:06.040> we<00:04:06.670> were<00:04:06.790> able

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.080 
to have in the past with the previous DS
systems<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:10.750> that's<00:04:11.530> part<00:04:11.830> of<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.070> you<00:04:12.400> know

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
the new upgraded hardware that they have

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.910 
the new upgraded hardware that they have
in<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.640> 3ds<00:04:16.000> not<00:04:16.900> only<00:04:17.140> does<00:04:17.290> this<00:04:17.410> system<00:04:17.620> do

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
in the 3ds not only does this system do

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.270 
in the 3ds not only does this system do
3d<00:04:18.310> it's<00:04:18.520> also<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.959> know<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.110> huge<00:04:20.620> upgrade<00:04:20.890> as

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
3d it's also you know a huge upgrade as

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.090 
3d it's also you know a huge upgrade as
far<00:04:21.459> as<00:04:21.580> horsepower<00:04:22.420> and<00:04:22.720> that<00:04:23.500> really<00:04:23.770> shines

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
far as horsepower and that really shines

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.760 
far as horsepower and that really shines
in<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.400> game<00:04:24.580> like<00:04:24.790> this<00:04:25.230> where<00:04:26.230> you<00:04:26.380> get<00:04:26.500> like
