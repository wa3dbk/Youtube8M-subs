00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
sure it would it would take some really

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.080

deep<00:04:40.200> investigating<00:04:41.190> to<00:04:41.280> find<00:04:41.520> out<00:04:41.700> which<00:04:41.850> one

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
deep investigating to find out which one

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.860 
deep investigating to find out which one
is<00:04:42.300> actually<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.650> best<00:04:43.830> but<00:04:44.820> that<00:04:45.270> being<00:04:45.510> said

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
is actually the best but that being said

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.420 
is actually the best but that being said
you<00:04:46.200> cannot<00:04:46.680> go<00:04:46.920> wrong

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
you cannot go wrong

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.790 
you cannot go wrong
actually<00:04:47.760> with<00:04:47.880> any<00:04:48.090> any<00:04:48.600> one<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.080> those<00:04:49.380> three

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
actually with any any one of those three

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.540 
actually with any any one of those three
but<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.580> g4<00:04:51.150> is<00:04:51.180> next<00:04:52.110> level<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:53.010> have<00:04:53.130> manual

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
but the g4 is next level you have manual

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.730 
but the g4 is next level you have manual
controls<00:04:54.090> you<00:04:54.360> can<00:04:54.540> shoot<00:04:54.780> RAW<00:04:55.140> which<00:04:55.500> I

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
controls you can shoot RAW which I

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.440 
controls you can shoot RAW which I
really<00:04:55.950> don't<00:04:56.130> care<00:04:56.220> about<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.910> me<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.240> auto

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
really don't care about to me the auto

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.110 
really don't care about to me the auto
mode<00:04:57.870> just<00:04:58.170> works<00:04:58.380> fantastic<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.550> don't<00:05:00.030> need

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
mode just works fantastic I don't need

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.790 
mode just works fantastic I don't need
anything<00:05:00.420> more<00:05:00.630> than<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.080> auto<00:05:01.230> mode<00:05:01.500> it<00:05:01.740> has

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
anything more than the auto mode it has

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.090 
anything more than the auto mode it has
an<00:05:02.130> F<00:05:02.370> 1.8<00:05:03.240> aperture<00:05:03.810> which<00:05:04.440> for<00:05:04.830> those<00:05:04.950> who

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
an F 1.8 aperture which for those who

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.500 
an F 1.8 aperture which for those who
don't<00:05:05.310> know<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:05.670> means<00:05:05.850> it<00:05:06.000> lets<00:05:06.180> more<00:05:06.450> light

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
don't know that means it lets more light

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.780 
don't know that means it lets more light
into<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.170> sensor<00:05:07.590> so<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:08.250> get<00:05:08.520> better

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
into the sensor so you get better

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.210 
into the sensor so you get better
low-light<00:05:09.180> performance<00:05:09.530> but<00:05:10.530> also<00:05:10.560> gives<00:05:11.130> you

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
low-light performance but also gives you

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.130 
low-light performance but also gives you
that<00:05:11.250> great<00:05:11.580> depth<00:05:12.000> of<00:05:12.180> field<00:05:12.420> or<00:05:12.660> that<00:05:12.840> bokeh

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
that great depth of field or that bokeh

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.380 
that great depth of field or that bokeh
which<00:05:13.770> bokeh<00:05:14.280> gives<00:05:14.850> you<00:05:14.940> that<00:05:15.090> blurry

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
which bokeh gives you that blurry

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.540 
which bokeh gives you that blurry
background<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.230> the<00:05:16.740> foreground<00:05:16.770> nice<00:05:17.340> and

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
like vanilla Android

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.730 
like vanilla Android
I<00:06:42.070> don't<00:06:42.820> like<00:06:43.000> stock<00:06:43.390> I<00:06:43.690> like<00:06:44.020> a<00:06:44.200> few<00:06:44.470> bells

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.900 
and whistles in there and LG does that I
think<00:06:47.320> there's<00:06:47.860> a<00:06:47.920> few<00:06:48.190> updates<00:06:48.370> they<00:06:48.730> could

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
think there's a few updates they could

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.520 
think there's a few updates they could
do<00:06:49.030> probably<00:06:49.300> for<00:06:49.600> the<00:06:49.690> camera<00:06:50.140> like<00:06:50.290> what<00:06:50.440> the

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530 
do probably for the camera like what the

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.650 
do probably for the camera like what the
O<00:06:50.590> is<00:06:50.950> like<00:06:51.370> I<00:06:51.460> was<00:06:51.610> talking<00:06:52.030> about<00:06:52.090> they<00:06:52.510> could

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
O is like I was talking about they could

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.400 
O is like I was talking about they could
clean<00:06:52.900> that<00:06:52.960> up

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.410 
clean that up

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.380 
clean that up
but<00:06:53.890> overall<00:06:54.430> the<00:06:54.580> experience<00:06:54.670> has<00:06:55.240> been

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
but overall the experience has been

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.180 
but overall the experience has been
fantastic<00:06:55.690> I'm<00:06:56.470> not<00:06:56.590> gonna<00:06:56.740> get<00:06:56.860> too<00:06:57.040> deep

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
into battery life because battery life

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.900 
into battery life because battery life
has<00:06:59.020> been<00:06:59.170> okay<00:06:59.530> with<00:06:59.950> this<00:07:00.100> but<00:07:00.160> like<00:07:00.760> I<00:07:00.850> said
