objective might enjoy this I actually

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.000 
objective might enjoy this I actually
think<00:02:45.359> that<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:45.870> game<00:02:46.230> types<00:02:46.530> are<00:02:46.680> kind<00:02:46.919> of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
think that the game types are kind of

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.649 
think that the game types are kind of
similar<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.430> battlefields<00:02:48.120> rush<00:02:48.329> where<00:02:48.599> you

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
similar to battlefields rush where you

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.210 
similar to battlefields rush where you
have<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.930> complete<00:02:49.109> multiple<00:02:49.889> sets<00:02:50.129> of

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
have to complete multiple sets of

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.309 
have to complete multiple sets of
objectives<00:02:50.389> and<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.540> map<00:02:51.780> then<00:02:52.019> kind<00:02:52.230> of

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
objectives and the map then kind of

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.770 
objectives and the map then kind of
opens<00:02:52.709> up<00:02:52.889> as<00:02:53.099> you<00:02:53.250> kind<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:53.549> well<00:02:54.329> cross<00:02:54.599> those

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
opens up as you kind of well cross those

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.170 
opens up as you kind of well cross those
objectives<00:02:55.530> off<00:02:55.680> your<00:02:55.829> list<00:02:55.980> now<00:02:56.700> what<00:02:57.090> are

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
objectives off your list now what are

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.599 
objectives off your list now what are
those<00:02:57.269> objectives<00:02:57.840> well<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:59.099> kind<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.430> varies

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
those objectives well it kind of varies

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.280 
those objectives well it kind of varies

now<00:04:03.150> my<00:04:03.329> only<00:04:03.509> gripe<00:04:04.049> with<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.439> game<00:04:04.620> at<00:04:04.799> the

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
now my only gripe with the game at the

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.619 
now my only gripe with the game at the
moment<00:04:05.310> has<00:04:05.430> been<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.699> frequency<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.239> use

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
moment has been the frequency of use

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.420 
moment has been the frequency of use
with<00:04:06.870> some<00:04:07.079> of<00:04:07.199> the<00:04:07.290> more<00:04:07.530> powerful<00:04:07.979> special

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
with some of the more powerful special

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.039 
with some of the more powerful special
abilities<00:04:09.060> kind<00:04:09.299> of<00:04:09.359> like<00:04:09.449> the<00:04:09.569> airstrikes

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
abilities kind of like the airstrikes

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.170 
abilities kind of like the airstrikes
and<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.259> orbital<00:04:10.680> strikes<00:04:10.979> now<00:04:11.669> they're

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
and the orbital strikes now they're

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.089 
and the orbital strikes now they're
based<00:04:12.449> on<00:04:12.659> a<00:04:12.689> cooldown<00:04:13.169> timer<00:04:13.500> instead<00:04:13.979> of

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
based on a cooldown timer instead of

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.460 
based on a cooldown timer instead of
kind<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.400> total<00:04:14.790> per<00:04:14.970> life<00:04:15.209> so<00:04:15.840> they<00:04:15.870> do<00:04:16.139> have

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
kind of a total per life so they do have

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.680 
kind of a total per life so they do have
a<00:04:16.500> potential<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.250> be<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.430> bit<00:04:17.729> annoying<00:04:18.120> now

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
a potential to be a bit annoying now

question<00:04:29.969> for<00:04:30.240> this<00:04:30.569> game<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:31.020> going<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.199> be

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
question for this game is going to be

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.800 
question for this game is going to be
about<00:04:31.439> future<00:04:32.009> content<00:04:32.520> now<00:04:32.879> for<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.210> beta<00:04:33.509> with

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
about future content now for a beta with

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.839 
about future content now for a beta with
5<00:04:34.050> maps<00:04:34.349> and<00:04:34.620> multiple<00:04:34.979> game<00:04:35.159> modes<00:04:35.189> it<00:04:35.639> seems

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
5 maps and multiple game modes it seems

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.879 
5 maps and multiple game modes it seems
pretty<00:04:36.090> good<00:04:36.389> but<00:04:36.990> if<00:04:37.080> this<00:04:37.259> is<00:04:37.409> the<00:04:37.439> amount<00:04:37.740> of

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
pretty good but if this is the amount of

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.559 
pretty good but if this is the amount of
content<00:04:38.249> that<00:04:38.340> it's<00:04:38.550> going<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:38.729> have<00:04:38.939> that

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
content that it's going to have that

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.420 
content that it's going to have that
we're<00:04:39.689> going<00:04:39.779> to<00:04:39.870> see<00:04:40.020> over<00:04:40.289> time<00:04:40.319> then<00:04:41.129> I<00:04:41.219> kind

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
we're going to see over time then I kind

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.469 
we're going to see over time then I kind
of<00:04:41.460> doubt<00:04:41.610> this<00:04:41.789> game<00:04:41.999> is<00:04:42.090> going<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.240> end<00:04:42.419> up

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
of doubt this game is going to end up

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.929 
of doubt this game is going to end up
having<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.900> staying<00:04:43.139> power<00:04:43.639> only<00:04:44.639> time<00:04:44.789> is

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939 
having the staying power only time is

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.879 
having the staying power only time is
really<00:04:45.120> going<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.330> tell<00:04:45.479> them<00:04:45.659> now<00:04:46.409> this<00:04:46.710> game

to unlock other characters in game or
you<00:04:50.370> could<00:04:50.550> just<00:04:50.580> flat<00:04:50.849> out<00:04:50.879> by<00:04:51.240> them<00:04:51.479> you<00:04:51.749> know

some<00:04:52.080> people<00:04:52.110> hate<00:04:52.469> that<00:04:52.680> aspect<00:04:53.069> of

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:53.189 
some people hate that aspect of

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:54.950 
some people hate that aspect of
free-to-play<00:04:53.490> games<00:04:53.909> but<00:04:54.240> in<00:04:54.419> reality<00:04:54.599> that's

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
free-to-play games but in reality that's

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.450 
free-to-play games but in reality that's
how<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.169> developers<00:04:55.680> make<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.889> living<00:04:56.249> so<00:04:56.370> it

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
how the developers make a living so it

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.219 
how the developers make a living so it
doesn't<00:04:56.759> really<00:04:56.879> bother<00:04:56.999> me<00:04:57.330> not<00:04:57.870> to<00:04:57.990> mention

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
doesn't really bother me not to mention

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.420 
doesn't really bother me not to mention
the<00:04:58.319> base<00:04:58.499> characters<00:04:58.949> are<00:04:59.099> fairly

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
the base characters are fairly

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.769 
the base characters are fairly
competitive<00:04:59.849> against<00:05:00.300> some<00:05:00.479> of<00:05:00.509> the<00:05:00.629> other

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:00.779 
competitive against some of the other

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.159 
competitive against some of the other
stuff<00:05:01.050> so<00:05:01.229> it's<00:05:01.379> not<00:05:01.469> a<00:05:01.529> huge<00:05:01.889> deal<00:05:02.009> breaker<00:05:02.490> ah

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
stuff so it's not a huge deal breaker ah

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.480 
stuff so it's not a huge deal breaker ah
you<00:05:04.169> know<00:05:04.289> so<00:05:04.469> the<00:05:04.650> starting<00:05:05.009> classes<00:05:05.189> are

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
you know so the starting classes are

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.519 
you know so the starting classes are
pretty<00:05:05.669> good<00:05:05.909> on<00:05:06.120> and<00:05:06.479> I<00:05:06.689> really<00:05:07.199> like<00:05:07.379> the

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:07.529 
pretty good on and I really like the

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:08.570 
pretty good on and I really like the
fact<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:07.800> they<00:05:07.979> kind<00:05:08.189> of<00:05:08.219> give<00:05:08.370> you<00:05:08.460> these

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
fact that they kind of give you these

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.909 
fact that they kind of give you these
temporary<00:05:08.939> trial<00:05:09.479> characters<00:05:10.080> outside<00:05:10.830> of

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
temporary trial characters outside of

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:11.959 
temporary trial characters outside of
the<00:05:11.009> fact<00:05:11.159> they<00:05:11.279> let<00:05:11.460> you<00:05:11.580> know<00:05:11.669> if<00:05:11.729> you<00:05:11.819> want

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:11.969 
the fact they let you know if you want

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.580 
the fact they let you know if you want
to<00:05:12.060> buy<00:05:12.180> one<00:05:12.449> of<00:05:12.479> them<00:05:12.659> with<00:05:12.840> in-game<00:05:13.020> currency

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
to buy one of them with in-game currency

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.559 
to buy one of them with in-game currency
or<00:05:13.710> real<00:05:13.889> money<00:05:14.069> it<00:05:14.819> also<00:05:14.969> adds<00:05:15.270> some<00:05:15.479> nice

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
or real money it also adds some nice

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.439 
or real money it also adds some nice
variety<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:16.439> your<00:05:16.469> play<00:05:17.060> bottom<00:05:18.060> line<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.300> this

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
it's free so you don't really have

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.429 
it's free so you don't really have
anything<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.729> lose<00:05:20.909> and<00:05:21.270> another<00:05:21.990> perk<00:05:22.289> for

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:22.439 
anything to lose and another perk for

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:23.629 
anything to lose and another perk for
this<00:05:22.589> game<00:05:22.770> is<00:05:22.919> that<00:05:22.949> it<00:05:23.099> took<00:05:23.279> all<00:05:23.460> of<00:05:23.490> about

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
this game is that it took all of about

five<00:05:24.060> minutes<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.569> download<00:05:24.779> so<00:05:25.050> you're<00:05:25.169> not

five minutes to download so you're not

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.200 
five minutes to download so you're not
really<00:05:25.409> risking<00:05:25.830> any<00:05:26.009> of<00:05:26.370> your<00:05:26.550> time<00:05:26.789> or<00:05:27.060> any
