 2014 Huaracino Carnival Awards 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.559
 that was fulfilled in the facilities of 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.559
 little window is camps 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.080
 the ceremony was developed with 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.790
 normality where some 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.130
 complaints from representatives of the neighborhoods 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.080
 participants however passed the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.119
 hours and tempers warmed in the drink 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.250
 of the celebration frictions were generated 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.509
 verbal that ended with aggressions and 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.690
 not be satisfied with the results 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.489
 end of the carnival party the 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.989
 chairs and bottles flew out in 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.120
 a quarrel that generalized in the 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.559
 interior of the local representatives 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.910
 of the extension neighborhood sell in 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.070
 insults showed their 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.870
 dissatisfaction with the prizes for their 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.830
 representative that managed to be crowned as 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.830
 the queen of the carnival 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.219
 we can remember the only one that 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.440
 showed a little dissatisfied this in the 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.110
 maid the skins edition and with 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.780
 thick words his tone was the 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.180
 representative it seems to me that 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:10.600
 is the dad of the programming come 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:12.899
 where you wanted to, there are very few 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.899
 they 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.820
 they took advantage of the moment a group of 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.259
 prairie dwellers to do 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.329
 public their discrepancies with others 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.850
 neighborhoods that overshadowed the carnival party 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.619
 in its final stage that is expected not to be 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.869
 causal gave reason why nobody 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.579
 incoming sponsoring companies will 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.329
 move away 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.530
 totally from us and between the 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.530
 prairie a boy 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.549
 identically bayern in our 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.220
 training sell that stop taking place 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.130
 and that the directors their managers of 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.810
 prolongation sold are those that the 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.080
 event and moving people when I 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.640
 I wanted people to be calm that 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.250
 let's know the results of the meeting and 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.409
 that is oriented to the entrepreneurs are the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.409
 listeners to others
