whether<00:00:35.670> first<00:00:36.090> stretches<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.660> game<00:00:36.809> I

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
whether first stretches of this game I

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.150 
whether first stretches of this game I
think<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.230> played<00:00:37.440> great<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.770> then<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.070> other

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
think we played great and then for other

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.830 
think we played great and then for other
stretches<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.850> don't<00:00:39.420> think<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.660> played

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
stretches that I don't think we played

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.479 
stretches that I don't think we played
up<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> our<00:00:40.140> standards<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.770> that's<00:00:41.280> how<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
up to our standards so that's how it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.520 
up to our standards so that's how it
goes<00:00:41.610> games<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:42.090> ebbs<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.420> flows<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.350> just

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
goes games are ebbs and flows you just

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.860 
goes games are ebbs and flows you just
hope<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.640> more<00:00:44.820> good<00:00:45.420> minutes<00:00:45.750> and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
hope that you have more good minutes and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.420 
hope that you have more good minutes and
you<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.020> bad<00:00:46.200> minutes<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:46.770> lose<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
you have bad minutes and we lose the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.130

case<00:00:47.579> tonight<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.510> seems<00:00:48.780> though<00:00:48.960> even

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
case tonight it seems though even

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.510 
case tonight it seems though even
there's<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> quite<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> bit<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.160> feeling<00:00:50.430> out

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
there's a quite a bit of feeling out

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.220 
there's a quite a bit of feeling out

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
process maybe jitters but yet this team

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.689 
process maybe jitters but yet this team
seems<00:00:52.440> they<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> switch<00:00:52.949> they<00:00:53.129> can<00:00:53.280> flip

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
