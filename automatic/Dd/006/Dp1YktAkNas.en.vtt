00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.340
 Well, my dear friends, hello to all 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.170
 I'm Semchenko by you 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.719
 and welcome to the interrogation card 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.490
 this is 33 part today going through one more 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.310
 the map you made for me and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.590
 let's start with the autumn plates so 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.289
 hi hi kirill hi how are you 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.330
 I'm doing great for 10 you too 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.240
 my first card rule is not to break blocks 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.640
 I do not remember to play cheaters 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.980
 the shot is already up the world needs to be given 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.559
 only sand is good your glasses are diamonds 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.380
 and just a stack card made two namesake 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.660
 so the map made the cyrill well when 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.579
 separated you can change the time card i 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.800
 It was good luck that you went through because 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.600
 that I always ask my charge to 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.710
 before sending me the card yourself 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.410
 tried to pass the card 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.559
 well let's first take the chest 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.410
 there is iron armor and explosive 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.120
 healing potion as usually some 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.579
 part try to leave the camera chest 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.289
 2 episodes leave barely take it so 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.640
 that it did not understand why not dressed and we 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.129
 we already have armor 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.840
 leather well leather on let's leave in 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.130
 the chest she is all the more a little 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.500
 shabby need 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.180
 I think it will not need me just anytime 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.530
 the case will be as a fallback so 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.979
 here that reserve good let's let's 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.000
 this too we take ender pearls very 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.830
 cool so snowballs shovel think let's 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.750
 let's make snowballs like this 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.820
 one by one, even if it remains 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.520
 just in case a sign without any 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.650
 the concept of what we have gone so well that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.020
 something you can probably paint but not yet 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.880
 I know that let's sleep first because 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.979
 that suddenly rang elsewhere 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.140
 somewhere in a strange place I will die 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.140
 I hope I still do not die right now so 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.090
 here we all went 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.640
 said to float sand yes no 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.470
 find here now somewhere again 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.720
 I’ll skip this sand and tell me 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.680
 I missed so like it is not visible 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.270
 nowhere sand but I found sand 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.039
 already 16 diamonds found 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.829
 serve well and need only 64 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:10.500
 ok first level parkour 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.260
 Parkour were listen you again took 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.420

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:24.140

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.480

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.989
 updated and now you can go where 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.849
 anything away virus base so 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:38.340
 let's make the sound a little quieter 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:40.849
 but closing already why so damn how I 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.959
 I'm starting to record this fucking video 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.450
 antivirus avast pulp new antivirus 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.030
 that's because of this i have silver on 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.099
 for my aunt lousy talk I'll try her 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.079
 somehow again disable the stories don't 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.299
 I know the settings will have to dig 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.360
 maybe there will be a shutdown of this 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.420
 nasty aunt virus database updated well 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:05.010
 nice if all he'll take enough 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.139
 diamond well what's the question here who 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.220
 nationality psin who sings opa 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.290
 Gangnam Style 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.209
 oh you are a cool question by the way this 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.010
 an interesting question seems to me because 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.299
 so constantly read it seems to me because 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.340
 that i'm not at all aware of who he is 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.709
 nationality I kept thinking who 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.109
 is he korean or damn it in japan 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.470
 With or Chinese communication I do not understand 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:28.079
 this is so korean or chinese listen 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.069
 if the screech is all loose but there is a risk 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.989
 I can get out 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.310
 pearl so here's up throw and 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.799
 ejection just in case so let's 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.319
 check I think Korean is my choice 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.220
 Koreans 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:43.200
 well how did I guess he is korean yes he is more 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.030
 similar to korean than to chinese 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.530
 my he somewhere I heard that he is Korean 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.650
 but didn't remember so well 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.230
 o see ka well ka you get about 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.720
 turned out look see how we can 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.470
 make here a maze find a lever in 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.230
 labyrinth of nuk nuk nuk we are now 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.660
 find frets don't want to pass first 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.549
 honestly then the place that there is no longer 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.630
 I can’t find a lever at all 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.760
 the labyrinth will pass over the top 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.440
 I'll play by the rules for now though 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.530
 the rules were not written that it is impossible 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.330
 give up this labyrinth if 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.640
 the author wanted to provide for this he would 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:22.270
 put myself the roof here the pot has already found 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.630
 without any of these help here and by myself 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.310
 itself so well that now we need to find and 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.860
 exit somewhere he was like this I remember 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.340
 and perfectly here need to put all 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:37.660
 passed boats here 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.630
 so let's take science and here that i 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.300
 I not yet fully understand probably just 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.530
 need to ride well let's sit in 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:53.920
 boat and let's go go hey let's go and boat 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:57.250
 let's go boat and did not know why 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.650
 did maybe just get in 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:04.660
 picture if not open then forget it well 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:10.510
 of not open then hammer here the author of the map 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:13.180
 how well suited hey here you see a 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.540
 what did i say i did say even if 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.830
 last time I used a fishing rod 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.440
 threw the picture anyway she would also 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.980
 perform she fell to the edge and therefore 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.890
 I did not open anything, I'll put it 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.770
 I will try to do it again, but you yourself 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:33.450
 just made sure that no matter how 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.450
 always claws attacks the pressure plate 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.580
 but it is not at all clear where I waver 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.030
 Ok, don't care just didn’t open 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.620
 hammer on her 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:48.830
 you passed thanks 2 there were 54 on the map 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.380
 diamonds if found then I hope everything is fine 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.160
 yes I found all 64 diamonds I am well done 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.990
 show you 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.340
 potions two more potions of these take from here 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.860
 snowballs in general you will become nothing let's 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.690
 leaving them and diamond shovel stomach 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.660
 also leave the same to us nothing and 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.110
 so here here is the same two 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.920
 chest 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.470
 let's read further but for not a map 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:16.010
 Golem shit at all her so-so little 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:18.080
 disk assignments so good class 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.440
 cool card + scales 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.910
 over9000 i'm at the heart of this map either eye 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.190
 Taliban cool as because in the map 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.920
 There are no special such bugs all done 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.650
 competently and well, too well-plates 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.510
 everything is written that is generally on the map everything 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.810
 done principle is good to find fault not to 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.670
 what really would like something else 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.140
 something special in the crankcase something special 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.110
 I would like to have some 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.160
 interesting trials because sometimes I 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.110
 go through the map and legs 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.080
 many tests are repeated i mean i 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.180
 I already saw them I understand it therefore here 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.800
 I was absolutely not surprised at all 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.610
 on the map but the maps are good so i 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.490
 put 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.890
 so I will put it guess what i am 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:02.390
 I will put a class and let's do it too 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:04.550
 put a cool card because a little 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.080
 tasks I do not know the task seems to be 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.600
 ok because sometimes they do 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.480
 less well in general then actually me 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.880
 I liked the map so I think that 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.350
 This all went through the next card if you 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.360
 want me to go to your card 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.980
 send me in lichku vkontakte 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.630
 send me to the wall everywhere everywhere 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.460
 everywhere everywhere everywhere because i 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.950
 most of your cards skipping which 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.340
 I can not send for everything 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.900
 keep track 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.000
 very large flow of information to me 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:32.420
 Comes in lichku as 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.220
 on these cards and not only so 

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.740
 what send repeat if you even 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.230
 maybe I’d send her 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.880
 and download cards because I'm really 

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.470
 the case before passing without choosing 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.750
 only here I go to look at spawn 

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.970
 there are spawns and there are signs there 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.700
 hi Cyril then pass if not I 

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:51.410
