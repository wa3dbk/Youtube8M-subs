00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.820
 you order perfect beasts 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.830
 now now des princes matter then 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.990
 we must find a fight a life one 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.880
 water source fill the bucket 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.310
 return to using it to fertilize 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.900
 the others change because I'm tired of 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.369
 see these fields being destroyed e 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.840
 then I don't want to use much 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.369
 bonneville I want the fields to be a 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.489
 not grow the poor ones alone 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.170
 they want to be the bastard biologist 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.600
 the bastard farmer who crosses 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.890
 fertilizers and forces them to grow to 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 come on or see this is perfect 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.550
 water pumps that was completely 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.710
 out of place and I think this can 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.600
 at least for an initial stem 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.700
 obviously going back will be as usual 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.740
 a beast fatigue but we will do it 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.690
 ok, come on until we are in charge 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.180
 diamonds pecks a pity to leave them here 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.280
 in short, they are always diamonds and they are not 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.079
 bad in short I could maybe use them 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.060
 to trade with the village hoping 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.620
 guide flower basket diamond emilian 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.700
 emerald with the hummers to buy 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.130
 something else 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.610
 because in short it never expects others 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.610
 diamonds here 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.790
 or who is or found all these beautiful 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.590
 diamonds I found as many as 12 diamonds 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.659
 simply by going downstairs 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.520
 if these things happened, real life 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.030
 I would have already a front therefore remains in 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.060
 general 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.680
 good job excellent b.brin minecraft that 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.020
 beautiful good that these things happen 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.940
 just miss here I have to try i 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.159
 cotton seeds this is one thing 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.869
 I wanted to do see I said I would do 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.789
 and I have already forgotten to do so 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.530
 now that I come back he made mine 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.390
 nice little field I want to see how 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.039
 cotton allies grow and yes 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.450
 they can use in my opinion is 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.979
 they will simply block some 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.929
 strings when they are destroyed 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.380
 together with other cotton seed then 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.909
 if it's basic like that but I don't know 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.649
 it will still be moving then 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.330
 I don't remember casting under the rule of 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.920
 water up to what they could 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.440
 fertilize but did a beautiful thing 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.509
 risk have it and we place the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.789
 water source so hoping it can 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.240
 fertilize up to two blocks of 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:10.420
 distance but let's see if he can do one 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.819
 nice little thing let's put the little pot here 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.829
 campiciano then we see what happens field 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.959
 field field field field ko kay let's see 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.670
 as how this affera goes we see 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.300
 if they remain fertilized with them 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.460
 pertini 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.680
 those near the water as you can see 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.900
 they fertilize thematically but I don't know if 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.980
 those two blocks away there is a 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.050
 block these here work at the same 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.210
 way it works the same way 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.760
 excellent the cia the perfect then 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.320
 we immediately try our cotton seeds 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.060
 which we left in the certain with 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.740
 we must also keep beasts 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.240
 a test with all the rocks account of 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.820
 various gems because I would like to keep 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.840
 to these these move on to 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.600
 achieve maybe later 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.220
 the castle what I wanted to do alone 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.870
 so cooler then we put all the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.920
 blocks so we make a box 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.870
 lousy stuff and guys sives known the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.940
 since here we have these great ones 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.130
 of the bowl mini the perfect we can 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.640
 go down our little field 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.080
 plant these snobbish guy with the left le 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.740
 here I am here 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.420
 let's do so go hungry use the 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.350
 boeing to make them grow and grow 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.430
 still and will still grow great to cool 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.870
 ok so basically with a shot 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.489
 simply with the left button you don't 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.670
 they destroy the plants but you get in 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.010
 so those cotton do not come 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.630
 basically recovered 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.550
 of the series that those seeds are worth for 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.160
 a plant that will remain will remain with it 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.900
 always great, excellent, but now 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.580
 my question is how it turns the 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.440
 silk cotton 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.020
 I do not know I will discover it indeed we can 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.820
 discover it directly with the croton 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:53.290
 great all souls of zill or'll ok there 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.350
 He says nothing says nothing to me 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.800
 its strings and let's see 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.040
 ok contracts cotton you make a string is the 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.450
 maximum I have to tell the truth and tumbleweed 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.980
 how do you get use tables I don't know 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.720
 google is not the best so there 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.250
 you will need a lot of cotton for one 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.470
 string but at least it's always better than 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.180
 go around and kill spiders 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.390
 risk taking damage then not 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.560
 dead is cool and cool 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.169
 I will use wrapped 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.730
 then I think the gent came a 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.910
 moment a little special I just have 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.510
 discovered this is this beautiful one 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.800
 chocobo or to copy big 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.110
 let's have fun seeing your play that 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.110
 they try to couple one on one side 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.240
 fence and one from the other will be one 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.150
 fun for us not for them of course 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.220
 they will suffer like crazy but it doesn't matter 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.220
 we're bastards and we'll do it anyway 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:50.130
 so we see a male can copy himself 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:53.410
 mail look up that can so down 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.570
 still no it is only the lace that I hope 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.729
 this geisel app in hand then pair 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:03.280
 keep an eye on me with me be careful e 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:04.810
 you or numbers have made us 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.280
 oh my god they did it through 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.669
 the fence I don't even want to know 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.180
 how the hell is not different and always in 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.030
 yellow 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.590
 too many chocobos too many I played yellow 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.350
 I hope at least you are female because 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.080
 now for the moment it seems to me 34 males 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.110
 and a female I don't know we see this 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.210
 what is this and 6a I can't yet 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.550
 know it because you are a java needle chick 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.539
 so it is ahead of forward 8 i will discover 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.060
 some way 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.440
 so we have our fields now 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.210
 we can dedicate ourselves to planting all the 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.560
 Our greetings we found in the course 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.630
 of this small I do not know exit for 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.110
 pepper for the forest we will see all the 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.820
 our seeds and change alloy pro to not 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.620
 I want to realize I don't want to cultivate 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.030
 other geysers for the moment I hope not 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.160
 use them all stupidly 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.590
 because as it happened before in short 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.030
 I was no guys at the very gesture 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.530
 ugly because he had to find another one 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.960
 new and not a good experience 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.880
 to a long devastating experience for 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.320
 me psyche so be careful with some 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.080
 wheat bam bam bam that is still see 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.420
 then we miss bla bla bla bla bla bla bla 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.720
 barli ok 1 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.060
 and so oh my god they are perfect chemicals 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.520
 they are raffaele 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.500
 yes we have filled exactly everything 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.300
