welcome back this is Marty from g.d.p

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.570 
welcome back this is Marty from g.d.p
our<00:00:03.840> surveillance<00:00:04.350> equipment<00:00:04.430> today<00:00:05.430> we're

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
our surveillance equipment today we're

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.160 
our surveillance equipment today we're
going<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.730> be<00:00:05.850> talking<00:00:06.000> about<00:00:06.240> another<00:00:06.720> type

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
going to be talking about another type

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.799 
going to be talking about another type
of<00:00:07.220> tracking<00:00:08.220> device<00:00:08.670> we<00:00:09.090> have<00:00:09.300> real-time

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
of tracking device we have real-time

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.259 
of tracking device we have real-time
trackers<00:00:10.620> which<00:00:11.370> allow<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.969> go<00:00:12.090> online

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
trackers which allow you to go online

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.120 
trackers which allow you to go online
and<00:00:12.809> see<00:00:13.049> what<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.349> vehicle<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.830> at<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
and see what the vehicle is at the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.150 
and see what the vehicle is at the
particular<00:00:14.429> moment<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.410> then<00:00:16.410> we<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:16.770> what

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
particular moment and then we have what

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.150 
particular moment and then we have what
we<00:00:17.190> call<00:00:17.570> loggers<00:00:18.570> or<00:00:20.420> GPS<00:00:21.439> tracker<00:00:22.439> loggers

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
we call loggers or GPS tracker loggers

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.929 
we call loggers or GPS tracker loggers
that<00:00:23.550> basically<00:00:23.939> love<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.510> information<00:00:25.939> main

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that basically love the information main

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.880 
that basically love the information main
the<00:00:27.180> major<00:00:27.390> difference<00:00:27.840> again<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.289> these

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the major difference again is these

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.980 
the major difference again is these
aren't<00:00:29.160> real<00:00:29.460> time<00:00:29.789> again<00:00:30.269> they<00:00:30.420> are<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.810> real

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
aren't real time again they are not real

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.709 
aren't real time again they are not real
time<00:00:31.289> but<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.740> do<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> option<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.880> taking

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
time but you do get the option of taking

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.740 
time but you do get the option of taking
this<00:00:34.079> particular<00:00:34.590> type<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.010> price<00:00:35.630> put<00:00:36.630> it

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
this particular type of the price put it

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.319 
this particular type of the price put it
in<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.559> vehicle<00:00:38.040> inside<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.640> vapor<00:00:38.820> actually

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
in the vehicle inside the vapor actually

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.840 
in the vehicle inside the vapor actually
because<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.809> small<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.379> logger<00:00:41.309> will<00:00:41.579> log<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
because that small a logger will log the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.350 
because that small a logger will log the
information<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.579> later<00:00:45.000> on

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
information for you so that you later on

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.139 
information for you so that you later on
you<00:00:45.690> go<00:00:45.870> down<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.410> go<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.340> download<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you go down you go and download the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.619 
you go down you go and download the
information<00:00:48.590> to<00:00:49.590> your<00:00:49.710> computer<00:00:50.210> again<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
information to your computer again you

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.660 
information to your computer again you
take<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.399> logger<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.600> call<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
take the logger and we call this the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.750 
take the logger and we call this the
micro<00:00:56.670> GPS<00:00:56.910> tracking<00:00:57.480> module<00:00:57.809> 2<00:00:58.550> because<00:00:59.550> it's

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
micro GPS tracking module 2 because it's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.010 
micro GPS tracking module 2 because it's
the<00:00:59.850> latest<00:01:00.030> generation<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.780> tracking

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the latest generation or tracking

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.070 
the latest generation or tracking
modules<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:02.340> us<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.910> take<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.120> micro

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
modules for us and you take the micro

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.100 
modules for us and you take the micro
GPS<00:01:04.890> tracking<00:01:05.460> module<00:01:05.700> 2<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.659> take<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
GPS tracking module 2 and you take the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.710 
GPS tracking module 2 and you take the
little<00:01:07.770> cover<00:01:08.130> off<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.030> end<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.570> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
little cover off of that end and you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.510 
little cover off of that end and you
could<00:01:09.930> see<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> USB<00:01:10.530> connector<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.130> plug

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
could see the USB connector you plug

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.980 
could see the USB connector you plug
that<00:01:11.549> into<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:12.030> USB<00:01:12.330> connector<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:12.960> your

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that into your USB connector on your

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.219 
that into your USB connector on your
computer<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.680> download<00:01:14.840> three<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.020> four
