twenty-third which is really suck for
the<00:00:11.670> playstation<00:00:12.360> users<00:00:12.750> because<00:00:12.929> you're

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
the playstation users because you're

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.499 
the playstation users because you're
fucking<00:00:13.230> just<00:00:13.620> got<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.950> last<00:00:14.099> map<00:00:14.340> pack<00:00:14.580> but

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
fucking just got the last map pack but

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.960 
fucking just got the last map pack but
basically<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.710> map<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:16.980> going<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.400> be<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
basically this map is going to be on the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.420 
basically this map is going to be on the
moon<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:19.050> what<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.470> basically<00:00:19.770> think<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.250> it's

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
moon and what I basically think is it's

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.010 
moon and what I basically think is it's
either<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> come<00:00:21.000> before<00:00:21.180> ascension

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
either going to come before ascension

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.050 
either going to come before ascension
because<00:00:22.289> he<00:00:22.410> was<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.680> moon<00:00:22.949> or<00:00:23.220> after

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
because he was on the moon or after

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.779 
because he was on the moon or after
shangri-la<00:00:25.010> because<00:00:26.010> if<00:00:26.160> he<00:00:26.279> has<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.580> moon

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
shangri-la because if he has on moon

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.599 
shangri-la because if he has on moon
suit<00:00:27.029> then<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.269> will<00:00:27.480> know<00:00:27.650> but<00:00:28.650> or<00:00:29.220> he<00:00:29.429> could

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
suit then we will know but or he could

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.429 
suit then we will know but or he could
be<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:30.119> from<00:00:30.210> ascension<00:00:30.630> but<00:00:31.109> everyone

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
be going from ascension but everyone

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.659 
be going from ascension but everyone
doesn't<00:00:31.590> believe<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.890> there<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.550> it's

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
doesn't believe that there but it's

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.950 
doesn't believe that there but it's
actually<00:00:32.790> possible<00:00:33.210> if<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.600> actually<00:00:33.719> look

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
actually possible if you actually look

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.540 
actually possible if you actually look
in<00:00:34.200> between<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> lines<00:00:34.860> instead<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.370> fucking

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
in between the lines instead of fucking

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.310 
in between the lines instead of fucking
just<00:00:35.880> being<00:00:36.059> chronological<00:00:36.809> little<00:00:36.989> bitches

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
just being chronological little bitches

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.420 
just being chronological little bitches
guess<00:00:37.530> I'm<00:00:37.649> sure<00:00:37.860> he<00:00:37.950> actually<00:00:38.070> has<00:00:38.340> in

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
guess I'm sure he actually has in

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.080 
guess I'm sure he actually has in
chronological<00:00:39.649> but<00:00:40.649> basically<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.790> map<00:00:42.059> is

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
chronological but basically this map is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.630 
chronological but basically this map is
going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.200> moon<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.710> believe<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.309> not

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
going to be on moon I believe it is not

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.920 
going to be on moon I believe it is not
going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> really<00:00:45.059> change<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> storyline

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
going to really change the storyline

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.299 
going to really change the storyline
that<00:00:45.960> much<00:00:46.350> unless<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:46.800> dramatically

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
that much unless they dramatically

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.250 
that much unless they dramatically
decide<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> whopping<00:00:48.690> change<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.140> events

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
decide to do a whopping change of events

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.220 
decide to do a whopping change of events
like<00:00:49.710> they<00:00:49.829> haven't<00:00:50.219> been<00:00:50.370> doing<00:00:50.610> for

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
like they haven't been doing for

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.020 
like they haven't been doing for

website there's gonna be the four
original<00:01:02.760> maps<00:01:03.329> which<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:03.960> annoying

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
original maps which is really annoying

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.780 
original maps which is really annoying
me<00:01:04.439> because<00:01:04.920> they<00:01:05.159> couldn't<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.460> given<00:01:05.580> it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
me because they couldn't have given it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.190 
me because they couldn't have given it
as<00:01:06.000> earlier<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.869> didn't<00:01:07.110> actually

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
as earlier because I didn't actually

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.660 
as earlier because I didn't actually
know<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.560> they<00:01:07.770> were<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
know that they were going to be on the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.600 
know that they were going to be on the
fucking<00:01:09.000> game<00:01:09.240> which<00:01:10.140> pisses<00:01:10.409> me<00:01:10.590> off<00:01:10.619> but

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
fucking game which pisses me off but

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.910 
fucking game which pisses me off but
anyways<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.080> I'm<00:01:13.140> basically<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
anyways so I'm basically think that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.770 
anyways so I'm basically think that
illness<00:01:14.250> map<00:01:14.430> Tokyo<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.270> either<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> die

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
illness map Tokyo is either going to die

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.300 
illness map Tokyo is either going to die
or<00:01:15.990> someone's<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:16.979> done<00:01:17.130> because

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
or someone's going to be done because

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.390 
or someone's going to be done because
Tokyo<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.420> really<00:01:18.570> sick<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
Tokyo is really really sick and

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.350 
Tokyo is really really sick and
