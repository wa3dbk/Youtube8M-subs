up<00:00:42.170> there<00:00:42.460> yeah<00:00:43.460> I<00:00:43.879> got<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.420> same<00:00:44.660> question<00:00:44.870> is

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
up there yeah I got the same question is

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.500 
up there yeah I got the same question is
hot<00:00:45.469> head<00:00:45.710> here<00:00:46.010> all<00:00:46.579> of<00:00:46.940> my<00:00:47.120> readings

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
hot head here all of my readings

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.049 
hot head here all of my readings
correlate<00:00:47.989> exactly<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.769> this<00:00:48.920> location<00:00:49.309> I've

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
correlate exactly to this location I've

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.090 
correlate exactly to this location I've
tracked<00:00:50.420> a<00:00:50.539> large<00:00:50.809> cosmic<00:00:51.320> energy<00:00:51.649> spike<00:00:51.920> to

tracked a large cosmic energy spike to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.099 
tracked a large cosmic energy spike to
these<00:00:52.249> coordinates<00:00:52.510> find<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.629> source<00:00:53.899> and

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
these coordinates find the source and

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.709 
these coordinates find the source and
maybe<00:00:54.379> just<00:00:55.280> maybe<00:00:55.399> we'll<00:00:56.210> be<00:00:56.329> able<00:00:56.359> to<00:00:56.539> figure

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
maybe just maybe we'll be able to figure

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.450 
maybe just maybe we'll be able to figure
out<00:00:56.870> why<00:00:57.109> earth<00:00:57.350> is<00:00:57.589> experiencing<00:00:58.219> such

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460

out why earth is experiencing such
strange<00:00:58.879> weather<00:00:59.120> anomalies<00:00:59.719> this<00:01:00.289> would<00:01:00.469> so

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
strange weather anomalies this would so

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.439 
strange weather anomalies this would so
