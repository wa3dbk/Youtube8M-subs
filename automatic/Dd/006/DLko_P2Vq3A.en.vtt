00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.680
 in the Chiapas coast continue the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.840
 prevention measures derived from 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.820
 bottom sea phenomenon that although already 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.679
 decreased its intensity is expected to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.080
 continue in the next hours 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.960
 I am born and grown up that matter 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.080
 wood but I've never lived here like this 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.720
 here the first time here primen is in 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.300
 this place that vibrates that first time 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.120
 did not help them in the stones that are 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.520
 there but here but already in another side not 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.570
 regarding the practical stones but not 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.399
 hit hard so if I would ask for a 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.219
 little help that they came to put 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.649
 more stones because this but it went down 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.510
 a little the stones and now yes if you can 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.800
 enter this side tourists who are 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.140
 directed to enjoy the attractions 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.519
 that generates this coast had to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.589
 comply with the indications of the 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.629
 authorities and avoid challenging the sea 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.640
 they took a lot of caution to the families 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.170
 mostly those who live here close 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.780
 this area nothing more to be careful 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.300
 and above all, the name must take care of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.220
 nature what a bad wave but I did not know 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.030
 they 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.900
 but we put the security first thing 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.640
 what to respect 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.250
 at times you have to enjoy it like this 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.320
 while you can enjoy it though 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.090
 be more than little ones that do not try 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.570
 get in there 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.039
 for civil protection jointly 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.619
 with authorities of the three orders of 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.049
 government monitor beach breakwaters 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.000
 linda and playa san benito ask no 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.250
 enter the beaches to avoid putting 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.960
 at risk your life or be attentive to 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.210
 newsletters to the media 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.619

 proceed and remind the population that 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.810
 let's not see this as a show that 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.259
 it was not a tsunami it was a strong swell 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.659
 of derived from the waves that come from 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:57.570
 far from the sea in the background with
