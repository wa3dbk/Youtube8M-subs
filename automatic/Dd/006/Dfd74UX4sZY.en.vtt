00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
briefly my prediction on it i think that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.120 
briefly my prediction on it i think that
there<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:22.859> no<00:00:23.310> chance<00:00:23.699> whatsoever<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:25.230> John

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
there is no chance whatsoever of John

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.310 
there is no chance whatsoever of John
Cena<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.550> winning<00:00:26.730> those<00:00:26.970> belts<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.630> don't

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
Cena and winning those belts I don't

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.439 
Cena and winning those belts I don't
think<00:00:28.529> there's<00:00:28.769> no<00:00:29.010> chance<00:00:29.369> whatsoever<00:00:29.910> of

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
think there's no chance whatsoever of

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.350 
think there's no chance whatsoever of
Seth<00:00:30.960> Rollins<00:00:31.080> winning<00:00:31.769> those<00:00:32.070> belts<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.640> think

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
Seth Rollins winning those belts I think

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.750 
Seth Rollins winning those belts I think
this<00:00:33.540> will<00:00:33.719> be<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> cluster<00:00:35.280> fucks<00:00:35.550> of

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
sudden walking around with two goals we

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.820 
sudden walking around with two goals we
don't<00:02:45.150> even<00:02:45.270> want<00:02:45.570> him<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.810> won<00:02:46.110> gold<00:02:46.440> and
