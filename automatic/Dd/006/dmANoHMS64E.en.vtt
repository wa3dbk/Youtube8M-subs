00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.030
 kilometers further 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.690
 but difficult for him to think about the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.560
 victory a nervous race that does not 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.330
 not allow any looseness 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.650
 philippe gilbert is going to be the first 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.360

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.310
 the Belgian winner at the wall of huy in 2011 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.150
 falls heavily to less than 50 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.599
 kilometers from the finish 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.040
 he will then abandon the fugitives see 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.659
 their advance diminish the peloton 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.310
 picks up under the guidance of three 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.319
 teams the katusha of joaquín rodríguez 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.659
 the etics quick step of michal kwiatkowski 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.069
 and the movistar of alejandro valverde 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:53.480
 less than two minutes to 40 km from 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.829
 the arrival here they are doomed men 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.269
 of head are taken by two runners 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.709
 released against in the second 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.510
 ascent of the wall of huy giovanni 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.620
 visconti and luis leon sanchez 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.659
 two men put forth by the 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.879
 leaders vincenzo nibali and alejandro 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.470
 valverde in view of the final always as 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.269
 unlucky christopher froome valley at 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.500
 land 10 km from the finish no chance 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.370
 to see him again in the end and we fear 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.689
 the worst at that moment for the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.060
 British already forced to abandon 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.140
 last year on the tour de france after 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.579
 a grouping down the coast of 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.870
 at rabelais favorites are surprised by 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.610
 the Belgian tim wellens who tries his luck 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.840
 alone but the young Belgian has 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.640
 lack of juice at the foot of the wall of huy 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.200
 swallowed by the group of favorites 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.970
 the explanation between cost will take place 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.230
 alejandro valverde leads the pack to 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.879
 outside the road to come 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.829
 clinch its third Walloon arrow 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.359
 in front of a French julian alaphilippe and 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:41.989
 michele albasini the Swiss who finishes 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:44.389
 third this day was very hard 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.810
 very nervous there have been many 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.840
 falls 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:53.329
 I do not remember a race too 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.690
 difficult on that plane at the end of the 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.030
 race 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.180
 we tried to control it we had 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.190
 visconti at the front in the breakaway and 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.280
 in the ascent of the wall I am super 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.230
 well placed then decided to score a 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.949
 little pace to be able to do the 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.949
 difference on the end 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.900
