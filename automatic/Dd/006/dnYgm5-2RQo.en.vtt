favorites kind of change depending on my
age<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:19.380> I'm<00:00:19.470> gonna<00:00:19.650> say<00:00:19.980> if<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.250> had<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.970> pick

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
age so I'm gonna say if I had to pick

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.019 
age so I'm gonna say if I had to pick
one<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:22.710> was<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> only<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:23.730> allowed

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
one that was the only one I was allowed

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.540 
one that was the only one I was allowed
to<00:00:24.269> read<00:00:24.480> ever<00:00:24.810> again<00:00:25.760> it<00:00:26.760> would<00:00:27.480> probably<00:00:27.930> be

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
to read ever again it would probably be

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.519 
to read ever again it would probably be
the<00:00:29.550> Deathly<00:00:30.000> Hallows<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:31.019> because<00:00:31.289> that

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the Deathly Hallows just because that

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.670 
the Deathly Hallows just because that
way<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.189> would<00:00:32.669> get<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.059> experience<00:00:33.510> almost<00:00:34.469> all

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
way I would get to experience almost all

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.250 
way I would get to experience almost all
of<00:00:34.800> my<00:00:34.950> favorite<00:00:35.309> characters<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.719> not<00:00:36.989> my

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
of my favorite characters it's not my

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.380 
of my favorite characters it's not my
favorite<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.100> don't<00:00:38.460> think<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> favorite

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
favorite I don't think I have a favorite

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.220 
favorite I don't think I have a favorite
but<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.170> think<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.980> could<00:00:41.370> only<00:00:41.579> ever<00:00:42.230> read

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
but I think if I could only ever read

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.340 
but I think if I could only ever read
one<00:00:43.500> ever<00:00:44.460> again<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.120> would<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.840> final<00:00:46.200> one

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
one ever again it would be the final one

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.200 
one ever again it would be the final one
but<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:46.980> again<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.219> think<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.730> one<00:00:47.879> I've<00:00:48.000> read

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
but then again I think the one I've read

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.110 
but then again I think the one I've read
the<00:00:48.390> most<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:50.370> order<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> Phoenix

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the most is the order of the Phoenix

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.270 
the most is the order of the Phoenix
official<00:00:51.690> number<00:00:51.930> two<00:00:52.110> your<00:00:52.379> favorite<00:00:52.949> movie

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
official number two your favorite movie

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.119 
official number two your favorite movie
and<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:54.210> don't<00:00:54.809> know<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:55.949> most

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
and I don't know if this is what most

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.279 
and I don't know if this is what most
people<00:00:56.280> would<00:00:56.730> say<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.809> Chamber

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
people would say but I think the Chamber

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.410 
people would say but I think the Chamber
of<00:00:58.320> Secrets<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:59.520> first<00:00:59.789> one<00:00:59.969> was<00:01:00.180> too

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
of Secrets the first one was too

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.360 
of Secrets the first one was too
disappointing<00:01:01.079> because<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.559> had<00:01:01.890> such<00:01:02.160> high

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
disappointing because I had such high

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.340 
disappointing because I had such high
expectations<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> name<00:01:03.840> yield<00:01:04.110> when

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
expectations as like a name yield when

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500 
expectations as like a name yield when
it<00:01:04.470> was<00:01:04.559> coming<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.909> could<00:01:06.150> never<00:01:06.330> be

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
it was coming out then it could never be

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.730 
it was coming out then it could never be
the<00:01:06.780> same<00:01:06.930> for<00:01:07.439> me

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the same for me

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.289 
the same for me
but<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> second<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:08.909> came<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.180> I

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but it's in the second one came out I

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.080 
but it's in the second one came out I
just<00:01:09.450> didn't<00:01:09.720> expect<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:10.820> literal<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
just didn't expect as literal a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.840 
just didn't expect as literal a
translation<00:01:12.990> onto<00:01:13.260> screen<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.220> enjoyed<00:01:14.700> it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
translation onto screen so I enjoyed it

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.780 
translation onto screen so I enjoyed it
so<00:01:15.119> much<00:01:15.150> more<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.900> then<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.590> enjoy<00:01:17.430> number

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
so much more and then I enjoy number

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.969 
so much more and then I enjoy number
three<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.360> four<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.650> books<00:01:19.830> got

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
three and four but as the books got

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.010 
three and four but as the books got
longer<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.670> films<00:01:20.970> couldn't<00:01:21.360> really<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.840> them

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
longer the films couldn't really do them

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.560 
longer the films couldn't really do them
as<00:01:22.170> much<00:01:22.320> justice<00:01:22.950> they<00:01:23.340> absolutely<00:01:23.580> despise

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
as much justice they absolutely despise

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.960 
as much justice they absolutely despise
