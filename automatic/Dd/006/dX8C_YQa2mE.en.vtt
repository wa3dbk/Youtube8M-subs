00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 Good morning Hello evening is cute no time this King two parts today 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.710
 I would like to introduce a mailer 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:18.000
 Do you know this is such a product I am using a product called dm 20 and this time dm 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.020
 I have a product of 25 and I would like to report this difference 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.230
 I am this dm 20 step 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.770
 I wrote many books at home ustream books 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:31.119
 twitter marketing book business king &amp; book 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:35.920
 i use mailer to write ustream touch &amp; try books 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.970
 The reason is that this is itself a study, of course you can write sentences on a PC 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.010
 Though 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.309
 It is a so-called dedicated word processor and it is different from writing on a PC 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.760
 It feels like I'm stuck in my first game 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:52.219
 Copy from wikipedia which can not connect to the Internet 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:57.799
 On the contrary, you can not write nor write sentences using only the events in your head 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:59.750
 I'm worried that this time there is an upgraded version of 25 for this 20 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.030
 I heard that it became a little thinner 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.940
 Oh dear 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.390
 Players say the insignificant difference is the fact the previous dm 20 is 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:15.300
 Yeah it is because was at two-fold the keyboard came out 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.850
 This kind of pillar comes out this dm 25 this time of the pillar on the back side 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.920
 It is gone, and here is the construction 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.580
 Now I can feel the click sound a little Please listen to this sound This is dm 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.580
 20 sounds 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.020
 The public is shaking a little and 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:39.590
 How is the heat of keyboard rice here 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:45.469
 It's only about 3 mm, but it's getting thinner. By this getting thinner 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:50.630
 It's really easy to use, and until now it looks like you raise your wrists a little and move your hand up 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:51.900
 Now I feel like the keyboard face is very smooth next time 25 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.870
 To this dm 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:01.020
 I'm doing 25-9 minutes and the last part has changed the engraving on the keyboard 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.909
 I felt it was black and gold but 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.410
 This time it became simple because it should be black 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.709
 Since the arrangement has not changed , I think it is very easy to use if you are using the previous Pomera 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.549
 I will 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.250
 two both try to compare the dm 20 25 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.940
 Let's start 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.440
 Although it is the feature of Pomera that it starts very fast to this 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.980
 The menu background is cloaked compared to 20, making it easier to see 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.480
 The top and bottom were blacked out and I felt very clean 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.910
 The format here is the most unusual place Displayed font size switching is from the teens 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.240
 There are 7 types of models before 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.380
 This time, say Ha kind 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:43.790
 The size of 16 points was added by 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:49.880
 A new item was made from this model in this formatting. 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:55.230
 It is frame display settings and to but I just hit the automatic line feed settings referred to in the past 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:58.500
 For example, I wrote a column, and one line is 15 characters. 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.200
 If it is said to want to do in a set of 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.590
 In this way 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:12.260
 The display changes, so this time I was able to set the opening direction in the format . 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:17.540
 So it is possible to write a sentence like a vertical Well just paper for the document I'm can be displayed in writing 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.190
 It is Pomera dm 25 that I have seen by that, but it has evolved significantly from 20 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.380
 And I Could form has quietly evolved but key 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:30.750
 The keyboard has become thinner and less supportive , and the keyboard is more stable 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:34.680
 There was a convenient display setting for vertical writing and writing magazines 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.670
 The type that the so-called keyboard called Pomera dm 100 does not fold 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.480
 There is also one corresponding to bluetooth but I still have this Pomera and 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.180
 Speaking 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.540
 Finish 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:48.129
 I like this size to be the size of a paperback book 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.530
 This is a new chapter, but a small little coffeehouse such as Doutor's coffeehouse 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.739
 Rice can beat the sentence spread ยง 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.989
 I would like to go to the finished form because of reason 25 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:00.200
 Electronic text that he wrote in Pomela the boom of now Day paper books went this way in some of you duck 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.080
 How about trying it as a book 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.000
 Is not it 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.000
 More than Himana Inu Kawai passed through
