00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.879
 Hmm 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.600
 Barn 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.050
 Hello 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:26.820
 Today Thank you for seeing this video 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:31.590
 Kedomo are you going to see attached to it is the mineral Fastenings today 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.879
 Tteyuu to its mineral Fastenings there are three steps when there are three stages 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.300
 Was to tell you that 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.480
 The first one is 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:44.840
 First of all there is a preparation tree as a previous step and it is actually 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:50.989
 It was to say that there is a Fastenings machine and Fukushoku life last to go back into the fasting 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:54.850
 But today I will talk about preparing things. 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.030
 Take between in preparation machine It is roughly 3 days 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:05.560
 Please think about the 23rd 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:10.030
 And in such sense that it will be three days or someday to fasting It is already an individual 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.960
 I would like to think about it, but at the beginning I feel like I have 3 days of turnfasting 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.149
 I think it's good 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:22.750
 So please think about 23 days in the preparation phase . 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:25.550
 So what do you do during the 23rd? This is a preparatory phase, so speaking in the movement, Nominal gear is up 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.450
 It is time of sports eva warm up 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:34.110
 It is sudden- 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.670
 It doesn't mean to move in earnest, but in front of that you can make your body flexible and stretch it 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.040
 By saying 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.259
 When you would need a stage to loosen the body it hits the preparation stage referred to in the preparation stage Fastenings 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.200
 Please think 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:52.290
 At this time, we will prepare the built-in state 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.470
 As a stage prior to not put something built gold autonomous body 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:02.159
 It is time to reduce things 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:07.560
 Therefore , please be aware of things that do not burden internal organs as much as possible at this time 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.519
 Or so strange because tough too make too determined is good in another About my own 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.180
 I think but 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:20.670
 Avoid burdening internal organs, ie avoid high-fat, high- protein diets as much as possible 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.150
 Avoid meat and fried foods if you can or if you really eat it 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.349
 But really less 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:30.520
 Please keep in a very small amount Yabakar more than usual 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:33.790
 So as not to say that eats whether joint 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.550
 And I want you to make it a staple food instead 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.830
 rice 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:44.890
 If you can do it than white rice , I think it would be better to eat each game or before adding ribbed with cereals 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.950
 But those staple foods and the rest 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.209
 I say friendly Magowa but this is good I is said 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.209
 Grandson-friendly food 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.879
 Waiting for I mean is 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:02.440
 Or a natto tofu to mimic but it is Mameru 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:04.290
 Processed soybeans and items such as sesame and nuts 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:11.050
 I and God 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:15.070
 It's nice and Maako is a seaweed like seaweed or kelp 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:21.700
 8 I'm a vegetable , a fish is a fish 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:22.990
 Especially small fish, but just fish there is a problem of pollution now, so it is necessary to take care with caution enough 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.620
 I do not think 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:31.040
 And it is kind of mushrooms It is good with mushrooms such as shiitake and seaweed I like potato 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:38.150
 Sweet potato and other comforts 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:44.090
 There is no doubt if it is centered around this kind of easy- to-eat meal 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:46.329
 You get are taking conscious during the 23 days of daily cat 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.329
 And 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:56.260
 Get drinking thing of it is water quality firm one day 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.070
 I will more firmly 11.5 l person in order but I do not need to drink impossible to 1.5 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.660
 l 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:05.220
 Or I think it is okay to drink 2 l or so 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.340
 And if it is possible at this time, Omega 3 system 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.810
 Aglaia 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:15.680
 Aim for fatty acids Please ingest fatty acids of science 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:19.850
 This is a lot like fat or a sesame oil 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:25.160
 Please take a picture of this for a year or so every year . 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:32.660
 Why does it mean that the condition of the cell is adjusted during this time? 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:33.920
 Especially when the cell membrane is made of fatty acid and the state of the cell membrane is in good condition 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.280
 It is to say 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.180
 It says here at the Toka fried still made with fried bad oil and is it is better to refrain after all 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.520
 It is a thing 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:53.849
 Consciously ingest omega-3 flaxseed oil and English bra 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:57.880
 Say it and Toka 10 parts belly here to keep in there eight minutes belly but 7 minutes I 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:05.630
 Dessert after a meal back home and ends up in about 12 minutes 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:07.600
 Even by the very painful cooking in reverse too there is a difference between the period of the fasting 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.540
 It is thus So 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.560
 As much as possible before going into that fast 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:19.310
 Slow down 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.960
 If it can be said that it will be kept a little understate in 7 minutes belly 8 minutes 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.940
 Please be conscious 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:31.940
 If you can protect it, the next fasting key is sure 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.580
 I will have a fuck, so it's very important to get that ready first 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:38.250
 Also hand the I mean 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:44.430
 It is important, but in fact the preparation period and side meal are very important, so there 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:51.539
 Because it is all right if by holding a point to is more than please try to aware of it next 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:52.569
 It attached to that Pasutin stems will be more than that I will try to deliver in another video today 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.520
 thank you very much 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:57.300

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.300
