countless<00:00:24.430> clients<00:00:25.029> but<00:00:25.329> not<00:00:25.509> so<00:00:25.719> many

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
countless clients but not so many

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.839 
countless clients but not so many
relating<00:00:26.320> to<00:00:26.410> soccer<00:00:26.680> we<00:00:27.340> thought<00:00:27.520> we'd<00:00:27.700> get

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
relating to soccer we thought we'd get

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.819 
relating to soccer we thought we'd get
one<00:00:28.029> done<00:00:28.210> for<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.540> game<00:00:28.779> let's<00:00:29.320> take<00:00:29.500> a<00:00:29.559> look

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
one done for the game let's take a look

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.280 
one done for the game let's take a look
so<00:00:30.309> the<00:00:30.520> type<00:00:30.700> of<00:00:30.730> printing<00:00:31.119> here<00:00:31.329> at<00:00:31.540> hatch<00:00:31.899> is

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
so the type of printing here at hatch is

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.530 
so the type of printing here at hatch is
letterpress<00:00:33.129> it's<00:00:33.520> always<00:00:33.879> been<00:00:34.059> letterpress

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
letterpress it's always been letterpress

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.139 
letterpress it's always been letterpress
and<00:00:35.440> essentially<00:00:35.980> what<00:00:36.520> that<00:00:36.550> means<00:00:36.940> is

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
and essentially what that means is

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.510 
and essentially what that means is
letters<00:00:37.629> are<00:00:37.930> pressed<00:00:38.290> into<00:00:38.500> paper<00:00:39.039> with<00:00:39.489> ink

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
letters are pressed into paper with ink

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.279 
letters are pressed into paper with ink
in<00:00:39.879> between<00:00:40.210> them<00:00:40.390> we've<00:00:40.780> never<00:00:40.930> straight

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
in between them we've never straight

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:42.930 
in between them we've never straight
away<00:00:41.469> from<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.829> historical<00:00:42.340> design<00:00:42.610> and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
away from the historical design and

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.660 
away from the historical design and
asked<00:00:43.300> aspects<00:00:44.020> of<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.530> shop<00:00:44.740> when<00:00:45.370> you<00:00:45.400> walk

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
asked aspects of the shop when you walk

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.580 
asked aspects of the shop when you walk
in<00:00:45.880> the<00:00:45.910> hatch<00:00:46.180> show<00:00:46.450> print<00:00:46.480> here<00:00:47.200> in<00:00:47.350> downtown

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
in the hatch show print here in downtown

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.979 
in the hatch show print here in downtown
Nashville<00:00:48.310> you<00:00:48.730> look<00:00:49.180> at<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.390> walls<00:00:49.600> and<00:00:49.900> you

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
Nashville you look at the walls and you

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.720 
Nashville you look at the walls and you
don't<00:00:50.170> know<00:00:50.290> if<00:00:50.440> it's<00:00:50.730> 1911<00:00:51.730> or<00:00:52.200> 2011<00:00:53.200> because

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
don't know if it's 1911 or 2011 because

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.770 
don't know if it's 1911 or 2011 because
of<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:54.940> fact<00:00:55.149> that<00:00:55.300> everything<00:00:55.660> is

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
of the fact that everything is

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.180 
of the fact that everything is
letterpress<00:00:56.320> here<00:00:56.530> we're<00:00:56.710> technically<00:00:57.100> a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
letterpress here we're technically a

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.819 
letterpress here we're technically a
museum<00:00:57.730> so<00:00:58.270> our<00:00:58.560> responsibility<00:00:59.560> is<00:00:59.590> to

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
museum so our responsibility is to

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.190 
museum so our responsibility is to
maintain<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.670> historic<00:01:01.390> aesthetics<00:01:01.989> of<00:01:02.110> the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
maintain the historic aesthetics of the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.799 
maintain the historic aesthetics of the
shop<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:02.950> let<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.640> type<00:01:03.850> speak<00:01:04.239> for<00:01:04.479> itself

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
shop and let the type speak for itself

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.190 
shop and let the type speak for itself
so<00:01:05.470> we<00:01:05.740> have<00:01:05.890> limitations<00:01:06.340> of<00:01:07.000> typefaces<00:01:07.899> that

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
so we have limitations of typefaces that

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.920 
so we have limitations of typefaces that
were<00:01:08.380> purchased<00:01:08.729> anywhere<00:01:09.729> from<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.149> 1920s

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
were purchased anywhere from the 1920s

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.620 
were purchased anywhere from the 1920s
onward<00:01:11.860> but<00:01:12.460> since<00:01:12.790> we're<00:01:12.969> a<00:01:13.000> museum<00:01:13.390> now<00:01:13.570> we

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
onward but since we're a museum now we

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.230 
onward but since we're a museum now we
don't<00:01:13.840> purchase<00:01:14.110> anything<00:01:14.380> new<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.580> it's<00:01:15.970> it's

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
don't purchase anything new so it's it's

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.789 
don't purchase anything new so it's it's
a<00:01:16.330> good<00:01:16.479> limitation<00:01:16.990> for<00:01:17.020> us<00:01:17.290> to<00:01:17.440> be<00:01:17.530> able<00:01:17.620> to

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
a good limitation for us to be able to

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.370 
a good limitation for us to be able to
use<00:01:17.979> these<00:01:18.130> old<00:01:18.460> pipe<00:01:18.880> faces<00:01:19.420> that<00:01:19.659> are<00:01:19.690> that

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
use these old pipe faces that are that

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.930 
use these old pipe faces that are that
have<00:01:20.440> just<00:01:20.920> developed<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.430> beautiful

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
have just developed this beautiful

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.880 
have just developed this beautiful
patina<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:24.250> these<00:01:24.430> limitations<00:01:24.880> we<00:01:25.540> can

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
patina and with these limitations we can

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.440 
patina and with these limitations we can
mix<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.100> typefaces<00:01:27.490> in<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.790> different<00:01:28.060> way<00:01:28.180> and

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
mix the typefaces in a different way and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.270 
mix the typefaces in a different way and
lay<00:01:29.049> them<00:01:29.170> out<00:01:29.320> in<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.590> different<00:01:29.890> way<00:01:30.040> and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
lay them out in a different way and

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.850 
lay them out in a different way and
sometimes<00:01:30.850> we<00:01:31.210> do<00:01:31.330> carve<00:01:31.570> new<00:01:31.720> images<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.650> try

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
sometimes we do carve new images to try

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.820 
sometimes we do carve new images to try
to<00:01:32.920> create<00:01:33.250> some<00:01:33.790> nuance<00:01:34.510> that<00:01:34.750> that<00:01:35.710> our

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
to create some nuance that that our

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.440 
to create some nuance that that our
clients<00:01:36.220> haven't<00:01:36.460> seen<00:01:36.670> before<00:01:37.030> because<00:01:37.210> it

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
clients haven't seen before because it

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.080 
clients haven't seen before because it
is<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.600> very<00:01:37.810> iconic<00:01:38.280> image<00:01:39.280> said<00:01:39.549> that<00:01:39.790> we<00:01:39.880> use

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
is a very iconic image said that we use

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.950 
is a very iconic image said that we use
as<00:01:40.360> for<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.820> inspiration<00:01:42.820> for<00:01:43.210> posters<00:01:43.750> like
