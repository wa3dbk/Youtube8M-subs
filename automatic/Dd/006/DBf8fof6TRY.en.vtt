we're<00:00:12.150> still<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.170> position<00:00:13.350> where<00:00:15.049> we<00:00:16.049> can't

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
we're still in a position where we can't

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.890 
we're still in a position where we can't
argue<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.490> were<00:00:17.610> extremely<00:00:17.970> overvalued

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
argue that we were extremely overvalued

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.359 
argue that we were extremely overvalued
in<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> marketplace<00:00:20.130> yet<00:00:20.310> leveraged<00:00:22.369> types

in the marketplace yet leveraged types

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.640 
in the marketplace yet leveraged types
of<00:00:25.010> toxic<00:00:26.010> assets<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.600> very<00:00:28.170> serious

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
of toxic assets we have a very serious

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.090 
of toxic assets we have a very serious
problem<00:00:28.940> as<00:00:30.260> 2008<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:32.000> 1929<00:00:33.260> showed<00:00:34.260> us<00:00:34.440> gold

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
problem as 2008 and 1929 showed us gold

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.470 
problem as 2008 and 1929 showed us gold
is<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.699> currency<00:00:36.680> it<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.710> still<00:00:38.460> by<00:00:39.059> all

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
is a currency it is still by all

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.770 
is a currency it is still by all
evidences<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.650> the<00:00:40.800> premier<00:00:41.340> currency<00:00:41.970> where

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
evidences of the premier currency where

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.780 
evidences of the premier currency where
no<00:00:43.080> fiat<00:00:43.500> currency<00:00:43.980> including<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> dollar

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
no fiat currency including the dollar

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.260 
no fiat currency including the dollar
can<00:00:45.270> match<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:47.040> that<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.370> issue<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.970> if

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
can match it and so that the issue is if

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.540 
can match it and so that the issue is if
you're<00:00:48.450> looking<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.110> question<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.950> turmoil

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
you're looking at a question of turmoil

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.000 
you're looking at a question of turmoil
you<00:00:51.540> will<00:00:51.719> find<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.290> always<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
you will find as we always have in the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.299 
you will find as we always have in the
past<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:54.270> moves<00:00:54.570> into<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.020> gold<00:00:55.230> price<00:00:55.469> but

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
past it moves into the gold price but

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.209 
past it moves into the gold price but
the<00:00:56.430> gold<00:00:56.670> price<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:56.969> actually<00:00:57.800> sort<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.890> half

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the gold price is actually sort of half

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.090 
the gold price is actually sort of half
a<00:00:59.489> commodity<00:01:00.270> price<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.350> when<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> economy<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
a commodity price so when the economy is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.410 
a commodity price so when the economy is
weakening<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.789> goes<00:01:03.360> down<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:04.020> copper<00:01:05.420> but

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
weakening it goes down like copper but

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.330 
weakening it goes down like copper but
it's<00:01:07.080> also<00:01:07.440> got<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.390> monetary<00:01:09.390> characteristic

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
it's also got a monetary characteristic

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.200 
it's also got a monetary characteristic
which<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.960> intrinsic<00:01:13.039> it's<00:01:14.039> not<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.670> bred<00:01:15.030> into

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
which is intrinsic it's not in bred into

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.309 
which is intrinsic it's not in bred into
human<00:01:15.630> beings<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.050> cannot<00:01:16.380> conceive<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.340> any

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:18.319 
human beings I cannot conceive of any

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:20.359 
human beings I cannot conceive of any
mechanism<00:01:19.319> by<00:01:19.440> which<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.800> could<00:01:19.950> say<00:01:20.160> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
mechanism by which you could say that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.919 
mechanism by which you could say that
but<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.840> behaves<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:22.500> though<00:01:23.039> it<00:01:23.190> is<00:01:23.929> intrinsic

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
but it behaves as though it is intrinsic

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.169 
but it behaves as though it is intrinsic
currencies<00:01:25.709> like<00:01:25.979> gold<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.550> silver<00:01:26.670> for

currencies like gold and silver for

the person who shipped the goods in

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
would accept the gold and didn't care

phenomenon it's it's the reason why for
example<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:58.310> renewal<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.599> an<00:02:00.599> agreement

European Central Bank's I believe about

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.419 
European Central Bank's I believe about
allocating<00:02:07.110> their<00:02:07.500> gold<00:02:07.800> sales<00:02:08.160> which

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
allocating their gold sales which

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.910 
allocating their gold sales which
occurred<00:02:08.910> when<00:02:09.259> gold<00:02:10.259> prices<00:02:10.500> are<00:02:10.679> falling

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
occurred when gold prices are falling

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.729 
occurred when gold prices are falling
down<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.880> has<00:02:12.209> been<00:02:12.510> renewed<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.680> year

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
down that has been renewed this year

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.630 
down that has been renewed this year
with<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> statement<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.410> gold<00:02:17.010> serves<00:02:17.430> a

with a statement that it gold serves a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.250 
with a statement that it gold serves a
very<00:02:17.849> important<00:02:18.980> place<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:21.260> monetary

reserves

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.780 
reserves
and<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.730> question<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.799> why<00:02:25.799> did<00:02:25.860> central

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and the question is why did central

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.830 
and the question is why did central
bank's<00:02:27.239> put<00:02:28.110> money<00:02:28.409> into<00:02:29.310> an<00:02:29.909> asset<00:02:30.420> which<00:02:30.629> has

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
bank's put money into an asset which has

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.339 
bank's put money into an asset which has
no<00:02:31.110> rate<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.439> return<00:02:31.760> but<00:02:32.760> cost<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.810> storage

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
no rate of return but cost of storage

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.140 
no rate of return but cost of storage
and<00:02:34.560> insurance<00:02:35.189> and<00:02:35.430> everything's<00:02:35.879> loves

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
and insurance and everything's loves

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.069 
and insurance and everything's loves
like<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.659> why<00:02:37.500> are<00:02:37.560> they<00:02:37.739> doing<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:38.840> if<00:02:39.840> you

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
like that why are they doing that if you

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.929 
like that why are they doing that if you
look<00:02:40.290> at<00:02:40.439> the<00:02:40.560> data<00:02:40.769> with<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.069> very<00:02:41.549> few

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
look at the data with a very few

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.190 
look at the data with a very few
