 hello with you android android today 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.059
 wanted to talk about the novelty game 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.590
 called back what a king she 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.949
 is a parking simulator 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.140
 and by very cool everything is done to me in it 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.010
 like you now see for yourself 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.859
 in the settings of the game you can fuck quality 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.529
 music management graphics are much more 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.660
 of course minus further what's the translation 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.030
 very, very incomprehensibly 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.140
 employees pressing this box office captions then 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.750
 there is some 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.079
 Well, this translation may be wrong. 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.200
 say crookedly done giving 8 what have 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.670
 presents itself push start but here 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.190
 our car as you can see the graphics 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.520
 awesome done we can take from three 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.730
 car but gradually to understand 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.160
 cars closed jeeps mars to the finish 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.230
 and lincoln this model does not ask 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.580
 choose this car and try 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.430
 pass 1 point 1 passed as you understood 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.369
 from genre to 7 sending we need 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.530

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.290
 that's all very cool done now 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.689
 this kill but our car itself we 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.390
 that's driving like that written gas 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.210
 reverse ride can be slow 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.070
 there already drive here to this 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.200
 whether to put rectangle our car 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:34.500
 even so I missed a little is all 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.140
 and some temporarily can hold that 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.890
 we have passed it this detail can gradually 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.750
 pass this game I think it is 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.509
 simulator best senate simulator 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.229
 of this parking because everything is done 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.329

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.570
 qualitatively also if we are with you 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.939
 get hit a different top 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.509
 car there curb from sleep will 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.479

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.920
 so often we will have to do with you 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.319

 didn't work out too see not 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:32.780
 so everything is simple here we can do 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.409
 you need to turn everything clearly and correctly 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:41.629

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:45.650

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:49.189
 I turn so sharply 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.090
