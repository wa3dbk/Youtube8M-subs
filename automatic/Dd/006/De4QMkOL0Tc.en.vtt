there's<00:03:49.590> just<00:03:49.769> fire<00:03:50.010> in<00:03:50.250> there<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.700> doesn't

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
there's just fire in there so it doesn't

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.240 
there's just fire in there so it doesn't
really<00:03:51.239> make<00:03:51.450> much<00:03:51.510> sense<00:03:51.769> but<00:03:52.769> I<00:03:53.040> mean<00:03:53.190> that's

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
really make much sense but I mean that's
