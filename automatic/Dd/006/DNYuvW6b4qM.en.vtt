and<00:02:38.319> may<00:02:38.680> be<00:02:38.739> injured<00:02:39.280> but<00:02:39.459> it<00:02:39.610> could<00:02:39.760> still

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
and may be injured but it could still

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.220 
and may be injured but it could still
bite<00:02:41.459> we<00:02:42.459> can<00:02:42.610> see<00:02:42.760> it's<00:02:42.970> super<00:02:43.569> sharp<00:02:43.930> little

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.729 
bite we can see it's super sharp little
teeth<00:02:45.390> we<00:02:46.390> can<00:02:46.540> make<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.780> dinosaur<00:02:47.230> chomp<00:02:47.500> by

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
teeth we can make the dinosaur chomp by

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.320 
teeth we can make the dinosaur chomp by
squeezing<00:02:48.100> its<00:02:48.340> little<00:02:48.580> legs<00:02:48.610> together<00:02:49.060> like

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
squeezing its little legs together like

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.120 
squeezing its little legs together like
this<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:52.390> also<00:02:52.540> tries<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.019> flap<00:02:53.290> its<00:02:53.470> wings<00:02:53.530> but

this it also tries to flap its wings but
she's<00:02:54.340> injured<00:02:54.880> right<00:02:55.090> now<00:02:55.120> all<00:02:55.600> right<00:02:55.900> let's

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
she's injured right now all right let's

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.539 
she's injured right now all right let's
take<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.200> look<00:02:56.319> at<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.590> wound<00:02:56.830> she<00:02:57.280> got<00:02:57.400> hurt

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
take a look at that wound she got hurt

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.229 
take a look at that wound she got hurt
from<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> fall

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
from the fall

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.990 
from the fall
I<00:02:58.269> can<00:02:58.540> cause<00:02:58.690> erratic<00:02:59.019> back<00:02:59.560> so<00:03:00.430> if<00:03:00.549> we<00:03:00.670> look

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
I can cause erratic back so if we look

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.120 
I can cause erratic back so if we look
at<00:03:01.150> our<00:03:01.209> dinosaur<00:03:01.930> if<00:03:02.049> we<00:03:02.170> flip<00:03:02.410> her<00:03:02.530> up<00:03:02.680> just<00:03:02.709> a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
at our dinosaur if we flip her up just a

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.280 
at our dinosaur if we flip her up just a
little<00:03:03.340> bit<00:03:03.459> we<00:03:03.549> can<00:03:03.700> actually<00:03:03.880> see<00:03:04.330> she's<00:03:05.170> got

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
little bit we can actually see she's got

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.110 
little bit we can actually see she's got
a<00:03:05.350> little<00:03:05.560> bit<00:03:05.739> of<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.980> wounded<00:03:06.459> area<00:03:06.700> right

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
a little bit of a wounded area right

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.070
