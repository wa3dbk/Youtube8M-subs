00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.650
 very good to all kids that just like 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.780
 you are welcome guys again 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.820
 channel welcome to a video of 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.670
 information to a video in which I'm going 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.250
 to announce the new tlc that will come out 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.900
 April 22 for collectives I do not 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.849
 I refer to a type dcc like those of the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.619
 season pass with maps and such but a 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.269
 micro lcd of these that include us 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.159
 camouflages that include us pack 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.529
 legendary characters like that of the 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:27.060
 captain price like that of makárov but 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.189
 this time if what they wanted was 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.319
 surprise me personally they have 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.930
 surprised I do not know if for good or for 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:35.370
 bad but they have got one thing how much 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.219
 less curious than now when the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.539
 if you listen to the truth ossla diaz 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.160
 that I think you're going to flip a little 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.980
 First of all the background game the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.899
 is taken out this morning is playing in the 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.309
 360 as a colleague is very funny for 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.960
 the people who playing this game of 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.640
 I 'm surprised every day more 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.890
 because here in a moment I killed myself 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.230
 four or five who were all in the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.420
 bad windows of the host but 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.129
 good as are some of the campers 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.050
 Sometimes they kill you in places that you do not 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.390
 you are used to watching and it costs you 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.890
 get good games of the jacket 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.480
 that is the people are combined and between 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.310
 bad country 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.720
 the final but good combination 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.400
 the gameplay is pretty good out there 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.810
 catching the sniper and such a 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.970
 pretty good game just dying 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.490
 twice normal and is for comment 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.890
 this micro d lc okay guys we are going to 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.690
 start with the dlc and I tell you that they are what 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.220
 of always camouflages packs but there is a 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.800
 quite original thing that I leave it for 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.370
 then for the middle point of 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.870
 video 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.580
 first of all we start with the new 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.230
 legendary pack the legendary pack for 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.000
 that you get an idea is something similar 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.310
 which they removed from the captain's makárov 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.960
 price but this time with this black 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.680
 Tozongo that I remember coming out 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.840
 which bales 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.700
 I do not know if it came out later because I have not 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.770
 past the story but good the captain 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.050
 swap I do not know if he was captain good soat 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.120
 legendary pack because legendary pajín 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.280
 because it includes the character include 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.500
 converges for the weapon that is not yet 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.930
 very clear sure they get a trailer 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.160
 seeing these camouflages in action with the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.250
 Jota and Bayern and all that always 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.830
 they do then includes the character a 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.030
 camouflage a patch a background of 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.740
 those that you put on the card 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.450
 and also a network of these that 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.880
 puts in the sight of red dot and others 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.310
 so that would be that would be the most 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.850
 caro de steele this dlc since it costs 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.890
 four dollars 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.200
 we went to the simplest packs that 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.610
 include the same nothing more than not 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.980
 they include a character that is 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.810
 include camouflage background patch and 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.330
 reticle for the weapon this makes the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.670
 pack is lowered two dollars ie the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.100
 legendary pack costs four then all 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.260
 those that I am going to announce now cost 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.450
 two dollars well let's go there guys the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.910
 I have tried ordering from ordering more 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.490
 ugly to prettiest in the first place the 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.810
 Sheikh, this one I think is the worst 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.630
 will be with the little dots there 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.220
 brown I think it's fatal 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.930
 then we have the mountain maybe 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.070
 Be cool, I do not know, but for the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.990
 view but I 've already placed it 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.430
 here with a dark tone with stripes 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.960
 yellow I do not know obviously what 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.000
 we have to see in the gun but good 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.040
 this would be the second one that I think is 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.660
 it is uglier what I like the best 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.070
 the camouflages on a personal level is that 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.080
 they remain striking that I the 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.150
 put on the weapon and stand out as 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.240
 example this is the heartland that 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.760
 it has yellow blue tones here 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.410
 oranges this can be pretty 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.070
 striking that is not blue screeching that 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.540
 have we have then in 1987 quite 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.240
 similar to the previous pink tones 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.790
 yellow blue clarito and 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.160
 to marijuana bloom force here we see it 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.230
 the marijuana leaves there in the gun and 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.590
 personally the one that I liked the most and 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.660
 last the sixth that is the eye balls already 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.220
 how cool this camouflage maybe 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.980
 I bought it because I liked it a lot 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.810
 with eyes in comic plan personally 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.060
 I think that can stay pretty 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.160
 well all these packs and I'm telling you 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.410
 include camouflage reticle patch and 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.180
 background are for the price of two 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.370
 dollars or they will be for the price of 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.740
 two dollars apart we have been cast here 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.720
 a pack that is a bit simple 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.340
 it only includes the character but 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.140
 when he includes the character this classic 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.350
 of golf that is also for two dollars 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.290
 and finally we come to the most curious part of 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.700
 this tlc that are the voices that is to say the 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.080
 voices that the game has warned you of 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.580
 that there is a chat with enemies that have 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.100
 taken the flag should they have placed 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.110
 pump or such things as various 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.030
 now that voice is going to change and what more 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.640
 highlights what most famous has been done is 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.320
 the voice of snoop dogg that snoop dogg 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.880
 has a very famous song that is 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.799
 mobile and the insurance that you have 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.060
 Well, I'll leave you a couple of 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.060
 examples to give you an idea 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.510
 and the truth is, guys who are going to how much 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.850
 less curious and with the voice of truth 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.040
 that is quite funny but of course 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.720
 is a voice in English we have the 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.400
 game in Spanish I do not think we snoop 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.260
 dogg as he has also recorded in 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.300
 Spanish no people I guess the tlc 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.820
 although we have the game in Spanish 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.100
 We will English voices the 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.780
 being naked not with the dlc then 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.340
 there are also three lcd other voice that does not 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.410
 I have no whore in that this guy 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.270
 of the instructor I have no idea who is 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.820
 but well I announced it there so that 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.460
 you see and finally the last pack that I 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.080
 remains to be said is the squad pack of 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.540
 extinction is to say the characters of 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.370
 extinction is something weird because we are going to 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.410
 give as several various characters 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.910
 accessories and we will be able to combine them 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.370
 how do we want to use that 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.620
 character in the multiplayer so 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.540
 guys everything is talked about and most 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.820
 curious is obviously the voice 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.160
 the tlc of voices especially with the 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.750
 with I was trying some camouflage 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.100
 I'll make you have safe gameplays 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.870
 nothing else I hope you liked the 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.670
 video the game for the people of time 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.770
 especially that guy in there campeando 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.410
 the toilet 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.580
 nothing else I hope you liked guys we 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.580
 in the 7 video goodbye
