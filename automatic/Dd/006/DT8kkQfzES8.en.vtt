00:00:09.417 --> 00:00:11.166
 The event itself is huge. 

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:15.542
 You don't realize how big it is until you get there ... 

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:18.000
 the size of the buildings and the circuit. 

00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:27.667
 It is good that architecture students gain practical experience ... 

00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:30.750
 and design, build, test and drive something. 

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:36.000
 My name is Robert Camilleri and I am the team leader of Team EPG. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.208
 I look at what we want to achieve ... 

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:42.917
 and make sure we do everything we can to make it work. 

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:50.166
 We have a collective structure and not so much a hierarchical one. 

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:54.041
 As a team from a prestigious university, we want to know ... 

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:57.583
 what innovations are used for this ... 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.500
 and we look at how these innovations can be translated ... 

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:03.375
 to a vehicle for the future. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.166
 Hello, my name is Nathan. 

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:09.333
 I am responsible for the engine control, the drive ... 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.000
 and I manage the maxon meter and the integration with the other circuits. 

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:17.667
 We have tested with two different types of engines ... 

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:20.208
 to see which is the most efficient. 

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:23.542
 Then we link it to the gas pedal ... 

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:25.458
 and the link. 

00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:28.083
 Hello, I am Pete Armstrong. 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.041
 I'm 27 and I'm technical manager of EPGs Team Peggie ... 

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:34.083
 for the Shell Eco-marathon. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.625
 We achieved almost 360 kilometers per kilowatt hour. 

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:40.375
 That can be compared to going from Oxford to Athens ... 

00:01:40.542 --> 00:01:41.917
 with around 5.5 liters of fuel. 

00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:45.125
 We hope to improve this by 10 to 20 percent. 

00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:50.417
 As a technical manager I look at the system integration problems ... 

00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:53.875
 that arise when you install all the technology in the vehicle ... 

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:55.375
 such as the adjustable PV ... 

00:01:55.542 --> 00:01:59.417
 phase control of the coupling and driver applications. 

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:05.750
 We adjust all of this from start to finish. 

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:09.208
 This year we also install solar cells in the vehicle. 

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:13.250
 The PV boys thought it was great how much energy was gained. 

00:02:13.417 --> 00:02:16.333
 About 10 percent of our drive comes from the PV ... 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.083
 and that is very good. 

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:20.917
 I'm Lucy Mahoney. 

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:25.208
 I'm 29 and I'm the driver for EPGs eco vehicle, Peggie. 

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:28.041
 I look forward to making a good attempt. 

00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:30.375
 We have to do ten rounds in forty minutes ... 

00:02:30.542 --> 00:02:32.458
 at around 25 km per hour. 

00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:37.375
 Some teams have very good sponsors ... 

00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:42.208
 and they can build great cars that are efficient in themselves ... 

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:44.208
 but we got Peggie ... 

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:48.250
 So all we have added is our innovation and technology. 

00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:51.125
 So the boys can really be praised for that. 

00:02:56.417 --> 00:03:00.708
 We have new strategies to improve our efficiency. 

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:03.750
 So I accelerate and at a bend I brake ... 

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:07.291
 with which I deliver energy back to the engine. 

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.792
 We have to reach an average of 25 km per hour ... 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.417
 that is 30 km per hour ... 

00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:14.208
 and turns lower the average because I then brake. 

00:03:16.792 --> 00:03:18.917
 It is quite a stressful experience ... 

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:22.208
 because it is hot in the car, it is quite claustrophobic ... 

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:25.000
 and you have a heavy belt in the middle of your chest. 

00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:28.834
 So you are completely stuck in the car, and that is good for safety ... 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.750
 but they are not comfortable forty minutes on the circuit. 

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:50.583
 AFTER THREE SUCCESSFUL ATTESTS 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.959
 ON THE LAST DAY OF THE SHELL ECO-MARATHON ... 

00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:54.083
 ENDED EPG TEAM ON THE SEVENTH PLACE, OF THE 36 IN THEIR CLASS. 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.875
 PEGGIE READ THE EQUIVALENT OF 564.91 KM ... 

00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:57.542
 ELECTRICITY IN ONE KILOWATT HOUR. 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.875
 THE TEAM OF OXFORD ALSO WON THE TECHNICAL INNOVATION PRICE ... 

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:04.333
 AND Â£ 1300 FOR THEIR ONBOARD TECHNOLOGY.
