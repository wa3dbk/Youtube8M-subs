00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
console next we have the controller

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.870 
console next we have the controller
which<00:04:00.020> is<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.890> bit<00:04:01.100> similar<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.610> Neo<00:04:01.790> Geo

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880

which is a bit similar to the Neo Geo
pocket<00:04:02.180> controller<00:04:02.680> except<00:04:03.680> with<00:04:03.830> additional

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
buttons but that I mean as I said say

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.330 
buttons but that I mean as I said say
it's<00:04:08.360> a<00:04:08.480> similar<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.930> Neo<00:04:09.080> Geo<00:04:09.140> pocket<00:04:09.530> is

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
it's a similar to the Neo Geo pocket is

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.150 
it's a similar to the Neo Geo pocket is
actually<00:04:10.730> got<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:11.150> lot<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:12.010> directional<00:04:13.010> pad

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160
