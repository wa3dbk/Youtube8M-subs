00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.470 
society came about 15 years ago around
the<00:02:56.310> time<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:56.670> got<00:02:56.849> here<00:02:57.060> at<00:02:57.120> Carnegie

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
the time that I got here at Carnegie

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.539 
the time that I got here at Carnegie
Mellon<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.620> think<00:02:58.859> it<00:02:58.980> was<00:02:59.069> an<00:02:59.189> initiative

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
Mellon and I think it was an initiative

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.339 
Mellon and I think it was an initiative
that<00:02:59.760> really<00:02:59.909> grew<00:03:00.239> out<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.389> the<00:03:00.599> hunger<00:03:01.049> of<00:03:01.260> a

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
that really grew out of the hunger of a

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.369 
that really grew out of the hunger of a
lot<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.650> us<00:03:01.769> who<00:03:02.659> deal<00:03:03.659> with<00:03:03.720> arts<00:03:04.200> and

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
lot of us who deal with arts and

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.210 
lot of us who deal with arts and
humanities<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.280> see<00:03:05.609> our<00:03:06.109> presence<00:03:07.109> a<00:03:07.560> little

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
humanities to see our presence a little

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.190 
humanities to see our presence a little
bolder<00:03:08.609> and<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.760> little<00:03:08.970> bigger<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:09.299> campus<00:03:09.930> and

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
bolder and a little bigger on campus and

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.479 
bolder and a little bigger on campus and
so<00:03:10.379> we<00:03:10.470> thought<00:03:10.620> well<00:03:10.769> maybe<00:03:11.010> if<00:03:11.159> we<00:03:11.189> join

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
so we thought well maybe if we join

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.759 
so we thought well maybe if we join
forces<00:03:11.720> sort<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.959> artists<00:03:13.439> and<00:03:13.560> then

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
forces sort of the artists and then

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.110 
forces sort of the artists and then
those<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:13.980> us<00:03:14.220> who<00:03:14.370> think<00:03:14.400> about<00:03:14.879> art

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
those of us who think about art

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.869 
those of us who think about art
analytically<00:03:15.810> if<00:03:16.049> we<00:03:16.200> join<00:03:16.439> forces<00:03:16.700> maybe<00:03:17.700> we

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
analytically if we join forces maybe we

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.550 
analytically if we join forces maybe we
can<00:03:18.030> have<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.209> bigger<00:03:18.480> impact<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.200> how<00:03:19.500> the

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
can have a bigger impact on how the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.850 
can have a bigger impact on how the
university<00:03:20.010> sees<00:03:20.459> itself

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.420 

I<00:03:24.840> think<00:03:25.840> what<00:03:25.990> makes<00:03:26.170> our<00:03:26.350> department<00:03:26.860> unique

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
I think what makes our department unique

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.910 
I think what makes our department unique
and<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:28.090> use<00:03:28.570> that<00:03:28.750> word<00:03:28.900> very<00:03:29.170> carefully<00:03:29.260> is

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
and I use that word very carefully is

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.280 
and I use that word very carefully is
that<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:31.060> programs<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.630> we<00:03:31.750> offer<00:03:31.930> at<00:03:32.200> the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
that the programs that we offer at the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.530 
that the programs that we offer at the
undergraduate<00:03:32.650> level<00:03:32.950> are<00:03:33.540> non-traditional

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
undergraduate level are non-traditional

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.410 
undergraduate level are non-traditional
in<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:35.290> sense<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.620> most<00:03:36.580> universities<00:03:37.210> in

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
in the sense that most universities in

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.880 
in the sense that most universities in
this<00:03:37.540> country<00:03:37.600> are<00:03:38.110> offering<00:03:38.470> language

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
this country are offering language

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.500 
this country are offering language
degrees<00:03:39.820> that<00:03:40.270> are<00:03:40.600> designed<00:03:41.230> really<00:03:41.530> to

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
degrees that are designed really to

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.730 
degrees that are designed really to
prepare<00:03:43.510> students<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.260> go<00:03:44.410> into<00:03:44.590> graduate

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
prepare students to go into graduate

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.550 
prepare students to go into graduate
study<00:03:45.310> in<00:03:45.550> languages<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.450> we<00:03:46.930> tailor<00:03:47.380> our

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
study in languages and we tailor our

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.640 
study in languages and we tailor our
courses<00:03:48.220> which<00:03:48.910> are<00:03:49.030> very<00:03:49.210> content<00:03:49.690> heavy<00:03:49.900> to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
courses which are very content heavy to

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.710 
courses which are very content heavy to
allow<00:03:51.250> students<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:51.760> do<00:03:52.030> their<00:03:52.240> own<00:03:52.390> thinking

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
allow students to do their own thinking

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
really focused on teaching students sort

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.310 
really focused on teaching students sort
of<00:04:02.440> deep<00:04:02.950> intellectual<00:04:03.660> knowledge<00:04:04.660> but<00:04:04.870> also

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
of deep intellectual knowledge but also

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.830 
of deep intellectual knowledge but also
useful<00:04:06.100> practical<00:04:06.730> skills<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.330> humanities

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
useful practical skills the humanities

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.310 
useful practical skills the humanities
department<00:04:08.350> is<00:04:08.560> just<00:04:08.610> great<00:04:09.610> for<00:04:10.320> allowing

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
department is just great for allowing

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.410 
department is just great for allowing
students<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.830> explore<00:04:12.160> any<00:04:12.520> of<00:04:13.209> their

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
students to explore any of their

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.250 
students to explore any of their
impossible<00:04:14.170> interests<00:04:14.770> I<00:04:15.209> really<00:04:16.209> liked<00:04:16.720> the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
impossible interests I really liked the

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.150 
impossible interests I really liked the
interdisciplinary<00:04:18.130> approach<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:20.739> fact<00:04:20.980> that

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
interdisciplinary approach the fact that

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.680 
interdisciplinary approach the fact that
it's<00:04:21.280> kind<00:04:21.549> of<00:04:21.609> like<00:04:21.690> international

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
it's kind of like international

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.270 
it's kind of like international
relations<00:04:23.080> but<00:04:23.320> it's<00:04:23.470> more<00:04:23.830> refreshing

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
relations but it's more refreshing

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.450 
relations but it's more refreshing
because<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:25.350> takes<00:04:26.350> on<00:04:26.530> an<00:04:26.740> anthropological

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
because it takes on an anthropological

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.140 
because it takes on an anthropological
focus<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.750> just<00:04:29.350> focusing<00:04:30.310> on<00:04:30.400> cultures<00:04:30.880> and

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
focus and just focusing on cultures and

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.730 
focus and just focusing on cultures and
languages<00:04:31.570> I'm<00:04:31.780> really<00:04:32.229> into<00:04:32.560> that

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
languages I'm really into that

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.580 
languages I'm really into that
so<00:04:33.240> just<00:04:34.240> seemed<00:04:34.450> like<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.750> perfect<00:04:34.930> major

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
so just seemed like the perfect major

I<00:06:14.370> became<00:06:15.419> serious<00:06:16.419> about<00:06:16.660> it<00:06:16.810> is<00:06:16.990> where<00:06:17.620> I

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
I became serious about it is where I

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.470 
I became serious about it is where I
developed<00:06:19.050> the<00:06:20.430> passion<00:06:21.430> and<00:06:21.640> the<00:06:21.730> toolbox<00:06:22.270> to

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
developed the passion and the toolbox to

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.940 
developed the passion and the toolbox to
be<00:06:23.050> a<00:06:23.860> poet<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:24.730> so<00:06:25.660> without<00:06:25.990> the<00:06:26.260> training

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
be a poet and so without the training

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.880 
be a poet and so without the training
and<00:06:27.220> without<00:06:28.230> everything<00:06:29.230> that<00:06:29.500> I'd<00:06:29.620> learned

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
and without everything that I'd learned

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.730 
and without everything that I'd learned
here<00:06:30.340> I<00:06:30.660> would<00:06:31.660> not<00:06:31.840> have<00:06:32.050> even<00:06:32.290> been<00:06:32.530> able<00:06:32.680> to

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
here I would not have even been able to

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.590 
here I would not have even been able to
make<00:06:32.919> that<00:06:33.070> next<00:06:33.370> step<00:06:33.550> into<00:06:33.880> getting<00:06:34.180> my<00:06:34.360> MFA

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
make that next step into getting my MFA

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.360 
make that next step into getting my MFA
and<00:06:34.990> then<00:06:35.500> I<00:06:35.560> certainly<00:06:35.860> would<00:06:36.130> have<00:06:36.190> had<00:06:36.340> a

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
and then I certainly would have had a

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.510 
and then I certainly would have had a
harder<00:06:36.790> time<00:06:36.820> making<00:06:37.120> that<00:06:37.240> next<00:06:37.480> step<00:06:37.750> into

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
harder time making that next step into

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.680 
harder time making that next step into
teaching
