00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.250
 car 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.970
 ni 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.970
 me 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.969
 2 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.590
 ni 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.590
 me 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.590
 uh 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:48.390
 The index finger to the little finger are numbered most frequently 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:53.309
 It is very simple and six horizontal lines are drawn 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.579
 It will be the strings of the guitar as it is right now 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:02.990
 If you want it to look a little upwards and say why 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:08.710
 A lot of arms to the power when pressing the cord 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.710
 Re is the end and ask them to help to gravity 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.710
 Another and are oriented such Fu 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.000
 I can not use it at all 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.210
 this 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.520
 You may wish you to something in a little reference condition out Hami 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.670
 So 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.240
 Thumb up 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.829
 We will continue to held against in such Fu 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:37.350
 The fingers are distributed horizontally like this 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:41.850
 So it can be classified like horizontal code 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.870
 In that case the finger is risky like this 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.240
 Rather if the palm of the hand 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:54.860
 A word placed near the horizontal along the neck is desirable 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:59.540
 Fret charge of the middle finger to 1 fret charge of index finger 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:03.250
 That Mr. Fred in charge is called ring finger like that 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:07.580
 It is possible to skillfully this classification 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.660
 It is said that the joints here are atrocities 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.819
 Not in the opposite direction but in the opposite direction 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.319
 I'm getting this way 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.319
 I think you can see 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.599
 me 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.599
 goo 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.500
 me 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.400
 me 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.400
 goo 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.280
 Yup 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.280
 me 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.020
 me 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.020
 It is good 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.020
 goo 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:56.060
 The practice to be done from now on is a foothold with one finger on the ground 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:58.190
 Repeat that say or keep or release the one of the finger for another 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.420
 I practice 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:10.710
 This sometimes is I So First Nee 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:17.670
 Let's do a little bit of talking and holding the ring finger with the middle finger as a foothold 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:24.120
 Just because the index finger is already quite cramped and it's already aired from here 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:27.810
 It will be a bit cramped and hard to get you up 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.370
 Absolutely the index finger 6 to 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.880
 Not to do this 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:39.000
 Already ring finger when pressed a minor mark on 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:45.290
 It is in such a positional relationship to the middle finger 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.290
 In short, most of the code to be used next is also prepared here 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.300
 And you can see the wind that 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.310
 U 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:58.150
 And it will rotate die the elbow to the body direction 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:03.100
 Middle finger ring finger 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:06.100
 Because you can bring to the ceiling through this kind of entrainment 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.100
 car 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.000
 me 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 uh 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.540
 Uu Ufu' 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.340
