00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.130
 The quarter was gone again after I had been fired. I kept repeating it. 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.599
 I woke up and I was so scared to fall asleep. 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.559
 That's why I do it once. 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.430
 I'm glad it's a dream. 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.110
 I am fortunate to have a dream. 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.050
 So we are really listening to the talk that idea, but the monthly Catch 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.869
 You really have to walk it to the player. 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.490
 One of our handmade tangerines 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.470
 Maybe there is not a balloon capitol and you did it at the place. I really applaud everyone. 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.470
 If you give me warm, that's it. 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.940
 There's a difference in the dangers, but it's just that people can do it. 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:49.970
 So that puts them athletes with family 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:52.309
 Just the family will suffer the same pain and the same pain. 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.839
 In the case of Kim Je-Bin, 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.640
 He did two economic cooperation in the country's four minutes, so I'm a little 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.000
 Because he is. 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.290
 That is why 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.430
 And when I go up, I have a hard dream, so if you come out, 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:16.500
 There will also be situations where you do not know 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.500
 So far , all I've done is World Championships , 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:28.600
 I could not hold him in that position and not carry it like this. 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:31.800
 I do not think there will be any more coming because my parents and I both care . 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.840
 So this time , 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.950
