00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:07.109
 i have so many mail now 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.000
 ask why I do not have one 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.280
 Looking back on the week, make me more 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.299
 idea now picked up again and off 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.369
 There is always 19 hours on Sundays 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.710
 a week review for needle game 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.810
 and a preview for the next week 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.699
 I also am trying so halfway 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.159
 to keep in mind 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.919
 let's see, but sometimes it stops 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:34.300
 different from what you think you are in here 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:39.070
 video look while I use the 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.710
 I've got a weekly review 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.859
 the Roman garnison I was up to date 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.000
 faith forgive about mountains of it 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.230
 shopped 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.910
 yes yes I know and after that 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.859
 entangle and empower the russians altogether 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.600
 a bit is cumbersome collar 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.570
 Enabling things is quite funny 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.940
 but larger parts are very tedious 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.920
 I'm sorry for that, I thought 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.299
 I just take it from me 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:14.020
 all and all the canadian and power 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.810
 from a ceiling made me domino effect 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.640
 have for it red black gray mottled 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:25.049
 and creamy white as colors and 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.659
 I'll turn it into a blanket 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.540
 It's going to be pretty tough, though 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.460
 think but also pretty pretty and the 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.850
 I'll just go during the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.189
 Weekly review and you 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.250
 can then always the progress of 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:46.200
 look blank so what was going on this week 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.770
 I have this summer so pretty 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.860
 dedicated to my new garden and 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.870
 Last week I have a lot 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.330
 prepared for the winter and for the 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.840
 gaggle category floating around this 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.979
 become 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:07.080
 on the far left she is the squirrel 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:09.830
 nesting box here there is mealworms 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:17.510
 which are then already for spring 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:21.360
 nester and dumpling and nests 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.430
 Peanut butter so I will 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.959
 then mount everything in the trees and 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.370
 there will be a picture of what that is 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.370
 but was not needle playing course 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:39.590
 I worked a bit further 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.590
 at the top lisas circles 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.939
 and the lucie of course was on the 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.430
 project came back very interested 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.939
 vigorously around that and a camera in the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:59.109
 Close sits the desire 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:03:03.549
 lucy get moving times, sometimes gently 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:06.579
 beautiful well so you remember when you 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:10.180
 lisa sharpener had our arrival so 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.700
 a beautiful toppan from last 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.829
 very simple loops together 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.750
 joined and I have the same 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.019
 After crocheting that will be a bit 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.239
 different because I different these circles 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.730
 but have joined together her I see 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.049
 I am already relatively far upper part 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.599
 I already have it 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.030
 But I would like to sleep longer 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.719
 have your turn 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.609
 maybe I will too 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.650
 cut out a bit height 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.579
 make two tracks higher 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.620
 but you will realize that I will turn you on 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.329
 the current it is quite 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.370
 Interesting ones at the end of the week 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.750
 which one actually asks the time 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.750
 has expelled the whole week 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:54.920
 I have one for example 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.670
 adventskalender video finished 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.980
 after being better prepared and now 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.530
 I show you once like that sometimes 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.560
 happened under difficult conditions 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:11.659
 if they are really loose 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:16.729
 then I usually cut that 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:18.799
 yes then partially out or this 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.889
 video for example i will do it again 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.930
 turn when distracted me so loose 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:31.389
 that I totally slip out of the picture 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.389
 with the paws so with my paw 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.639
 and usually the lucia is not like that 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.849
 interested in yarn except where from 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.070
 cuddle 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:46.340
 she always wants to shake her dead 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.479
 if that is such an initial thread before her 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.610
 nose hops around 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.949
 she can not stop then 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.020
 resist 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.449
 i have my love not the video 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.720
 to finish 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:05.630
 what else was going on facebook became one 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.060
 very important question is asked 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.650
 By the way, a series of videos ask quieter 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.630
 give where you can ask that you always 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.539
 I just wanted to ask 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.789
 consider where I set up the 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.220
 Questions can be asked 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:25.990
 Of course not all will be answered 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.990
 but I will always pick some 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:34.500
 and dear birgit wagner asked 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.500
 if she should continue like this 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:46.110
 the answers to this are ours 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:47.850
 facebook so much fun 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:54.780
 I still forget something and the preview 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:57.060

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.370
