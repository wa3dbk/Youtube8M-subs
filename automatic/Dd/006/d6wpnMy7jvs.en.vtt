00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.509
 such that lead to differentiation to 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.240
 this process is known as 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.539
 population and is considered a 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.980
 survival process 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.980
 in the process they are distinguished 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.270
 2 chromosomes 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.420
 stage 1 the dna is condensed constituting 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.880
 an axial filament stage 2 is formed a 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.190
 septum near the cell pole because of 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.190
 the imagination of the cytoplasm membrane 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.000
 information is delimited by two 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.720
 membranes since the cytoplasm membrane 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.720
 from the cell 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.909
 stage 4 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.540
 by the peptidoglycan arrangement of 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.540
 the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.810
 appears the pillage and the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.220
 stage 6 mature 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.210
 stage 7 the in 2 by a is released by the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.210
 autolysis
