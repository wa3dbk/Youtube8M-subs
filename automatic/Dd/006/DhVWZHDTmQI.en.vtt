00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
so wide in this spot in general that I

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.119 
so wide in this spot in general that I
want<00:00:58.340> to<00:00:58.780> protect<00:00:59.780> my<00:01:00.079> weaker<00:01:00.469> calls<00:01:00.739> and

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
want to protect my weaker calls and

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.150 
want to protect my weaker calls and
balance<00:01:01.519> my<00:01:01.699> range<00:01:02.000> by<00:01:02.989> having<00:01:03.530> some<00:01:03.800> big

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
balance my range by having some big

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
pairs in my call range and also because

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.330 
pairs in my call range and also because
I<00:01:08.380> think<00:01:09.380> I'm<00:01:09.560> just<00:01:09.680> gonna<00:01:09.800> get<00:01:10.010> too<00:01:10.190> many

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
blinds I doubt I'm gonna get her to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.800 
blinds I doubt I'm gonna get her to
stack<00:01:18.290> off<00:01:18.530> anything<00:01:18.860> worse<00:01:19.250> than<00:01:19.280> like<00:01:19.909> maybe

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
stack off anything worse than like maybe

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.649

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
Jackson Ace King preflop so there's not

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.420 
Jackson Ace King preflop so there's not
all<00:01:23.869> that<00:01:23.900> much<00:01:24.079> value<00:01:24.439> and<00:01:24.920> just<00:01:24.950> trying<00:01:25.310> to

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
all that much value and just trying to

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.340

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
felt the hand and now I'm pretty much

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.179 
felt the hand and now I'm pretty much
just<00:01:33.409> gonna<00:01:33.829> call<00:01:34.130> down<00:01:34.369> with<00:01:34.579> it<00:01:34.759> post<00:01:34.970> flop<00:01:35.270> I

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
just gonna call down with it post flop I

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.950 
just gonna call down with it post flop I
might<00:01:37.189> even<00:01:37.369> find<00:01:37.549> a<00:01:37.939> fold<00:01:38.210> if<00:01:38.479> it<00:01:38.570> goes<00:01:38.720> pop

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
might even find a fold if it goes pop

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.730 
might even find a fold if it goes pop
bottle<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.829> on<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.340> river<00:01:40.549> I<00:01:41.619> think<00:01:42.619> it's

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
bottle and on the river I think it's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.440 
bottle and on the river I think it's
pretty<00:01:42.920> likely<00:01:43.040> she's<00:01:43.520> aces<00:01:43.850> or<00:01:44.000> a<00:01:44.030> set<00:01:44.299> at

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
pretty likely she's aces or a set at

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.810 
pretty likely she's aces or a set at
that<00:01:44.630> point<00:01:47.770> it's<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.799> bet<00:01:49.009> sizing<00:01:49.520> having

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
that point it's the bet sizing having

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.060 
that point it's the bet sizing having
gone<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.149> way<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.390> did<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.409> I'm<00:01:51.500> expecting

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
gone the way it did and I'm expecting

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:01.270 
gone the way it did and I'm expecting
something<00:01:52.310> like<00:01:53.170> 600<00:01:54.170> here<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:59.920> think<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.100> she

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
something like 600 here I think that she

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.170 
something like 600 here I think that she
can<00:02:01.430> show<00:02:01.610> up<00:02:01.670> with<00:02:01.820> his<00:02:01.850> little<00:02:02.060> as<00:02:02.299> ace<00:02:02.479> Queen

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
can show up with his little as ace Queen

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.249 
can show up with his little as ace Queen
the<00:02:05.180> check<00:02:05.509> is<00:02:05.719> weird

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
the check is weird

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:14.770 
the check is weird
oh<00:02:06.579> I<00:02:11.050> don't<00:02:12.050> think<00:02:12.260> she<00:02:12.440> ever<00:02:12.560> checks<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.780> hand

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
oh I don't think she ever checks a hand

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.570 
oh I don't think she ever checks a hand
that<00:02:14.930> beats<00:02:15.170> me<00:02:15.440> here

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.760 

okay<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.450> decide<00:02:22.840> what<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.050> want<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.380> do<00:02:23.440> with<00:02:23.590> bet

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
okay I decide what I want to do with bet

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.400 
okay I decide what I want to do with bet
sizing<00:02:24.310> here<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.750> could<00:02:25.750> go<00:02:25.840> for<00:02:26.020> six<00:02:26.230> or<00:02:26.380> seven

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
sizing here I could go for six or seven

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.920 
sizing here I could go for six or seven
hundred<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:30.150> hope<00:02:31.150> get<00:02:31.420> called<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.780> bit

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
hundred and hope get called a bit

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.820 
hundred and hope get called a bit
lighter<00:02:32.170> or<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.470> can<00:02:32.710> just<00:02:32.740> ship<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:37.830> bet

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.970 
gonna say there's a chance that I get
min<00:02:43.870> raised<00:02:44.050> bluffed<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.650> there's<00:02:44.800> some

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
min raised bluffed and there's some

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.940 
min raised bluffed and there's some
value<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.960> but<00:02:46.960> I<00:02:46.990> don't<00:02:47.470> think<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:47.920> I

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
value in that but I don't think so I

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.340 
value in that but I don't think so I
think<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.400> play<00:02:48.550> is<00:02:48.580> just<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.970> stick<00:02:49.210> it<00:02:49.330> in<00:02:52.350> be

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
think the play is just to stick it in be

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.020 
think the play is just to stick it in be
pretty<00:02:53.590> sick<00:02:53.830> if<00:02:54.010> she<00:02:54.160> tanks<00:02:54.490> and<00:02:54.640> calls<00:02:54.820> with

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
pretty sick if she tanks and calls with

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.050 
pretty sick if she tanks and calls with
better<00:02:55.240> here<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:57.250> wouldn't<00:02:57.490> be<00:02:57.640> completely

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
better here it wouldn't be completely

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.360 
better here it wouldn't be completely
shocked<00:02:58.450> she's<00:02:58.960> a<00:02:59.370> see<00:03:00.370> two<00:03:00.550> pair<00:03:00.820> or<00:03:01.060> whatever
