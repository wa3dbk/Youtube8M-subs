00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
unique pack and that it opens right

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.369

along<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.800> top<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:36.210> pack<00:00:36.420> or<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.170> I

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
along the top of the pack or this I

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.430 
along the top of the pack or this I
guess<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.979> tops<00:00:38.219> not<00:00:38.749> the<00:00:39.749> normal<00:00:40.079> loading

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.860 
guess the tops not the normal loading
spot<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:41.639> so<00:00:41.819> it<00:00:41.940> opens<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.569> a<00:00:42.629> big
