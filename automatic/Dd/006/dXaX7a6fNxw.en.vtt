00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
couple of years ago so I got to thinking

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.610 
couple of years ago so I got to thinking
about<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> booth<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.140> everything<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> said

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
about the booth and everything I said

about the booth and everything I said
you<00:00:52.680> know<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.250> remember<00:00:53.579> seeing<00:00:54.360> an

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
you know I think I do remember seeing an

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.410 
you know I think I do remember seeing an
exhaust<00:00:55.410> fan<00:00:55.579> outside<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.879> went<00:00:57.120> checked

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
exhaust fan outside so I went checked

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.060 
exhaust fan outside so I went checked
sure<00:00:58.050> enough<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:58.469> their<00:00:58.620> brand-new

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
sure enough it was their brand-new

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.240 
sure enough it was their brand-new
in-the-box<00:00:59.340> never<00:01:00.090> open<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.129> know

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
in-the-box never open so then you know

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.359 
in-the-box never open so then you know
to<00:01:02.309> simply<00:01:02.730> cut<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> hole<00:01:04.100> based<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
to simply cut a hole based on the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.120 
to simply cut a hole based on the
pattern<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.850> box<00:01:06.119> itself<00:01:06.860> duct<00:01:07.860> taped

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
previous owner duck did that and this is

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.440 
previous owner duck did that and this is
flexible<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.920> expandable<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.119> pull<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
flexible and expandable so I can pull it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.499 
flexible and expandable so I can pull it
away<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.530> ducted<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.250> through<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
away and then I ducted that through this

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.620 
away and then I ducted that through this
box<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.369> I<00:01:35.369> can't<00:01:35.909> remember<00:01:36.150> what<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.479> was

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
box that I can't remember what it was

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.840 
box that I can't remember what it was
that<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.869> had<00:01:36.900> gotten<00:01:37.200> delivered<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.700> got

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
that we had gotten delivered and I got

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.010 
that we had gotten delivered and I got
to<00:01:38.909> thinking<00:01:39.150> about<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> could<00:01:39.720> run<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
to thinking about so I could run it

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.210 
to thinking about so I could run it
through<00:01:40.259> instead<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.920> putting<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.159> through

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
through instead of putting it through

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.310 
through instead of putting it through
the<00:01:41.340> window<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.939> leaving<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> gap<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.079> said<00:01:43.259> I

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the window and leaving a gap I said I

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.859 
the window and leaving a gap I said I
could<00:01:43.439> put<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.770> box<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.869> through

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
could put it in this box right through

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.139 
could put it in this box right through
the<00:01:45.960> other<00:01:46.110> side<00:01:46.320> tape<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> all<00:01:47.070> up<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.490> then

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the other side tape it all up and then

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.670 
the other side tape it all up and then
what<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.869> simply<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:52.020> know<00:01:52.140> open<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
what I do is simply you know open up the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.490 
what I do is simply you know open up the
window<00:01:53.030> pop<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.210> box<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.689> because<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.259> about

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
window pop the box in because it's about

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.580 
window pop the box in because it's about
four<00:01:56.040> inches<00:01:56.070> deep<00:01:56.610> as<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.719> see<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.290> then

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
four inches deep as you can see and then

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.499 
four inches deep as you can see and then
I<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.860> made<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> little<00:01:59.189> piece<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.579> filler

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
going and then I created a filter to run

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.580 
going and then I created a filter to run
through<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:33.030> for<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.900> ventilation<00:02:34.410> and

through to be for the ventilation and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.760 
through to be for the ventilation and
then<00:02:35.450> using<00:02:36.450> dr.<00:02:36.720> Frankie's<00:02:37.020> at<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> add<00:02:37.380> 50

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
then using dr. Frankie's at the add 50

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.940 
then using dr. Frankie's at the add 50
go

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
go

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.800 
go

worked well I've used it a few times now

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:08.170 
worked well I've used it a few times now
put<00:03:02.260> this<00:03:02.379> little<00:03:02.650> small<00:03:02.920> light<00:03:03.489> in<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.730> top

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.240 

cop<00:03:08.690> like<00:03:08.930> when<00:03:09.140> I'm<00:03:09.230> painting<00:03:09.500> is<00:03:09.890> brighter

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.910 
it's a little deeper then ones are like
55<00:03:52.040> or<00:03:52.310> 56<00:03:52.730> board<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:54.260> think<00:03:54.739> it<00:03:54.799> works

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
55 or 56 board so I think it works

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.740 
55 or 56 board so I think it works
pretty<00:03:55.040> well<00:03:55.250> I've<00:03:56.000> used<00:03:56.269> it<00:03:56.359> a<00:03:56.420> few<00:03:56.599> times

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
pretty well I've used it a few times

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.259 
pretty well I've used it a few times
with<00:03:57.109> some<00:03:57.440> just<00:03:57.709> doing<00:03:57.950> some<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.310> acrylic

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
with some just doing some of the acrylic

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.970 
with some just doing some of the acrylic
paint<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.750> haven't<00:04:00.049> tried<00:04:00.170> it<00:04:00.230> obviously<00:04:00.680> with

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
paint I haven't tried it obviously with

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.599 
paint I haven't tried it obviously with
the<00:04:01.129> enamel<00:04:01.760> because<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.299> is<00:04:02.420> inside<00:04:02.780> and

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
the enamel because it is inside and

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.580 
the enamel because it is inside and
seems<00:04:04.609> to<00:04:04.670> work<00:04:04.819> out<00:04:04.940> very<00:04:04.970> well<00:04:05.180> so<00:04:05.870> again

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
seems to work out very well so again

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.660 
seems to work out very well so again
there's<00:04:07.579> got<00:04:07.730> to<00:04:07.819> be<00:04:09.280> thinking<00:04:10.280> about<00:04:10.430> what

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
there's got to be thinking about what

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.110 
there's got to be thinking about what
