00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
the marathon is all about and therefore

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.320 
the marathon is all about and therefore
you<00:01:33.040> know<00:01:33.220> there<00:01:33.370> isn't<00:01:33.490> anything<00:01:33.880> in<00:01:34.150> life

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.210 

I<00:02:23.670> decided<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.450> take<00:02:24.570> by<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.750> time<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.350> think<00:02:25.920> I

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
I decided to take by the time I think I

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.760 
I decided to take by the time I think I
felt<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.330> need<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.720> know<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
felt the need you know it's the the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.160 
felt the need you know it's the the
decision<00:02:29.370> he<00:02:29.520> didn't<00:02:29.760> leave<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.210> felt<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:30.960> I

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
decision he didn't leave I felt like I

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.690 
decision he didn't leave I felt like I
really<00:02:31.890> remember<00:02:32.250> him

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
really remember him

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.950 
really remember him
I<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:33.030> do<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:36.470> this<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.530> my<00:02:37.860> first<00:02:38.220> marathon

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
I can do this this is my first marathon

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.620 
I can do this this is my first marathon
the<00:02:39.960> reason<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.590> started<00:02:41.070> running<00:02:41.280> was<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.600> I

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
the reason I started running was that I

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.070 
the reason I started running was that I
had<00:02:43.020> gotten<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.400> really<00:02:44.580> had<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.760> shape<00:02:45.080> by

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
had gotten so you really had a shape by

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.590 
had gotten so you really had a shape by
the<00:02:46.110> time<00:02:46.410> my<00:02:46.590> marriage<00:02:46.950> came<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:47.700> an<00:02:47.850> end<00:02:47.880> I

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
the time my marriage came to an end I

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.960 
the time my marriage came to an end I
guess<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.709> just<00:02:49.860> decided<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.610> was<00:02:50.730> time<00:02:50.910> to

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
guess I just decided that it was time to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.170 
guess I just decided that it was time to
do<00:02:51.209> something<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:52.260> get<00:02:53.190> back<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.820> person

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
do something to get back to the person

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.610 
do something to get back to the person
that<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.300> used<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.690> be<00:02:56.959> people<00:02:57.959> ask<00:02:58.260> me<00:02:58.440> why<00:02:58.590> I

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
that I used to be people ask me why I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.190 
that I used to be people ask me why I
run<00:02:58.890> marathons<00:02:59.459> I<00:03:00.000> wanted<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> t-shirt

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
run marathons I wanted for the t-shirt

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.500 
run marathons I wanted for the t-shirt
and<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:02.040> said<00:03:02.250> what<00:03:02.340> do<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.459> mean<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.270> said

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
and I said what do you mean and I said

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.479 
and I said what do you mean and I said
because<00:03:03.600> that's<00:03:03.959> my<00:03:04.080> very<00:03:04.350> subtle<00:03:04.800> way<00:03:04.950> about

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
because that's my very subtle way about

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.240 
because that's my very subtle way about
saying<00:03:05.790> hey<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.209> did<00:03:06.630> something<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.830> feel

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
saying hey I did something that I feel

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:23.460 
saying hey I did something that I feel
that<00:03:08.280> most<00:03:09.030> people<00:03:09.540> can't<00:03:09.900> do

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:43.150 

this<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.680> like<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:25.160> job<00:03:25.460> I<00:03:26.270> love<00:03:26.690> my<00:03:27.050> job<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.980> need

to

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.410 

I<00:03:54.920> hadn't<00:03:55.520> really<00:03:55.730> reached<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:56.060> point<00:03:56.240> in<00:03:56.390> my

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
I hadn't really reached a point in my

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.160 
I hadn't really reached a point in my
life<00:03:56.480> where<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:56.900> didn't<00:03:57.230> think<00:03:57.500> that<00:03:58.430> I<00:03:59.170> could

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
life where I didn't think that I could

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.830 
life where I didn't think that I could
ever<00:04:00.350> be<00:04:00.500> happy<00:04:00.650> again<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:02.330> has<00:04:02.480> really

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
ever be happy again and this has really

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.800 
ever be happy again and this has really
given<00:04:03.170> me<00:04:03.520> such<00:04:04.520> a<00:04:04.550> positive<00:04:05.090> outlook<00:04:05.690> I<00:04:07.810> think

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
given me such a positive outlook I think

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:30.679 
given me such a positive outlook I think
I<00:04:09.110> can<00:04:09.710> pretty<00:04:10.130> much<00:04:10.220> do<00:04:10.520> anything

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:35.309

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
mass is 10 6 miles it's not too late

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.929 
mass is 10 6 miles it's not too late
you<00:04:41.110> give<00:04:41.379> a<00:04:41.499> sense<00:04:41.770> of<00:04:41.919> kinship<00:04:42.399> with<00:04:42.759> these

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:42.939 
you give a sense of kinship with these

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.059 
you give a sense of kinship with these
away<00:04:43.419> fries<00:04:43.719> you<00:04:44.469> running<00:04:44.800> in<00:04:44.919> their

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.050 

basically<00:05:17.100> because<00:05:18.100> it's<00:05:18.310> really<00:05:18.759> fun

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060
