00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.580 
are definitely going to change and I'm
hoping<00:03:06.630> things<00:03:06.840> are<00:03:06.960> gonna<00:03:07.080> change<00:03:07.170> for<00:03:07.410> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
hoping things are gonna change for the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.000 
hoping things are gonna change for the
better

my shaman like it would come at the most
unn<00:03:49.610> tune<00:03:50.610> times<00:03:51.000> where<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:51.990> needed<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.459> fire

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
unn tune times where I needed to fire

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.260 
unn tune times where I needed to fire
our<00:03:54.120> flame<00:03:54.480> shock<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:55.380> target<00:03:55.770> but<00:03:56.270> my

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
our flame shock the target but my

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.720 
our flame shock the target but my
foundation<00:03:57.930> was<00:03:58.170> already<00:03:58.620> maxed<00:03:59.190> out<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.550> I

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
foundation was already maxed out and I

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.390 
foundation was already maxed out and I
needed<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.150> use<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.480> then<00:04:00.990> invent<00:04:01.740> then<00:04:02.220> and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
needed to use it then invent then and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.550 
needed to use it then invent then and
there<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:03.470> unfortunately<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:06.080> just<00:04:07.080> couldn't

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
there and unfortunately I just couldn't

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.530 
there and unfortunately I just couldn't
because<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:08.100> need<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:08.790> keep<00:04:08.970> up<00:04:09.180> your<00:04:09.360> flame

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
because you need to keep up your flame

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.270 
because you need to keep up your flame
shock<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.990> make<00:04:10.230> sure<00:04:10.350> that<00:04:10.530> your<00:04:10.800> lava<00:04:11.040> burst

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
shock to make sure that your lava burst

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.370 
shock to make sure that your lava burst
resets<00:04:11.760> because<00:04:12.570> that's<00:04:12.780> like<00:04:13.020> one<00:04:13.200> of<00:04:13.230> the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
resets because that's like one of the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.860 
resets because that's like one of the

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
it's not a damage well it is kind of a

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.210 
it's not a damage well it is kind of a
damage<00:04:49.210> increase<00:04:49.389> but<00:04:49.990> it's<00:04:50.229> also<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.620> visual

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
damage increase but it's also a visual

badass I think they more spec should be
having<00:04:56.199> stuff<00:04:56.710> like<00:04:56.949> this<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.729> I<00:04:58.120> think<00:04:58.360> it's

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
having stuff like this and I think it's

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.189

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
just great but other than that this

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.990 
just great but other than that this
