ok<00:00:07.550> we're<00:00:08.149> going<00:00:08.240> to<00:00:08.300> integrate<00:00:08.690> some<00:00:09.380> double

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
ok we're going to integrate some double

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.640 
ok we're going to integrate some double

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
it on the Telecaster something that

it on the Telecaster something that
everybody<00:00:14.450> does<00:00:14.600> a<00:00:14.629> lot<00:00:14.840> of<00:00:15.129> you<00:00:16.129> probably

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:16.370 
everybody does a lot of you probably

everybody does a lot of you probably
find<00:00:16.700> double<00:00:17.000> stopping<00:00:17.360> in<00:00:17.450> most<00:00:17.660> every<00:00:17.810> style

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
find double stopping in most every style

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.970 
find double stopping in most every style
anyway<00:00:18.560> but<00:00:18.880> it's<00:00:19.880> it's<00:00:20.330> you<00:00:20.660> know<00:00:20.779> largely<00:00:21.410> or

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
anyway but it's it's you know largely or

style<00:00:24.800> playing<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:25.699> we're<00:00:26.060> going<00:00:26.119> to<00:00:26.269> take<00:00:26.420> the

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
style playing so we're going to take the

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.269 
style playing so we're going to take the
first<00:00:26.810> pattern<00:00:27.080> pattern<00:00:27.529> everyone<00:00:27.949> as<00:00:28.099> we've

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
first pattern pattern everyone as we've

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.279 
first pattern pattern everyone as we've
been<00:00:28.429> going<00:00:28.670> along<00:00:28.730> with<00:00:29.089> and<00:00:29.839> we're<00:00:30.109> going<00:00:30.230> to

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
been going along with and we're going to

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.140 
been going along with and we're going to
play<00:00:30.439> through<00:00:30.650> that<00:00:30.859> pattern<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:31.460> add<00:00:31.820> double

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
play through that pattern and add double

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.420 
play through that pattern and add double
stop<00:00:32.330> leg<00:00:32.570> kind<00:00:32.870> of<00:00:32.960> bend<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.320> it<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:34.100> it<00:00:34.190> sounds

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
stop leg kind of bend to it so it sounds

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:46.600 
stop leg kind of bend to it so it sounds
like<00:00:34.490> this<00:00:44.649> okay<00:00:45.649> so<00:00:45.710> what<00:00:46.070> we're<00:00:46.160> doing<00:00:46.190> is

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
like this okay so what we're doing is

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.369 
like this okay so what we're doing is
we're<00:00:46.879> going<00:00:47.000> up<00:00:47.239> our<00:00:47.449> first<00:00:47.719> pattern<00:00:48.199> just

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
we're going up our first pattern just

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:55.270 
we're going up our first pattern just
like<00:00:48.440> we<00:00:48.649> always<00:00:48.800> do<00:00:49.210> massive<00:00:50.210> oru<00:00:50.539> it<00:00:54.190> to<00:00:55.190> the

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
like we always do massive oru it to the

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.189 
like we always do massive oru it to the
ain't<00:00:55.489> no<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.850> occupate-o<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.629> g<00:00:56.840> string<00:00:57.079> and

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
ain't no the occupate-o the g string and

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.229 
ain't no the occupate-o the g string and
2nd<00:00:57.680> fret<00:01:00.129> now<00:01:01.129> we<00:01:01.190> get<00:01:01.489> here<00:01:01.789> we're<00:01:01.969> gonna<00:01:02.059> put

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
2nd fret now we get here we're gonna put

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.299 
2nd fret now we get here we're gonna put
our<00:01:02.359> third<00:01:02.570> finger<00:01:02.809> down<00:01:03.050> on<00:01:03.109> the<00:01:03.289> B<00:01:03.469> note<00:01:03.739> at

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
our third finger down on the B note at

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.710 
our third finger down on the B note at
the<00:01:04.489> fourth<00:01:04.730> fret<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.180> we're<00:01:05.300> gonna<00:01:05.390> bend

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
the fourth fret and we're gonna bend

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:14.160 
the fourth fret and we're gonna bend
that<00:01:05.900> beam<00:01:06.140> up<00:01:06.350> up<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:07.160> a<00:01:07.190> C<00:01:07.400> sharp

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.640 

so<00:01:15.170> we<00:01:15.680> end<00:01:15.830> up<00:01:15.980> with<00:01:16.010> this<00:01:20.320> now<00:01:21.320> i'm<00:01:21.470> also

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
so we end up with this now i'm also

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.470 
so we end up with this now i'm also
using<00:01:21.800> my<00:01:22.160> first<00:01:22.460> finger<00:01:22.700> in<00:01:22.910> my<00:01:23.030> second

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
using my first finger in my second

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.450 
using my first finger in my second
finger<00:01:23.660> to<00:01:24.020> push<00:01:24.260> up<00:01:24.440> on<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.680> g<00:01:24.920> string<00:01:24.950> to

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
finger to push up on the g string to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.270 
finger to push up on the g string to
help<00:01:25.670> with<00:01:25.820> intonation<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:27.710> as<00:01:27.830> close<00:01:28.040> as<00:01:28.190> i

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
help with intonation it as close as i

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.390 
help with intonation it as close as i
possibly<00:01:28.700> can<00:01:28.760> and<00:01:29.270> also<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.979> just<00:01:31.010> it<00:01:31.370> just

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
possibly can and also it just it just

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.430 
possibly can and also it just it just
makes<00:01:31.729> it<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.910> lot<00:01:32.000> easier<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.479> bend<00:01:32.750> that<00:01:32.960> tube

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
makes it a lot easier to bend that tube

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.620 
makes it a lot easier to bend that tube
in<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.770> strength<00:01:34.130> for<00:01:34.700> accuracy<00:01:35.600> or

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
in that strength for accuracy or

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.620 
in that strength for accuracy or
whatever<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.880> we've<00:01:37.880> been<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.210> B<00:01:38.330> note<00:01:38.570> up

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
whatever so we've been the B note up

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.430 
whatever so we've been the B note up
then<00:01:41.630> we're<00:01:41.780> going<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:41.930> take<00:01:42.020> our<00:01:42.110> first

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
then we're going to take our first

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.900 
then we're going to take our first
finger<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:43.100> we're<00:01:43.190> going<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.369> play<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.729> C

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.590 

now<00:05:44.440> let's<00:05:44.680> look<00:05:44.800> at<00:05:44.889> the<00:05:45.009> right<00:05:45.190> hand<00:05:45.479> I'll<00:05:46.479> go

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
now let's look at the right hand I'll go

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.659 
now let's look at the right hand I'll go
over<00:05:46.720> that<00:05:46.840> real<00:05:47.050> slow<00:05:47.289> of<00:05:48.100> course<00:05:48.370> the

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
over that real slow of course the

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.370 
over that real slow of course the
pattern<00:05:49.060> hadn't<00:05:49.330> changed<00:05:49.570> as<00:05:49.960> far<00:05:49.990> as<00:05:50.289> the

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
pattern hadn't changed as far as the

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.749 
pattern hadn't changed as far as the
right<00:05:50.530> hand<00:05:50.740> is<00:05:50.800> concerned<00:05:51.130> with<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.490> scale

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
right hand is concerned with the scale
