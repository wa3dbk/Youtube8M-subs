00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
it's just me or if it's not meant to do

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.290 
it's just me or if it's not meant to do
that

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
part I recommend the way first because

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.540 
part I recommend the way first because
it's<00:02:30.260> much<00:02:30.470> easier<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:31.130> what<00:02:31.280> you're<00:02:31.400> going<00:02:31.520> to
