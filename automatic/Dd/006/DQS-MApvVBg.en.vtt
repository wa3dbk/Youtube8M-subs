00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
it's also very very short

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.690 
it's also very very short
it's<00:02:30.760> about<00:02:30.940> six<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.510> seven<00:02:31.870> hours<00:02:32.490> at<00:02:33.490> the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.180 
it's about six to seven hours at the
maximum<00:02:34.209> but<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.140> be<00:02:35.230> honest<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.650> couldn't<00:02:35.890> take

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
maximum but to be honest I couldn't take

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.760 
maximum but to be honest I couldn't take
much<00:02:36.459> more<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.880> first<00:02:37.120> person's<00:02:37.540> breath<00:02:37.770> but

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
much more this first person's breath but

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.589 
much more this first person's breath but
overall<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.250> gameplay<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.150> game<00:02:40.390> is

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
overall the gameplay in this game is

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.290 
overall the gameplay in this game is
actually<00:02:40.870> okay<00:02:41.800> even<00:02:42.640> though<00:02:42.730> some<00:02:43.180> parts

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
actually okay even though some parts

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.670 
actually okay even though some parts
about<00:02:44.250> for<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> movie<00:02:45.700> game<00:02:45.940> it's<00:02:46.360> actually<00:02:47.200> all

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
about for a movie game it's actually all

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.680 
about for a movie game it's actually all
right<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.370> mean<00:02:48.760> there's<00:02:49.209> way<00:02:49.810> worse<00:02:50.739> than<00:02:51.690> this

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
right I mean there's way worse than this

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.680 
right I mean there's way worse than this
game<00:02:53.220> definitely<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:55.000> we're<00:02:55.180> all<00:02:55.270> okay

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
game definitely so we're all okay

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:06.300 
game definitely so we're all okay
gameplay<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:04.450> graphics<00:03:04.660> for<00:03:05.500> King<00:03:05.709> Kong<00:03:05.920> are

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
gameplay the graphics for King Kong are

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.330 
gameplay the graphics for King Kong are
actually<00:03:07.209> okay<00:03:07.390> for<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.930> GameCube<00:03:08.410> they

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
actually okay for the GameCube they

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.509 
actually okay for the GameCube they
definitely<00:03:09.640> aren't<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.239> best<00:03:10.450> though<00:03:10.930> on<00:03:11.290> it

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
definitely aren't the best though on it

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.100 
definitely aren't the best though on it
there's<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.700> lot<00:03:12.910> of<00:03:13.090> detail<00:03:13.540> in<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.870> world

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
there's a lot of detail in the world

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.920 
there's a lot of detail in the world
that's<00:03:14.830> pretty<00:03:15.069> much<00:03:15.190> me<00:03:15.340> where<00:03:15.930> like

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
that's pretty much me where like

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.520 
that's pretty much me where like
graphics<00:03:17.500> are<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:18.510> didn't<00:03:19.510> see<00:03:19.810> any<00:03:19.989> framerate

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
graphics are I didn't see any framerate

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.380 
graphics are I didn't see any framerate
drops

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
drops

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.539 
drops
screen<00:03:22.390> tearing<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.890> graphics<00:03:24.340> are<00:03:24.519> just

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
screen tearing the graphics are just

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.640 
screen tearing the graphics are just
okay<00:03:25.150> though<00:03:25.360> I<00:03:25.390> mean<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.810> kind<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.290> ugly<00:03:26.590> in

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
okay though I mean it kind of ugly in

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.400 
okay though I mean it kind of ugly in
some<00:03:26.920> parts<00:03:27.250> but<00:03:27.569> most<00:03:28.569> the<00:03:28.720> game<00:03:28.900> is<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.110> lot<00:03:29.260> of

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
some parts but most the game is a lot of

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.910 
some parts but most the game is a lot of
detail<00:03:29.860> like<00:03:30.069> stalker<00:03:30.459> so<00:03:30.940> I<00:03:31.530> guess<00:03:32.530> it's<00:03:32.709> kind

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
detail like stalker so I guess it's kind

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.699 
detail like stalker so I guess it's kind
of<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.069> mixed<00:03:33.370> bag<00:03:33.610> I'm<00:03:34.510> just<00:03:34.900> gonna<00:03:35.290> say<00:03:35.680> I

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
of a mixed bag I'm just gonna say I

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.890 
of a mixed bag I'm just gonna say I
guess<00:03:36.040> okay<00:03:36.519> that's<00:03:36.940> over<00:03:37.150> really<00:03:37.510> is<00:03:37.630> just

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
guess okay that's over really is just

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:47.150 
guess okay that's over really is just
alright

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.140

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
Moody and atmospheric I guess if you

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.470

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
pretty much the first-person stuff but

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.090 
pretty much the first-person stuff but
it's<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.360> good<00:05:03.540> game<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:04.080> it's<00:05:04.470> pretty<00:05:04.860> short

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
it's a good game and it's pretty short
