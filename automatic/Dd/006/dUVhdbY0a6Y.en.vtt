00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.620
 a couple of months after the tour who's next media brings from those who acquire 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.930
 roa pillars to mexican soil we can go preparing for the experience that 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.380
 will be 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.960
 with the most recent calm kit delivery dedicated to one of the most 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.560
 great metal bands of all time 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.720
 metallic 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.240
 as in previous versions you should follow the instructions on the rich screen 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.109
 to simulate playing an instrument 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.669
 be it the guitar the bass the drums 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.939
 or perform the vocal execution being this possible alone or with 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.489
 All the group 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.699
 similarly the game includes the study mode in which they can be done 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.699
 own compositions and share online with other users 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.780
 since the introduction titadyn the metal is more than impressive 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.640
 introducing us to the group walking in slow motion while it sounds to you this 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.250
 circus that ennio morricone 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.900
 theme they use to open their concerts 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.210
 then they can play 28 songs like metallica or intimate of other groups 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.470
 that they selected themselves being the band brito hour of the concerts 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.050
 and if the extra difficulty seems simple, there is an express mode 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.320
 lux where you can connect a second criminal to the battery 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.850
 if they make them vibrate themes like perovic guaita has done that year 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.650
 nouguÃ©s four corners this video game will place them in the scenarios in the 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.650
 who has touched the group throughout his career 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.890
 within the first releases of the 28th minute series for wii that ooze 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.090
 titles that were originally released for nintendo that said 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.390
 we have mario paul tennis that places sea and its friends participating in a tournament 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.780
 of the sport king 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.580
 which went smoothly until 40 valdivia were presented 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.370
 melgar alliance with breaks to compete in a not very clean the main 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.160
 novelty is that now they play tennis through the sensitive control of 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.120
 trial movement similar to Luis porras although as usual 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.840
 mario ain sports games what surprise throughout the network 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.930
 with which you can activate different powers that will disconcert your 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.430
 opponent giving them the advantage like for example the club with which they can 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.800
 throwing shells there was another with which they will reach the ball no matter 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.790
 where are they 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.960
 In addition, such a scenario offers interactive elements 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.020
 in the case of the wiki mansion you should be careful with the ghosts 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.270
 while in the user factory 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.789
 the ground has platforms that moves 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:18.789
 There are also new mini-games that give you longer title duration 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.349
 just missed a good way in Lima 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.679
 there is no doubt that the world is crazy 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:31.269
 a city can be taken completely by a few individuals so that it 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.529
 serve as a playground for one of the bloodiest spectacles that 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.519
 never been transmitted 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.429
 pyonyang 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.819
 is caught in a program of contests like 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.769
 one where do you have to go 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.229
 and the more attic your procedure, the more points you get 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.229
 These points will allow you to have access to the file 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.399
 at your disposal all the time until a 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:55.129
 and let's talk social 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.029
 besides allowing them decent 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.029
 since karadzic has shown to be some cuts 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:03.589
 each adversary minus means point and apart 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:07.049
 although they do have serna 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.219
 for example maybe they have to catch someone with a bail spence perform it 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.099
 with a sign to finish it with some peculiar doors with spikes 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.579
 all using movement-sensitive control for our actions 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.729
 the graphics and the visual style are great aznar 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:28.409
 cutting black and white cartoons but with very red blood 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.349
 all carry 7 jackson without anything fire producer like circ function 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:39.329
 something has hit the spacecraft in which the cosmos plied peacefully 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.699
 Captain Olimar during his holidays 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.749
 and is forced to undertake a forced landing 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:48.499
 well I was born in something like a shock against a strange, inhospitable planet 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:52.829
 since it only has 30 days of air that can breathe oxygen 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.769
 it fulminates life 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.870
 the panorama is not hopeful but good filing discovers an object similar to 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.400
 a secuoya the creatures that come from mezzanine and animal 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.409
 who follow your orders and spark 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.819
 so take advantage of the situation to help you look for the different 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.349
 pieces of your ship that went off after the collision this is the 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.839
 basic premise of the picnic review 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:17.079
 strategy game that now uses the wii control to manage 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.310
 you point to the screen and point to different places to call some 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:24.600
 penguins could throw them though they should also take care of them 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.030
 because there are hostile creatures in the well-designed scenarios 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.550
 the graphics have been improved in this version and if they did not play it when 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.650
 it came out so that even 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.460
 now is the opportunity
