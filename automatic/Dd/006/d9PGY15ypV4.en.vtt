00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:45.630 
very interesting to see who want a
Hawaii<00:04:38.680> plate<00:04:39.810> Alaska<00:04:40.890> same<00:04:41.890> thing<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:44.640> they

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
Hawaii plate Alaska same thing and they

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.310 
Hawaii plate Alaska same thing and they
have<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:46.260> Bicentennial<00:04:47.340> Pennsylvania<00:04:48.340> plate

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
have the Bicentennial Pennsylvania plate

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.080 
have the Bicentennial Pennsylvania plate
we<00:04:50.320> made<00:04:50.500> these<00:04:50.650> from<00:04:50.979> 71<00:04:51.700> to<00:04:52.320> 77<00:04:53.320> I<00:04:53.590> think<00:04:53.830> and

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
we made these from 71 to 77 I think and

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.560 
we made these from 71 to 77 I think and
this<00:04:55.090> one<00:04:55.300> is<00:04:55.450> 75<00:04:56.169> and<00:04:56.200> 76<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:57.390> this<00:04:58.390> is<00:04:58.540> a

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
this one is 75 and 76 so this is a

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.409 
this one is 75 and 76 so this is a
Bicentennial<00:04:58.990> Bicentennial<00:04:59.890> play<00:05:00.419> pretty

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
Bicentennial Bicentennial play pretty

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:11.490 
Bicentennial Bicentennial play pretty
much<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:03.060> guess<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.270> could<00:05:04.419> say

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.960 

so<00:05:12.500> I<00:05:12.530> intend<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.070> get<00:05:13.190> more<00:05:13.400> plates

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
so I intend to get more plates

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.310 
so I intend to get more plates
eventually<00:05:16.090> I'm<00:05:17.090> going<00:05:17.300> to<00:05:17.360> try<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:17.870> join<00:05:18.020> a

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
eventually I'm going to try and join a

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.170 
eventually I'm going to try and join a
LPGA<00:05:21.610> see<00:05:22.610> if<00:05:22.730> I<00:05:22.880> can<00:05:24.340> get<00:05:25.340> some<00:05:25.550> plates<00:05:25.790> set<00:05:26.060> up

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
LPGA see if I can get some plates set up

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:35.520 
LPGA see if I can get some plates set up
swap<00:05:26.480> meet

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.500 

so<00:05:36.530> not<00:05:37.130> a<00:05:37.160> bad<00:05:37.310> collection<00:05:37.780> but<00:05:40.419> missing<00:05:41.419> a

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
so not a bad collection but missing a

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.469 
so not a bad collection but missing a
lot<00:05:41.660> of<00:05:41.690> states<00:05:41.990> in<00:05:42.169> the<00:05:42.260> southwest<00:05:43.479> like

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
lot of states in the southwest like

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.420 
lot of states in the southwest like
Arizona<00:05:45.380> Oklahoma<00:05:46.240> Nevada<00:05:47.240> I<00:05:48.340> don't<00:05:49.340> have

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
Arizona Oklahoma Nevada I don't have

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.200 
Arizona Oklahoma Nevada I don't have
Montana<00:05:49.910> either<00:05:50.150> I<00:05:50.560> don't<00:05:51.560> have<00:05:51.710> South<00:05:52.310> Dakota

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:02.260 

ice<00:05:56.210> of<00:05:56.540> them<00:05:56.690> have<00:05:57.760> Alabama<00:05:58.760> lose<00:05:59.449> Louisiana
