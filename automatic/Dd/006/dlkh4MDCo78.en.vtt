00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.319
 so first of all thank you all for 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.800
 the comments I received 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.280
 regarding the previous video 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:20.060
 in my case therefore the matrix is ​​this 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:25.920
 here that is the model now I see it here f 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 1281 to five this side the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.360
 English version with English writing 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.630
 therefore likely to have several 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.710
 we said different functions compared 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.629
 different functions than that 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.140
 Italian to show for example 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:52.980
 I put cotton I put it cornetto 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:57.660
 cotton and even if I wear cotton here 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.910
 I have no indication of entering 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.510
 of the prewash option 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:09.119
 whiteley walsh as it is written here and there 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.350
 I can optionally enter and then a 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.939
 these other options as di rita 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.090
 delay 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.070
 the quiz that should be option 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.299
 that of the basket that it spins with 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.570
 several different rotations and then can 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.090
 favorit but I don't know what it is yet 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.810
 so this is my display for 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.540
 regarding the spin the centrifuge 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.000
 can go up to 1200 as in the case 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.329
 cotton then in the program of the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.810
 cotton will be stronger people I do not 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.759
 I honestly have never proven 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.420
 I tried it once 1200 but I didn't 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.960
 had a great response and clash with 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.040
 the noise therefore this and for how much 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.990
 concerns the display 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:08.750
 so if I give you an example, I modify ho 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:12.690
 noticed that those on the left can 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.640
 change to be entered 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:21.060
 the prewash while for example if 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.980
 I put the sport here does not let me enter it 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.620
 so on the right surely there 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.370
 will be programs except me that 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.770
 do not allow me to enter while 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.990
 here on the left for example is cocotte 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:42.060
 makes me the pre-wash mix of ago 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:45.180
 easy prewash that makes the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.490
 prewash this war version 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:53.630
 English then we will have cotton cotton 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.630
 he mixed physical jazz mixes for the south 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.170
 Here sheets on the bed and you have to skin 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.470
 that even this should me here at 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.130
 this one gives me regarding the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.300
 baby that aimed the matically the 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.240
 prewash with the medic wings option 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:21.239
 so the one for taken for washing 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:27.180
 with the build the detergent that 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:30.600
 we said that disinfectant I noticed that 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:35.340
 there is a qua option here at 32 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.820
 1 option 2 in which allows me to 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.410
 select you see badly 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.050
 unfortunately, it allows me to 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:49.130
 select a doctor in the option one 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.130
 rings and a dryer e 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:57.500
 and spin 1 and 2 while in option 2 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:04:01.090
 or tram save then allows to 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.549
 saving time is also a 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.069
 intensive I have not sincerely looked on 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:11.000
 manual, however, what this means 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.099
 regarding the display of that 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.409
 of my model 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:18.320
 another to answer the question that 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.579
 I was made on the la tub 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.389
 my tank eg 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:26.060
 it is in this way therefore I have here for 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.590
 as for you see the symbol yes 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:33.169
 however, he sees the symbol of the little flower badly 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.650
 fair point written software that would be 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.630
 the softener almost a level 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.150
 maximum where you have to be careful not to 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.580
 get over it 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.240
 here is the tray with the symbol one for 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.729
 the prewash and on the left we have 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.800
 the tray with the symbol 2 for the 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.159
 normal washing that in this should 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:59.960
 respond to the previous precedent 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:06.020
 question this point is 8 kg of 18 triple 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:12.260
 a is this here is how the il presents itself 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:14.120
 this basket here and this is the 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.419
 seal an important thing to 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.750
 look for let's say if for long duration 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.139
 of this of this machine is to look 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.360
 always the seal that you do not have 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:32.150
 where are small balls or things like this 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:35.000
 which then ruin the hard life 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.909
 of the life of the washing machine 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.510
 Here are these little pebbles 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:44.659
 try to check high and 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:48.770
 watch that there are no dirty things 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:51.050
 or even mud or particular dirt 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.570
 on this is that the seal is then made 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.970
 soon to ruin 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.830
 otherwise this machine 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.970
 this to this washing machine 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:05.690
 it is not that there is much inside there is the 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.370
 tumblr the basket that runs with 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.530
 behind the inverter motor two 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.920
 shock absorbers that do that make the 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.600
 pressure they make so that not that 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.410
 don't let it not do too much for 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.060
 action 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.280
 you don't put an important thing in it 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.280
 nothing above because then it does even more 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.180
 noise is another thing that it is 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.730
 free the washing machine for each item 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:33.850
 free on each side and also the back 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.850
 that you do not touch we will not touch thanks
