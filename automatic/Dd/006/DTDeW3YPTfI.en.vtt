00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.760
 the very good welcome portal 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.490
 coches.net we are going to give us a return in 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.670
 this citroën c4 cactus accompanied by 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.670
 favor 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.289
 and 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:11.570
 we started to look out four 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.820
 meters and fifteen centimeters of the last 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.789
 newness of citroën this citroën c4 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.860
 cactus that is a car at least 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.969
 peculiar has a lot of things to 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.280
 comment 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:25.340
 mainly not only by design but 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.869
 also well then things that it brings 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.390
 for the first time what he rides for the first 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.829
 time and things that stop riding by 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.130
 example what else will have called you the 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.259
 attention are those kind of plates 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.439
 plastic on the sides that are the 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.990
 airbags that well that they have been 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.470
 devised by citroën to save the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.360
 body of those frictions with other 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.039
 doors of other cars or with columns 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.239
 in the parking lots and so on that the truth 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.829
 is that they will save your body and 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.750
 above all they will save you having to 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.520
 Take the car to sheet metal because of the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.390
 continuous scratches that normally then 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.820
 they usually happen 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.860
 how did you see it in this first shot 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.140
 of contact inside the truth is that 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.750
 It has a pretty attractive design that 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.429
 happens the quality of the materials is not 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.410
 very much there but we can not say that 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.790
 be a low cost car because good to 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.330
 from 15,000 euros a 415 car with 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.040
 pretty cheap engines below 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.510
 of the 100 euros this power of the 100 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.730
 euros of the 100 horses this 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.200
 example is the maximum expression in diesel 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.420
 100 100 horsepower diesel engine 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.510
 Five-speed manual gearbox and 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.770
 comes out for 17 thousand 950 euros you have it 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.650
 from 15,000 with gasoline engine 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.989
 of environment 80 horses with this that 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.430
 I mean, if we had 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.230
 moved around 11 thousand twelve thousand euros 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.730
 in the access price , maybe if 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.100
 could have been considered as low 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.780
 cost but let's say it's a little 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.090
 above all more because of the design and 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.060
 he has seen it on the outside that is that frontal 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.580
 for example that never seen but clear 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.140
 we also have that for example a point 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.340
 more that we have loved is this 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.470
 glove box 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.500
 the truth is that we love it seems 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.540
 a speaking position talking fast and 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.879
 place and colloquially but has 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.830
 some defects do not defects or some 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.780
 important absences for example there is no 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.580
 how many revolutions do you have to change 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:21.580
 by ear the truth is that it does not stop being 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.200
 well then weird for example there are things a 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.019
 little more bullshit like for example that 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.150
 in the driver's window not his 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.280
 touch and get off whole but there are other 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.260
 things that surprise more like 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.810
 example the rear windows that do not 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.430
 you can download are compass to the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.890
 old and the truth is something that 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.390
 It is also surprising in the 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.349
 most basic models train brakes 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.129
 drum the steering wheel for example is 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.799
 adjustable in height but not in 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:51.129
 depth are small things that have 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.560
 wanted to save and that good depends 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.959
 how it will make you think values 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.090
 that the car is worth it or not in 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.950
 this particular case for example at the level 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.720
 of habitability is pretty good no 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.340
 I know if you've seen the rear seats and 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.550
 the truth is that well they hold 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.250
 enough trunk 358 liters 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.460
 in the mean you can say was expected 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.560
 with that volume because it's had a 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.390
 little bit a little bit we had a little bit 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.850
 more capacity but good is what 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.769
 there is then now you have to do 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.510
 your accounts and see if with this price and 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.490
 with what this citroën c4 offers you 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.260
 cactus because it suits you or not it suits you 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.280
 at the level of consumption that yes we are 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.380
 very happy because after we have 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.270
 made 355 kilometers at the moment and is 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.640
 in five liters on average and we've done 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.950
 very many urban circulation 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.680
 besides he is such this works pretty 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.210
 well we would like for example that the 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.740
 guided the change so a little better 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.970
 the truth is that for example we 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.860
 we have many problems when it comes to 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.200
 put third I do not know why but we were 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.940
 it is quite stuck in the end they are small 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.600
 small details things you have to 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.060
 assess and of course at the time of 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.460
 think about acquiring a car that 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.620
 we predict and we think we are safe 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.810
 that will sell a lot we are 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.540
 convinced that it is a car that attracts 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.560
 a lot to people and that despite things 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.620
 For example, this panoramic roof 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.510
 fantastic that is very well we love 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.490
 but that does not have shutter is worth the 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.800
 roof is treated but I want to see it myself 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.020
 in Seville with 42 degrees the new month of 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.150
 August as well as small children 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.590
 they spend heat in the end this kind of 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.660
 things are what you have to value well 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.250
 I 'm going to leave it here you know that 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.140

 this model and you already know that we are
