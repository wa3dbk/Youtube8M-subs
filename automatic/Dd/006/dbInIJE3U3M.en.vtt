00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 So welcome to the blu-ray tips 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.580
 For the weekend today I introduce you 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.929
 superman before 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:14.940
 yes that's the superman box in front of the three 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:18.210
 films in there are de na good that's five 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.890
 I want to film two of them 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.630
 actually not really count 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.869
 So part 1 is superman the movie 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.460
 pretty cool so the stories known 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.769
 So now for the occasion of the man of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.560
 steel it is clear that I am you 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.270
 of course superman also from 1970 with 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.280
 christopher reeve to heart lie superman 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.890
 the movie a fairytale movie like the book 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.140
 is a comic film very nice in scene 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.910
 set very nicely tells for some 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.829
 maybe too lengthy by now 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.469
 you also find great is a beautiful 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.390
 Superman movie will be nice to everything 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.879
 was so completely from all over from the beginning 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.059
 Everything now tells like men of steel 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.949
 just differently interpreted at 8 note 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.949
 70s version with christopher reeve wears 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.210
 yes still underpants it now too 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.649
 think the reinterpretations also nice 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.019
 but i would go over my theories 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.930
 but about the 78er christopher reeve 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.640
 Superman filming by Richard Thunder 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.680
 who made level depen- 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.770
 has the level dude row who knows her 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.240
 not haha what did we laugh about? 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.360
 here are of course great if one 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.159
 superman 2 alone against all super my 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.570
 three combatants water heat pump 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.759
 Comedy is superman four the world on 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.400
 Abyssal grade which is switched off 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.229
 natural medium which is really something 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.280
 bad cards so much shit 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.500
 could you bad that you actually him 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.140
 rather should supersede and superman 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.320
 returns where he is just a bit 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.000
 depression has the good superman and 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.189
 causing the air to fly ok yes and he 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.960
 can logically be an entire planet 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.409
 Full of power , the air is okay 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.200
 give and then but still in the field 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.430
 but in the sun 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.110
 these are the movies you spend yes 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.850
 but should be here so I am sitting 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.200
 would like to put in the middle super 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.230
 my influence was because they were then 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.090
 in a twisted funnily in the 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.820
 same period of Brewster was 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.690
 cinema will nod nickily also because I 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.430
 yes yes superman 1 and 2 are 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.570
 actually a movie in itself 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.100
 but they would be completed 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.510
 go over three hours together 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.530
 that's probably why they are 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.080
 only appeared together 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.810
 superman 2 will be pretty awesome now 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.650
 when looking at men's style 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.440
 of course you say 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.270
 the parallel ones are there with those with the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.680
 crypto never on and so what but I want 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.420
 Do not betray too much so much 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.720
 content superman comes to earth and 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.060
 has gone almost a symbol is a 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.300
 guys or girls movie yes at superman 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.530
 Is it really so I have so far 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.170
 I say next time I'm speaker for me 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.360
 I always had girlfriends that 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.580
 do not care so much and otherwise 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.050
 There are always exceptions to the rule 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.100
 but otherwise I would say 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.750
 is it more of a classic boy 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.320
 I almost became a plastic junior section 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.320
 say 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.140
 I am the exception namely in protection 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.150
 So do not worry, with whom I look to 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.040
 best best buddy I am 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.390
 also has more on my brother coined he has 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.920
 almost showered me with it as a child 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.200
 That's why I'm using this one now 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.130
 so that superman almost as 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.090
 have a kind of religion look at it 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.530
 I watch the movie with that 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.180
 answered what can I eat there 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.209
 but I know afterwards how to drink 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.160
 because I'm super horny ice cubes so 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.500
 great if symbol ice cubes have that 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.150
 means I will have a few longdrinks 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.730
 make and get a few ice cubes in 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.140
 wrap up superman form so much white 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.549
 I will definitely do it 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.580
 probably any small ones 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.049
 snacks but the drink question is 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.130
 definitely answered and i will 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.130
 probably not so much for its 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.810
 Price in the tate ratio at the box 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.459
 currently not 30 degrees 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.519
 I only know that I am for my part 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.310
 I was pretty cheap at 30 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.190
 euro at 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.980
 endanger when I had the whole box 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.110
 and then the garnison strong superman 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.870
 is I then eventually I called 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.550
 I have closed for 20 euros 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.170
 that 's how it can go more so completely eyes 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.910
 on the road at the so it can 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.010
 go that also looks at amazon from so 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.450
 that is of course everything is flashing so 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.970
 if you want to know I do not know if 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.919
 The box is still as sexy as her 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.810
 because sometimes the pigs change 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.280
 yes, but I'm not there either 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.200
 another pranger standing in the box 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.300
 In any case, currently how much it costs 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.790
 if you are in the mood for men of 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.650
 steel maybe even through the 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.010
 film series or the first part 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.030
 he is somewhere a dutiful program 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.250
 continued doing it the building 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.320
 Answer I secretly hope so 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.240
 here is definitely more than half 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.900
 Although thought to superman 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.490
 alone against all the second of 78 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.900
 was realized was actually 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.850
 also thought that someday 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.320
 a few years later a relative again 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.760
 aebischer film comes a worthy 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.200
 Continuation does not include a tent 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.180
 really as a continuation 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.160
 And because that's my comedy, I say 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.220
 already with economy free so create 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.330
 without joke 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.370
 That's why returns was actually the 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.320
 third part for the least the know 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.620
 so to speak a kind of homage to the 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.150
 second part so should be a third 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.310
 part 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:21.710
 and not to forget that 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:23.600
 actually very good okay, it is an often 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.250
 head back so I think it is 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.840
 meanwhile more than clear that it 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.690
 really a start film for me 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.600
 is I watched the movies, so yes 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.610
 yes you can watch the movies often and it 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.350
 especially shares the third part 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.880
 I have to look again and again 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.740
 I've been on it for a while now 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.570
 me is a beautiful comedy the can 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.550
 you also often because superman yes 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.990
 also men would have a side role now 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.820
 I'm interested in how you like the movies 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.410
 especially maybe even finds that 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.919
 first superman of the mobi i got myself 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.970
 a bit blabbed sorry though 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.930
 me now but wait a minute with you 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.500
 Maybe you know that 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.090
 third part yes and how 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.620
 how do you like the superman series? 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.660
 in particular, will take part in the fourth 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.180
 just fuck you, what do you say ? 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.570
 returns on and on as I am 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.570
 hot on us
