00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.490
 toning is also one of the factors 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.889
 which affects safety during 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.110
 movement but how to properly toned 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:25.019
 car which film to choose 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:25.769
 let's talk on this subject with his body and so 2 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.189
 Topics 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.050
 car tinting primarily 100 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.390
 still need to pay attention when we 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.250
 appeal to this or that company or me 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.469
 what to make the car angry when choosing 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.829
 film and the second topic is still 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.040
 guests of films namely 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.920
 light transmission 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.620
 Well, the first thing you should pay 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.469
 attention when installing taniry tinted 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.660
 tinting film is the quality itself 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.120
 film quality film is divided into 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.949
 several criteria first this 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.410
 light transmission 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.300
 let's start with the most dubbing 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.600
 film about what features it should 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.700
 perform first of course she 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.180
 should save you from strangers 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.180
 views 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.030
 second moment this is a solar overlooked 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.520
 ray training should skip 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.409
 minimum ultraviolet rays to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.229
 keep cool in the cabin in hot 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.689
 day and third tint strength 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.909
 film to make you somehow sloppy 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.310
 touching or loading 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.869
 something in the salon could not hurt her 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.549
 we also take into account that we are 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.130
 raise lower the glass and it 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.770
 erased so you should 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.380
 warn all the above films 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.939
 from one manufacturer or another you 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.040
 let's work with proven 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.799
 manufacturers who do everything 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.840
 these features besides our film is easy 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.409
 set and as we said earlier 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.799
 removed I for example heard and know it 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.760
 about 12 film producers how much 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.800
 produce you 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.460
 stopped at the 4 most reliable and 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.590
 proven 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:05.020
 this is a contrast to yourself fil and sf and global with 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.300
 dubbing film is clear but what 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.220
 concerns guests and light transmission at 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.380
 us for example what's the question in the suspended 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.150
 condition but from time to time it 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.680
 raise the water workout cars 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.840
 side of traffic police yes we still have 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.150
 this question is solved but abroad you 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.930
 may face trouble 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.010
 connection with the tinted car is not 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.940
 by standards 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.640
 then how to be tinted well, first 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.890
 let's start for the rear side windows and 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.989
 rear window can tint than 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.180
 pleasing to the bill but no rules and 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.010
 there are no restrictions if we come to 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.800
 front side windows and frontal 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.260
 according to the guest translucency 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.250
 must be at least 70 percent we 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.920
 offer a film of seven ten percent 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.020
 light transmission that is you will not see 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.269
 virtually no change with the native 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.280
 glass but it keeps everything 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.730
 darker tint properties 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.269
 films 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.700
 Now this film she misses 70 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.860
 per cent of the world as it should be but according to GOST 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.200
 while retaining all the functions as well as 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.049
 another dubbing film i.e. 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.080
 does not transmit ultraviolet light 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:19.170
 Respectively and does not pass heat 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.150
 in addition, it is very important that 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.610
 energy saving and winter time everything 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.830
 the heat will stay in the cabin that 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.690
 will eventually result in saving gasoline well 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.100
 reflected heat stays in the cabin then 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.840
 there is essentially a principle 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.350
 energy-saving metal-plastic 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.900
 windows 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.630
 in the summer we do not miss the heat in the winter 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.340
 heat save that is all it will pour out 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.660
 in saving gasoline 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.460
 stove will not work does not fill 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.590
 gear to keep warm and the car 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.240
 in the summer, respectively, we will not 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.310
 at least often include air conditioning because 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.130
 that this film will save prahlad 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.080
 draw conclusions if you want it not 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.700
 toned your car first 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.100

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.880

 observe the year rear windows you can
