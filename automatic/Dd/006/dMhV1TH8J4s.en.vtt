basically<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.820> answer<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.180> we<00:03:42.510> shooting<00:03:42.750> HD

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
basically the answer is we shooting HD

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.500 
basically the answer is we shooting HD
we<00:03:43.620> edit<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.070> HD<00:03:44.460> the<00:03:45.000> reason<00:03:45.300> we<00:03:45.390> don't

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
we edit in HD the reason we don't

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.630 
we edit in HD the reason we don't
deliver<00:03:45.930> all<00:03:46.170> our<00:03:46.290> videos<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.650> HD<00:03:46.770> is<00:03:47.190> because

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
deliver all our videos in HD is because

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.430 
deliver all our videos in HD is because
a<00:03:47.670> lot<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.060> our<00:03:48.240> users<00:03:48.360> have<00:03:48.780> slow<00:03:49.080> broadband

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
a lot of our users have slow broadband

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.930 
a lot of our users have slow broadband
connections<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:50.040> wouldn't<00:03:50.700> be<00:03:50.730> able<00:03:50.790> to

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
connections and wouldn't be able to

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.810 
connections and wouldn't be able to
watch<00:03:51.170> high<00:03:52.170> quality<00:03:52.560> HD<00:03:52.920> videos<00:03:53.190> at<00:03:53.580> the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
watch high quality HD videos at the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.450 
watch high quality HD videos at the
optimal<00:03:54.180> quality<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.720> however<00:03:55.500> we<00:03:56.280> are

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
optimal quality and however we are

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.850 
optimal quality and however we are
looking<00:03:56.700> at<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.850> possibility<00:03:57.420> of<00:03:57.860> delivering

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
looking at the possibility of delivering

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.580 
looking at the possibility of delivering
multiple<00:03:59.670> streams<00:03:59.940> where<00:04:00.510> users<00:04:01.080> could<00:04:01.260> pick

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
multiple streams where users could pick

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.470 
multiple streams where users could pick
the<00:04:02.010> rate<00:04:02.190> at<00:04:02.370> which<00:04:02.400> they<00:04:02.700> watch<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.060> video<00:04:03.270> so

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
the rate at which they watch a video so

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.900 
the rate at which they watch a video so
user<00:04:04.290> with<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.560> high-speed<00:04:05.100> connection<00:04:05.730> could

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
user with a high-speed connection could

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.940 
user with a high-speed connection could
watch<00:04:06.090> HD<00:04:06.450> videos<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.990> a<00:04:07.470> user<00:04:07.620> what<00:04:07.830> low

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
watch HD videos and a user what low

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.470 
watch HD videos and a user what low
speed<00:04:08.160> connection<00:04:08.459> could<00:04:08.640> watch<00:04:08.820> a<00:04:09.000> kind<00:04:09.420> of

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
speed connection could watch a kind of

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.480 
speed connection could watch a kind of
slightly<00:04:09.750> lower<00:04:09.959> quality<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.410> ocean<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.220> the

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
slightly lower quality of ocean so the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.699 
slightly lower quality of ocean so the
answer<00:04:11.700> basically<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.180> watch<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.959> space<00:04:13.140> okay

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
answer basically is watch the space okay

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.099 
answer basically is watch the space okay
