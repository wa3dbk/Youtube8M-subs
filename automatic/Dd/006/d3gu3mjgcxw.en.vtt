using this image and the second example

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.420 
using this image and the second example
sounds<00:02:59.600> like<00:02:59.840> just<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.380> very<00:03:00.590> snarky<00:03:00.920> comedy

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430

the<00:03:58.349> technical<00:03:59.069> term<00:03:59.280> but<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.120> hair<00:04:00.300> is<00:04:00.420> like

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569
