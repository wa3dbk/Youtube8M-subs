 each of you my name is Nikita you 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.110
 watch another video on my channel 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.389
 let's not hesitate and immediately 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.140
 I'll tell you what she will be today 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.119
 it will be like this 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.230
 I will tell you this now friends in front of us 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.910
 some kind of anti-i cud and since here 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.070
 written as they claim them 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.920
 manufacturers it effectively remove 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.800
 chew illusions bite blunt surface 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.320
 so quickly and cleanly what do we have we have 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.370
 anti chewing gum or honestly 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.129
 I took the barrel itself two different taste 1 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.350
 as you can see with mint another 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.149
 lemon and check them on different 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.379
 surfaces that are written here 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.000
 drove here 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.840
 but naturally you need to start 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.989
 chew this pack itself to 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:14.729
 and like to stick so I while we 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:17.220
 chew let's open our anti chewing gum in general 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.880
 That's how we picked it all up here 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.590
 a can here we have 30 milliliters but 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.799
 I think it will be enough here 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.060
 neatly opens in general yes 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.930
 what kind of chewed gum let's them also 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.759
 extract here she will her 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.130
 stick right on the carpet I hope 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.000
 it really works anti 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.799
 chewing gum or me just 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.590
 will deliver maybe even buy a new one 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.770
 carpet so our gum take and glue 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.970
 her to our carpet with a finger so take and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.619
 neatly smeared so check 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.600
 everything is normal and natural i am afraid that 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.909
 what does chris leg find simply 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.100
 now we stick it to the carpet and 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.520
 naturally then separated the moto that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.680
 left to be our a girl so 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.690
 say otmazyvat otkleivat here all 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.319
 they tore off the rest of us 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:14.520
 launder anti chewing gum so take 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:17.670
 antiche barrel and neatly drip so 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.910
 on our cud that is applied to the carpet 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.239
 to close and 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.360
 wash here here is fine and now 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.090
 we wait 10 minutes as our packaging is written 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.040
 while we are drying there or rather 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.989
 say our gum is being washed which 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.410
 just stuck let's still 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.720
 let's go to one place and try make 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.440
 same thing but now let's not with mint 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:48.569
 chewing gum as lemon to wall to take 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.610
 one circulation as usual further 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.440
 We present this situation in our children 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.299
 go hob step on the cud 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.030
 naturally you won't like that 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.620
 chewing gum legs and you will want and and so 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.989
 say tear off but this is not yours 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.100
 it will turn out and in our case will help us 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.930
 only anti chewing gum but allen debts 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.530
 how not to tear it does not fight therefore 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.590
 we take anti chewing gum and drip distribute 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.519
 and here is this liquid on our sock and 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.209
 naturally leave our sock on 10 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.609
 minutes, but for now, back to our holster 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.769
 checked as he is there so we will remove 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.519
 rag a little important so in advertising 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.670
 are trying 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:33.030
 so to speak rub over more than 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.700
 clean well ka again no no no so 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.750
 try rubbing tinker let's get well in 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.430
 In principle, almost everything was removed 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.410
 so before the principle was taken a little 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.990
 now see la search for a place where 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.240
 it seemed to me that you chewed on your field 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.130
 found here they gave this place but so no 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.170
 less I am very pleased with this result 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.040
 I and I think anti chewing gum 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.680
 coped with my task here I am very 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.930
 really pleased with this girl I put 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.300
 Like and we are moving to the toe 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.400
 so it took 10 minutes and we will wash 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.930
 what we are on the sock hope 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.410
 help our shooting range. 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.320
 rid the sock of the pack itself 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.739
 taktivin he a little bit to you so 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.980
 say on shvachko rushed by let's see 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.580
 friends, well, at about he disappeared at least 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.920
 there is a little left before it is not here yet 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.990
 chew has really helped us but not 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.100
 less still the third situation which we 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.510
 Now consider so friends 3 situations 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.910
 come to such a home very much 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.530
 tired turn on the light and go through 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.270
 further in the room naturally want 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.640
 relax after watching some favorite 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.430
 series or even a movie sit down 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.280
 Insert headphones at the beginning of the right ear 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.240
 then 0 and already in anticipation click play 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.980
 you naturally press play but suddenly 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.870
 feel like you have something to buy 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.880
 there is under this point you watch it 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.340
 it turned out chewing gum here comes to the rescue 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.830
 anti chewing gum pour your chair anti 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.590
 cud remember the shorts throw them 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.960
 on the bed and pour a certain 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.680
 the area which is located 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.510
 a bundle of course it should be done very 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.630
 neatly so we put our anti 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:20.820
 cud that's the rest of our surface 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.820
 shorts and chairs here 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.490
 so it took about ten minutes and we take 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.140
 rag matters usual 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:32.240
 and rubbing found abs in this city okay 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.270
 try to just rub our cud 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.930
 maybe she'll clear i start 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.690
 to panic 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.470
 Okay, in general, it turned out like this 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.020
 you see she is very noticeable that 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.660
 not very cool and even if the nail is so 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.030
 do about it and it doesn't wash that very 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.860
 bad but now shorts take a rag and 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.300
 wipe our cud him we see what 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.760
 chewing gum is not rubbed just 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.280
 smeared and you have to tear off 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.610
 like that finger 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.110
 Generally it is very bad that it is very 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.420
 well still shorts 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.300
 the guy in general looks like this and 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.460
 now have a small output so expensive 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.370
 friends today checked whether 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.800
 clean here is such an anti chewing gum 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.100
 from different surface by about 4 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.160
 surfaces this is a carpet chair shorts and 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:26.030
 sock is interesting but worst of all 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.940
 gum rubbed anti zhrachkoy from socks 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.760
 best for some reason from the carpet then here 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.650
 shorts and then a chair but you know how she is 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.200
 acts if and pour wait 10 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.290
 minutes to wipe with a damp cloth, then sweat 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.330
 you need to clear the barrel to the end 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.730
 just pour more time to wait and only 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.800
 then it will be cleaned by 100 like you still 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.380
 wait and here naturally with 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.020
 cleaned all four surfaces and 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.710
 gum but only the second time and with 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.110
 first time 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.150
 dash from the carpet is not cleared if that 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.490
 here it lies that's it fast and clean 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.860
 it says not so fast here 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.350
 just 10 minutes to wait then again 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.870
 about ten goes to cleaning well 25 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.150
 Here is a very long time did not shoot the video therefore 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:11.180
 so much thought so much i think it is 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:14.780
 say now you need to take it all off 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.449
 somehow that's all have time to mount 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.520
 pay so to speak 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:20.789
 Well, this is all my name is Nikita all 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.789
 until
