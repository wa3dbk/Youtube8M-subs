using<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:11.040> sensor<00:00:11.340> brush<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.179> sensor<00:00:12.540> brush

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
using the sensor brush the sensor brush

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.019 
using the sensor brush the sensor brush
with<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:15.109> really<00:00:16.109> nice<00:00:16.470> little<00:00:16.740> app<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.730> we

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
with a really nice little app that we

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.859 
with a really nice little app that we
found<00:00:18.270> called<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.840> sketch<00:00:19.260> time<00:00:20.600> and<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.779> I'm

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
found called the sketch time and so I'm

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.390 
found called the sketch time and so I'm
just<00:00:21.900> gonna<00:00:22.140> use<00:00:22.410> sketch<00:00:22.619> time<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.100> non

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
just gonna use sketch time it's a non

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.320 
just gonna use sketch time it's a non
layers<00:00:23.970> based<00:00:24.570> app<00:00:25.730> it's<00:00:26.730> really<00:00:26.760> made<00:00:27.119> for

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
here now this is a fun app in that um

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.690 
here now this is a fun app in that um
the<00:01:50.800> marks<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:53.470> line<00:01:53.800> gets<00:01:54.310> a<00:01:54.400> little<00:01:54.580> bit

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
the marks the line gets a little bit

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.550 
the marks the line gets a little bit
thinner<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.210> faster<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:55.810> go<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.170> can<00:01:56.320> see<00:01:56.470> if

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
thinner the faster you go you can see if

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.520 
thinner the faster you go you can see if
I<00:01:56.680> move<00:01:56.890> across<00:01:57.430> Sarah<00:01:57.880> Connor<00:01:58.230> gets<00:01:59.230> a<00:01:59.320> little

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
I move across Sarah Connor gets a little

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.100 
I move across Sarah Connor gets a little
bit's<00:01:59.680> Skinner<00:02:00.610> sort<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.030> speed<00:02:01.450> dependent

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
bit's Skinner sort of speed dependent

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.720 
bit's Skinner sort of speed dependent
which<00:02:02.980> I<00:02:03.130> like<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.490> has<00:02:03.610> sort<00:02:03.880> of<00:02:03.940> a<00:02:05.370> silkscreen

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
which I like it has sort of a silkscreen
