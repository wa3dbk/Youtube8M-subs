one<00:00:01.449> other<00:00:01.569> test<00:00:01.930> I<00:00:02.050> just<00:00:02.080> did<00:00:02.500> is<00:00:02.679> run<00:00:02.920> crystal

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:03.460 
one other test I just did is run crystal

one other test I just did is run crystal

is<00:00:07.600> on<00:00:07.750> the<00:00:07.870> left<00:00:08.140> and<00:00:08.500> the<00:00:09.340> hard<00:00:09.790> drive<00:00:09.849> is<00:00:10.180> on

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
is on the left and the hard drive is on

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.140 
is on the left and the hard drive is on
the<00:00:10.480> right<00:00:10.750> I<00:00:10.990> should<00:00:11.530> mention<00:00:11.740> that<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
the right I should mention that the

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.560 
the right I should mention that the
solid-state<00:00:14.139> disk<00:00:14.590> I<00:00:14.830> bought<00:00:15.130> has<00:00:15.490> a<00:00:15.519> SATA<00:00:15.940> 2

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
solid-state disk I bought has a SATA 2

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.329 
solid-state disk I bought has a SATA 2
interface<00:00:17.140> which<00:00:17.380> can<00:00:17.409> go<00:00:17.650> up<00:00:17.710> to<00:00:17.890> three<00:00:18.070> Giga

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:18.339 
interface which can go up to three Giga

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.210 
interface which can go up to three Giga
bits<00:00:18.849> per<00:00:19.150> second<00:00:19.630> theoretically<00:00:20.259> but<00:00:21.009> the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
bits per second theoretically but the

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.189 
bits per second theoretically but the
controller<00:00:21.640> I<00:00:21.789> got<00:00:22.089> is<00:00:22.269> a<00:00:22.300> low-end<00:00:22.779> controller

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
controller I got is a low-end controller

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.540 
controller I got is a low-end controller
so<00:00:23.499> it<00:00:23.529> only<00:00:23.739> goes<00:00:23.919> up<00:00:24.009> to<00:00:24.069> one-and-a-half

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
so it only goes up to one-and-a-half

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.999 
so it only goes up to one-and-a-half
gigabits<00:00:25.329> per<00:00:25.480> second<00:00:26.050> so<00:00:26.499> the<00:00:26.589> numbers<00:00:26.919> you

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
gigabits per second so the numbers you

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.299 
gigabits per second so the numbers you
see<00:00:27.039> for<00:00:27.729> the<00:00:27.819> SSD<00:00:28.269> aren't<00:00:28.599> really

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:29.309 
see for the SSD aren't really

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.030 
see for the SSD aren't really
representative<00:00:30.309> of<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:31.689> an<00:00:31.779> SSD<00:00:32.200> is<00:00:32.560> capable

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
representative of what an SSD is capable

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.790 
representative of what an SSD is capable
of<00:00:33.330> but<00:00:34.330> if<00:00:34.870> you<00:00:34.930> compare<00:00:35.530> these<00:00:35.740> numbers

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
of but if you compare these numbers

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.890 
of but if you compare these numbers
starting<00:00:36.640> in<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:36.820> upper<00:00:36.850> left<00:00:37.450> is<00:00:37.840> a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
starting in the upper left is a

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.150 
starting in the upper left is a
sequential<00:00:38.590> reads<00:00:39.040> of<00:00:39.430> 100<00:00:39.820> megabytes<00:00:41.160> you

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
sequential reads of 100 megabytes you

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.860 
sequential reads of 100 megabytes you
can<00:00:42.310> see<00:00:42.550> that<00:00:42.730> you<00:00:42.910> get<00:00:43.060> over<00:00:43.390> triple<00:00:43.780> the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
can see that you get over triple the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.740 
can see that you get over triple the
performance<00:00:44.560> of<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.760> regular<00:00:46.180> hard<00:00:46.480> drive

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
performance of the regular hard drive

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.830 
performance of the regular hard drive
and<00:00:47.050> a<00:00:47.140> sequential<00:00:47.560> read<00:00:47.950> and<00:00:48.390> writing<00:00:49.390> it's

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
and a sequential read and writing it's

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.590 
and a sequential read and writing it's
about<00:00:50.110> a<00:00:50.170> 50%<00:00:50.560> a<00:00:51.310> little<00:00:52.090> over<00:00:52.240> 50%

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
about a 50% a little over 50%

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.740 
about a 50% a little over 50%
improvement<00:00:54.060> and<00:00:55.060> again<00:00:55.450> that's<00:00:55.630> a

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
improvement and again that's a

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.710 
improvement and again that's a
sequential<00:00:56.340> everything<00:00:57.340> in<00:00:57.460> a<00:00:57.520> row<00:00:57.700> the<00:00:58.450> hard

sequential everything in a row the hard
