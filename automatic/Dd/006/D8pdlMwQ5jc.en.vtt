00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
because it's very toxic so you don't

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.910 
because it's very toxic so you don't
want<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.900> do<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.140> anywhere<00:01:59.440> where<00:01:59.620> there's<00:01:59.770> not

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
want to do it anywhere where there's not

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.190 
want to do it anywhere where there's not
high<00:02:00.160> ventilation<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.659> also<00:02:01.840> want<00:02:02.170> to

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
high ventilation and you also want to

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.970 
high ventilation and you also want to
lay<00:02:02.350> down<00:02:02.380> like<00:02:02.890> painters<00:02:03.520> paper<00:02:04.240> or<00:02:04.690> tarp<00:02:05.260> so

lay down like painters paper or tarp so

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.740

if they come out in your their whole
yard<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.080> gold<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:14.739> we're<00:02:15.610> going<00:02:15.760> to

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
yard is gold so we're going to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
tarp before we begin this

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.800 
tarp before we begin this
so<00:02:20.800> I've<00:02:21.280> actually<00:02:21.670> already<00:02:22.150> spray-painted

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
so I've actually already spray-painted

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.050 
so I've actually already spray-painted
our<00:02:22.930> branches<00:02:23.319> but<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:24.160> would<00:02:24.280> spray-paint

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
our branches but you would spray-paint

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.850 
our branches but you would spray-paint
the<00:02:25.180> branches<00:02:25.629> and<00:02:25.930> then<00:02:26.080> let<00:02:26.410> them<00:02:26.560> dry<00:02:26.830> for

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
the branches and then let them dry for

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.740 
the branches and then let them dry for
about<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.370> half<00:02:27.640> an<00:02:27.730> hour<00:02:27.879> so<00:02:28.239> if<00:02:28.420> it's<00:02:28.569> sunny

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
about a half an hour so if it's sunny

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.050 
about a half an hour so if it's sunny
out<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:30.129> should<00:02:30.280> be<00:02:30.400> all<00:02:30.430> set<00:02:30.700> great

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
out and you should be all set great

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.030 
out and you should be all set great
paint<00:02:31.300> dries<00:02:31.510> pretty<00:02:31.720> quickly<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.319> once<00:02:32.890> you

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
paint dries pretty quickly so once you

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.589 
paint dries pretty quickly so once you
have<00:02:33.129> spray-painted<00:02:33.700> your<00:02:33.819> branches<00:02:34.269> you

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
have spray-painted your branches you

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.970 
have spray-painted your branches you
need<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.810> gather<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.290> rest<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.800> things

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
need to gather the rest of the things

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.030 
more than branches if you'd like to make
it<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.660> little<00:03:58.750> bit<00:03:58.930> more<00:03:59.109> unique<00:03:59.290> like<00:03:59.889> I

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
position that you'd like them to remain

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.989 
position that you'd like them to remain
in<00:04:24.450> before<00:04:25.450> you<00:04:25.599> pull<00:04:25.810> pour<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.680> filler<00:04:26.919> so

00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:28.999 
in before you pull pour the filler so

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:32.049 
in before you pull pour the filler so
you<00:04:29.269> on<00:04:29.479> to<00:04:30.339> once<00:04:31.339> you<00:04:31.459> have<00:04:31.579> the<00:04:31.669> branches

00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:32.059 
you on to once you have the branches

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:34.359 
you on to once you have the branches
secured<00:04:32.569> in<00:04:32.719> place<00:04:32.869> you're<00:04:33.559> going<00:04:33.799> to<00:04:33.889> pour

00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:34.369 
secured in place you're going to pour

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:37.449 
secured in place you're going to pour
your<00:04:34.879> filler<00:04:35.239> into<00:04:35.719> the<00:04:36.169> base<00:04:36.349> around<00:04:36.679> it<00:04:36.919> now

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:37.459 
your filler into the base around it now

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:44.069 
your filler into the base around it now
glass<00:04:38.089> beads<00:04:38.389> on<00:04:38.599> glass<00:04:38.899> sounds<00:04:39.349> very<00:04:39.619> loud<00:04:39.919> so

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:44.079 

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:46.869 

so<00:04:45.079> then<00:04:45.259> your<00:04:45.409> tree<00:04:45.649> branches<00:04:46.069> should<00:04:46.099> stay

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
so then your tree branches should stay

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.519 
so then your tree branches should stay
perfectly<00:04:47.659> in<00:04:47.749> place<00:04:48.279> then<00:04:49.279> you<00:04:49.610> can<00:04:49.759> add

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:50.529 
perfectly in place then you can add

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.829 
perfectly in place then you can add
whatever<00:04:51.529> filler<00:04:52.249> in<00:04:53.089> this<00:04:53.239> case<00:04:53.479> I'm<00:04:53.719> going

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:53.839 
whatever filler in this case I'm going

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:59.009 
whatever filler in this case I'm going
to<00:04:53.899> use<00:04:54.110> some<00:04:54.379> really<00:04:54.709> pretty<00:04:55.239> gold<00:04:56.239> fern<00:04:57.879> and
