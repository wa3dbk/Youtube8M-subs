with<00:00:14.759> another<00:00:15.089> tutorial<00:00:15.360> at<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.170> time<00:00:16.440> it's

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
with another tutorial at this time it's

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.269 
with another tutorial at this time it's
how<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.890> diamond<00:00:17.880> cut<00:00:18.180> wheels<00:00:18.690> now<00:00:19.619> first<00:00:20.039> off

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
how to diamond cut wheels now first off

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.279 
how to diamond cut wheels now first off
I<00:00:20.490> start<00:00:20.789> with<00:00:20.970> priming<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.750> I'm<00:00:21.990> doing

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
I start with priming it on I'm doing

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.950 
I start with priming it on I'm doing
this<00:00:22.560> with<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.100> zero<00:00:23.340> paint<00:00:23.640> primer<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
this with the zero paint primer and the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.200 
this with the zero paint primer and the
technique<00:00:25.410> I'm<00:00:25.650> using<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:26.310> holding<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
technique I'm using is holding the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.660 
technique I'm using is holding the
airbrush<00:00:27.689> steady<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.470> giving<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.340> really

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
airbrush steady and giving it a really

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.540 
airbrush steady and giving it a really
really<00:00:30.000> small<00:00:30.750> amount<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.230> paint<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.859> then

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
really small amount of paint and then

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.280 
really small amount of paint and then
just<00:00:32.850> spinning<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> wheel<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:34.050> cover

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
just spinning the wheel to cover

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.889 
just spinning the wheel to cover
everything<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.910> let<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.360> dry<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.660> about

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
everything I just let that dry for about

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.840 
everything I just let that dry for about
thirty<00:00:37.320> minutes<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.950> then<00:00:38.219> move<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
thirty minutes and then move on to

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.360 
thirty minutes and then move on to
painting<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.329> silver<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.230> pretty<00:00:40.950> much<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
painting the silver and pretty much the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.160 
painting the silver and pretty much the
same<00:00:41.579> technique<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.270> then<00:00:42.450> moving<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
same technique but then moving the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.740 
same technique but then moving the
airbrush<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.829> small<00:00:44.250> bit<00:00:44.789> from<00:00:45.059> side<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> side

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
airbrush a small bit from side to side

00:00:45.750 --> 00:01:00.500 
airbrush a small bit from side to side
and<00:00:46.190> slowly<00:00:47.300> spinning<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> wheel<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.870> well

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.600 

and<00:01:01.510> now<00:01:02.320> we're<00:01:02.530> moving<00:01:02.770> on<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.310> most

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
and now we're moving on to the most

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.390 
and now we're moving on to the most
important<00:01:04.180> step<00:01:04.270> in<00:01:04.720> this<00:01:05.020> tutorial<00:01:05.260> and<00:01:05.770> that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
important step in this tutorial and that

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.790 
important step in this tutorial and that
is<00:01:06.640> by<00:01:06.910> covering<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.600> zero<00:01:07.870> paints<00:01:08.290> which<00:01:08.560> is

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
is by covering the zero paints which is

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.230 
is by covering the zero paints which is
a<00:01:09.270> thinners<00:01:10.270> based<00:01:10.630> paint<00:01:11.500> or<00:01:12.240> cellulose

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
a thinners based paint or cellulose

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.920 
a thinners based paint or cellulose
thinner<00:01:13.720> based<00:01:14.080> paint<00:01:14.410> with<00:01:15.040> a<00:01:15.570> acrylic<00:01:16.570> paint

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
thinner based paint with a acrylic paint

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.010 
thinner based paint with a acrylic paint
and<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:18.160> reason<00:01:18.550> for<00:01:18.820> doing<00:01:19.000> this<00:01:19.150> in<00:01:19.510> acrylic

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
and the reason for doing this in acrylic

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.920 
and the reason for doing this in acrylic
is<00:01:20.200> that<00:01:20.620> we<00:01:20.890> are<00:01:21.100> going<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.490> wipe<00:01:21.760> off<00:01:22.090> the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
is that we are going to wipe off the

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.050 
is that we are going to wipe off the
excess<00:01:23.320> paint<00:01:23.590> which<00:01:23.860> we<00:01:24.040> don't<00:01:24.190> want<00:01:24.490> with

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
excess paint which we don't want with

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.510 
excess paint which we don't want with
acrylic<00:01:25.660> thinner<00:01:25.870> and<00:01:26.200> if<00:01:26.950> we<00:01:27.160> would<00:01:27.430> have

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
acrylic thinner and if we would have

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.940 
acrylic thinner and if we would have
done<00:01:27.790> this<00:01:28.000> with<00:01:28.330> let's<00:01:28.900> say<00:01:29.110> zero<00:01:29.380> paints<00:01:29.800> we

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
done this with let's say zero paints we

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.040 
done this with let's say zero paints we
would<00:01:30.190> wipe<00:01:30.490> off<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:31.000> zero<00:01:31.240> paints<00:01:31.630> layer<00:01:31.840> as

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
would wipe off the zero paints layer as

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.500 
would wipe off the zero paints layer as
well<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.560> be<00:01:33.190> left<00:01:33.430> with<00:01:33.580> pretty<00:01:34.180> much<00:01:34.450> no

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
well and be left with pretty much no

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:43.440 
well and be left with pretty much no
paint<00:01:35.290> at<00:01:35.440> all

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.770 

and<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.460> pretty<00:01:45.700> much<00:01:45.939> where<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.270> magic

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
and this is pretty much where the magic

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.469 
and this is pretty much where the magic
starts<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:47.320> took<00:01:47.680> out<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:48.130> q-tip<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:48.909> put<00:01:49.299> a

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
starts I took out a q-tip and put a

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.440 
starts I took out a q-tip and put a
small<00:01:49.930> amount<00:01:50.259> of<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.909> Vallejo<00:01:51.909> airbrush

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
small amount of the Vallejo airbrush

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.289 
small amount of the Vallejo airbrush
cleaner<00:01:52.890> onto<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:54.009> q-tip<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.729> what<00:01:55.119> that

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
cleaner onto that q-tip and what that

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.020 
cleaner onto that q-tip and what that
does<00:01:55.570> is<00:01:55.899> wipe<00:01:56.259> off<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.770> black<00:01:56.979> paint<00:01:57.310> from

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
does is wipe off the black paint from

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.779 
does is wipe off the black paint from
the<00:01:58.180> high<00:01:58.330> spots<00:01:58.720> and<00:01:58.930> thus<00:01:59.560> creating<00:02:00.430> the

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
the high spots and thus creating the

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.389 
the high spots and thus creating the
diamond-cut<00:02:01.060> effect<00:02:01.990> on<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.860> wheels<00:02:03.100> and

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
diamond-cut effect on the wheels and

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.800 
diamond-cut effect on the wheels and
just<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.740> said<00:02:06.039> earlier<00:02:06.460> on<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:07.390> reason

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
just like I said earlier on the reason

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.050 
just like I said earlier on the reason
why<00:02:07.930> I'm<00:02:08.200> using<00:02:08.229> acrylic<00:02:08.709> paints<00:02:09.429> is<00:02:09.640> because

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
why I'm using acrylic paints is because

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.320 
why I'm using acrylic paints is because
the<00:02:10.390> acrylic<00:02:10.660> thinner<00:02:11.080> does<00:02:11.590> not<00:02:11.980> affect<00:02:12.550> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
the acrylic thinner does not affect the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.920 
the acrylic thinner does not affect the
zero<00:02:13.630> paints<00:02:14.050> or<00:02:14.680> whatever<00:02:15.670> other<00:02:16.000> paint<00:02:16.780> you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
zero paints or whatever other paint you

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.050 
zero paints or whatever other paint you
would<00:02:17.050> like<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.410> use<00:02:17.590> for<00:02:17.860> this<00:02:18.010> as<00:02:18.220> long<00:02:18.910> as

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
would like to use for this as long as

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.780 
would like to use for this as long as
it's<00:02:19.239> not<00:02:19.420> acrylic<00:02:19.959> based<00:02:20.280> make<00:02:21.280> sure<00:02:21.519> the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
it's not acrylic based make sure the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.840 
it's not acrylic based make sure the
underneath<00:02:22.299> layer<00:02:22.660> is<00:02:22.930> dry<00:02:23.260> before<00:02:24.220> applying

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
underneath layer is dry before applying

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.600 
underneath layer is dry before applying
the<00:02:25.299> acrylic<00:02:25.600> paint<00:02:26.049> over<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.440> because<00:02:27.130> if<00:02:27.430> it

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
the acrylic paint over it because if it

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.120 
the acrylic paint over it because if it
wasn't<00:02:27.880> dry<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.690> what<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.170> leave<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.620> with<00:02:29.920> a

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
wasn't dry that what to leave you with a

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.580 
wasn't dry that what to leave you with a
horrible<00:02:30.549> effect<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.209> might<00:02:31.540> even<00:02:31.959> ruin<00:02:32.410> the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
horrible effect and might even ruin the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.460 
horrible effect and might even ruin the
wheel<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.299> now<00:02:34.299> I'm<00:02:34.360> just<00:02:34.480> moving<00:02:35.140> slowly

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
wheel and now I'm just moving slowly

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.860 
wheel and now I'm just moving slowly
around<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:35.950> wheel<00:02:36.250> being<00:02:37.120> careful<00:02:37.660> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
around the wheel being careful and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.350 
around the wheel being careful and
taking<00:02:38.290> my<00:02:38.440> time<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:39.340> only<00:02:39.519> wipe<00:02:39.880> off<00:02:40.120> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
taking my time to only wipe off the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:57.270 
taking my time to only wipe off the
areas<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.930> want<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.410> be<00:02:41.530> wiped<00:02:41.830> off

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.009 

also<00:02:58.280> when<00:02:58.519> applying<00:02:58.939> the<00:02:59.120> second<00:02:59.540> color<00:02:59.719> in

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
also when applying the second color in

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.770 
also when applying the second color in
this<00:03:00.409> case<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.980> black<00:03:01.219> be<00:03:02.030> sure<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.510> do<00:03:02.659> it

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
this case the black be sure to do it

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.379 
this case the black be sure to do it
thin<00:03:03.170> because<00:03:03.499> if<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.219> do<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.459> really<00:03:04.999> thick

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
thin because if you do a really thick

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.319 
thin because if you do a really thick
layer<00:03:05.599> it<00:03:05.900> has<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:07.159> thinners<00:03:07.489> has<00:03:07.700> more<00:03:08.120> to

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
layer it has the thinners has more to

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.229 
layer it has the thinners has more to
remove<00:03:08.749> so<00:03:09.139> it<00:03:09.290> will<00:03:09.499> take<00:03:09.769> a<00:03:09.799> lot<00:03:10.099> longer<00:03:10.459> and

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
remove so it will take a lot longer and

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.839 
remove so it will take a lot longer and
if<00:03:11.359> you<00:03:11.540> do<00:03:11.689> it<00:03:11.810> in<00:03:11.959> thin<00:03:12.260> coats<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:13.310> will<00:03:13.609> cover

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
if you do it in thin coats it will cover

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.449 
if you do it in thin coats it will cover
just<00:03:14.659> as<00:03:14.810> well<00:03:15.049> but<00:03:15.650> there<00:03:15.859> will<00:03:16.040> be<00:03:16.069> less

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
just as well but there will be less

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.729 
just as well but there will be less
paint<00:03:16.790> build<00:03:17.060> up<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.900> will<00:03:18.109> be<00:03:18.230> easier<00:03:18.680> for

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
paint build up and it will be easier for

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.649 
paint build up and it will be easier for
the<00:03:19.099> thinners<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.639> break<00:03:19.879> through<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.480> layer

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
the thinners to break through the layer

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:29.850 
the thinners to break through the layer
of<00:03:20.840> black<00:03:21.079> and<00:03:21.669> removing<00:03:22.669> it

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960

over it

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.490

and<00:03:56.770> then<00:03:57.250> removing<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.150> again<00:03:58.480> because<00:03:59.290> you

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
and then removing it again because you

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.260 
and then removing it again because you

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
and that's not what you want so make

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.120 
and that's not what you want so make
sure<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.420> use<00:04:04.570> two<00:04:04.960> different<00:04:05.230> types<00:04:05.680> of<00:04:05.860> paint

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
sure to use two different types of paint

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.330 
sure to use two different types of paint
and<00:04:06.310> preferably<00:04:07.240> using<00:04:08.140> an<00:04:08.440> acrylic<00:04:08.680> topcoat

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
and preferably using an acrylic topcoat

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.000 
and preferably using an acrylic topcoat
as<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:10.060> acrylic<00:04:10.540> paints<00:04:10.870> pretty<00:04:11.170> much<00:04:11.440> plays

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
as the acrylic paints pretty much plays

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.990 
as the acrylic paints pretty much plays
well<00:04:12.310> with<00:04:12.580> every<00:04:13.060> other<00:04:13.270> paint<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:15.760> get

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
well with every other paint and to get

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.380 
well with every other paint and to get
in<00:04:16.209> this<00:04:16.480> tight<00:04:16.920> spot<00:04:17.920> I'm<00:04:18.130> not<00:04:18.760> using<00:04:19.090> the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
in this tight spot I'm not using the

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.050 
in this tight spot I'm not using the
q-tip<00:04:19.780> as<00:04:20.019> that<00:04:20.290> is<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.530> bit<00:04:20.830> too<00:04:20.859> big<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.790> bulky

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
q-tip as that is a bit too big and bulky

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.330 
q-tip as that is a bit too big and bulky
and<00:04:22.510> would<00:04:22.720> probably<00:04:22.960> remove<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.800> black<00:04:24.070> in

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
and would probably remove the black in

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.390 
and would probably remove the black in
the<00:04:24.460> center<00:04:24.820> as<00:04:24.940> well<00:04:25.210> so<00:04:25.990> what<00:04:26.440> I<00:04:26.470> did<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:27.040> fold

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
the center as well so what I did is fold

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.060 
the center as well so what I did is fold
up<00:04:27.640> a<00:04:27.820> paper<00:04:28.030> towel<00:04:28.330> into<00:04:29.170> a<00:04:29.200> sharp<00:04:29.590> point<00:04:29.890> and

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
up a paper towel into a sharp point and

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.490 
up a paper towel into a sharp point and
then<00:04:30.280> applying<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:31.300> thinners<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.050> that

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
then applying the thinners to that

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.520 
then applying the thinners to that
specific<00:04:33.310> small<00:04:33.550> area<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.180> then<00:04:34.660> going<00:04:35.110> over

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
specific small area and then going over

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.760 
specific small area and then going over
it<00:04:35.620> with<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:36.130> clean<00:04:36.669> q-tip<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:38.230> remove<00:04:38.620> the

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
it with a clean q-tip to remove the

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:46.690 
it with a clean q-tip to remove the
black<00:04:39.010> paint

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700

there are some tighter spots which are

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.750 
there are some tighter spots which are

a big piece of paper towel so what you

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
could do is again wetting the paper

and then apply it to that small area

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.390 
and then apply it to that small area
lightly<00:05:07.340> which<00:05:08.120> breaks<00:05:08.780> up<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:09.140> paint<00:05:09.590> so<00:05:10.310> you

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
lightly which breaks up the paint so you

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.340 
lightly which breaks up the paint so you
can<00:05:10.760> easily<00:05:11.030> remove<00:05:11.570> it<00:05:11.750> with<00:05:11.960> a<00:05:11.990> toothpick

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
can easily remove it with a toothpick

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.880 
can easily remove it with a toothpick
and<00:05:13.150> finally<00:05:14.150> to<00:05:14.330> finish<00:05:14.540> this<00:05:14.900> wheel<00:05:15.170> off<00:05:15.410> I'm

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
and finally to finish this wheel off I'm

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.490 
and finally to finish this wheel off I'm
going<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.880> highlight<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:17.630> wheel<00:05:17.810> bolts<00:05:18.020> with

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
going to highlight the wheel bolts with

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.260 
going to highlight the wheel bolts with
some<00:05:18.860> silver<00:05:20.890> now<00:05:21.890> this<00:05:22.190> is<00:05:22.430> pretty<00:05:22.760> much<00:05:22.880> all

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
some silver now this is pretty much all

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.210 
some silver now this is pretty much all
you<00:05:23.330> need<00:05:23.540> to<00:05:23.840> do<00:05:24.080> you<00:05:24.320> could<00:05:24.560> now<00:05:24.740> apply<00:05:25.160> the

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
you need to do you could now apply the

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.870 
you need to do you could now apply the
decal<00:05:25.760> and<00:05:25.790> leave<00:05:26.330> it<00:05:26.480> as<00:05:26.690> is<00:05:27.050> or<00:05:27.580> give<00:05:28.580> it<00:05:28.700> a

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
decal and leave it as is or give it a

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:41.219 
decal and leave it as is or give it a
gloss<00:05:29.330> by<00:05:29.810> clear<00:05:30.500> coating<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:30.950> wheel

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.719 

now<00:05:42.229> just<00:05:42.560> to<00:05:42.650> give<00:05:42.680> you<00:05:42.949> a<00:05:42.979> bit<00:05:43.280> of<00:05:43.310> a<00:05:43.520> better

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
now just to give you a bit of a better

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.969 
now just to give you a bit of a better
understanding<00:05:44.539> on<00:05:44.629> how<00:05:44.689> this<00:05:45.020> works<00:05:45.409> I<00:05:45.650> did

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
understanding on how this works I did

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.770 
understanding on how this works I did
this<00:05:46.159> on<00:05:46.370> another<00:05:46.699> wheel<00:05:47.000> design<00:05:47.360> as<00:05:47.539> well

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
this on another wheel design as well

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.649 
this on another wheel design as well
it's<00:05:48.349> pretty<00:05:48.740> much<00:05:48.949> the<00:05:49.189> same<00:05:49.219> I<00:05:49.669> only<00:05:49.969> used<00:05:50.389> a

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659 
it's pretty much the same I only used a

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.469 
it's pretty much the same I only used a
gunmetal<00:05:51.520> accent<00:05:52.520> color<00:05:52.729> instead<00:05:53.210> of<00:05:53.360> the

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
gunmetal accent color instead of the

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.179 
gunmetal accent color instead of the
black<00:05:53.750> just<00:05:54.469> to<00:05:54.590> give<00:05:54.740> it<00:05:54.770> a<00:05:54.889> bit<00:05:55.039> of<00:05:55.069> a

00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:55.189 
black just to give it a bit of a

00:05:55.189 --> 00:06:50.820 
black just to give it a bit of a
different<00:05:55.580> look

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.679 

with<00:06:51.830> all<00:06:52.099> the<00:06:52.249> flat<00:06:52.459> areas<00:06:52.909> now<00:06:53.059> cleaned<00:06:53.449> off

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:53.689 
with all the flat areas now cleaned off

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:56.229 
with all the flat areas now cleaned off
it<00:06:53.989> was<00:06:54.199> either<00:06:54.489> decide<00:06:55.489> to<00:06:55.519> leave<00:06:55.879> it<00:06:56.059> like

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:56.239 
it was either decide to leave it like

00:06:56.239 --> 00:06:58.629 
it was either decide to leave it like
this<00:06:56.269> or<00:06:56.809> clean<00:06:57.229> the<00:06:57.349> center<00:06:57.709> out<00:06:57.889> and<00:06:58.129> I

this or clean the center out and I

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:00.819 
this or clean the center out and I
decided<00:06:58.699> to<00:06:59.179> clean<00:06:59.509> the<00:06:59.629> center<00:06:59.929> out<00:07:00.049> as<00:07:00.259> well

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:00.829 
decided to clean the center out as well

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:04.149 
decided to clean the center out as well
I<00:07:00.860> did<00:07:01.639> put<00:07:02.299> a<00:07:02.479> lot<00:07:02.779> more<00:07:03.049> dinners<00:07:03.619> on<00:07:03.860> the

I did put a lot more dinners on the

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:06.459 
I did put a lot more dinners on the
q-tip<00:07:04.549> this<00:07:04.759> time<00:07:04.969> as<00:07:05.239> it<00:07:05.449> was<00:07:05.599> a<00:07:05.629> bigger<00:07:06.110> area

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:06.469 
q-tip this time as it was a bigger area

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:10.059 
q-tip this time as it was a bigger area
and<00:07:06.999> less<00:07:07.999> chance<00:07:08.329> of<00:07:08.589> removing<00:07:09.589> paint<00:07:09.860> I

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:10.069 
and less chance of removing paint I

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:13.449 
and less chance of removing paint I
didn't<00:07:10.369> want<00:07:10.579> to<00:07:10.759> so<00:07:11.389> I<00:07:11.419> just<00:07:11.779> went<00:07:12.139> at<00:07:12.349> it<00:07:12.459> this

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:13.459 
didn't want to so I just went at it this

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:15.579 
didn't want to so I just went at it this
