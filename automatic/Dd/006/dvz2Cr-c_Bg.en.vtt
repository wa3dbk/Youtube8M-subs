00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.159
 The fourth generation is Oyama 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.979
 The same as I introduce this time is the opening here 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.409
 You know what 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.349
 You may hear a voice saying nostalgic 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.519
 Let's not have a chart 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.359
 I want to introduce 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.460
 It is a very embarrassing story but I speak my personal feelings 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.120
 It's a good buying place until recently 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.830
 Because it is a form like this 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.090
 I thought that I was 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.550
 Do you use it like that common comforter? 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
 It is an opening event 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.630
 I would like to introduce this today 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.130
 It was eco-friendly but there is still a close relationship 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.710
 I just want to go there 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.760
 First of all 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.090
 The first one is 100% of those who are out 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.360
 It is% who is using it again 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.140
 Among the ana matta 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.480
 In ema Mexico requests 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.940
 I use it yeah 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.850
 The feature in Mexico is that the product is very thin and long 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.790
 By feature 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.860
 It is said that it is very suitable when these young people 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.240
 is 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.300
 To professional craftsmen 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.260
 In addition to the point I felt that I have made it, this season is one 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
 It is a point 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.200
 The second one is 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 It's all season total 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.830
 I wonder if that makes me understand 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.859
 That's it 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.259
 In fact, it's the start of this season, but I've made more than one 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.230
 Published 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.609
 It is easy to understand that there is a word sbs system 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.750
 I think it will generally be 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.670
 Uehara can talk about fluorescent lights 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.700
 Because 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.300
 frsirt ぇ ぇ winter is still chilly spring ahead 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.080
 Yes, I'm heading for the country from now on is the team's chilly one 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.160
 Season 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.929
 Nakagawa this one 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.819
 If it says uniformly, if there is a full-scale winter this 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.610
 Painting quilt plus 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.150
 It is a program 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.230
 Then you call me a duvet 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.459
 It is fine if you run away 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.410
 It is cheaper because it uses hand skin so nasdaq market 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.430
 But as a result some customers also say 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.760
 Some testers are not allowed to banner in the series 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.579
 It is a very popular product 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.919
 It will be watering 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:39.229
 This is a painting quilt, so it's just a few 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.619
 In that you can use season eco 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:46.069
 I think that there should not be a lot of that city 1 town 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.249
 In that 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.000
 We are in this statistic 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.620
 1 * I think that I would like to try again 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.209
 And the third one reports 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.430
 The third one is yes It is not a horizontal letter The height of the drapability 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.389
 It means that people who were playing this are actually paintings 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.479
 After quilt is the best feature 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:10.969
 As it is in the form of station stuff, this is another Taguchi form 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.049
 I will surely do it 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.399
 It was a loss that hardly any way 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.659
 Don't let this stuffed body get out of the way 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.270
 I was asked not to enter the point that Taguchi 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.209
 That you go comfortably 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.229
 In the feature that I think that I will be in another 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.139
 I put on here to improve the sameness 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.979
 It is the first feature 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.899
 That's especially because it seems to be fu in addition to some pounds 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.939
 I think you will get this handed brakes 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.189
 It was high on the desk that I think I would like to try it by all means 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.229
 is not it 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.479
 I bought and sold three points of Komadai 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:54.259
 It is a blue horse in the previous verse 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:55.929
 There is aquaculture 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:58.379
 Same faq page 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.189
 Roughly 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.979
 There were many pinks 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.209
 Here are two and then 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.659
 while fa 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.169
 Velcade 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.169
 Because it is fine, two Bernards 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.809
 Then to 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:15.079
 In friendship 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.879
 There was no pink 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.629
 This term dictionary is on the Internet 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:22.199
 Because we prepare 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.930
 By all means it is based on one point These are all the same 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.000
 And I think Aso size 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.779
 Participate if the size is upset 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:32.539
 The US media reported 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.879
 Because there is Yokohama, there is 155 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.710
 General adult singleton 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.669
 Opening day 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.860
 Also, although I do not have the merits of prices 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.740
 It is a breakout quilt for adults 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.490
 It is to say that we introduce this time 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.490
 By all means ahead of this neighborhood this year 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.889
 How do you want to challenge another person? 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.029
 Is not it 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:58.869
 Movie taxi no one goes to the deck with the opening card this year 

00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:00.889
 I think so 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.809
 Please consider by all means with this change 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:06.879
 Comfortable sleep is comfortable 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:07.759
 From the beginning 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.639
 Who sent 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:10.560
 Wrong love
