00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
interceptors are must because Iran may

have<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.899> capability<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.770> apparently<00:01:02.370> they

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
have that capability and apparently they

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.690 
have that capability and apparently they
didn't<00:01:02.730> know<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.750> wouldn't<00:01:04.019> seem<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.260> III<00:01:05.070> how

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
about here and I this just seems like a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
and you know look if he was gonna happen

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.710 
and you know look if he was gonna happen
if<00:01:25.350> Iran<00:01:25.680> were<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.040> launch<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:26.909> missile<00:01:27.330> at

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
if Iran were to launch one missile at

if Iran were to launch one missile at
the<00:01:27.780> United<00:01:28.140> States<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.500> America<00:01:28.860> we'd

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the United States of America we'd

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.090 
the United States of America we'd
obliterate<00:01:30.210> yeah<00:01:30.720> absolutely<00:01:31.020> ever<00:01:31.590> happened

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
obliterate yeah absolutely ever happened

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.749 
obliterate yeah absolutely ever happened
to<00:01:32.340> uh<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:33.320> mad<00:01:34.320> principle<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> mutual

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
to uh the mad principle what a mutual

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.190 
to uh the mad principle what a mutual
assured<00:01:36.030> destruction<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.840> case<00:01:37.020> it's

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
assured destruction in this case it's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.289 
assured destruction in this case it's
not<00:01:37.320> mutual<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:38.280> Iran<00:01:38.579> attacked<00:01:38.909> us<00:01:39.150> they

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
not mutual if Iran attacked us they

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.850 
not mutual if Iran attacked us they
might<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.780> something<00:01:40.140> through<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.619> way

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
might get something through and that way

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.530 
might get something through and that way
might<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.100> terrible<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.360> would

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
might be terrible but we would

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.600 
might be terrible but we would
annihilate<00:01:43.229> Iran<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.159> that's<00:01:44.430> our

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
annihilate Iran but that's our

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.760 
annihilate Iran but that's our
protection<00:01:45.180> that's<00:01:45.450> our<00:01:45.630> missile<00:01:45.960> defense<00:01:45.990> is

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
protection that's our missile defense is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.399 
protection that's our missile defense is
that<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.670> literally<00:01:48.060> blow<00:01:48.780> around<00:01:48.960> off

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
that we would literally blow around off

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.990 
that we would literally blow around off
the<00:01:49.649> face<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.100> map<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.640> would<00:01:50.790> kill

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the face of the map and we would kill

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.490 
the face of the map and we would kill
millions<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.420> people<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> process<00:01:52.049> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
millions of people in the process and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.200 
millions of people in the process and
that's<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.920> way<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.159> goes<00:01:53.220> because<00:01:54.090> they

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
that's just the way it goes because they

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.200

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
the way it should be pointed out that

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.740 
the way it should be pointed out that
spark<00:04:51.550> already<00:04:51.850> has<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:51.970> plan<00:04:52.270> in<00:04:52.420> motion<00:04:52.540> to

spark already has a plan in motion to

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.390 
spark already has a plan in motion to
launch<00:04:53.050> missile<00:04:53.470> interceptors<00:04:53.980> from<00:04:54.160> Europe

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
launch missile interceptors from Europe

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.850 
launch missile interceptors from Europe
yes<00:04:54.670> yes<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:55.750> they're<00:04:56.050> not<00:04:56.110> gonna<00:04:56.260> get<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.740> the

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
yes yes so they're not gonna get to the

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.040 
yes yes so they're not gonna get to the
east<00:04:57.040> coast<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.970> a<00:04:58.480> hundred<00:04:58.780> million<00:04:58.930> dollars

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
east coast and a hundred million dollars

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.290 
east coast and a hundred million dollars
again<00:04:59.620> there's<00:04:59.980> no<00:05:00.100> way<00:05:00.280> that<00:05:00.520> that<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.970> missile

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
again there's no way that that a missile

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.510 
again there's no way that that a missile
defense<00:05:01.780> system<00:05:02.200> to<00:05:02.230> intercept<00:05:02.740> missiles<00:05:02.950> all

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
defense system to intercept missiles all

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.670 
defense system to intercept missiles all
along<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.150> east<00:05:04.330> coast<00:05:04.420> that's<00:05:05.170> I'm<00:05:05.470> gonna

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
along the east coast that's I'm gonna

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.950 
along the east coast that's I'm gonna
make<00:05:05.860> it<00:05:06.010> up<00:05:06.130> that's<00:05:06.400> gonna<00:05:06.580> cost<00:05:06.960> nineteen

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
make it up that's gonna cost nineteen

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.290 
make it up that's gonna cost nineteen
billion<00:05:08.260> dollars<00:05:08.830> right<00:05:09.490> if<00:05:09.730> we<00:05:09.940> were<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.180> do

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
billion dollars right if we were to do

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.940 
billion dollars right if we were to do
it<00:05:10.330> if<00:05:10.600> it<00:05:10.720> were<00:05:10.840> necessary<00:05:11.020> i<00:05:11.530> think<00:05:11.770> it's<00:05:11.890> the

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
it if it were necessary i think it's the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.250 
it if it were necessary i think it's the
kind<00:05:12.220> of<00:05:12.250> thing<00:05:12.430> and<00:05:12.700> worked<00:05:13.360> it<00:05:14.020> might

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
kind of thing and worked it might

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.720 
kind of thing and worked it might
actually<00:05:14.410> kind<00:05:14.890> of<00:05:14.920> a<00:05:15.010> American<00:05:15.460> to<00:05:15.580> get
