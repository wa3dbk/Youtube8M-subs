little kid ran off the field full speed
and<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:49.450> thought<00:02:49.690> if<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.590> weren't<00:02:50.740> for<00:02:50.920> the

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
take the lung out of the body and put it

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.140 
take the lung out of the body and put it
on<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.740> system<00:04:51.950> where<00:04:52.340> you<00:04:52.460> can<00:04:52.640> keep<00:04:52.850> it<00:04:53.060> at

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
on the system where you can keep it at

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.510 
on the system where you can keep it at
normal<00:04:53.570> body<00:04:53.780> temperature<00:04:54.230> keep<00:04:55.070> it<00:04:55.220> alive

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
normal body temperature keep it alive

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.659 
normal body temperature keep it alive
and<00:04:55.790> allow<00:04:56.480> it<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:56.720> begin<00:04:57.230> healing<00:04:57.669> outside

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
and allow it to begin healing outside

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.880 
and allow it to begin healing outside
the<00:04:58.820> body<00:04:59.030> before<00:04:59.360> you<00:04:59.570> transplant<00:05:00.230> it<00:05:00.410> it<00:05:00.740> was

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
the body before you transplant it it was

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.400 
the body before you transplant it it was
on<00:05:01.010> one<00:05:01.160> of<00:05:01.190> my<00:05:01.310> clinic<00:05:01.640> days<00:05:01.990> that<00:05:02.990> we<00:05:03.080> come<00:05:03.260> in

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
on one of my clinic days that we come in

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.320 
on one of my clinic days that we come in
the<00:05:03.710> doc<00:05:04.010> come<00:05:04.220> in<00:05:04.340> he<00:05:04.490> talked<00:05:04.760> to<00:05:04.880> me<00:05:04.940> he<00:05:05.030> says

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
the doc come in he talked to me he says

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.840 
the doc come in he talked to me he says
you<00:05:05.450> know<00:05:05.570> there's<00:05:05.810> a<00:05:05.870> new<00:05:06.020> procedure<00:05:06.380> and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
you know there's a new procedure and

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.600 
you know there's a new procedure and
they<00:05:07.850> did<00:05:08.650> did<00:05:09.650> want<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:09.950> try<00:05:10.070> it<00:05:10.130> out<00:05:10.310> on<00:05:10.340> me

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
they did did want to try it out on me

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.700 
they did did want to try it out on me
was<00:05:10.790> I<00:05:10.970> willing<00:05:11.750> to<00:05:11.840> do<00:05:12.020> this<00:05:12.200> and<00:05:12.320> explained

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
was I willing to do this and explained

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.830 
was I willing to do this and explained
it<00:05:12.860> all<00:05:12.980> to<00:05:13.010> me<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.490> yeah<00:05:14.090> I<00:05:14.120> was<00:05:14.480> wanting<00:05:14.750> to

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
it all to me and yeah I was wanting to

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.930 
it all to me and yeah I was wanting to
do<00:05:14.960> this<00:05:15.140> I<00:05:15.350> didn't<00:05:16.190> know<00:05:16.220> at<00:05:16.370> that<00:05:16.400> time<00:05:16.580> it

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
do this I didn't know at that time it

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.870 
do this I didn't know at that time it
was<00:05:17.060> a<00:05:17.090> world<00:05:17.360> first<00:05:17.660> so<00:05:18.350> that<00:05:18.530> is<00:05:18.740> a<00:05:18.919> total

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
was a world first so that is a total

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.750 
was a world first so that is a total
paradigm<00:05:20.390> shift<00:05:20.810> in<00:05:21.190> transplantation<00:05:22.190> we<00:05:22.610> got

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
paradigm shift in transplantation we got

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.790 
paradigm shift in transplantation we got
a<00:05:22.790> system<00:05:23.300> that<00:05:23.450> doesn't<00:05:23.660> add<00:05:23.960> more<00:05:24.320> injury

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
a system that doesn't add more injury

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.040 
a system that doesn't add more injury
but<00:05:25.070> actually<00:05:25.430> protects<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.120> lung<00:05:26.300> it<00:05:26.810> looks

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
but actually protects the lung it looks

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.740 
but actually protects the lung it looks
after<00:05:27.290> a<00:05:27.530> maintains<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.460> lung<00:05:28.640> outside<00:05:29.570> the

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
after a maintains the lung outside the

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.320 
after a maintains the lung outside the
body<00:05:29.930> so<00:05:30.500> it<00:05:30.680> can<00:05:30.710> start<00:05:31.190> to<00:05:31.340> heal<00:05:31.550> and<00:05:32.030> we<00:05:32.180> can

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
body so it can start to heal and we can

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.810 
body so it can start to heal and we can
help<00:05:32.570> it<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:32.900> heal<00:05:32.930> and<00:05:33.710> II<00:05:33.919> got<00:05:34.100> lungs<00:05:34.430> that<00:05:34.669> we

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
help it to heal and II got lungs that we

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.880 
help it to heal and II got lungs that we
couldn't<00:05:35.180> have<00:05:35.300> used<00:05:35.540> without<00:05:36.080> that<00:05:36.440> strategy

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
couldn't have used without that strategy

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.590 
couldn't have used without that strategy
we<00:05:37.100> developed<00:05:37.550> that<00:05:38.150> came<00:05:38.330> out<00:05:38.450> of<00:05:38.479> the

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
we developed that came out of the

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.210 
we developed that came out of the
intensive<00:05:39.020> care<00:05:39.050> unit<00:05:39.290> they<00:05:39.680> put<00:05:39.860> me<00:05:39.979> up<00:05:40.100> on

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
intensive care unit they put me up on

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.090 
intensive care unit they put me up on
the<00:05:40.340> ward<00:05:40.780> the<00:05:41.780> next<00:05:42.080> day<00:05:42.290> the

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
the ward the next day the

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.710 
the ward the next day the
physiotherapist<00:05:43.880> coming<00:05:44.180> along<00:05:44.330> she<00:05:44.510> says

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
physiotherapist coming along she says

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.390 
physiotherapist coming along she says
you<00:05:44.900> know<00:05:44.990> do<00:05:45.470> you<00:05:45.560> feel<00:05:45.740> like<00:05:45.830> getting<00:05:46.100> up<00:05:46.190> can

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
you know do you feel like getting up can

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.290 
you know do you feel like getting up can
you<00:05:46.430> get<00:05:46.640> up<00:05:46.729> and<00:05:46.880> said<00:05:47.000> you<00:05:47.090> have<00:05:47.150> already

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
you get up and said you have already

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.420 
you get up and said you have already
been<00:05:47.479> to<00:05:47.570> the<00:05:47.630> bathroom<00:05:47.990> so<00:05:48.260> if<00:05:49.130> you<00:05:49.250> want<00:05:49.400> to

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
been to the bathroom so if you want to

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.230 
been to the bathroom so if you want to
go<00:05:49.550> for<00:05:49.700> a<00:05:49.790> while<00:05:50.200> sure<00:05:51.580> we<00:05:52.580> went<00:05:52.790> for<00:05:52.970> a<00:05:53.030> walk

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
go for a while sure we went for a walk

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.730 
go for a while sure we went for a walk
and<00:05:53.270> boom<00:05:53.810> right<00:05:53.990> away<00:05:54.169> you<00:05:54.229> knew<00:05:54.350> there's<00:05:54.650> a

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
and boom right away you knew there's a

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.820 
and boom right away you knew there's a
difference<00:05:55.100> you<00:05:55.610> could<00:05:55.790> breathe<00:05:56.090> I<00:05:56.620> go<00:05:57.620> for

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
difference you could breathe I go for

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.800 
difference you could breathe I go for
walks<00:05:58.040> with<00:05:58.250> with<00:05:58.520> our<00:05:58.700> dog<00:05:58.910> I'd<00:05:59.150> go<00:05:59.270> into<00:05:59.720> the

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
walks with with our dog I'd go into the
