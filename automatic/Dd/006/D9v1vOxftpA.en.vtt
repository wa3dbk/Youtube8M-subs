00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.850
 Real Madrid won by three goals 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.530
 to one to the real betis football from the 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.150
 Starting the match with more than 2,000 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.590
 fans of the verdiblanco team was saved 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.320
 a minute of silence in memory of the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.880
 three victims in the attacks after the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.400
 Boston Marathon First Goal of the Match 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.270
 Betis annulled for offside 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.450
 rubén castro 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.670
 everything after the great intervention 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.050
 and diego lopez to the shot of rose in the 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.660
 repetition you can appreciate how 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.940
 effectively rubén castro is in out 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.329
 of game 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.609
 the answer 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.050
 almost immediately from madrid and from 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.050
 a debutante who looks 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.800
 Shot 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.180
 deflected 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.180
 I could remember 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.300
 an adrián that throws bullet against the betis 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.460
 in which marcelo was going to designate 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.980
 would be action that with the back 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.560
 Brazilian lying in the green 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.510
 and to have ricardo carvalho to rotate 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.850
 the ball out but in this action it 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.850
 I hurt marcelo muscle injury 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.659
 Murillo reacted like this knowing that 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.080
 injured Marcelo and he had to give 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.270
 Entrance to Raphael Varanne 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.670
 that is that corner booted by bo derek 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.820
 headshot to the taste of Christian 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.820
 ronaldo 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.030
 in the decisive hand they could also be 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.710
 living here the shot 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.710
 deviated from jos and is better 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.020
 the replica of betis with this action of 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.880
 soap the acrobatic finish very nice 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.560
 angel capel 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.890
 although we divert without problems to 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.890
 diego lopez 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.280
 more arrivals from the verdiblanco box more 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.920
 dangerous arrivals list was 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.510
 probably the best of the first 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.240
 half for the pepe ml team that 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.410
 head shot Franco stole the 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.410
 Castro who was leaving high 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.870
 an opportunity to which he responded 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.090
 Cristiano Ronaldo with this lash 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.739
 from far away it crashed on the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.489
 left post of adrián's goal 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.680
 the entity immediately after 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.350
 invalidated by out of play of karim 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.320
 benzema 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.930
 and the stoppage of Christian to stop the royal 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.079
 betis football 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.450
 the braided play of pepe's team 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.790
 mel was going to end this center of 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.040
 nick and the auction of favor that hit 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.939
 in the upper part the stringer of the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.939
 diego lópez goal 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.080
 madrid that was going to score the first bullseye 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.370
 of the meeting in this beautiful association 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.370
 between benzema and mesut özil marked on the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.760
 last breath of the first time the 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.739
 first target of the confrontation of 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.019
 German player 1 yes that has been very 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.010
 protagonist because he has marked two of 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.010
 the three goals of madrid 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.290
 images already of the second time in a 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.240
 action in which the first request was made 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.740
 or even possible Christian france and 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.740
 that ended with that shot of benzema 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.750
 there they will be able to see the repetition of 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.750
 throw 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.150
 in the referee I ask nothing of the backlash of the 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.220
 madrid and will end with the 2 to 0 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.680
 I depth of Christian the auction 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.680
 of benzema to bring down Adrian Sanmiguel 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.300
 but then make a madrid that also 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.690
 from marcelo due to an injury I also lost 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.930
 modric for a nuisance went into his 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.930
 place 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.810
 pt to form the double pivot next to 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.740
 casimir 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.320
 and from fast counterattack the betis was going 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.840
 to force this penalty from nacho to rubén 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.110
 castro nacho who saw the cardboard 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.110
 yellow 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:11.069
 and that's how well jorge molina launched it 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:13.469
 with very little run up the 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.360
 ball brushed lightly diego 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:17.909
 lopez but could not divert the 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.350
 trajectory of the ball 19 of the season 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.890
 for 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.890
 jorge molina 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.810
 betis that as a result of the goal he spawned and 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.690
 speech of this double shot opportunity 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.790
 to the rubén castro crossbar and the action 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.010
 later turkey did not hit 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.680
 bring down the ship defended by Diego 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.950
 lopez albiol in the very same line of 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.060
 goal 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.060
 I took the ball 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.760
 more arrivals from madrid than in this 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.260
 Christian's maneuver was going to get 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.640
 the final 3 to 1 in goal mouth 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.640
 I pushed the ball 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.710
 mesut özil to score 3 to 1 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.710
 definitive 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.979
 it does not exist outside the game because it is 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.979
 enabling paula or 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.780
 at the end three to one in the bernabéu 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:23.490
 triumph of madrid over the real betis 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.490
 football madrid 3 betis 1
