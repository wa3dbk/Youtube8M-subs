going to go to filter we're going to go

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.810 
going to go to filter we're going to go
to<00:01:27.930> all<00:01:29.240> all<00:01:30.240> time<00:01:31.310> we'll<00:01:32.310> see<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:32.729> the

to all all time we'll see what the
highest<00:01:33.090> wave<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.540> probably<00:01:33.869> very

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
highest wave there it's probably very

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
considering it's just an easy map it's

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.240 
considering it's just an easy map it's
ranked<00:03:28.480> easy<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:29.049> haven't<00:03:29.590> really<00:03:29.769> put<00:03:29.980> much

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
like one hard map I don't even remember

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.710 
like one hard map I don't even remember
what<00:03:41.380> map<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:41.980> was<00:03:42.190> but<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.209> didn't<00:03:43.510> get<00:03:43.600> too<00:03:43.690> far

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
might get that lmg later on not exactly

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.020 
might get that lmg later on not exactly
sure<00:06:26.860> but<00:06:27.860> right<00:06:28.340> now<00:06:28.460> we<00:06:28.520> can<00:06:28.670> just<00:06:28.700> use<00:06:28.910> the

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
sure but right now we can just use the

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.760 
sure but right now we can just use the
shotgun<00:06:29.270> and<00:06:29.690> you<00:06:29.960> can<00:06:30.110> see<00:06:30.230> I'm<00:06:30.320> taking<00:06:30.590> a<00:06:30.620> lot

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
shotgun and you can see I'm taking a lot

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.310 
shotgun and you can see I'm taking a lot
of<00:06:30.860> damage<00:06:31.040> here<00:06:31.370> which<00:06:31.520> isn't<00:06:31.700> a<00:06:31.850> big<00:06:32.030> deal

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
of damage here which isn't a big deal

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.660 
of damage here which isn't a big deal
normally<00:06:33.320> it<00:06:33.500> would<00:06:33.710> take<00:06:33.740> away<00:06:34.130> all<00:06:34.340> of<00:06:34.400> the

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
normally it would take away all of the

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.580 
normally it would take away all of the
armor<00:06:35.060> I<00:06:35.090> have<00:06:35.390> it<00:06:35.570> would<00:06:35.720> be<00:06:35.840> it<00:06:36.170> would<00:06:36.230> be<00:06:36.560> a

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
armor I have it would be it would be a

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.620 
armor I have it would be it would be a
big<00:06:36.740> deal<00:06:36.950> if<00:06:37.010> I<00:06:37.190> had<00:06:37.340> armor<00:06:37.730> how<00:06:38.150> but<00:06:38.330> I<00:06:38.360> don't

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
big deal if I had armor how but I don't

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.780 
big deal if I had armor how but I don't
have<00:06:38.780> armor<00:06:39.080> so<00:06:39.380> it's<00:06:39.620> not<00:06:39.950> taking<00:06:40.250> away<00:06:40.490> any

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
have armor so it's not taking away any

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.430 
have armor so it's not taking away any
health<00:06:41.090> the<00:06:41.570> only<00:06:41.780> thing<00:06:41.960> that<00:06:42.110> it's<00:06:42.230> taken

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.320 
health the only thing that it's taken
away<00:06:42.620> is<00:06:42.860> the<00:06:43.100> opportunity<00:06:43.550> for<00:06:43.760> me<00:06:44.030> to<00:06:44.150> earn

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330

away is the opportunity for me to earn
money<00:06:44.570> because<00:06:45.020> obviously<00:06:45.260> the<00:06:46.250> less<00:06:46.490> help

you you lose the more money you get at

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.220 
you you lose the more money you get at
the<00:06:49.130> end<00:06:49.310> of<00:06:49.430> every<00:06:49.730> wave<00:06:49.940> and<00:06:50.300> you<00:06:51.020> know<00:06:51.110> the

much<00:06:54.410> money<00:06:54.470> which<00:06:55.010> is<00:06:55.280> kind<00:06:55.790> of<00:06:55.880> a<00:06:55.970> big<00:06:56.120> deal

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
much money which is kind of a big deal

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.000 
much money which is kind of a big deal
because<00:06:56.420> money<00:06:56.750> is<00:06:56.840> important<00:06:57.560> especially

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
because money is important especially

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:20.690 
this is the helicopter wave I think

that's<00:07:20.870> next<00:07:21.470> wave<00:07:21.860> wave<00:07:22.310> 6<00:07:22.610> yes<00:07:22.790> it<00:07:22.940> is<00:07:23.530> um<00:07:24.530> so

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190 
that's next wave wave 6 yes it is um so

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.920 
that's next wave wave 6 yes it is um so
right<00:07:25.340> now<00:07:25.370> we<00:07:25.940> are<00:07:26.060> going<00:07:26.210> to<00:07:26.390> pick<00:07:26.600> up<00:07:26.720> the
