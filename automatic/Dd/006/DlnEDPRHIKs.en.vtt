going to create a new layer called
highlights<00:00:28.699> about<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.939> double<00:00:30.630> clicked

effect<00:00:45.050> kinda<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.960> doesn't

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
effect kinda like so and this doesn't

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.619 
effect kinda like so and this doesn't
have<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.590> perfect<00:00:51.289> but<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.910> nicer<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.510> is

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
have to be perfect but the nicer that is

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.889 
have to be perfect but the nicer that is
the<00:00:54.840> better<00:00:56.180> I'm<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.510> ahead<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the better I'm going to go ahead and

the better I'm going to go ahead and
grab<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.469> point<00:00:58.859> here

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.980

click or command click that delete that
layer<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:23.030> now<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.420> use<00:01:24.630> our<00:01:24.810> paintbrush

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
layer and now we can use our paintbrush

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.179 
layer and now we can use our paintbrush
tool<00:01:26.179> make<00:01:27.179> it<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.359> nice<00:01:27.569> good<00:01:27.899> size<00:01:28.170> around<00:01:28.740> 100

100<00:01:29.729> pixels<00:01:29.969> to<00:01:30.270> drop<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> hardness<00:01:31.020> all<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:31.349 
100 pixels to drop the hardness all the

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:33.190 
100 pixels to drop the hardness all the
way<00:01:31.439> down<00:01:31.649> make<00:01:31.920> sure<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.399> white<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
nice highlight in like so and then we

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.410 
nice highlight in like so and then we
can<00:01:42.270> drop<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.509> 0<00:01:42.719> pacity<00:01:43.319> down<00:01:43.560> into<00:01:44.159> about

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.550 

about<00:01:48.420> forty<00:01:49.319> five<00:01:49.469> percent<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.099> good

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
about forty five percent will be good

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.139 
about forty five percent will be good
and<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.649> don't<00:01:52.770> need<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.069> bunch<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.610> these<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
and we don't need a bunch of these and

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.690 
and we don't need a bunch of these and
we<00:01:54.959> can<00:01:55.110> actually<00:01:55.229> use<00:01:55.679> our<00:01:55.950> polygon<00:01:56.399> lasso

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
we can actually use our polygon lasso

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.499 
we can actually use our polygon lasso
tool<00:01:57.179> for<00:01:57.420> some<00:01:57.629> of<00:01:57.750> these<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:58.079> well<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:59.509> we'll

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
tool for some of these as well and we'll

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:20.480 
tool for some of these as well and we'll
start<00:02:00.780> here

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.450 

and<00:02:21.240> we'll<00:02:21.930> move<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.350> below<00:02:22.830> our<00:02:23.070> lines

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
and we'll move this below our lines

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.160 
and we'll move this below our lines
layer<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:24.300> don't<00:02:24.510> even<00:02:24.600> see<00:02:25.050> them

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
layer so that you don't even see them

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.310 
layer so that you don't even see them
like<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.880> that's<00:02:26.880> looking<00:02:27.270> good<00:02:27.480> let's<00:02:28.080> go

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
like so that's looking good let's go

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.020 
like so that's looking good let's go
ahead<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.560> create<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:30.020> nice<00:02:31.760> nice<00:02:32.760> one<00:02:33.000> right

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.509 
go ahead and go to select modify and
track<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.859> by<00:03:27.129> about<00:03:27.489> 15<00:03:28.450> pixels<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.519> that's

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
track that by about 15 pixels and that's

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.800 
track that by about 15 pixels and that's
because<00:03:30.670> it's<00:03:30.909> going<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.090> give<00:03:31.209> us<00:03:31.239> this<00:03:31.480> line

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
because it's going to give us this line

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.970 
because it's going to give us this line
here<00:03:32.139> and<00:03:32.440> we<00:03:32.950> can<00:03:33.129> then<00:03:33.629> hold<00:03:34.629> down<00:03:34.780> alt<00:03:35.290> shift

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
here and we can then hold down alt shift

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.819 
here and we can then hold down alt shift
and<00:03:36.849> I<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:38.019> invert<00:03:38.440> our<00:03:38.680> selection<00:03:40.620> using<00:03:41.620> the

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
and I to invert our selection using the

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:49.319 
and I to invert our selection using the
paintbrush<00:03:42.280> tool<00:03:42.609> again<00:03:44.129> we<00:03:45.129> can<00:03:45.340> then<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:49.239> I

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
paintbrush tool again we can then and I

00:03:49.329 --> 00:04:08.740 
paintbrush tool again we can then and I
actually<00:03:49.540> need<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.139> undo<00:03:51.010> that<00:03:51.129> inverse

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:18.920 

I'm<00:04:09.350> not<00:04:09.710> really<00:04:09.950> sure<00:04:10.070> why<00:04:10.640> that's<00:04:10.820> doing<00:04:11.390> it

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.710 

oh<00:04:18.989> it's<00:04:19.650> on<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.070> wrong<00:04:20.220> layer<00:04:20.459> right<00:04:20.940> there

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
oh it's on the wrong layer right there

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.719 
oh it's on the wrong layer right there
we<00:04:21.840> go<00:04:23.750> something<00:04:24.750> like<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.430> maybe<00:04:26.430> do<00:04:26.699> a

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
we go something like that maybe do a

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.010 
we go something like that maybe do a
little<00:04:26.820> bit<00:04:27.210> like<00:04:27.479> yeah<00:04:27.960> on<00:04:28.380> his<00:04:28.650> lips<00:04:30.020> little

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
little bit like yeah on his lips little

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.679 
little bit like yeah on his lips little
bit<00:04:31.139> here

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:35.689 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:39.230 

we<00:04:36.529> can<00:04:36.709> do

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.839 

over<00:04:39.720> on<00:04:39.840> this<00:04:39.990> inside<00:04:40.770> in<00:04:41.190> like<00:04:41.639> so<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:43.849> like

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
over on this inside in like so and like

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.680 
over on this inside in like so and like
that<00:04:45.330> we<00:04:46.229> have<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.470> nice<00:04:46.830> shaded<00:04:47.520> character<00:04:48.090> all

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
that we have a nice shaded character all

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.600 
that we have a nice shaded character all
we<00:04:48.990> need<00:04:49.169> to<00:04:49.199> do<00:04:49.380> is<00:04:49.560> finish<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:50.099> going<00:04:50.520> to

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
we need to do is finish that going to

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.540 
we need to do is finish that going to
blur<00:04:50.849> Gaussian<00:04:51.509> blur<00:04:51.539> and<00:04:51.960> just<00:04:52.650> blurt<00:04:52.979> by<00:04:53.520> a

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
blur Gaussian blur and just blurt by a

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.860 
blur Gaussian blur and just blurt by a
couple<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.210> pixels<00:04:55.639> do<00:04:56.639> it<00:04:56.759> by<00:04:56.940> about<00:04:57.060> four

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
couple of pixels do it by about four

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.450 
couple of pixels do it by about four
should<00:04:58.530> be<00:04:58.620> good<00:04:59.780> okay<00:05:01.460> go<00:05:02.460> ahead<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:04.460> command
