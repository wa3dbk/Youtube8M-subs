conditioning<00:01:15.549> it<00:01:15.700> at<00:01:15.880> all<00:01:16.030> like<00:01:16.360> I<00:01:16.600> was<00:01:16.990> just

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
conditioning it at all like I was just

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.810 
conditioning it at all like I was just
pretty<00:01:17.560> much<00:01:17.740> done<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.100> one<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:18.400> something<00:01:18.670> new

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
pretty much done in one is something new

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.880 
pretty much done in one is something new
so<00:01:19.060> that's<00:01:19.330> what<00:01:19.479> happened<00:01:19.750> with<00:01:19.840> that<00:01:19.890> so

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
so that's what happened with that so

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.620 
so that's what happened with that so
after<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.250> bleach<00:01:21.430> bath<00:01:21.670> it<00:01:21.939> has<00:01:22.210> behaved

after the bleach bath it has behaved

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.749 
after the bleach bath it has behaved
very<00:01:22.750> well<00:01:23.579> um<00:01:24.579> i<00:01:24.670> actually<00:01:25.450> have<00:01:25.780> some<00:01:26.229> of<00:01:26.439> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
very well um i actually have some of the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.510 
very well um i actually have some of the
16<00:01:27.759> inches<00:01:28.210> left<00:01:28.509> from<00:01:28.810> there<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:33.369> is

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
16 inches left from there and this is

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.190 
16 inches left from there and this is
how<00:01:33.640> it<00:01:33.759> looks<00:01:33.820> this<00:01:34.149> is<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.450> natural<00:01:35.020> wave

how it looks this is a natural wave

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.980 
how it looks this is a natural wave
pattern<00:01:35.649> it's<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.939> loose<00:01:37.270> wave<00:01:37.509> so<00:01:37.960> i

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
pattern it's the loose wave so i

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.190 
pattern it's the loose wave so i
installed<00:01:38.939> most<00:01:39.939> of<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.270> 16<00:01:40.720> inch<00:01:40.750> in
