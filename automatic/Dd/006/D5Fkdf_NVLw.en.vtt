00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.849
 Mother go out hello guys, be well. 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.130
 Come to another channel video 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.530
 this time a tutorial late angles and 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.230
 common was the first major loot 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.390
 efficiency is the least damage as if 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.820
 You only with the first person the big ones. 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.410
 Not the little ones here to demonstrate. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.900
 there is a correct sequence for 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.390
 focus on who greater efficiency in django 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.820
 with the least possible damage 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.390
 the most important is to focus on the other 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.090
 for their attacks to be more efficient 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.160
 You have to choose koka, which is not 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.250
 can be multiple monsters at the same time 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.309
 time the idea is a good example of how 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.840
 focus on a single target each happy if 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.239
 You're going to use smic 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.879
 only another great first to only one 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.350
 personal exception is for the birds in the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.750
 birds case 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.760
 only that first the small ones and also with 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.160
 the two sips of stones on the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.859
 lane but focuses on the first small 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.739
 now we will treat you in practice as 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.110
 this methodology works here first 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.110
 steps and do not focus on small 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.359
 the path with approximately 460 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.729
 life 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:27.429
 now I'm going to focus first on big bird 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.859
 to show you how to 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.020
 You will see the difference between Big Macau 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.689
 first small children but the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.880
 first in the case of birds 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.880
 you will have a smaller goose son 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.649
 passing will be focused on the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.479
 first focus on a single monsters each 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.239
 People said I'm going to finish with 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:56.469
 approximately 350 lives 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:59.020
 I had in the year this one of 110 more then 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.209
 It is always legal to focus on the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.979
 birds a little first to you 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.979
 take as few damage as possible 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.459
 here on the clothes that I'm going to focus on 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.459
 big first on small things 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:40.660
 I will finish with approximately 550 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:43.600
 DHPP just now here and focus me 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.150
 the small wolves first at a time 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:03:03.519
 and I'm going to finish with approximately 20 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:03:05.980
 30 hp is coming this 20 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.739
 then the ideal is to start first by 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:15.250
 large logo in case of egg take the smallest 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:18.940
 possible here in both terms of 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.700
 stone begins the first by the small eu 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.430
 I'll finish with 260 dhpp 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.590
 the ideal is to start from the small hill 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.100
 first in the case of these two walls of 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.100
 stone 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:44.470
 with that pure water on that day here 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.890
 It starts with our great and I go 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.960
 finish with 200g hc the title of the extra 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.360
 of 60 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.780
 the ideal is to start with the small monster 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.920
 in the case here the two stone monsters is 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.920
 take as little damage as possible 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.430
 in the case of balls both net while a 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.360
 legal group always gets so big 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.360
 here I finish with about 300 hp 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.360
 about 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.270
 our pink battle 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.230
 and do it 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.580
 here I started with our little ones 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.830
 blue ball had no domestic 80 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.690
 I 'll finish with approximately 200 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.580
 girls coming to p 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.980
 the cool thing is always to get the goal in 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.980
 However the group at large rec blog 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.130
 I know my person in the comments 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.680
 the monster you kill first big or 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.780
 small people whatever 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.790
 good people today video is getting to 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.160
 who do not forget to write in our 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.990
 you still need video cilic and 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.160
 share aggressively to give 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.230
 a pro-channel force 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.260
 A big hug, thank you, bye. 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.260
