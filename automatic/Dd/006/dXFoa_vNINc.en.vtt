00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.230
 hello guys I'm marquez and today we're going to 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.600
 see a little bit all the functions of 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.629
 cerberus which is an anti-theft application 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.309
 for our engine or the motorcycle that well what 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.460
 first thing we will do is download it from 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.930
 play this is totally free but to 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.740
 the time to login 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.140
 I think it costs 23 euros deserved before 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.350
 to buy it watch this video and if you 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.200
 so convinces the purchases or I do not oblige 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.570
 to anyone well once we have it with 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.420
 a username and password we divide 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:44.120
 we will go to the pc and we will 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.450
 www.peru.com and there we will put our 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.620
 username and our password 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.340
 when you have the page open 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.160
 you will have an interface like this this 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.320
 previously activating services in 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.660
 our 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.250
 in this phone that I will put you later 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.250
 here on the right side a little square 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.409
 and we'll see some functions on the phone 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.770
 from above it appears that above is the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:15.280
 mine and down here because they are all 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.110
 codes that we can do with cerberus 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.090
 now we will do one's test so that 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.369
 You see who they say state of 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.979
 connection that we have that is to see that 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.990
 the device is well connected 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.000
 the tracking status that I imagine will be 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.630
 because I do not have the gps put in mode 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.509
 precise the battery that we have it 71 73 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.520
 percent and lowering and good the last 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.250
 connection and the ip of the device that 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.560
 here we see a map 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.050
 that will not come out in the case of if what 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.870
 we lose then we will give you to start 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.460
 crawl and send the command I do not 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.850
 I can do it because if I do not use my 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.850
 location and it is not necessary either 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.979
 so every time you see me a command 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.390
 here will be on the right side a 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.850
 record of everything we are doing 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.940
 ok let's do a test by 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.560
 example I will use the one to start the 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.280
 alarm 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.280
 I will put proof 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.160
 if it works if I have to activate something 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.120
 more on the phone and we 're going to give 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.120
 send with 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.780
 Well, that message sounds 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:32.990
 listened to with the text that you want well 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.510
 we can do lots of things 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.700
 have the location history because 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.590
 it moves the phone unlock it if not 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.890
 we come to find block with code 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.020
 important if we do not have the pin pattern 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.000
 get the call log and that 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.950
 person because it is the coincidence that 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.900
 we have put no code and the person 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.140
 has been dedicated to calling from your 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.450
 phone call the phone or be you 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.340
 you put a number and a call is made 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.320
 remote from the terminal that you have lost 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.390
 to which you want to send sms record 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.420
 audio take both front photograph 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.050
 and rear screenshot 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.480
 capture video in emergency mode 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.250
 hide menu apps that summer 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.690
 and the most important thing are the two 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.970
 last down that is to erase the memory 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.870
 of the device and erase the sd memory 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.920
 along with blocking it with codes well not 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.650
 has more sincerely is the use 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.470
 easy enough and also remind you that 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.450
 put a bonding pattern so that 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.599
 time to get home and do 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.269
 all these commands as you like and 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.069
 buy them and I recommend buying them and 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.660
 I bought it in its day and when the 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.330
 buy I think there are three euros many 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.730
 sometimes because of the occasional use of an offer of 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.400
 which is free and so on 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.629
 and you have for five phones to put 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.280
 the five phones that more from here 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.840
 there are a few more options here 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.310
 device configuration that 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.840
 we can eliminate the devices that already 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.500
 do not use when selling it and go 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.150
 to realize that it comes out right here and what 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.129
 The only one that will come out is to change 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.480
 our password put the new 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:17.169
 our mail and the simple language 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.489
 true then nothing simply that and 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.970
 activate on the phone as it came out in the 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.290
 previous video 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.720
 the settings 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.060
 we will go to cerberus in the 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.310
 Android application and we will activate it 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.700
 that by effect comes deactivated and then 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.890
 in security and administration settings 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.230
 devices we will mark the box of a 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.510
 cerberus remember that if you are a user 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.360
 root you can flash 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.860
 with cerberus that has to be integrated into 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.150
 the rom and endure enough uip is this 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.210
 is the bad thing that this has 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.230
 to be 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.820
 and no root user is worth 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.630
 with a little work but you could 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.220
 say salar so nothing I recommend 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.460
 I recommend that simply that the 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.460
 buy since it's pretty 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.099
 Well nothing guys just this I hope 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.389
 that the video has served you 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.970
 liked any comment me what 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:20.000
 leave below and I will respond as 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:23.539
 always the most the maximum speed 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.069
 possible I hope you liked it and without 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.330
 more I'll see you in the following 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.330
 comes a greeting
