people do they're going to get this

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.730 
people do they're going to get this
going<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.640> called<00:00:26.849> for<00:00:26.939> traveling<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
going to get called for traveling and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.650 
going to get called for traveling and
jabbing<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.010> right<00:00:29.220> foot<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:30.449> get<00:00:30.630> so

quick<00:00:31.279> they<00:00:32.279> go<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.669> way<00:00:32.880> by<00:00:33.540> moving<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
quick they go this way by moving the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.959 
quick they go this way by moving the
left<00:00:34.200> foot<00:00:34.350> which<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.680> your<00:00:34.829> pivot<00:00:35.160> foot<00:00:35.190> that

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
is traveling in any league so the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.540 
is traveling in any league so the
correct<00:00:39.120> way<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.300> do<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.840> when<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.410> jab<00:00:40.710> now

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
correct way to do it is when you jab now

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.709 
correct way to do it is when you jab now
you're<00:00:41.700> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> pick<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> same<00:00:42.420> foot

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
you're going to pick up the same foot

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.650 
you're going to pick up the same foot
that<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.960> jab<00:00:43.320> with<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.890> change<00:00:44.760> directions

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that you jab with and change directions

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.619 
that you jab with and change directions
and<00:00:46.110> then<00:00:46.739> putting<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.129> ball<00:00:47.309> down<00:00:47.670> good

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and then putting the ball down good

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
and then putting the ball down good
defensive<00:00:49.140> players<00:00:49.410> if<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.100> put<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> ball

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
defensive players if you put the ball

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.299 
defensive players if you put the ball
out<00:00:50.789> here<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:52.170> long<00:00:52.440> enough<00:00:52.649> arms<00:00:52.860> scottie

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
out here have long enough arms scottie

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.450 
out here have long enough arms scottie
pippen<00:00:53.699> for<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.930> slap<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.469> your<00:00:56.010> momentum

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
pippen for one can slap it your momentum

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.740 
pippen for one can slap it your momentum
is<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.000> way<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> ball<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.719> going

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
is going this way and the ball is going

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.010 
is going this way and the ball is going
that<00:00:58.109> way<00:00:58.340> good<00:00:59.340> way<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> correct<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.090> is

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
that way good way to correct that is

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.100 
that way good way to correct that is
when<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> jab<00:01:01.620> now<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.640> change<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.899> put

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
when you jab now you change if you put

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.590 
when you jab now you change if you put
the<00:01:04.260> ball<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.760> got<00:01:05.939> protection<00:01:06.360> from

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the ball here you got protection from

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.320 
the ball here you got protection from
your<00:01:06.810> right<00:01:06.990> leg<00:01:07.400> your<00:01:08.400> hand<00:01:08.640> should<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:09.000> here

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
your right leg your hand should be here

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.870 
your right leg your hand should be here
protecting<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> basketball<00:01:10.439> anyway<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.640> now

protecting the basketball anyway so now

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.520 
protecting the basketball anyway so now
the<00:01:11.939> only<00:01:12.330> way<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> defense<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:13.170> get<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.409> that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the only way the defense can get to that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.530 
the only way the defense can get to that
ball<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.159> through<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.430> arms<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:15.330> through

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
your legs nine times out of 10 it's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.450 
your legs nine times out of 10 it's
going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> file<00:01:18.900> I'd<00:01:19.799> say<00:01:20.009> nine<00:01:20.220> times

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
going to be a file I'd say nine times

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.800 
going to be a file I'd say nine times
out<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.640> 10<00:01:20.880> because<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.299> could<00:01:21.479> get<00:01:21.600> away<00:01:21.689> with

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
out of 10 because I could get away with

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.170 
out of 10 because I could get away with
it<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> don't<00:01:22.860> play<00:01:23.130> anymore<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.060> don't

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it but I don't play anymore so you don't

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.929 
it but I don't play anymore so you don't
have<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.360> worry<00:01:24.509> about<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.650> jab<00:01:26.640> step

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
have to worry about that so jab step

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.030 
have to worry about that so jab step
change<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> direction<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.380> way<00:01:28.619> putting

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
change the direction this way putting

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.520 
change the direction this way putting
the<00:01:29.189> ball<00:01:29.369> inside<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.240> leg<00:01:30.390> now<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.320> good

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the ball inside your leg now the good

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
the ball inside your leg now the good
thing<00:01:31.590> about<00:01:31.740> an<00:01:32.009> offensive<00:01:32.490> player<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.960> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
thing about an offensive player is you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.469 
thing about an offensive player is you
got<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:34.350> able<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:34.680> both<00:01:35.159> ways<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.360> go

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
got to be able to go both ways you go

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
got to be able to go both ways you go
one<00:01:36.689> way<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.740> you're<00:01:38.009> limiting<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.520> options

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
one way now you're limiting your options

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.480 
one way now you're limiting your options
the<00:01:39.570> defense<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.259> read<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the defense is going to read that and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.960 
the defense is going to read that and
then<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:41.790> become<00:01:42.200> more<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.770> guess<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
then they become more I guess have the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.730 
then they become more I guess have the
advantage<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.689> try<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> limit<00:01:46.320> your<00:01:46.680> options

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
advantage to try to limit your options

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.219 
advantage to try to limit your options
as<00:01:47.280> an<00:01:47.430> option<00:01:47.729> suppler<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.689> never<00:01:48.960> want<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
as an option suppler you never want to

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.020 
as an option suppler you never want to
limit<00:01:49.409> your<00:01:49.590> options<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.159> when<00:01:50.909> you're

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
limit your options so when you're

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.319 
limit your options so when you're
working<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.509> move<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.290> way

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
working on that move to do it this way

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.139 
working on that move to do it this way
also<00:01:54.350> do<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.649> way<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.549> now<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:57.030> have

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
also do it that way so now you can have

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.260 
also do it that way so now you can have
two<00:01:57.390> options<00:01:58.310> if<00:01:59.310> my<00:01:59.610> man<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.939> taking<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
two options if my man is taking a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.940 
two options if my man is taking a
defensive<00:02:00.540> stance<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.500> thing<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.860> I'm

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
defensive stance the thing that I'm

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.380 
defensive stance the thing that I'm
looking<00:02:02.100> at<00:02:02.280> right<00:02:02.340> now<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.939> he's<00:02:03.119> playing

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
looking at right now is he's playing

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.899 
looking at right now is he's playing
parallel<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:04.890> he's<00:02:05.280> playing<00:02:05.549> me<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.790> go

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
parallel so now he's playing me to go

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.630 
parallel so now he's playing me to go
either<00:02:06.090> way<00:02:06.210> which<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.689> good<00:02:07.129> which<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.310> also

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
either way which is good which and also

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.930 
either way which is good which and also
to<00:02:09.179> me<00:02:09.360> means<00:02:10.039> all<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.459> do<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.700> give<00:02:11.849> him

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to me means all I have to do is give him

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.490 
to me means all I have to do is give him
a<00:02:11.970> nice<00:02:12.209> little<00:02:12.420> effect<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:12.930> way

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
a nice little effect this way

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.020 
a nice little effect this way
he's<00:02:14.500> going<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.800> think<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.220> feel<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.940> that's

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
he's going to think and feel that that's

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.089 
he's going to think and feel that that's
where<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.390> way<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.050> way<00:02:17.170> I'm<00:02:17.319> going<00:02:17.530> my

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
where the way that the way I'm going my

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.460 
where the way that the way I'm going my
change<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.520> direction<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:20.020> little<00:02:20.380> bit

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
change of direction is a little bit

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.960 
change of direction is a little bit
better<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.860> use<00:02:21.099> when<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.489> see<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.700> guy<00:02:21.910> with

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
better to use when you see a guy with

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.380 
better to use when you see a guy with
the<00:02:22.209> parallel<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:22.720> stance<00:02:23.400> mainly<00:02:24.400> because<00:02:24.430> he

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
the parallel of stance mainly because he

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.180 
the parallel of stance mainly because he
doesn't<00:02:25.569> know<00:02:25.660> where<00:02:25.900> you're<00:02:26.050> going<00:02:26.349> so<00:02:27.010> now

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
doesn't know where you're going so now

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.430 
doesn't know where you're going so now
you<00:02:27.250> have<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.670> many<00:02:27.790> options<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:29.020> just<00:02:29.230> try<00:02:29.410> to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
you have so many options you just try to

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.830 
you have so many options you just try to
use<00:02:29.739> as<00:02:30.040> many<00:02:30.220> options<00:02:30.459> as<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.880> can<00:02:31.090> now<00:02:31.720> if

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
use as many options as you can now if

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.280 
use as many options as you can now if
you<00:02:31.959> had<00:02:32.140> his<00:02:32.260> right<00:02:32.500> foot<00:02:32.770> forward<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:35.080> to

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
you had his right foot forward that to

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.040 
you had his right foot forward that to
me<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.680> saying<00:02:35.970> now<00:02:36.970> he<00:02:37.300> wants<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.720> go<00:02:37.870> this

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
me is saying now he wants you to go this

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.110 
me is saying now he wants you to go this
way<00:02:38.230> last<00:02:39.160> thing<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.400> want<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.610> do<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.850> go<00:02:39.970> where

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
way last thing I want to do is go where

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.790 
way last thing I want to do is go where
the<00:02:40.209> defense<00:02:40.540> wants<00:02:40.720> me<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.050> go<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.410> want<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.709> go

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
the defense wants me to go I want to go

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.720 
the defense wants me to go I want to go
opposite<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.390> when<00:02:43.800> now<00:02:44.800> he<00:02:45.310> takes

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
opposite so this is when now he takes

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.430 
opposite so this is when now he takes
his<00:02:46.000> step<00:02:46.300> that<00:02:46.660> way<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.080> change<00:02:47.319> of

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
his step that way the change of

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.130 
his step that way the change of
direction<00:02:47.560> means<00:02:48.360> he's<00:02:49.360> got<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.690> pick<00:02:49.840> up<00:02:49.959> this

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
direction means he's got to pick up this

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.220 
direction means he's got to pick up this
foot<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.650> open<00:02:51.549> then<00:02:51.970> slide<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.600> keep<00:02:52.780> up<00:02:52.930> you

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
foot and open then slide to keep up you

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.530 
foot and open then slide to keep up you
as<00:02:53.470> an<00:02:53.799> offensive<00:02:54.100> player<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:55.060> takes<00:02:55.330> more

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
as an offensive player that takes more

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.809 
as an offensive player that takes more
time<00:02:55.810> than<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.350> taking<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:56.980> crossover<00:02:57.489> and

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
time than you taking that crossover and

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.580 
time than you taking that crossover and
driving<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.840> hole<00:02:58.989> so<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.200> have<00:02:59.470> the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
driving to the hole so you have the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.699 
driving to the hole so you have the
advantage<00:02:59.739> in<00:03:00.130> that<00:03:00.160> sense<00:03:00.549> now<00:03:01.510> if<00:03:02.410> he<00:03:02.560> has

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
advantage in that sense now if he has

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.710 
advantage in that sense now if he has
his<00:03:02.890> other<00:03:03.069> foot<00:03:03.340> up<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.330> what<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.540> was

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
his other foot up this is what I was

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.210 
his other foot up this is what I was
telling<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.080> about<00:03:05.110> being<00:03:05.590> able<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.830> go<00:03:06.010> both

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
telling you about being able to go both

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.580 
telling you about being able to go both
ways<00:03:06.519> now<00:03:07.390> you<00:03:07.450> can<00:03:07.600> do<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.810> same<00:03:08.080> thing<00:03:08.380> and

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
ways now you can do the same thing and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.390 
ways now you can do the same thing and
attack<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:09.549> this<00:03:10.030> way<00:03:10.680> be<00:03:11.680> sure<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.830> mean<00:03:12.069> so<00:03:12.250> now

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
attack it this way be sure I mean so now

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.920 
attack it this way be sure I mean so now
he<00:03:12.459> can't<00:03:12.910> limit<00:03:13.150> your<00:03:13.420> options<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:13.840> you

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
he can't limit your options so you

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.080 
he can't limit your options so you
should<00:03:14.230> look<00:03:14.440> before<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.340> take<00:03:15.610> your<00:03:15.640> stance

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
should look before you take your stance

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.880 
should look before you take your stance
look<00:03:16.420> how<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.600> defense<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:17.080> playing<00:03:17.319> you<00:03:17.650> and

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
look how the defense is playing you and

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.000 
look how the defense is playing you and
then<00:03:19.140> decide<00:03:20.140> which<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.530> your<00:03:20.650> pivot<00:03:20.980> foot

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
then decide which is your pivot foot

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.949 
then decide which is your pivot foot
your<00:03:21.250> right<00:03:21.280> foot<00:03:21.730> or<00:03:22.269> your<00:03:22.390> left<00:03:22.570> foot<00:03:22.810> and

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
your right foot or your left foot and

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.500 
your right foot or your left foot and
then<00:03:23.170> attack
