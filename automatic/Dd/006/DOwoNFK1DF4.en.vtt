and<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.080> think<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.350> XP<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:23.039> obviously<00:00:23.939> more<00:00:24.980> so

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
and I think the XP is obviously more so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
and I think the XP is obviously more so
I<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:26.430> 62<00:00:26.910> agility<00:00:27.689> currently<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:29.000> I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
started at 43 with this project so it's

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.389 
started at 43 with this project so it's
almost<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.130> solid<00:00:35.579> 20<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.120> jillee<00:00:36.360> levels<00:00:37.399> so

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
almost a solid 20 of jillee levels so

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.619 
almost a solid 20 of jillee levels so
yeah<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.579> got<00:00:38.760> higher<00:00:38.969> 95<00:00:39.540> marks<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.260> grace<00:00:40.469> and

yeah I got higher 95 marks of grace and

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.010 
yeah I got higher 95 marks of grace and
I'm<00:00:42.629> really<00:00:42.989> leaning<00:00:43.320> towards<00:00:44.040> only<00:00:44.640> getting

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
I'm really leaning towards only getting

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.670 
I'm really leaning towards only getting
220<00:00:46.020> marks<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> grace<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:48.680> graceful

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
220 marks of grace because the graceful

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.819 
220 marks of grace because the graceful
boots<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:50.760> pretty<00:00:51.570> much<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.020> same<00:00:52.260> thing<00:00:52.559> as

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
boots are pretty much the same thing as

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.850 
boots are pretty much the same thing as
boots<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.309> lightness<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.870> I<00:00:54.870> already<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.350> 20

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
boots of lightness and I already have 20

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.779 
boots of lightness and I already have 20
boots<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.370> lightness<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.829> why<00:00:58.829> waste<00:00:59.520> more

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
boots of lightness so why waste more

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.720 
boots of lightness so why waste more
time<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> same<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.609> know

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
time to get just the same you know

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.850 
time to get just the same you know
weight<00:01:02.969> reduction<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.719> boots<00:01:04.290> eliteness<00:01:04.559> does

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
weight reduction as boots eliteness does

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.260 
weight reduction as boots eliteness does
and<00:01:05.159> also<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.299> more<00:01:06.720> than<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:07.909> so<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.180> were

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and also have more than one so if I were

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.840 
and also have more than one so if I were
to<00:01:09.299> ever<00:01:09.570> lose<00:01:09.930> my<00:01:10.439> graceful<00:01:10.710> boots<00:01:11.070> I'd<00:01:11.430> have

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
to ever lose my graceful boots I'd have

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.300 
to ever lose my graceful boots I'd have
to<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.890> this<00:01:13.890> painful<00:01:14.930> skill<00:01:16.040> again<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.060> 40

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
to do this painful skill again to get 40

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.410 
to do this painful skill again to get 40
marks<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.430> grace<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> yeah<00:01:22.710> I'm<00:01:23.189> pretty

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
marks of grace so yeah I'm pretty

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.039 
marks of grace so yeah I'm pretty
centered<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.570> 220<00:01:25.229> marks<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.799> grace<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.189> now

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
centered on 220 marks of grace for now

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
centered on 220 marks of grace for now
it's<00:01:28.049> been<00:01:28.259> quite<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.740> journey<00:01:29.180> hopefully<00:01:30.180> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it's been quite the journey hopefully I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.990 
it's been quite the journey hopefully I
don't<00:01:30.299> have<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.750> again<00:01:30.930> um<00:01:32.000> ten

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
don't have to do this again um ten

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.130 
don't have to do this again um ten
thousand<00:01:33.689> three<00:01:33.930> ten<00:01:34.290> thousand<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.520> agility

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
thousand three ten thousand for agility

thousand three ten thousand for agility
which<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:38.450> really<00:01:39.450> good<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.170> shows

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
which is really good but it just shows

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.160 
which is really good but it just shows
how<00:01:41.390> useless<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.750> skill<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.990> yeah

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
