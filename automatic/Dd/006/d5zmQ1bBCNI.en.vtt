 instrument to vote mountain of the day to 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:43.829
 People see how it's going to get this from here. 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.989
 The little I saw on the internet is doing 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.730
 here also remained the first 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.050
 thing we're going to have to take this 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.090
 for rifle that in fact not for the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.199
 position and has to pull box for 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.390
 out 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.340
 when you can but will get a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.340
 thing that counts do this now the circus 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.869
 you can see that the damage in won 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:22.810
 putting a guy on cars is now a lot 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:24.850
 Simple let's pull if the match is good 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.759
 people right here is the next me 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.899
 sweepstakes nobody Here in rubber 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.080
 of the door 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.130
 I think chic Michel defended Friday for 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.470
 see right 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.020
 and here in the corner that I started was the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.300
 city here to here is the part I'm 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.490
 Picking her up, she's hidden. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.740
 that is a team that if you guys car but 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.340
 will happen 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.130
 You'll know even here she comes to 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.130
 front 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.130
 safe 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.360
 this safe exchange is this 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.959
 this is another question the four were 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.319
 loose law was already good now was 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.200
 covered whoever had to do the 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:19.930
 People are going to vote for this screw. 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.850
 hopeful good to drop screw and 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.280
 have to be that key that thinking about 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.480
 You see in bed and you and you do not have much. 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.519
 focus 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.230
 she looks like a star announcing the name 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:40.600
 I have here is how it loosens and 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:53.620
 then come back and get carried away and 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:55.600
 Let's see screw in next beauty 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:03.239
 of relapse that of course you will 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:08.500
 do with us here is this I 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:13.030
 I got here I just showed up 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.810
 This can be measured to break said 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.810
 landis the car 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.420
 You can see that on this side here too 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.030
 the species in which the study 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.970
 Spike time, cool, just not for 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.720
 break she wanted to break down here 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.980
 making noise with us I do not 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.660
 I was able to get totally apathetic and 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.330
 because here in 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:52.030
 if you can see if you have a 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.630
 screw it is placed underneath 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.790
 Up then I will not rip it off 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:02.320
 I just let it go. 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:12.840
 here and I'm going to make this move that 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:12.840
 claim to be in danger 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.979
 I do not need to release that part 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:30.600
 now it's just because of my case that 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:30.600
 I have from my sound to a subtle one in her 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.350
 Internet 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.920
 The problem in my life is here, my 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.920
 camera does not have much focus 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:05:03.030
 search, we'll see how soon 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:05:03.030
 the breath is taking what you read from 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:16.080
 mouse has even put it so 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.080
 to spin 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:26.550
 good staff is keep the panel is seeing 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:31.180
 I did not film because it's just the reverse, right? 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.880
 caxeta 27 cha cha money alone here 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:37.120
 I have the screwdriver put 15 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.540
 next that has nothing here that is 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:50.880
 fully paid up is the most 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:06:08.860
 important of everything in my night photo 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:06:12.870
 regular staff is stronger and I found 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:17.230
 resembles a faintly lighter coyote 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:20.730
 I also enjoyed putting the end of the 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.730
 your white you need to identify yourself 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.320
 in return a human 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:34.390
 are you in pain can buy that is 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:39.430
 very dumb 8 leds rachiki a tip you 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:44.110
 They're afraid to put your hand 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:46.720
 in the mass who also wonders what is 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.320
 the following when you take the 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.110
 panel is doubt to see on the internet 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.670
 the pieces where we fit you go 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.550
 take your doubts and give 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.860
 You see the piece on the internet looks behind 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.170
 her and you will handle the fittings 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.000
 for you to stay crown pulls comet 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.780
 Put the staff hug 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.220
 I hope you have kicked the one who is 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.750
 wanting to do the same as I did 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.750
 to change things
