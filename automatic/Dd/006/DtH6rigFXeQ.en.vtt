other wine in here and it won't let a
good<00:03:39.670> ways<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.300> yeast<00:03:40.480> is<00:03:40.720> dissolved<00:03:41.220> now

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
good ways so the yeast is dissolved now

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.190 
good ways so the yeast is dissolved now
I'm<00:03:42.370> just<00:03:42.550> going<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:43.000> pour<00:03:43.390> it<00:03:43.510> into<00:03:43.660> my<00:03:43.810> wine

I'm just going to pour it into my wine

I'm just going to pour it into my wine
give<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.680> good<00:03:48.160> stir<00:03:48.220> wow<00:03:49.150> there's<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.510> lot

of<00:03:49.810> sugar<00:03:49.959> on<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.319> bottom<00:03:50.620> just<00:03:51.120> going<00:03:52.120> to

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
of sugar on the bottom just going to

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.520 
of sugar on the bottom just going to
stir<00:03:52.450> this<00:03:52.630> up<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:53.050> help<00:03:53.260> everything

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.649 

here's<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.680> hardest<00:04:01.010> part<00:04:01.219> pouring<00:04:01.969> your

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
here's the hardest part pouring your

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:11.920 
here's the hardest part pouring your
wine<00:04:02.840> into<00:04:03.409> your<00:04:04.250> job

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.210 

they'll<00:04:12.930> put<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.290> lid<00:04:13.439> on<00:04:13.470> yet<00:04:13.739> because<00:04:13.920> the

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
they'll put the lid on yet because the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.830 
they'll put the lid on yet because the
yeast<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.640> going<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:14.879> eat<00:04:15.060> up<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.329> sugar<00:04:15.569> and

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
yeast is going to eat up the sugar and

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.509 
yeast is going to eat up the sugar and
give<00:04:15.989> off<00:04:16.169> gas<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.829> you<00:04:16.889> don't<00:04:17.070> want<00:04:17.220> too<00:04:17.370> much

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
give off gas and you don't want too much

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.909 
give off gas and you don't want too much
pressure<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:18.060> build<00:04:18.150> up<00:04:18.299> in<00:04:18.479> your<00:04:18.509> bottle<00:04:18.919> so

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
pressure to build up in your bottle so

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.860 
pressure to build up in your bottle so
but<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.699> still<00:04:20.940> want<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.180> protect<00:04:21.509> your<00:04:21.630> wine

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
but you still want to protect your wine

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.110 
but you still want to protect your wine
from<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:23.370> elements

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
from the elements

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.290 
from the elements
so<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:25.440> recommend<00:04:26.009> putting<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.639> balloon<00:04:26.970> on<00:04:27.150> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
so I recommend putting a balloon on the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.060 
so I recommend putting a balloon on the
top<00:04:27.509> of<00:04:27.660> your<00:04:27.780> bottle<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.490> it'll<00:04:30.620> catch<00:04:31.620> the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
top of your bottle and it'll catch the

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:39.020 
top of your bottle and it'll catch the
air<00:04:33.060> as<00:04:33.919> it<00:04:34.919> comes<00:04:35.250> out<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:38.370> it'll<00:04:38.759> be<00:04:38.850> cool

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
air as it comes out and it'll be cool

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
air as it comes out and it'll be cool
because<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.539> can<00:04:39.690> watch<00:04:39.840> this<00:04:40.080> though<00:04:42.050> you

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
because you can watch this though you

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.210 
because you can watch this though you
can<00:04:43.639> you<00:04:44.639> could<00:04:44.760> walk<00:04:44.970> watch<00:04:45.389> your<00:04:45.660> balloon

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
can you could walk watch your balloon

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.710 
can you could walk watch your balloon
fill<00:04:47.220> up<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.610> then<00:04:47.699> you<00:04:47.820> know<00:04:47.970> your<00:04:48.180> line<00:04:48.419> is

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
fill up and then you know your line is

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.060 
fill up and then you know your line is
cooking<00:04:51.860> alright<00:04:53.419> there's<00:04:54.830> dandelion<00:04:55.830> wine

we're going to set it in a dark room
temperature<00:05:00.599> closet<00:05:01.229> and<00:05:01.470> check<00:05:02.220> on<00:05:02.400> it<00:05:02.550> in<00:05:02.729> 6

temperature closet and check on it in 6
weeks<00:05:03.330> and<00:05:03.690> it<00:05:04.169> should<00:05:04.320> be<00:05:04.440> ready<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.710> drink

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.620 

it's<00:05:09.400> been<00:05:09.580> about<00:05:09.760> six<00:05:10.090> weeks<00:05:10.180> since<00:05:10.390> our

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
it's been about six weeks since our

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.600 
it's been about six weeks since our
dandelion<00:05:11.140> wine<00:05:11.320> has<00:05:11.560> been<00:05:11.740> fermenting<00:05:12.310> and

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
dandelion wine has been fermenting and

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.260 
dandelion wine has been fermenting and
this<00:05:13.090> balloon<00:05:13.510> got<00:05:14.470> so<00:05:14.830> huge<00:05:15.190> because<00:05:15.730> of<00:05:16.060> the

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
this balloon got so huge because of the

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.900 
this balloon got so huge because of the
off-gassing<00:05:16.870> that<00:05:17.800> several<00:05:18.250> times<00:05:18.460> I<00:05:18.640> had<00:05:18.790> to

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
off-gassing that several times I had to

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.260 
off-gassing that several times I had to
let<00:05:19.030> some<00:05:19.300> air<00:05:19.390> out<00:05:19.510> so<00:05:19.930> it<00:05:20.050> didn't<00:05:20.320> pop<00:05:20.500> but

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
let some air out so it didn't pop but

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.310 
let some air out so it didn't pop but
you<00:05:22.270> know<00:05:22.390> it's<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.690> end<00:05:22.810> of<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:22.930> process

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
you know it's the end of the process

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.690 
you know it's the end of the process
when<00:05:23.500> your<00:05:23.650> boon<00:05:23.860> is<00:05:24.480> that<00:05:26.160> so<00:05:27.160> at<00:05:27.310> this<00:05:27.400> point

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700
