skin<00:01:51.500> what<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.640> really

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
skin what this is going to do is really

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.420 
skin what this is going to do is really
exploit<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.810> accumulation<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.950> dead<00:01:56.159> skin

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
exploit that accumulation of dead skin

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.840 
exploit that accumulation of dead skin
cells<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> olive<00:01:57.450> oil<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.840> also<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
cells but the olive oil is also going to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.999 
cells but the olive oil is also going to
rehydrate<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.180> skin<00:02:00.210> as<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.810> exfoliates<00:02:01.049> so

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
rehydrate the skin as it exfoliates so

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.070 
rehydrate the skin as it exfoliates so
the<00:02:02.250> next<00:02:02.430> step

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
the next step

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.170 
the next step
