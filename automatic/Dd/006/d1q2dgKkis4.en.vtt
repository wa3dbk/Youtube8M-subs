00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.200
 so how am I 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:16.450
 have an emergency i had 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:21.070
 on the island the boat and my backpack are all carried away 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:24.119
 over here I got wet wet 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.540
 it turned out to be a very small island 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.540
 there are no trees here 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.290
 the first thing to do is not 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.079
 no panic 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.899
 panic and calmly assess the situation 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:42.940
 that is, to the coast we will assume that 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:44.800
 down we can not get for some reason 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.100
 for some reason, if it can 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.380
 get to the shores of coffee and go home 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.540
 here but for some reason we cannot 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:58.480
 to the shore to get through the necessary first 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.710
 to make a trend inventory 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.409
 there is and we have with you 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.210
 my pockets are always in my pocket 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.970
 rope is better than just 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.619
 survival bracelet there are such him him 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.499
 unravels the debt rope here it is 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:22.770
 pulled tied back then removed everything 

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:32.409
 and it does not take up much space either 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:35.109
 legs on the belt of a match in an airtight 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:40.270
 pack there tea bag lies 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:42.189
 the phone doesnâ€™t work wet 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.039
 help and call can not get out 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.499
 somehow very desirable for a long time with this not 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:52.049
 delay because I do not spend the night 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:52.049
 really want to but maybe have to 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.460
 if you crawled out of the water and that's how 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.030
 cold, you should preferably make a fire 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.030
 warm up to dry out
