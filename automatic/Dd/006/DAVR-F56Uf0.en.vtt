00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.580 
sneaky I think it's going to be the end
of<00:04:08.299> impulse<00:04:08.719> on<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.079> one<00:04:09.260> though<00:04:09.349> as<00:04:09.469> they

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
of impulse on this one though as they

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.959 
of impulse on this one though as they
try<00:04:09.799> to<00:04:09.829> go<00:04:10.069> for<00:04:10.219> broke<00:04:10.430> here<00:04:10.579> on<00:04:10.669> this<00:04:10.730> fight

sneaky<00:04:11.659> gets<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.989> exhaust<00:04:12.349> but<00:04:12.560> he<00:04:12.650> knows

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
sneaky gets the exhaust but he knows

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.349
