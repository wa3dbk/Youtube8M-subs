Scout has fallen back I think they're

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.170

going to wait for their medic to get
back<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:10.460> maybe<00:01:11.460> build<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.970> new<00:01:12.090> breeze

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
back and maybe build up a new breeze

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.440 
back and maybe build up a new breeze
it's<00:01:12.810> very<00:01:13.740> hard<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> push<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.670> from<00:01:15.330> this

is on the point he gives them double the

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.230 
is on the point he gives them double the
time<00:04:51.800> bubble<00:04:52.520> to<00:04:52.550> capture<00:04:52.880> times<00:04:53.060> this

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
time bubble to capture times this

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.610 
time bubble to capture times this
equivalence<00:04:53.690> having<00:04:53.960> two<00:04:54.110> people<00:04:54.290> on<00:04:54.530> the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
equivalence having two people on the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.020 
equivalence having two people on the
point<00:04:54.800> instead<00:04:55.010> of<00:04:55.130> one<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:55.760> if<00:04:55.820> you've<00:04:55.940> got

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
point instead of one so if you've got

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.490 
point instead of one so if you've got
two<00:04:56.180> Scouts<00:04:56.480> it's<00:04:56.690> like<00:04:56.840> half<00:04:57.050> of<00:04:57.170> your<00:04:57.260> team

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
two Scouts it's like half of your team

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.680 
two Scouts it's like half of your team
is<00:04:57.680> already<00:04:57.830> on<00:04:58.040> that<00:04:58.190> point<00:04:58.460> which<00:04:59.300> does<00:04:59.540> by

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
is already on that point which does by

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.150 
is already on that point which does by
the<00:04:59.720> rest<00:04:59.990> of<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.170> team<00:05:00.350> some<00:05:00.590> time<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:01.010> get

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
the rest of the team some time to get

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
the rest of the team some time to get
there<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.340> means<00:05:01.610> they<00:05:01.730> don't<00:05:01.910> have<00:05:02.090> to

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
there and means they don't have to

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.860 
there and means they don't have to
commit<00:05:02.420> to<00:05:02.570> staying<00:05:02.630> on<00:05:03.020> that<00:05:03.050> point<00:05:03.440> and<00:05:04.870> this

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
commit to staying on that point and this

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.120 
commit to staying on that point and this
looks<00:05:06.080> like<00:05:06.260> it's<00:05:06.410> going<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.620> be<00:05:06.680> quite<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:06.950> long

getting<00:05:24.170> a<00:05:24.350> little<00:05:24.410> bit<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.740> scouting<00:05:24.950> him<00:05:25.070> for

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
getting a little bit of scouting him for

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.100 
getting a little bit of scouting him for
that<00:05:25.340> médicas<00:05:25.730> not<00:05:25.880> following<00:05:26.270> him<00:05:26.420> and<00:05:26.600> that

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
that if he's not careful that demo man

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.680 
that if he's not careful that demo man
will<00:05:28.730> just<00:05:28.760> be<00:05:29.030> able<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.240> take<00:05:29.390> him<00:05:29.510> off<00:05:29.570> and

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
will just be able to take him off and

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.460 
will just be able to take him off and
the<00:05:29.780> medic<00:05:29.990> taking<00:05:30.260> a<00:05:30.320> few<00:05:30.500> pipes<00:05:30.740> there

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
the medic taking a few pipes there

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.540 
the medic taking a few pipes there
that's<00:05:33.470> never<00:05:33.680> a<00:05:33.770> good<00:05:33.800> thing<00:05:33.950> you<00:05:34.250> really

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
that's never a good thing you really

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.350 
that's never a good thing you really
need<00:05:34.670> to<00:05:34.910> protect<00:05:35.120> your<00:05:35.240> medical<00:05:35.570> times<00:05:35.990> and

need to protect your medical times and
saya<00:05:38.360> saya<00:05:39.130> fracture<00:05:40.130> even<00:05:40.430> a<00:05:40.670> long<00:05:41.330> way<00:05:41.510> off

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
saya saya fracture even a long way off

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.650 
saya saya fracture even a long way off
of<00:05:41.690> there<00:05:42.020> Dubai<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:42.830> a<00:05:43.150> cyan<00:05:44.150> out<00:05:44.300> definitely

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
of there Dubai and a cyan out definitely

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.450 
of there Dubai and a cyan out definitely
coming<00:05:45.110> out<00:05:45.200> to<00:05:45.350> push<00:05:45.530> then<00:05:45.920> they're<00:05:46.220> trying

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
coming out to push then they're trying

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.850 
coming out to push then they're trying
to<00:05:46.490> take<00:05:46.640> that<00:05:46.790> point<00:05:47.030> back<00:05:47.380> now<00:05:48.380> we'll<00:05:48.560> see<00:05:48.710> if

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
to take that point back now we'll see if

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.860 
to take that point back now we'll see if
if<00:05:49.120> fracture<00:05:50.120> managed<00:05:50.360> to<00:05:50.420> send<00:05:50.570> their<00:05:50.720> load

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
if fracture managed to send their load

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.240 
if fracture managed to send their load
scout<00:05:51.200> into<00:05:51.440> the<00:05:51.530> final<00:05:51.770> point<00:05:51.860> i<00:05:52.010> believe

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
scout into the final point i believe

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.800 
scout into the final point i believe
thats<00:05:52.580> i<00:05:52.700> would<00:05:53.000> have<00:05:53.090> left<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.360> Demoman

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
thats i would have left the Demoman

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.630 
thats i would have left the Demoman
there<00:05:54.080> or<00:05:54.800> something<00:05:55.070> they<00:05:55.190> haven't<00:05:55.400> managed

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
there or something they haven't managed

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.340 
there or something they haven't managed
to<00:05:55.670> think<00:05:55.850> that<00:05:55.940> point<00:05:56.150> so<00:05:56.270> if<00:05:56.510> if<00:05:56.720> indeed<00:05:57.230> they

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
to think that point so if if indeed they

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.080 
to think that point so if if indeed they
did<00:05:57.410> leave<00:05:57.710> something<00:05:58.040> there<00:05:58.220> they<00:05:58.760> only<00:05:58.910> left

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
did leave something there they only left

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.520 
did leave something there they only left
the<00:05:59.180> scout<00:05:59.450> they're<00:05:59.600> quite<00:05:59.870> risky<00:06:02.410> but<00:06:03.410> now

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
the scout they're quite risky but now

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.850 
the scout they're quite risky but now
cyanogen<00:06:04.310> to<00:06:04.430> push<00:06:04.610> that<00:06:04.790> out<00:06:05.050> but<00:06:06.050> I<00:06:06.290> think

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
cyanogen to push that out but I think

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.460 
cyanogen to push that out but I think
fracture<00:06:07.340> can<00:06:07.550> I<00:06:07.580> take<00:06:07.820> it<00:06:08.000> back<00:06:08.180> again<00:06:08.630> so

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
fracture can I take it back again so

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.400 
fracture can I take it back again so
this<00:06:09.830> is<00:06:09.860> the<00:06:10.100> third<00:06:10.310> time<00:06:10.480> but<00:06:11.480> we've<00:06:12.200> had<00:06:12.350> a

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
this is the third time but we've had a

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.170 
this is the third time but we've had a
battle<00:06:12.770> inside<00:06:13.070> this<00:06:13.250> base<00:06:13.490> and<00:06:13.790> quite

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
battle inside this base and quite

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.000 
battle inside this base and quite
frankly<00:06:14.210> I'm<00:06:14.630> getting<00:06:14.660> a<00:06:15.020> bit<00:06:15.440> bored<00:06:15.650> about

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
frankly I'm getting a bit bored about

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.820 
frankly I'm getting a bit bored about
the<00:06:16.390> these<00:06:17.390> surroundings<00:06:18.020> I<00:06:18.200> quite<00:06:18.620> like<00:06:18.800> it

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
the these surroundings I quite like it

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.860 
the these surroundings I quite like it
to<00:06:19.220> take<00:06:19.400> this<00:06:19.550> outside<00:06:19.760> and<00:06:20.240> see<00:06:20.480> if<00:06:20.570> they<00:06:20.720> can

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
to take this outside and see if they can

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.360 
to take this outside and see if they can
push<00:06:21.050> back<00:06:23.470> saya<00:06:24.470> desperately<00:06:25.040> trying<00:06:25.280> to

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
push out here right I see I now they're

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.630 
push out here right I see I now they're
building<00:06:30.560> back<00:06:30.740> up<00:06:30.770> on<00:06:31.010> their<00:06:31.130> final<00:06:31.310> point

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
building back up on their final point

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.810 
building back up on their final point
again<00:06:32.620> practice<00:06:33.620> ending<00:06:34.070> in<00:06:34.160> a<00:06:34.220> lone<00:06:34.370> scout

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
again practice ending in a lone scout

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.470 
again practice ending in a lone scout
did<00:06:35.090> the<00:06:35.210> rest<00:06:35.360> of<00:06:35.450> the<00:06:35.510> combo<00:06:35.810> go<00:06:35.930> in<00:06:37.120> nope

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.940

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
okay so sire going for another push I

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.020 
okay so sire going for another push I
don't<00:06:43.130> think<00:06:43.280> they<00:06:43.370> can<00:06:43.430> send<00:06:43.730> we've<00:06:43.820> just

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
don't think they can send we've just

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.390 
don't think they can send we've just
seen<00:06:44.150> it<00:06:44.360> they<00:06:44.600> know<00:06:44.720> eventually<00:06:45.130> if<00:06:46.130> they

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
seen it they know eventually if they

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.040 
seen it they know eventually if they
mess<00:06:46.730> up<00:06:46.880> just<00:06:47.180> once<00:06:47.390> fracture<00:06:47.870> will

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
mess up just once fracture will

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.360 
mess up just once fracture will
overpower<00:06:48.380> them<00:06:48.560> and<00:06:48.710> that<00:06:48.830> could<00:06:49.070> be<00:06:49.100> the

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
overpower them and that could be the

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.620 
overpower them and that could be the
mess<00:06:49.520> up<00:06:49.640> they've<00:06:49.790> lost<00:06:50.030> their<00:06:50.210> medic<00:06:50.510> and

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630

mess up they've lost their medic and
they're<00:06:50.900> heavy<00:06:51.080> and<00:06:51.820> a<00:06:52.820> fracture<00:06:53.180> now<00:06:53.300> pushing

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
they're heavy and a fracture now pushing

they're heavy and a fracture now pushing
the<00:06:53.960> demo<00:06:54.140> I'm<00:06:54.320> pushing<00:06:54.620> very<00:06:54.830> aggressively

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
the demo I'm pushing very aggressively

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.410 
the demo I'm pushing very aggressively
on<00:06:55.340> top<00:06:55.580> he's<00:06:55.700> going<00:06:55.820> to<00:06:55.880> get<00:06:55.970> some<00:06:56.120> stickies

on top he's going to get some stickies

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.280 
on top he's going to get some stickies
down<00:06:56.600> there<00:06:56.750> and<00:06:56.810> that's<00:06:56.960> going<00:06:57.080> to<00:06:57.140> cause
