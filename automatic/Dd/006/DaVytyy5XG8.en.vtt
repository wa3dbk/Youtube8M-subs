00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
I love it how the bio has three viewers

I love it how the bio has three viewers
they<00:00:28.800> always<00:00:29.400> watch<00:00:29.580> out<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:29.970> me<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.150> each

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
they always watch out for me in each

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.209 
they always watch out for me in each
other<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.779> very<00:00:30.840> cool<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.439> he<00:00:31.949> said<00:00:32.189> a

other it's it's very cool and he said a

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.790 
other it's it's very cool and he said a
more<00:00:32.730> scientific<00:00:33.300> proof<00:00:33.600> when<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.050> eat<00:00:34.290> when

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
studied enough and they find out that

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.249 
studied enough and they find out that
when<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.549> fucking<00:01:36.060> train<00:01:36.270> intensely<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:37.170> I

Jan<00:02:36.510> Nutrition<00:02:37.379> org<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:40.170> know<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.739> always

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
Jan Nutrition org you know I have always

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.290 
Jan Nutrition org you know I have always
felt<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:42.349> let's<00:02:43.349> face<00:02:43.560> facts<00:02:43.830> if<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:45.120> get<00:02:45.269> a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
felt that let's face facts if you get a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.050 
felt that let's face facts if you get a
thermic<00:02:45.660> effect<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:46.080> food<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:49.129> you<00:02:50.129> everytime

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
thermic effect of food and you everytime

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.990 
thermic effect of food and you everytime
you<00:02:51.390> ingest<00:02:51.750> food<00:02:52.160> protein<00:02:53.160> fibers

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
you ingest food protein fibers

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.630 
you ingest food protein fibers
carbohydrates<00:02:54.450> fats<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.950> get<00:02:56.099> a<00:02:56.129> spike<00:02:56.459> in

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
carbohydrates fats you get a spike in

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.890 
carbohydrates fats you get a spike in
metabolism<00:02:56.910> which<00:02:57.269> actually<00:02:57.599> happens

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
metabolism which actually happens

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.030 
metabolism which actually happens
because<00:02:57.989> they<00:02:58.140> call<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.409> thermic<00:02:58.709> effect<00:02:58.769> of

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
because they call the thermic effect of

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.770 
because they call the thermic effect of
food<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.519> body<00:02:59.640> speeds<00:03:00.030> its<00:03:00.150> metabolism<00:03:00.540> up

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
food the body speeds its metabolism up

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.600 
food the body speeds its metabolism up
now<00:03:01.560> if<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.750> didn't<00:03:03.750> train<00:03:04.080> at<00:03:04.650> all<00:03:04.830> did<00:03:05.459> no

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
now if you didn't train at all did no

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.339 
now if you didn't train at all did no
weight<00:03:05.819> training<00:03:06.030> no<00:03:06.239> cardio<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:07.110> eat<00:03:07.260> all

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
weight training no cardio you eat all

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.729 
weight training no cardio you eat all
your<00:03:07.470> food<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.769> one<00:03:07.860> meal<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:10.590> would

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
your food in one meal and you would

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.920 
your food in one meal and you would
probably<00:03:10.890> then<00:03:11.430> see<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:12.090> there<00:03:12.269> is<00:03:12.420> probably

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
probably then see that there is probably

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.570 
probably then see that there is probably
a<00:03:13.019> bigger<00:03:13.230> spike<00:03:13.560> eating<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.069> all<00:03:14.159> one<00:03:14.370> meal

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
a bigger spike eating it all one meal

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.160 
a bigger spike eating it all one meal
because<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.909> get<00:03:15.030> more<00:03:15.209> food<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:15.629> in<00:03:15.810> by

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
because you get more food going in by

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.190 
because you get more food going in by
trying<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.500> process<00:03:16.709> more<00:03:17.599> but<00:03:18.599> by<00:03:18.780> training

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
trying to process more but by training

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.170 
trying to process more but by training
the<00:03:19.590> body<00:03:19.830> actually<00:03:20.099> has<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.580> recover<00:03:20.940> and

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the body actually has to recover and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.759 
the body actually has to recover and
repair<00:03:21.409> now

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
repair now

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.520 
repair now
that<00:03:23.099> is<00:03:23.400> its<00:03:24.060> utmost<00:03:24.330> importance<00:03:25.110> okay<00:03:25.500> I

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
that is its utmost importance okay I

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.289 
that is its utmost importance okay I
said<00:03:25.739> your<00:03:26.010> body<00:03:26.250> doesn't<00:03:26.819> give<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.090> shit

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
whether you got to go take the dog to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.899 
whether you got to go take the dog to
the<00:03:28.530> vet<00:03:28.590> I'm<00:03:29.220> gonna<00:03:29.400> pick<00:03:29.519> up<00:03:29.610> your<00:03:29.730> track

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
training it wants to recover that's it's

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.490 
training it wants to recover that's it's
only<00:03:32.970> fucking<00:03:33.690> function<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.260> recover

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
only fucking function is to recover

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.809

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
its main thing is to recover so

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.030 
its main thing is to recover so
immediately<00:03:42.930> it's<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.409> now<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.620> mean<00:03:43.709> like<00:03:43.950> the

immediately it's so now I mean like the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.490 
immediately it's so now I mean like the
fucking<00:03:44.400> second<00:03:44.849> you're<00:03:44.970> done<00:03:45.299> with<00:03:46.110> fucking

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
fucking second you're done with fucking

fucking second you're done with fucking
training<00:03:46.860> your<00:03:47.310> body's<00:03:47.580> not<00:03:47.760> getting<00:03:47.970> this

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
training your body's not getting this

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.490

thickness<00:03:48.269> anymore<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.720> break<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.080> down<00:03:49.230> to

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
thickness anymore to break it down to

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.720 
thickness anymore to break it down to
break<00:03:49.650> down<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.830> muscle<00:03:49.980> tissue<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.430> fucking

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
break down the muscle tissue to fucking

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.920

to<00:03:51.269> be<00:03:51.390> killing<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.230> in<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.439> gym<00:03:53.750> your<00:03:54.750> body

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
to be killing it in the gym your body

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.539 
to be killing it in the gym your body
starts<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.319> recover<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:56.220> starts<00:03:56.459> at

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
starts to recover and it starts at

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.860 
starts to recover and it starts at
recovery<00:03:56.879> process<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.390> wants<00:03:57.599> to<00:03:57.659> recover

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
recovery process and it wants to recover

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.170 
recovery process and it wants to recover
as<00:03:58.049> fast<00:03:58.080> as<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.680> humanly<00:03:58.830> possible<00:03:59.549> if<00:03:59.819> you're

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
waiting it doesn't keep recovering if I

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.280 
waiting it doesn't keep recovering if I
can<00:04:08.549> stops<00:04:08.879> it<00:04:09.390> stops<00:04:09.689> recovery<00:04:10.019> starts

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290

breaking<00:04:10.560> down<00:04:10.680> other<00:04:11.069> tissues<00:04:11.700> let's<00:04:12.120> try<00:04:12.269> to

breaking down other tissues let's try to

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.030 
breaking down other tissues let's try to
recover<00:04:12.659> so<00:04:13.140> it's<00:04:13.230> changing<00:04:13.650> your<00:04:13.769> hormonal

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040

the bodies of living organism that's

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.110 
the bodies of living organism that's
constantly<00:04:34.470> changing<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:34.950> adapting<00:04:35.130> every

something<00:04:37.980> it's<00:04:38.460> never<00:04:38.640> just<00:04:38.880> sitting<00:04:39.210> there

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
something it's never just sitting there

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.550 
something it's never just sitting there

going<00:04:40.890> on<00:04:41.040> doesn't<00:04:41.490> mean<00:04:41.640> it's<00:04:41.880> not<00:04:42.030> going<00:04:42.330> on

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
going on doesn't mean it's not going on

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.740 
going on doesn't mean it's not going on
okay<00:04:43.230> now<00:04:44.180> going<00:04:45.180> back<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:45.450> what<00:04:45.540> I<00:04:45.570> said<00:04:45.690> about

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
okay now going back to what I said about

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.290 
okay now going back to what I said about
the<00:04:45.990> recovery<00:04:46.350> as<00:04:46.470> it's<00:04:46.860> recovering<00:04:47.400> okay

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
the recovery as it's recovering okay

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.510 
the recovery as it's recovering okay
it<00:04:48.900> wants<00:04:49.140> to<00:04:49.170> recover<00:04:49.440> fast<00:04:49.770> if<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.190> protein

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
it wants to recover fast if the protein

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.370 
it wants to recover fast if the protein
is<00:04:50.670> there<00:04:50.820> it's<00:04:50.910> gonna<00:04:51.030> recover<00:04:51.330> faster<00:04:52.050> okay

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
is there it's gonna recover faster okay

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.230 
is there it's gonna recover faster okay
now<00:04:52.860> what<00:04:53.010> happens<00:04:53.280> is<00:04:53.370> as<00:04:53.520> its<00:04:53.730> recovering

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
now what happens is as its recovering

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.110 
now what happens is as its recovering
and<00:04:54.390> using<00:04:54.690> that<00:04:54.780> protein<00:04:55.250> you<00:04:56.250> feed<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.640> again

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
and using that protein you feed it again

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.610 
and using that protein you feed it again
it<00:04:57.420> keeps<00:04:57.630> recovering<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.200> you<00:04:58.260> feed<00:04:58.500> it

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
it keeps recovering and you feed it

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.750 
it keeps recovering and you feed it
again<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:58.920> it<00:04:58.980> keeps<00:04:59.130> your<00:04:59.190> covering<00:04:59.460> now

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
again and it keeps your covering now

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.310 
again and it keeps your covering now
what<00:04:59.940> happens<00:05:00.180> is<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.360> recover<00:05:00.630> faster<00:05:00.960> you

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
what happens is you recover faster you

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.680 
what happens is you recover faster you
build<00:05:01.560> muscle<00:05:01.980> okay<00:05:02.640> now<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.270> muscle<00:05:03.660> that

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
build muscle okay now the muscle that

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.850 
build muscle okay now the muscle that
you've<00:05:03.930> built<00:05:04.140> of<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.410> muscle<00:05:04.650> that<00:05:04.680> you've

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
you've built of the muscle that you've

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.830 
you've built of the muscle that you've
maintained<00:05:05.280> when<00:05:05.550> one<00:05:05.880> way<00:05:06.000> or<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.180> other<00:05:06.210> has

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
maintained when one way or the other has

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.900 
maintained when one way or the other has
metabolically<00:05:07.650> active<00:05:07.770> tissue<00:05:08.130> muscle

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
metabolically active tissue muscle

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.010 
metabolically active tissue muscle
tissue<00:05:09.090> okay

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
tissue okay

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.210 
tissue okay
hence<00:05:10.440> you're<00:05:10.650> keeping<00:05:11.010> your<00:05:11.130> metabolism

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
hence you're keeping your metabolism

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.280 
hence you're keeping your metabolism
instead<00:05:12.090> of<00:05:12.180> tearing<00:05:12.480> it<00:05:12.570> down<00:05:12.600> or<00:05:12.990> if<00:05:13.170> you're

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
instead of tearing it down or if you're

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.420 
instead of tearing it down or if you're
building<00:05:13.410> muscle<00:05:13.650> you<00:05:13.860> know<00:05:13.950> increasing

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
building muscle you know increasing

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.830 
building muscle you know increasing
metabolism<00:05:14.520> because<00:05:15.330> you're<00:05:15.480> more

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
metabolism because you're more

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.650 
metabolism because you're more
metabolically<00:05:16.380> active<00:05:16.470> tissue<00:05:17.540> but<00:05:18.540> if

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
metabolically active tissue but if

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.850 
metabolically active tissue but if
you're<00:05:18.810> waiting<00:05:19.020> till<00:05:19.290> the<00:05:19.380> end<00:05:19.560> of<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.710> day

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
you're waiting till the end of the day

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.950 
you're waiting till the end of the day
to<00:05:19.920> feed<00:05:20.250> all<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:20.610> all<00:05:21.090> that<00:05:21.120> food<00:05:21.570> in<00:05:21.720> there

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
to feed all that all that food in there

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.410 
to feed all that all that food in there
yes<00:05:22.950> you're<00:05:23.310> not<00:05:23.340> gonna<00:05:23.730> get<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:23.970> mean<00:05:24.210> you<00:05:24.330> may

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
yes you're not gonna get a mean you may

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.420 
yes you're not gonna get a mean you may
take<00:05:24.690> you<00:05:24.840> days<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.860> finally<00:05:26.130> get<00:05:26.250> all<00:05:26.310> that

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
take you days to finally get all that

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.430 
take you days to finally get all that
food<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:26.730> you'll<00:05:26.820> use<00:05:27.030> it<00:05:27.180> all<00:05:27.270> but<00:05:28.050> why<00:05:28.380> do

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
food and you'll use it all but why do

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.870 
food and you'll use it all but why do
you<00:05:28.650> think<00:05:28.740> you<00:05:28.980> guys<00:05:29.130> are<00:05:29.160> getting<00:05:29.340> such<00:05:29.610> slow

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
you think you guys are getting such slow

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.910 
you think you guys are getting such slow
gains<00:05:30.150> you're<00:05:30.810> stopping<00:05:31.170> your<00:05:31.440> own<00:05:31.590> gains

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
gains you're stopping your own gains

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.700 
gains you're stopping your own gains
like<00:05:32.160> it's<00:05:32.550> it's<00:05:33.090> I<00:05:33.240> mean<00:05:33.660> it<00:05:33.780> is<00:05:33.990> flat-out<00:05:34.530> I

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
like it's it's I mean it is flat-out I

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.140 
like it's it's I mean it is flat-out I
don't<00:05:34.920> give<00:05:35.010> a<00:05:35.040> fuck<00:05:35.220> about<00:05:35.280> these<00:05:35.550> scientists

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
don't give a fuck about these scientists

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.400 
don't give a fuck about these scientists
and<00:05:36.300> what<00:05:36.390> they<00:05:36.480> did<00:05:36.690> if<00:05:37.050> you<00:05:37.080> look<00:05:37.260> at<00:05:37.320> the

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
and what they did if you look at the

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.650 
and what they did if you look at the
basic<00:05:37.620> biochemistry<00:05:38.100> and<00:05:38.790> you<00:05:39.030> guys<00:05:39.180> tell<00:05:39.450> you

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
basic biochemistry and you guys tell you

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.330 
basic biochemistry and you guys tell you
the<00:05:39.810> science<00:05:40.230> is<00:05:40.320> so<00:05:40.470> cute<00:05:40.710> fuck<00:05:40.980> you<00:05:41.190> all

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
the science is so cute fuck you all

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.830 
the science is so cute fuck you all
right<00:05:41.400> and<00:05:41.850> what<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.060> fucking<00:05:42.390> science<00:05:42.690> class

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
right and what the fucking science class

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.970 
right and what the fucking science class
and<00:05:43.110> I'm<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.440> one<00:05:43.590> that's<00:05:43.740> what<00:05:43.860> kept

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
and I'm the one that's what kept

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.230 
and I'm the one that's what kept
producing<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.370> result<00:05:44.670> so<00:05:44.940> I<00:05:44.970> think<00:05:45.060> I

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
producing the result so I think I

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.240 
producing the result so I think I
probably<00:05:45.570> have<00:05:45.870> a<00:05:45.900> better<00:05:46.140> grasp<00:05:46.350> on<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.770> than

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
probably have a better grasp on it than

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.050 
probably have a better grasp on it than
you<00:05:47.400> do<00:05:47.550> okay

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
you do okay

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.580 
you do okay
doesn't<00:05:48.660> take<00:05:48.780> fucking<00:05:49.080> steroids<00:05:49.290> against

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
doesn't take fucking steroids against

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.530 
doesn't take fucking steroids against
results<00:05:50.010> it<00:05:50.100> takes<00:05:50.250> fucking<00:05:50.550> logic<00:05:50.940> a<00:05:51.090> little

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
results it takes fucking logic a little

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.850 
results it takes fucking logic a little
bit<00:05:51.630> of<00:05:51.720> knowledge<00:05:51.840> about<00:05:52.080> fucking<00:05:52.560> science

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
bit of knowledge about fucking science

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.960 
bit of knowledge about fucking science
and<00:05:52.980> how<00:05:53.070> it<00:05:53.190> works<00:05:53.370> and<00:05:53.460> then<00:05:53.610> a<00:05:53.640> fucking

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
and how it works and then a fucking

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.100 
and how it works and then a fucking
whole<00:05:54.090> bunch<00:05:54.270> of<00:05:54.330> bro<00:05:54.480> science<00:05:54.660> throw<00:05:54.930> it<00:05:55.020> in

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
whole bunch of bro science throw it in

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.480 
whole bunch of bro science throw it in
there<00:05:55.230> and<00:05:55.380> I<00:05:55.680> know<00:05:55.770> people<00:05:55.950> will<00:05:56.160> bitch<00:05:56.340> and

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
but you know what it's working for the

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.100 
but you know what it's working for the
best<00:05:59.640> in<00:05:59.820> the<00:05:59.910> fucking<00:06:00.240> world<00:06:00.450> and<00:06:00.720> those<00:06:00.840> best
