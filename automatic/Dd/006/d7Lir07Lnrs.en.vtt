00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
popped up when I was on that wrong but I

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.890 
popped up when I was on that wrong but I
was<00:02:41.609> routed<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.299> had<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> custom<00:02:42.780> recovery

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
was routed and I had a custom recovery

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.440 
was routed and I had a custom recovery
and<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.739> was<00:02:43.859> on<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> custom<00:02:44.340> ROM<00:02:44.519> so<00:02:44.849> it<00:02:45.239> was

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
and I was on the custom ROM so it was

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.500 
and I was on the custom ROM so it was
gonna<00:02:45.659> reject<00:02:46.140> no<00:02:46.470> matter<00:02:46.650> what<00:02:49.489> so<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
gonna reject no matter what so and the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.240 
gonna reject no matter what so and the
coolest<00:02:51.840> thing<00:02:51.959> about<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.349> is<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.709> it's<00:02:53.099> not

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
coolest thing about it is that it's not

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.849 
coolest thing about it is that it's not
one<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.459> those<00:02:53.609> ones<00:02:53.879> where<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.239> tried<00:02:54.569> to

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
one of those ones where it tried to

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.080 
one of those ones where it tried to
install<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:56.010> update<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.459> bricked<00:02:56.700> your<00:02:56.879> phone

it<00:02:57.780> didn't<00:02:58.170> wipe<00:02:58.379> out<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.889> system<00:02:59.250> first<00:02:59.579> try

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
it didn't wipe out the system first try

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.080 
it didn't wipe out the system first try
to<00:03:00.389> apply<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.840> update<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.769> then<00:03:02.310> patch<00:03:02.790> and
