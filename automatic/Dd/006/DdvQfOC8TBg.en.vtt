what<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:09.850> think<00:01:10.270> about<00:01:10.770> tuning<00:01:11.770> tuning<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:13.119> such

what I think about tuning tuning is such

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.550 
what I think about tuning tuning is such
an<00:01:13.659> important<00:01:15.119> point<00:01:16.119> in<00:01:16.570> every<00:01:17.049> single<00:01:17.290> turn

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
an important point in every single turn

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.270 
an important point in every single turn
a<00:01:17.619> player<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:19.060> first<00:01:19.390> step<00:01:20.080> that<00:01:20.409> I<00:01:20.740> like<00:01:21.100> to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280

do<00:01:21.460> when<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.270> practice<00:01:22.750> intonation<00:01:23.140> is<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.880> know

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
do when I practice intonation is to know

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.120 
do when I practice intonation is to know
how<00:01:26.190> my<00:01:27.190> clarinet<00:01:27.580> works<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.360> I<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.470> how<00:01:29.770> I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
for instance what I do is that they have

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.469 
for instance what I do is that they have
two<00:01:34.000> tuners<00:01:34.390> or<00:01:34.630> two<00:01:35.020> iPads<00:01:35.380> I<00:01:35.710> use<00:01:36.610> one<00:01:37.000> with

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
two tuners or two iPads I use one with

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.690 
two tuners or two iPads I use one with
sound<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:38.140> use<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.679> other<00:01:38.800> one<00:01:39.039> with<00:01:39.310> tuning

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
sound I use the other one with tuning

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.600 
sound I use the other one with tuning
and<00:01:40.509> what<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:40.720> really<00:01:41.080> do<00:01:41.259> is<00:01:41.470> that<00:01:42.070> I<00:01:42.310> want<00:01:42.520> to

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
playing that is completely in tune for

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.399 
playing that is completely in tune for
that<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:49.960> will<00:01:50.080> give<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.679> four<00:01:51.280> five<00:01:52.030> tries<00:01:52.479> so

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
that I will give it four five tries so

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.219

what<00:01:53.590> I'm<00:01:53.710> doing<00:01:53.740> every<00:01:54.130> day<00:01:54.280> is<00:01:54.759> actually<00:01:55.600> to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
what I'm doing every day is actually to

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.880 
what I'm doing every day is actually to
train<00:01:56.710> my<00:01:57.159> brain<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:58.060> get<00:01:58.270> used<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.990> be<00:01:59.500> in<00:01:59.649> tune

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
train my brain to get used to be in tune

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.070 
train my brain to get used to be in tune
I'm<00:02:00.429> gonna<00:02:00.610> do<00:02:00.789> it<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.940> little<00:02:01.060> bit<00:02:01.270> again<00:02:01.840> for

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
I'm gonna do it a little bit again for

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:11.080 
I'm gonna do it a little bit again for
you<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:03.700> play<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.390> sound

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:25.940 

that<00:02:12.090> was<00:02:12.210> too<00:02:12.330> sharp

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.130 

you<00:02:26.950> see<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.250> other<00:02:27.400> ones<00:02:27.489> were<00:02:28.209> much<00:02:28.480> better

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
you see the other ones were much better

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.360 
you see the other ones were much better
so<00:02:29.560> as<00:02:30.010> musicians<00:02:30.819> we<00:02:31.560> improve<00:02:32.560> we<00:02:33.010> get<00:02:33.159> much

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
so as musicians we improve we get much

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.699 
so as musicians we improve we get much
better<00:02:33.700> through<00:02:34.450> practicing<00:02:35.140> constantly

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
better through practicing constantly

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.720 
better through practicing constantly
this<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.670> best<00:02:36.879> way<00:02:37.560> for<00:02:38.560> me<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:39.040> know<00:02:39.430> how

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
this is the best way for me to know how

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.110 
this is the best way for me to know how
my<00:02:40.540> clarinet<00:02:40.959> is<00:02:41.260> working<00:02:42.099> if<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.879> note

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
my clarinet is working if that note

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.399 
my clarinet is working if that note
tends<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.870> be<00:02:44.019> higher<00:02:44.260> or<00:02:45.099> flatter<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:47.230> other

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
tends to be higher or flatter the other

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.470 
tends to be higher or flatter the other
thing<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.860> do<00:02:47.920> once<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.849> practice<00:02:49.269> this

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
thing that I do once I practice this

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.410 
thing that I do once I practice this
like<00:02:49.659> half<00:02:49.989> an<00:02:50.140> hour<00:02:50.230> everyday<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:51.670> every

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
like half an hour everyday like every

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.039 
like half an hour everyday like every
hour<00:02:53.099> I<00:02:54.099> will<00:02:54.579> put<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:54.970> same<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.750> will<00:02:55.900> play

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
hour I will put the same and I will play

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.149 
hour I will put the same and I will play
some<00:02:56.319> of<00:02:56.379> the<00:02:56.590> notes<00:02:56.769> that<00:02:56.829> i'm<00:02:56.980> playing

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
some of the notes that i'm playing

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.390 
some of the notes that i'm playing
during<00:02:57.609> every<00:02:58.090> piece<00:02:58.269> so<00:02:58.930> my<00:02:59.170> brain<00:02:59.530> gets<00:02:59.950> used

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
during every piece so my brain gets used

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.770 
during every piece so my brain gets used
to<00:03:00.879> play<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.269> tune

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
to play in tune

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.210 
to play in tune
usually<00:03:02.650> it's<00:03:02.889> so<00:03:03.069> easy<00:03:03.310> because<00:03:03.790> we<00:03:04.629> play

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
usually it's so easy because we play

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.930 
usually it's so easy because we play
eight<00:03:06.720> pieces<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.260> we<00:03:08.680> try<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.010> get<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.700> best

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
eight pieces and we try to get the best

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.170 
eight pieces and we try to get the best
sound<00:03:10.569> possible<00:03:10.750> with<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.530> clarinet

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
sound possible with the clarinet

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.559 
sound possible with the clarinet
sometimes<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:14.190> great<00:03:15.190> sound<00:03:15.609> is<00:03:16.150> really

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
sometimes that great sound is really

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.680 
sometimes that great sound is really
sharp<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:17.170> when<00:03:18.069> we<00:03:18.489> get<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.849> play<00:03:19.030> with

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
sharp so when we get to play with

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.490 
sharp so when we get to play with
chamber<00:03:20.349> music<00:03:20.620> or<00:03:21.120> solo<00:03:22.120> or<00:03:22.510> with<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:22.989> member

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
chamber music or solo or with a member

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.490 
chamber music or solo or with a member
of<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.739> orchestra<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.489> have<00:03:25.299> as<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:26.079> student

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
of the orchestra you have as a student

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.449 
of the orchestra you have as a student
have<00:03:27.370> lots<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:27.909> problems<00:03:28.420> trying<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.459> suite

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
have lots of problems trying to suite

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.449 
have lots of problems trying to suite
your<00:03:30.819> sound<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:32.049> is<00:03:32.169> the<00:03:32.199> sound<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:33.099> totally

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
your sound that is the sound is totally

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.210 
your sound that is the sound is totally
in<00:03:33.519> tune<00:03:33.549> so<00:03:34.419> that's<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.900> way<00:03:35.079> that<00:03:35.769> I<00:03:35.799> usually

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
in tune so that's the way that I usually

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:51.830 
in tune so that's the way that I usually
play<00:03:36.970> all<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.319> concertos<00:03:38.980> like<00:03:39.639> on<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.180> tuner
