00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
probably play it but I think

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.090 
probably play it but I think
a lot<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.960> people<00:02:13.230> feel<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.620> way<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.830> mean<00:02:14.010> if

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
a lot of people feel this way I mean if

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.830 
a lot of people feel this way I mean if
they're<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:14.340> gonna<00:02:14.490> release<00:02:14.850> some<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.570> couple

they're just gonna release some a couple

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.900 
they're just gonna release some a couple
of<00:02:15.930> good<00:02:16.050> cards<00:02:16.470> maybe<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.800> few<00:02:17.310> reprints<00:02:17.760> enter

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910

of good cards maybe a few reprints enter
here<00:02:18.210> there<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.600> don't<00:02:19.050> think<00:02:19.260> people<00:02:19.410> are

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
here there I don't think people are

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.860 
here there I don't think people are

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
going to take the time to really dig

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.330 
going to take the time to really dig
into<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.200> deck<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.590> start<00:02:22.710> trying<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.160> play

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
into the deck and start trying to play

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.650 
into the deck and start trying to play
it<00:02:23.370> without<00:02:23.610> shadows<00:02:24.030> he's<00:02:24.240> just<00:02:24.510> that

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
it without shadows he's just that

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.420 
it without shadows he's just that
important<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.290> archetype<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.220> really

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
important to the archetype and it really

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.190 
important to the archetype and it really
just<00:02:26.700> seems<00:02:26.910> like<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.150> horrendous<00:02:27.750> business

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
just seems like a horrendous business

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.990 
just seems like a horrendous business
move<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.680> release<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.130> product<00:02:29.550> with<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.730> card

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
move to release this product with a card

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.820 
move to release this product with a card
that<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.480> pretty<00:02:30.750> integral<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> deck

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
that is pretty integral to the deck

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.560 
that is pretty integral to the deck
still<00:02:32.160> being<00:02:32.460> out<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.910> game<00:02:33.090> especially

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
still being out of the game especially

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.080 
still being out of the game especially
when<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.290> legal<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.710> Japan<00:02:35.100> like<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.940> would

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
when it's legal in Japan like you would

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.060 
when it's legal in Japan like you would
then<00:02:36.240> create<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.750> huge<00:02:37.170> disparity<00:02:37.470> where

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
then create this huge disparity where

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.190 
then create this huge disparity where
the<00:02:38.610> product<00:02:39.030> might<00:02:39.210> sell<00:02:39.510> really<00:02:39.840> well<00:02:39.960> in

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
the product might sell really well in

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.560 
the product might sell really well in
Japan<00:02:40.350> but<00:02:40.980> really<00:02:41.460> poorly<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> TCG

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
Japan but really poorly in the TCG

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.630 
Japan but really poorly in the TCG
because<00:02:42.900> there's<00:02:43.530> not<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:43.740> lot<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:43.980> hype<00:02:44.190> for<00:02:44.520> it

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
because there's not a lot of hype for it

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.250 
because there's not a lot of hype for it
because<00:02:44.910> people<00:02:45.210> know<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.600> their<00:02:45.780> ace<00:02:45.930> card

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
because people know that their ace card

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.050 
because people know that their ace card
is<00:02:46.380> still<00:02:46.530> gone<00:02:46.740> so<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.250> don't<00:02:47.790> think<00:02:47.940> that

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
is still gone so I don't think that

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.120 
is still gone so I don't think that
Konami<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.660> even<00:02:49.140> gonna<00:02:49.260> let<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:49.680> become<00:02:50.100> a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
Konami is even gonna let this become a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.340 
Konami is even gonna let this become a
possibility<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.970> think<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.990> might<00:02:52.170> even

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
possibility I think that you might even

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.890 
possibility I think that you might even
see<00:02:52.650> Konami<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.370> Japan<00:02:53.730> who<00:02:53.970> really<00:02:54.450> owned<00:02:54.690> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
see Konami of Japan who really owned the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.290 
see Konami of Japan who really owned the
game<00:02:55.080> kind<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.560> forced<00:02:55.860> Konami<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.400> America<00:02:56.850> to

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
game kind of forced Konami of America to

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.600 
game kind of forced Konami of America to
unban<00:02:58.020> shadows<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.620> mean<00:02:58.770> just<00:02:59.100> for<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.400> sake

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
unban shadows I mean just for the sake

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.580 
unban shadows I mean just for the sake
of<00:02:59.640> sales<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:00.360> let<00:03:00.930> me<00:03:01.020> know<00:03:01.140> what<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.410> guys

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
of sales so let me know what you guys

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.710 
of sales so let me know what you guys
think<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.190> think<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:03.000> shadows<00:03:03.360> could<00:03:03.630> have

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
think I think that shadows could have

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.360 
think I think that shadows could have
been<00:03:03.810> one<00:03:03.960> of<00:03:04.050> those<00:03:04.140> cards<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.620> was<00:03:05.010> put<00:03:05.280> on

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
been one of those cards that was put on

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.340 
been one of those cards that was put on
the<00:03:05.460> banlist<00:03:05.850> much<00:03:06.420> like<00:03:06.630> tsuki<00:03:06.960> you<00:03:07.110> need
