from<00:02:39.770> Drive<00:02:40.040> into<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.580> sport<00:02:40.880> shift<00:02:41.120> area

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
from Drive into the sport shift area

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.540 
from Drive into the sport shift area
then<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.350> can<00:02:42.500> push<00:02:42.770> it<00:02:42.920> forward<00:02:43.310> to

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
then you can push it forward to

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.310 
then you can push it forward to
downshift<00:02:43.730> or<00:02:44.360> pull<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.570> back<00:02:44.840> for<00:02:45.200> up

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
downshift or pull it back for up

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.500 
downshift or pull it back for up
shifting<00:02:45.740> this<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.580> really<00:02:46.880> important<00:02:47.330> if<00:02:47.420> you

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
shifting this is really important if you

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.910 
shifting this is really important if you
live<00:02:47.720> in<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.900> area<00:02:48.260> with<00:02:48.380> steep<00:02:48.620> hills

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
live in the area with steep hills

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.250 
live in the area with steep hills
because<00:02:49.730> second<00:02:50.270> gear<00:02:50.450> isn't<00:02:50.720> enough<00:02:50.960> to<00:02:51.080> hold

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
because second gear isn't enough to hold

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.380 
because second gear isn't enough to hold
you<00:02:51.440> going<00:02:51.740> downhill<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.430> really<00:02:53.000> need<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.300> be

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
you going downhill you really need to be

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.630 
you going downhill you really need to be
able<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.660> access<00:02:53.900> first<00:02:54.500> gear<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.040> this

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
able to access first gear and this

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.410 
able to access first gear and this
transmission<00:02:56.270> lets<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:56.780> do<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:59.060> second

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
transmission lets you do that the second

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.360 
transmission lets you do that the second

make a decent sized cargo area of about
71<00:03:03.950> cubic<00:03:04.160> feet<00:03:04.520> let's<00:03:05.450> see<00:03:05.600> how<00:03:05.720> these<00:03:05.870> work

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
71 cubic feet let's see how these work

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.420 
71 cubic feet let's see how these work
first<00:03:07.490> all<00:03:07.640> we<00:03:07.760> do<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:08.060> just<00:03:08.240> pull<00:03:08.450> on<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.690> tap

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
first all we do is just pull on the tap

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.180 
first all we do is just pull on the tap
fold<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.550> seat<00:03:10.760> bottom<00:03:11.030> into<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.750> front<00:03:11.990> seat

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
fold the seat bottom into the front seat

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.610 
fold the seat bottom into the front seat
then<00:03:13.190> lift<00:03:13.520> up<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.880> seat<00:03:14.090> back<00:03:14.240> adjuster<00:03:14.840> and

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
then lift up a seat back adjuster and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.790 
then lift up a seat back adjuster and
that<00:03:16.220> folds<00:03:16.550> flat<00:03:16.870> then<00:03:17.870> we<00:03:18.050> go<00:03:18.200> around<00:03:18.320> back

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
that folds flat then we go around back

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.360 
that folds flat then we go around back
open<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.880> rear<00:03:20.060> deck<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.810> then<00:03:21.710> I'm<00:03:21.860> back<00:03:22.070> all

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
open the rear deck and then I'm back all

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.280 
open the rear deck and then I'm back all
you<00:03:22.550> have<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.850> do<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.120> pull<00:03:23.330> on<00:03:23.480> these<00:03:23.630> tabs<00:03:23.930> to

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
you have to do is pull on these tabs to

you have to do is pull on these tabs to
let<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.770> rear<00:03:24.980> seatbacks<00:03:25.430> down<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:26.410> that's

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
let the rear seatbacks down and that's

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:35.699 
let the rear seatbacks down and that's
all<00:03:27.620> there<00:03:27.800> is<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:28.100> it

is rather aggressive meaning that if you

is rather aggressive meaning that if you
just<00:03:55.640> give<00:03:55.819> it<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:55.970> little<00:03:56.150> bit<00:03:56.360> of<00:03:56.510> gas<00:03:57.190> it

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
just give it a little bit of gas it

just give it a little bit of gas it
tends<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:58.489> jump<00:03:59.000> out<00:03:59.180> abruptly<00:03:59.630> so<00:04:00.319> I<00:04:00.380> predict

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
tends to jump out abruptly so I predict

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.650 
tends to jump out abruptly so I predict
that<00:04:00.980> owners<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.880> this<00:04:01.970> car<00:04:02.180> will<00:04:02.420> soon

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
that owners of this car will soon

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.720 
that owners of this car will soon
develop<00:04:03.049> a<00:04:03.170> very<00:04:03.349> sensitive<00:04:03.830> right<00:04:04.130> foot<00:04:04.430> the

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
develop a very sensitive right foot the

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.490 
develop a very sensitive right foot the
reason<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.209> so<00:04:05.510> much<00:04:05.629> fun<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:05.959> drive<00:04:06.110> is

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
reason this is so much fun to drive is

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.860 
reason this is so much fun to drive is
because<00:04:06.890> it's<00:04:07.640> a<00:04:07.760> lot<00:04:07.940> lighter<00:04:08.209> weight<00:04:08.360> than

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
because it's a lot lighter weight than

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.589 
because it's a lot lighter weight than
most<00:04:09.049> minivans<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:09.920> it's<00:04:10.730> easy<00:04:10.910> to<00:04:11.150> maneuver

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
most minivans and it's easy to maneuver

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.960 
most minivans and it's easy to maneuver
in<00:04:11.720> park<00:04:12.019> and<00:04:12.319> also<00:04:13.069> just<00:04:13.370> handles<00:04:13.760> better

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
in park and also just handles better

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.629 
in park and also just handles better
because<00:04:14.269> of<00:04:14.390> its<00:04:14.540> lighter<00:04:14.750> weight<00:04:15.049> in<00:04:15.639> fact

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
because of its lighter weight in fact

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.640 
because of its lighter weight in fact
when<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:16.850> comes<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.269> handling<00:04:17.660> and<00:04:18.019> cornering
