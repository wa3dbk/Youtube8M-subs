ended<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.869> wounding<00:01:37.770> ku<00:01:37.979> were<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.970> Draenei

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
ended up wounding ku were the Draenei

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.840 
ended up wounding ku were the Draenei
then<00:01:39.659> left<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> ship<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.500> buried<00:01:41.159> war<00:01:41.520> in

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
then left the ship they buried war in

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.850 
then left the ship they buried war in
aachen<00:01:42.450> dune<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.810> they<00:01:43.380> essentially<00:01:43.740> just

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
aachen dune and they essentially just

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.620 
aachen dune and they essentially just
colonized<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.579> planets<00:01:44.970> they<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.210> course<00:01:45.360> met

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
colonized the planets they of course met

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.359 
colonized the planets they of course met
the<00:01:45.780> orcs<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.290> they<00:01:46.470> didn't<00:01:46.710> fight<00:01:46.890> initially

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the orcs and they didn't fight initially

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.639 
the orcs and they didn't fight initially
they<00:01:47.490> were<00:01:47.579> actually<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.149> not<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.259> wouldn't<00:01:49.560> say

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
they were actually on not I wouldn't say

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.740 
they were actually on not I wouldn't say
great<00:01:49.860> terms<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.369> they<00:01:50.520> traded<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.360> they<00:01:51.600> had

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
great terms but they traded and they had

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.730 
great terms but they traded and they had
a<00:01:51.780> decent<00:01:52.110> rapport

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
a decent rapport

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.010 
a decent rapport
so<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.700> orcs<00:01:54.030> actually<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> very

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
so the orcs actually have a very

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.620 
so the orcs actually have a very
different<00:01:55.649> meaning<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.759> ship<00:01:57.030> they

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
different meaning for this ship they

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.569 
different meaning for this ship they
thought<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.049> was<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> sacred<00:01:58.920> mountain<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
thought it was a sacred mountain and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.480 
thought it was a sacred mountain and
they<00:01:59.700> called<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.119> Oh<00:02:00.210> shoo<00:02:00.420> gum<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:02.159> explain

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
they called it Oh shoo gum so to explain

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.859 
they called it Oh shoo gum so to explain
why<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.700> all<00:02:03.000> happened<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.420> first<00:02:03.689> need<00:02:03.810> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
why this all happened I first need to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.719 
why this all happened I first need to
talk<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> little<00:02:04.290> bit<00:02:04.469> about<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.799> Naru<00:02:04.979> when<00:02:05.610> an

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
talk a little bit about the Naru when an

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.190 
talk a little bit about the Naru when an
arrow<00:02:05.909> was<00:02:06.060> severely<00:02:06.390> damaged<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.079> point

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
arrow was severely damaged to the point

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.249 
arrow was severely damaged to the point

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
of being an in near death near a state

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.999 
of being an in near death near a state
called<00:02:10.470> void

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
called void

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.980 
called void
they<00:02:11.670> basically<00:02:11.970> absorbed

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
they basically absorbed

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.720 
they basically absorbed
Souls<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.530> vacuum<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.430> preserve

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
Souls like a vacuum to preserve

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.760 
Souls like a vacuum to preserve
themselves<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.930> meant<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.410> spirits

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
themselves this meant that the spirits

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.740 
themselves this meant that the spirits
of<00:02:16.890> dead<00:02:17.040> orcs<00:02:17.340> were<00:02:17.700> drawn<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.390> mountain

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
of dead orcs were drawn to the mountain

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.690 
of dead orcs were drawn to the mountain
where<00:02:19.020> they<00:02:19.230> would<00:02:19.380> essentially<00:02:19.770> be<00:02:20.100> consumed

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
where they would essentially be consumed

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.180 
where they would essentially be consumed
by<00:02:20.970> cooler<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:22.170> cooler<00:02:22.470> ended<00:02:22.890> up<00:02:22.980> actually

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
by cooler so cooler ended up actually

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.920 
by cooler so cooler ended up actually
manipulated<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.150> orcish<00:02:24.450> religion<00:02:24.900> a

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
manipulated in the orcish religion a

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.990 
manipulated in the orcish religion a
little<00:02:25.260> bit<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.160> they<00:02:26.250> would<00:02:26.520> be<00:02:26.550> able<00:02:26.850> to

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
little bit so that they would be able to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.030 
little bit so that they would be able to
sustain<00:02:27.330> him<00:02:27.750> through<00:02:27.960> things<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.010> know

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
sustain him through things like you know

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.370 
sustain him through things like you know
blessed<00:02:29.430> water<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.090> offerings<00:02:30.810> essentially

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
blessed water and offerings essentially

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.950 
blessed water and offerings essentially
and<00:02:31.850> because<00:02:32.850> these<00:02:33.180> offerings<00:02:33.570> were<00:02:33.720> able<00:02:33.930> to

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
and because these offerings were able to

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.690 
and because these offerings were able to
sustain<00:02:34.200> him<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.650> meant<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.100> he<00:02:35.190> wouldn't

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
sustain him it meant that he wouldn't

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.910 
sustain him it meant that he wouldn't
suck<00:02:36.120> up<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.570> spirits<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.290> dead<00:02:37.410> orcs<00:02:37.710> and

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
suck up the spirits of dead orcs and

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.490 
suck up the spirits of dead orcs and
destroy<00:02:38.370> them<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:39.330> seems<00:02:39.720> like<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.080> actual

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
destroy them it seems like the actual

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.770 
destroy them it seems like the actual
like<00:02:41.160> consumption<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.850> orc<00:02:42.030> spirits<00:02:42.420> was<00:02:42.570> more

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
like consumption of orc spirits was more

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.360 
like consumption of orc spirits was more
a<00:02:42.810> thing<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.320> he<00:02:43.380> couldn't<00:02:43.650> prevent<00:02:43.920> and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
a thing that he couldn't prevent and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.820 
a thing that he couldn't prevent and
cores<00:02:45.330> are<00:02:45.450> pretty<00:02:45.630> nice<00:02:45.780> guys<00:02:46.050> we<00:02:46.440> tried<00:02:46.710> to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
cores are pretty nice guys we tried to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.940 
cores are pretty nice guys we tried to
stop<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.370> he<00:02:47.610> successfully<00:02:47.940> did<00:02:48.950> overall

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
stop it and he successfully did overall

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.440 
stop it and he successfully did overall
though<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.280> seems<00:02:50.460> like<00:02:50.640> what<00:02:50.790> cooler<00:02:51.030> did<00:02:51.300> is

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
though it seems like what cooler did is

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.600 
though it seems like what cooler did is
just<00:02:51.810> create<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.500> kind<00:02:52.710> of<00:02:52.770> nice<00:02:52.980> spiritual

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
just create this kind of nice spiritual

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.070 
just create this kind of nice spiritual
style<00:02:53.850> place<00:02:54.090> where<00:02:54.330> all<00:02:54.420> those<00:02:54.600> spirits<00:02:54.990> the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
style place where all those spirits the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.840 
style place where all those spirits the
dead<00:02:55.230> orcs<00:02:55.560> we're<00:02:56.040> able<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.370> just<00:02:56.610> float

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
dead orcs we're able to just float

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.640 
dead orcs we're able to just float
around<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.150> place<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.570> be<00:02:57.960> happy

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
around the place and be happy

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.160 
around the place and be happy
I<00:02:58.680> suppose<00:02:59.130> anyway<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.150> through<00:03:00.600> all<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:00.870> or

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
I suppose anyway so through all this or

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.900 
I suppose anyway so through all this or
contamination<00:03:01.770> basically<00:03:02.490> just<00:03:02.670> started

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
contamination basically just started

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.730 
contamination basically just started
placing<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.420> lot<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.750> emphasis<00:03:04.020> on<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
placing a lot of emphasis on the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.100 
placing a lot of emphasis on the
mountain<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.250> regular<00:03:06.030> festivals<00:03:06.480> festivals

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
mountain and regular festivals festivals

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.870 
mountain and regular festivals festivals
like<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.440> choleric<00:03:07.950> festival<00:03:08.400> were<00:03:08.550> held<00:03:08.730> at

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
like the choleric festival were held at

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.360 
like the choleric festival were held at
its<00:03:09.030> base<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:09.480> that's<00:03:10.350> basically<00:03:10.740> it<00:03:10.950> for<00:03:10.980> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
its base and that's basically it for the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.730 
its base and that's basically it for the
actual<00:03:11.820> history<00:03:12.240> of<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.630> place<00:03:12.810> now<00:03:13.320> later<00:03:13.530> on

actual history of the place now later on

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.560 
actual history of the place now later on
one<00:03:13.950> or<00:03:14.070> two<00:03:14.190> things<00:03:14.370> do<00:03:14.670> happen<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.330> during

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
one or two things do happen to it during

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.540 
one or two things do happen to it during
the<00:03:15.690> Burning<00:03:16.020> Crusade<00:03:16.160> first<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.310> all<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
the Burning Crusade first of all the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.340 
the Burning Crusade first of all the
Legion<00:03:17.940> found<00:03:18.240> out<00:03:18.480> about<00:03:18.630> cooler<00:03:19.110> and

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
Legion found out about cooler and

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.950 
Legion found out about cooler and
especially<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.460> kind<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.820> partial<00:03:21.570> void

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
especially the kind of partial void

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.380 
especially the kind of partial void
state<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.620> was<00:03:22.740> within<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.250> now<00:03:24.000> we're<00:03:24.210> very

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
state that was within and now we're very

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.000 
state that was within and now we're very
weird<00:03:24.600> by<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.810> way<00:03:24.990> and<00:03:25.230> essentially<00:03:25.860> they

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
weird by the way and essentially they

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.290 
weird by the way and essentially they
have<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.220> bit<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.550> connection<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.150> void

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
have a bit of a connection to the void

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.870 
have a bit of a connection to the void
when<00:03:27.510> they're<00:03:27.630> severely<00:03:27.900> damaged<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:29.130> the

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
when they're severely damaged the the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.460 
when they're severely damaged the the
Burning<00:03:30.120> Legion<00:03:30.150> actually<00:03:30.750> used<00:03:31.020> this<00:03:31.230> void

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
Burning Legion actually used this void

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.190 
Burning Legion actually used this void
to<00:03:31.980> summon<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.460> void<00:03:32.640> creatures<00:03:33.200> to

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
to summon and void creatures to

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.600 
to summon and void creatures to
basically<00:03:34.500> just<00:03:34.710> bolster<00:03:35.070> up<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.280> numbers

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
basically just bolster up the numbers

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.460 
basically just bolster up the numbers
but<00:03:36.030> then<00:03:36.150> they<00:03:36.300> also<00:03:36.600> apparently<00:03:36.990> use<00:03:37.200> the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
but then they also apparently use the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.460 
but then they also apparently use the
dead<00:03:38.340> orcs<00:03:38.730> spirits<00:03:39.210> to<00:03:39.360> create<00:03:39.720> void<00:03:39.990> walkers

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
dead orcs spirits to create void walkers

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.560 
dead orcs spirits to create void walkers
this<00:03:41.040> was<00:03:41.190> covered<00:03:41.370> in<00:03:41.550> a<00:03:41.670> horrid<00:03:42.000> only<00:03:42.330> quest

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
this was covered in a horrid only quest

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.930 
this was covered in a horrid only quest
line<00:03:42.840> which<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.590> think<00:03:43.890> was<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.250> know<00:03:44.550> at<00:03:44.760> least

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
line which I think was I know at least

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.280 
line which I think was I know at least
sounds<00:03:45.180> like<00:03:45.270> a<00:03:45.330> very<00:03:45.480> cool<00:03:45.690> quest<00:03:45.990> line<00:03:46.170> if

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
sounds like a very cool quest line if

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.170 
sounds like a very cool quest line if
I'm<00:03:46.380> honest<00:03:46.710> a<00:03:46.860> little<00:03:47.340> bit<00:03:47.490> sad<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.060> I

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
to attempt this however they realized

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
what they would actually be doing and

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.490 
what they would actually be doing and
they<00:04:06.030> didn't<00:04:06.390> want<00:04:06.570> to<00:04:06.630> upset<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.200> Naru

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
they didn't want to upset the Naru

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.380 
they didn't want to upset the Naru
because<00:04:07.770> of<00:04:07.890> course<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.250> NAIRU<00:04:08.430> command<00:04:08.850> well

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
because of course the NAIRU command well

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.150 
because of course the NAIRU command well
the<00:04:09.630> force<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:10.050> shattrath<00:04:10.440> said<00:04:10.650> he<00:04:10.770> liked<00:04:10.950> the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
the force of shattrath said he liked the

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.750 
the force of shattrath said he liked the
Chitauri<00:04:11.760> sky<00:04:12.090> guard<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:13.370> guitar<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.640> whole

Chitauri sky guard the guitar and whole

Chitauri sky guard the guitar and whole
bunch<00:04:14.880> of<00:04:15.000> other<00:04:15.140> groups<00:04:16.140> of<00:04:16.410> people<00:04:17.220> anyway

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
bunch of other groups of people anyway

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.580 
bunch of other groups of people anyway
so<00:04:18.060> that's<00:04:18.239> essentially<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.900> lore<00:04:19.560> of

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
so that's essentially the the lore of

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.950 
so that's essentially the the lore of
osho<00:04:20.040> gone<00:04:20.220> not<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.820> great<00:04:21.060> deal<00:04:21.210> else<00:04:21.450> happened

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
osho gone not a great deal else happened

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.090 
osho gone not a great deal else happened
there<00:04:22.169> was<00:04:22.290> only<00:04:22.380> really<00:04:22.560> those<00:04:22.800> two<00:04:22.830> events

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
there was only really those two events

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.800 
there was only really those two events
during<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.669> Burning<00:04:23.940> Crusade<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.690> new

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.100 
during the Burning Crusade and the new
crowd

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
certainly is very interesting place and

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.189 
certainly is very interesting place and
I<00:04:28.800> absolutely<00:04:28.979> cannot<00:04:29.759> wait<00:04:29.819> to<00:04:30.330> see<00:04:30.509> how<00:04:30.990> a

I absolutely cannot wait to see how a

I absolutely cannot wait to see how a

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
because hopefully the consortium wolf

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:38.959 
because hopefully the consortium wolf
not<00:04:37.560> have<00:04:37.680> gotten<00:04:38.039> their<00:04:38.159> hands<00:04:38.370> on<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.639> and

not have gotten their hands on it and

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.209 
not have gotten their hands on it and
it'll<00:04:39.419> be<00:04:39.479> a<00:04:39.569> little<00:04:39.719> bit<00:04:39.900> more<00:04:40.319> just<00:04:40.979> kind<00:04:41.099> of

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.219 
it'll be a little bit more just kind of

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.459 
it'll be a little bit more just kind of
