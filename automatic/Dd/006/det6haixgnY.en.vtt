all<00:00:05.080> right<00:00:05.290> in<00:00:05.740> this<00:00:05.950> video<00:00:06.250> I<00:00:06.310> wanted<00:00:06.609> to<00:00:06.700> talk

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:06.910 
all right in this video I wanted to talk

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.010 
all right in this video I wanted to talk
a<00:00:06.939> little<00:00:07.120> bit<00:00:07.240> about<00:00:08.700> some<00:00:09.700> ways<00:00:10.420> to<00:00:10.780> use

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.020 
a little bit about some ways to use

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.090 
a little bit about some ways to use
different<00:00:11.770> devices<00:00:12.070> for<00:00:12.430> descending<00:00:12.850> a<00:00:13.059> rope

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100 
different devices for descending a rope

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.439 
different devices for descending a rope
rappelling<00:00:15.100> abseiling<00:00:15.820> whatever<00:00:16.240> you<00:00:16.299> want

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449 
rappelling abseiling whatever you want

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.439 
rappelling abseiling whatever you want
to<00:00:16.510> call<00:00:16.630> it<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.920> typically<00:00:18.490> probably<00:00:19.119> the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:19.449 
to call it and typically probably the

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.499 
to call it and typically probably the
most<00:00:19.689> single<00:00:20.320> most<00:00:20.380> common<00:00:21.060> device<00:00:22.060> for<00:00:22.390> that

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
most single most common device for that

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.189 
most single most common device for that
purpose<00:00:22.869> is<00:00:23.080> an<00:00:23.499> eight<00:00:24.400> ring<00:00:24.669> and<00:00:25.539> it's<00:00:25.900> said

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
purpose is an eight ring and it's said

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.569 
purpose is an eight ring and it's said
because<00:00:26.529> it<00:00:26.650> looks<00:00:26.829> like<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:27.009> figure<00:00:27.699> eight<00:00:29.579> and

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
because it looks like a figure eight and

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.030 
because it looks like a figure eight and
this<00:00:30.820> one's<00:00:30.999> kind<00:00:31.119> of<00:00:31.269> old<00:00:31.390> and<00:00:31.449> beat<00:00:31.630> up<00:00:31.659> but

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
this one's kind of old and beat up but

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.140 
this one's kind of old and beat up but
there's<00:00:33.040> a<00:00:33.100> couple<00:00:33.280> of<00:00:33.430> different<00:00:33.730> types<00:00:33.880> here

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
there's a couple of different types here

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.790 
there's a couple of different types here
you<00:00:34.300> just<00:00:34.690> a<00:00:34.840> typical<00:00:35.020> eight<00:00:35.290> ring<00:00:35.500> when<00:00:35.710> you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
you just a typical eight ring when you

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.870 
you just a typical eight ring when you
have<00:00:35.950> this<00:00:36.090> fancy<00:00:37.090> rescue<00:00:37.690> eight<00:00:37.840> which<00:00:38.880> you

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
have this fancy rescue eight which you

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.250 
have this fancy rescue eight which you
know<00:00:40.000> I'll<00:00:40.450> get<00:00:40.600> into<00:00:40.750> some<00:00:40.990> of<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.140> features

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
know I'll get into some of the features

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.890 
know I'll get into some of the features
of<00:00:41.500> this<00:00:41.680> one<00:00:41.890> in<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.040> little<00:00:42.250> bit<00:00:42.400> but<00:00:42.900> for

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
of this one in a little bit but for

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.090 
of this one in a little bit but for
starters<00:00:44.320> normally<00:00:46.620> actually<00:00:47.620> before<00:00:47.740> I<00:00:47.950> go

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
starters normally actually before I go

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.840 
starters normally actually before I go
into<00:00:48.250> that<00:00:48.310> let<00:00:48.460> me<00:00:48.670> just<00:00:50.070> state<00:00:51.070> for<00:00:51.700> the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
into that let me just state for the

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.420 
into that let me just state for the
record<00:00:52.000> don't<00:00:52.900> try<00:00:53.230> any<00:00:53.410> of<00:00:53.500> this<00:00:53.650> at<00:00:53.710> home<00:00:53.860> you

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
record don't try any of this at home you

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.580 
record don't try any of this at home you
know<00:00:54.550> you<00:00:55.390> really<00:00:55.630> need<00:00:55.900> to<00:00:56.170> get<00:00:56.320> some

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
know you really need to get some

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.140 
know you really need to get some
qualified<00:00:57.930> instruction<00:00:58.930> from<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.410> certified

qualified instruction from a certified
climbing<00:01:01.150> instructor<00:01:01.950> before<00:01:02.950> you<00:01:03.040> do<00:01:03.190> any

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
climbing instructor before you do any

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.920 
climbing instructor before you do any
any<00:01:03.670> kind<00:01:04.000> of<00:01:04.089> these<00:01:04.180> techniques<00:01:04.540> like<00:01:04.750> this

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
any kind of these techniques like this

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.570 
any kind of these techniques like this
you<00:01:05.110> know<00:01:05.199> it's<00:01:05.350> very<00:01:05.590> important<00:01:06.280> I<00:01:06.340> can't

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
you know it's very important I can't

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.399 
you know it's very important I can't
stress<00:01:06.820> enough<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.749> reason<00:01:08.020> I'm<00:01:08.109> doing<00:01:08.229> these

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
stress enough the reason I'm doing these

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.770 
stress enough the reason I'm doing these
videos<00:01:08.799> is<00:01:09.130> hopefully<00:01:10.119> to<00:01:10.149> spark<00:01:10.659> interest<00:01:11.109> in

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
videos is hopefully to spark interest in

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.359 
videos is hopefully to spark interest in
vertical<00:01:13.780> rope<00:01:13.960> use<00:01:14.469> and<00:01:14.799> climbing

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
vertical rope use and climbing

mountaineering spelunking
I<00:01:18.159> just<00:01:18.729> want<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.939> spark<00:01:19.149> an<00:01:19.270> interest<00:01:19.450> in<00:01:19.780> it

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
I just want to spark an interest in it

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.219 
I just want to spark an interest in it
but<00:01:21.219> don't<00:01:21.969> don't<00:01:22.479> do<00:01:22.630> anything<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:23.020> see<00:01:23.170> in

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
but don't don't do anything you see in

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.660 
but don't don't do anything you see in
these<00:01:23.319> videos<00:01:23.409> make<00:01:24.009> sure<00:01:24.159> you<00:01:24.280> get<00:01:24.429> some

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
these videos make sure you get some

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.389 
these videos make sure you get some
actual<00:01:24.939> qualified<00:01:25.600> instruction<00:01:26.140> first<00:01:26.399> now

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
actual qualified instruction first now

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:28.980 
actual qualified instruction first now
that<00:01:27.549> I've<00:01:27.640> said<00:01:27.850> that<00:01:27.880> I'll<00:01:28.749> go<00:01:28.960> into

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
that I've said that I'll go into

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.330 
that I've said that I'll go into
explaining<00:01:29.560> some<00:01:30.039> of<00:01:30.069> the<00:01:30.280> ways<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:33.310> I

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
explaining some of the ways to that I

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.109 
explaining some of the ways to that I
rigged<00:01:33.670> these<00:01:34.270> these<00:01:34.659> devices<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:35.789> eight<00:01:36.789> ring

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
rigged these these devices so eight ring

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.870 
rigged these these devices so eight ring
for<00:01:37.899> rappelling<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:39.100> would<00:01:39.219> simply<00:01:39.369> pass<00:01:39.700> the

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
for rappelling you would simply pass the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.260 
for rappelling you would simply pass the
rope<00:01:40.030> through<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.429> around<00:01:42.429> and<00:01:43.740> then<00:01:45.270> clip

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
rope through and around and then clip

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.719 
rope through and around and then clip
into<00:01:46.539> your<00:01:46.659> harness<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:48.280> always<00:01:48.429> want<00:01:48.700> to

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
into your harness and you always want to

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.739 
into your harness and you always want to
use<00:01:48.789> a<00:01:48.909> locking<00:01:50.100> carabiner<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.639> clip<00:01:51.969> in<00:01:52.209> I<00:01:52.389> had

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
use a locking carabiner to clip in I had

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.779 
use a locking carabiner to clip in I had
this<00:01:52.899> is<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.079> screw<00:01:53.380> screw<00:01:53.799> gate<00:01:54.009> carabiner<00:01:54.549> and

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
this is a screw screw gate carabiner and

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.580 
this is a screw screw gate carabiner and
I've<00:01:55.479> got<00:01:55.630> locked<00:01:55.869> in<00:01:56.079> and<00:01:56.469> then<00:01:57.429> basically

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
I've got locked in and then basically

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.830 
I've got locked in and then basically
this<00:01:59.590> allows<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.069> to<00:02:00.219> descend<00:02:00.609> the<00:02:00.729> rope<00:02:00.909> like

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
this allows you to descend the rope like

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.429 
this allows you to descend the rope like
so

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
so

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.340 
so
by<00:02:04.219> applying<00:02:04.549> downward<00:02:05.509> pressure<00:02:05.780> on<00:02:06.200> this

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
by applying downward pressure on this

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.940 
by applying downward pressure on this
rope<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:07.310> actually<00:02:07.670> locks<00:02:07.969> the<00:02:08.390> device<00:02:08.690> off<00:02:08.959> it

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
rope it actually locks the device off it

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.770 
rope it actually locks the device off it
won't<00:02:10.220> allow<00:02:10.489> you<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.729> descend<00:02:11.209> anymore

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
won't allow you to descend anymore

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.780 
won't allow you to descend anymore
so<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.470> vary<00:02:12.709> your<00:02:12.920> rate<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.099> descent<00:02:13.250> by

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
so you can vary your rate of descent by

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.869 
so you can vary your rate of descent by
varying<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:15.319> amount<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.739> this<00:02:16.340> lower<00:02:16.549> rope

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
varying the amount of this lower rope

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.270

all<00:02:19.879> this<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.510> doing<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:21.049> acting<00:02:21.590> as<00:02:21.709> a

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
all this is doing is acting as a

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.830 
all this is doing is acting as a
friction<00:02:22.040> multiplier<00:02:22.819> that's<00:02:23.420> all<00:02:23.660> it's

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
friction multiplier that's all it's

doing I'm using accessory cord here
simply<00:02:27.049> because<00:02:27.319> it's<00:02:27.470> more<00:02:27.620> supple<00:02:27.890> than<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760

fashion to the way it did before make

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.920 
fashion to the way it did before make
sure<00:03:28.099> you<00:03:29.109> lock<00:03:30.109> the<00:03:30.590> gate<00:03:30.769> on<00:03:30.919> your<00:03:31.040> carabiner

sure you lock the gate on your carabiner

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.089 
sure you lock the gate on your carabiner
it's<00:03:32.930> still<00:03:33.200> going<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.530> act<00:03:33.650> as<00:03:33.799> a<00:03:33.829> friction

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
it's still going to act as a friction

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.069 
it's still going to act as a friction
multiplier<00:03:34.840> however<00:03:37.359> this<00:03:38.359> is<00:03:38.540> prevented

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
multiplier however this is prevented

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.839 
multiplier however this is prevented
from<00:03:39.109> slipping<00:03:39.799> up<00:03:39.919> over<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.430> forming<00:03:40.730> that

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.470 

over<00:03:51.220> here<00:03:51.580> we<00:03:52.090> have<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:53.130> rescue<00:03:54.130> 8<00:03:54.490> and<00:03:54.880> it

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
over here we have a rescue 8 and it

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.160 
over here we have a rescue 8 and it
actually<00:03:55.690> has<00:03:55.990> these<00:03:56.170> ears<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:58.660> prevent<00:03:59.050> that

another<00:04:12.040> interesting<00:04:12.580> use<00:04:12.760> for<00:04:13.000> this

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
another interesting use for this

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.560 
another interesting use for this
particular<00:04:13.770> descender<00:04:14.770> is<00:04:15.070> that<00:04:15.700> it's<00:04:16.299> made

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
particular descender is that it's made

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.440 
particular descender is that it's made
with<00:04:16.750> a<00:04:16.780> really<00:04:17.049> wide<00:04:17.940> opening<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:19.150> that<00:04:19.299> you

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
with a really wide opening so that you

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.150 
with a really wide opening so that you
can<00:04:19.709> double<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:22.330> friction<00:04:22.750> so<00:04:23.620> if<00:04:23.950> you're

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
can double the friction so if you're

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.340 
can double the friction so if you're
rappelling<00:04:24.640> and<00:04:24.790> you<00:04:24.850> have<00:04:25.060> an<00:04:25.360> injured

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
rappelling and you have an injured

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.670 
rappelling and you have an injured
climber<00:04:27.060> clip<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.210> your<00:04:28.330> harness<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:29.650> can

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
climber clip to your harness you can

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.340 
climber clip to your harness you can
double<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.340> friction<00:04:30.700> through<00:04:30.910> here<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:32.110> that

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
double the friction through here so that

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.120 
double the friction through here so that
you're<00:04:32.770> able<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:33.100> lower<00:04:34.740> twice<00:04:35.740> as<00:04:35.980> much

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
you're able to lower twice as much

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.360 
you're able to lower twice as much
weight<00:04:37.169> with<00:04:38.169> about<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:38.620> same<00:04:38.830> amount<00:04:39.160> of

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
weight with about the same amount of

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.680 
weight with about the same amount of
pressure<00:04:40.240> on<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.230> lower<00:04:41.500> line<00:04:42.540> so<00:04:43.540> that's

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
pressure on this lower line so that's

it<00:05:01.900> from<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.200> rope<00:05:02.410> and<00:05:03.010> that's<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:04.060> can<00:05:04.180> be

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
it from the rope and that's that can be

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.150 
it from the rope and that's that can be
very<00:05:04.510> handy<00:05:04.690> if<00:05:04.960> you<00:05:05.080> for<00:05:05.590> whatever<00:05:05.680> reason

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160

very handy if you for whatever reason
your<00:05:06.280> descent<00:05:06.640> is<00:05:06.850> so<00:05:07.270> long<00:05:07.510> that<00:05:07.720> you<00:05:07.810> have<00:05:07.990> to

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
your descent is so long that you have to

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.450 
your descent is so long that you have to
join<00:05:08.860> two<00:05:09.130> ropes<00:05:09.370> to<00:05:10.330> get<00:05:10.450> down<00:05:10.800> another<00:05:11.800> cool

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
join two ropes to get down another cool

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.400 
join two ropes to get down another cool
thing<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:12.970> this<00:05:13.240> can<00:05:13.419> be<00:05:13.510> used<00:05:13.660> for<00:05:13.870> is<00:05:15.479> as<00:05:16.479> a

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
thing that this can be used for is as a

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.090 
thing that this can be used for is as a
belay<00:05:17.919> device<00:05:19.110> and<00:05:20.110> some<00:05:20.440> people<00:05:20.650> use<00:05:20.800> belay

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
belay device and some people use belay

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.620 
belay device and some people use belay
devices<00:05:21.430> for<00:05:21.960> rappelling<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.020> ascending<00:05:23.500> but

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
devices for rappelling and ascending but

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.580 
devices for rappelling and ascending but
you<00:05:25.630> would<00:05:25.750> clip<00:05:25.960> this<00:05:26.080> into<00:05:26.320> your<00:05:26.410> harness

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
you would clip this into your harness

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.969 
you would clip this into your harness
like<00:05:26.860> so<00:05:27.100> and<00:05:27.610> then<00:05:28.570> this<00:05:29.080> is<00:05:29.260> also<00:05:29.410> a<00:05:29.560> friction

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
like so and then this is also a friction

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.960 
like so and then this is also a friction
multiplier<00:05:30.460> so<00:05:32.100> you<00:05:33.100> know<00:05:33.220> this<00:05:33.550> is<00:05:33.790> the

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
multiplier so you know this is the

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.730 
multiplier so you know this is the
climber<00:05:34.600> that<00:05:34.840> you're<00:05:35.020> belaying<00:05:35.350> on<00:05:35.560> this

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
climber that you're belaying on this

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.200 
climber that you're belaying on this
side<00:05:36.240> this<00:05:37.240> way<00:05:37.479> and<00:05:38.820> you're<00:05:39.820> feeding<00:05:40.030> the

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
side this way and you're feeding the

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.719 
side this way and you're feeding the
Rope<00:05:40.390> through<00:05:40.600> like<00:05:41.560> so<00:05:41.800> giving<00:05:42.550> a<00:05:42.610> little

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
Rope through like so giving a little

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.840 
Rope through like so giving a little
slack<00:05:43.030> as<00:05:43.240> he<00:05:43.360> climbs<00:05:44.160> and<00:05:45.160> it<00:05:45.370> can<00:05:45.490> be<00:05:45.580> used<00:05:45.760> to

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
slack as he climbs and it can be used to

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.030 
slack as he climbs and it can be used to
belay<00:05:46.120> like<00:05:46.300> so<00:05:46.510> there's<00:05:47.320> actually<00:05:47.530> a<00:05:47.800> few

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
belay like so there's actually a few

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.370 
belay like so there's actually a few
more<00:05:48.160> uses<00:05:48.580> for<00:05:48.610> this<00:05:48.880> rescue<00:05:49.120> aid<00:05:49.450> I'm<00:05:50.080> not

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
more uses for this rescue aid I'm not

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.110 
more uses for this rescue aid I'm not
familiar<00:05:50.560> with<00:05:50.800> all<00:05:50.979> of<00:05:51.160> them<00:05:51.310> but<00:05:51.550> it's<00:05:52.060> a

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
familiar with all of them but it's a

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.930 
familiar with all of them but it's a
really<00:05:52.479> handy<00:05:52.660> tool

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
really handy tool

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.920 
really handy tool
and<00:05:54.940> there's<00:05:55.120> a<00:05:55.180> lot<00:05:55.330> of<00:05:55.419> information

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
and there's a lot of information

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.719 
and there's a lot of information
available<00:05:56.020> on<00:05:56.470> how<00:05:56.620> to<00:05:56.680> do<00:05:56.830> this<00:05:57.039> really<00:05:57.430> handy

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
available on how to do this really handy

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.490 
available on how to do this really handy
tool<00:05:57.910> to<00:05:57.940> have<00:05:58.060> and<00:05:58.750> I<00:05:58.870> think<00:05:58.900> this<00:05:59.289> one<00:05:59.470> is

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
tool to have and I think this one is

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.450 
tool to have and I think this one is
actually<00:06:00.370> hard<00:06:00.580> anodized<00:06:01.000> so<00:06:02.130> one<00:06:03.130> thing<00:06:03.340> that

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
actually hard anodized so one thing that

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.680 
actually hard anodized so one thing that
I<00:06:03.490> have<00:06:05.639> been<00:06:06.639> made<00:06:06.820> aware<00:06:06.910> of<00:06:07.090> as<00:06:07.360> far<00:06:07.570> as

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
I have been made aware of as far as

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.260 
I have been made aware of as far as
anodized<00:06:08.229> descending<00:06:09.039> devices<00:06:09.550> is<00:06:09.759> once<00:06:10.090> you

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
anodized descending devices is once you

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.430 
anodized descending devices is once you
do<00:06:10.479> wear<00:06:10.750> through<00:06:11.110> that<00:06:11.289> anodizing<00:06:13.440> the

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
do wear through that anodizing the

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.260 
do wear through that anodizing the
underlying<00:06:15.340> aluminum<00:06:15.850> is<00:06:15.970> going<00:06:16.030> to<00:06:16.180> be

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
underlying aluminum is going to be

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.659 
underlying aluminum is going to be
softer<00:06:16.810> so<00:06:17.669> you'll<00:06:18.669> have<00:06:18.820> a<00:06:18.880> sharp<00:06:19.240> edge<00:06:19.449> of

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
softer so you'll have a sharp edge of

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.240 
softer so you'll have a sharp edge of
anodized<00:06:21.669> metal<00:06:22.440> so<00:06:23.440> once<00:06:23.650> you<00:06:23.740> wear<00:06:23.949> through

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
anodized metal so once you wear through

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.879 
anodized metal so once you wear through
it<00:06:24.400> with<00:06:25.060> with<00:06:25.330> with<00:06:25.690> the<00:06:25.810> rope<00:06:25.990> you're<00:06:26.770> going

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 
it with with with the rope you're going

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.080 
it with with with the rope you're going
to<00:06:26.949> want<00:06:27.099> to<00:06:27.130> retire<00:06:27.460> it<00:06:27.669> because<00:06:27.940> it<00:06:28.030> will

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
to want to retire it because it will

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.219 
to want to retire it because it will
start<00:06:28.360> to<00:06:28.509> cut<00:06:28.780> the<00:06:30.449> outer<00:06:31.449> sheath<00:06:31.870> of<00:06:32.110> the

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
start to cut the outer sheath of the

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:33.589 
start to cut the outer sheath of the
rope<00:06:32.440> and<00:06:32.590> you<00:06:32.680> don't<00:06:32.889> want<00:06:33.039> that<00:06:33.130> to<00:06:33.190> happen

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
rope and you don't want that to happen

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:38.100 
rope and you don't want that to happen
so<00:06:34.599> now<00:06:35.490> if<00:06:36.490> whatever<00:06:37.270> reason<00:06:37.720> you're<00:06:37.840> stuck

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
so now if whatever reason you're stuck

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.070 
so now if whatever reason you're stuck
without<00:06:38.289> a<00:06:38.620> descending<00:06:39.130> device<00:06:39.400> a<00:06:40.080> regular

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
without a descending device a regular

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.010 
without a descending device a regular
carabiner<00:06:41.560> can<00:06:41.740> you<00:06:41.860> can<00:06:42.190> be<00:06:42.310> used<00:06:43.020> the

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
carabiner can you can be used the

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.570 
carabiner can you can be used the
perhaps<00:06:44.320> the<00:06:44.470> simplest<00:06:44.740> way<00:06:45.070> is<00:06:45.669> to<00:06:45.940> just<00:06:46.120> clip

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
perhaps the simplest way is to just clip

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.790 
perhaps the simplest way is to just clip
three<00:06:48.580> or<00:06:48.669> four<00:06:48.849> turns<00:06:49.680> through<00:06:50.680> the

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
three or four turns through the

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.310 
three or four turns through the
carabiner<00:06:51.660> depending<00:06:52.660> upon<00:06:52.750> how<00:06:52.960> much<00:06:53.080> weight

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
carabiner depending upon how much weight

carabiner depending upon how much weight
you're<00:06:53.490> you're<00:06:54.490> lowering<00:06:54.820> and<00:06:55.620> again<00:06:56.620> you

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
you're you're lowering and again you

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.649 
you're you're lowering and again you
know<00:06:57.340> you<00:06:57.400> would<00:06:57.580> clip<00:06:57.820> a<00:06:57.849> second<00:06:58.270> carabiner

00:06:58.649 --> 00:06:58.659 
know you would clip a second carabiner

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:03.120 
know you would clip a second carabiner
in<00:06:58.810> your<00:06:58.960> harness<00:06:59.280> lock<00:07:00.280> it<00:07:00.460> off<00:07:00.610> and<00:07:01.860> now<00:07:02.860> it

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
in your harness lock it off and now it

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.710 
in your harness lock it off and now it
functions<00:07:03.550> just<00:07:03.940> like<00:07:04.060> any<00:07:04.210> other<00:07:04.389> as<00:07:04.659> a

functions just like any other as a
friction<00:07:05.169> multiplier<00:07:05.770> now<00:07:06.699> all<00:07:06.909> of<00:07:07.120> these

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
friction multiplier now all of these

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.770 
friction multiplier now all of these
methods<00:07:07.770> impart<00:07:08.770> some<00:07:09.070> spin<00:07:09.490> on<00:07:09.520> the<00:07:09.820> rope<00:07:10.000> but

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:10.780 
methods impart some spin on the rope but

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.240 
methods impart some spin on the rope but
if<00:07:10.870> you're<00:07:11.020> doing<00:07:11.139> a<00:07:11.349> long<00:07:11.590> descent<00:07:12.010> where

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
if you're doing a long descent where

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.830 
if you're doing a long descent where
you're<00:07:12.400> hanging<00:07:12.789> in<00:07:12.820> free<00:07:13.270> air<00:07:13.479> you're<00:07:13.690> not

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
you're hanging in free air you're not

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.649 
you're hanging in free air you're not
descending<00:07:14.409> a<00:07:14.470> cliff<00:07:14.710> face<00:07:14.979> this<00:07:15.970> is<00:07:16.180> probably

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:16.659 
descending a cliff face this is probably

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:19.439 
descending a cliff face this is probably
not<00:07:17.380> one<00:07:17.740> of<00:07:17.860> the<00:07:18.010> methods<00:07:18.940> you<00:07:19.060> want<00:07:19.240> to<00:07:19.300> use

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:19.449 
not one of the methods you want to use

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:22.260 
not one of the methods you want to use
because<00:07:19.659> of<00:07:20.320> this<00:07:20.800> spiral<00:07:21.220> winding<00:07:22.090> through

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.270 
because of this spiral winding through

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.300 
because of this spiral winding through
here<00:07:22.509> it'll<00:07:23.110> impart<00:07:23.409> a<00:07:23.470> lot<00:07:23.590> of<00:07:23.650> spin<00:07:23.949> so<00:07:24.190> as

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 
here it'll impart a lot of spin so as

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.430 
here it'll impart a lot of spin so as
you<00:07:24.490> descend<00:07:24.849> you'll<00:07:25.060> be<00:07:25.210> doing<00:07:26.139> pirouettes

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440 
you descend you'll be doing pirouettes

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.370 
you descend you'll be doing pirouettes
all<00:07:26.830> the<00:07:26.919> way<00:07:27.009> down<00:07:27.220> but<00:07:28.090> in<00:07:28.449> an<00:07:28.539> emergency<00:07:28.659> if

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:29.380 
all the way down but in an emergency if

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.860 
all the way down but in an emergency if
it's<00:07:29.620> all<00:07:29.770> you've<00:07:29.889> got<00:07:30.039> available<00:07:30.490> it's<00:07:30.940> it's

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:31.870 
it's all you've got available it's it's

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.180 
it's all you've got available it's it's
a<00:07:32.020> way<00:07:32.139> to<00:07:32.199> give<00:07:32.440> yourself<00:07:32.530> a<00:07:32.860> friction

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.190 
a way to give yourself a friction

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.770 
a way to give yourself a friction
multiplier<00:07:33.669> so<00:07:33.940> that<00:07:34.060> you<00:07:34.180> can<00:07:34.300> actually<00:07:34.479> get

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:34.780 
multiplier so that you can actually get

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:41.700 
multiplier so that you can actually get
down<00:07:34.930> the<00:07:35.110> rope<00:07:38.490> this<00:07:39.490> is<00:07:39.669> so<00:07:39.940> I<00:07:40.000> hope<00:07:40.389> that<00:07:41.080> you

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:41.710 
down the rope this is so I hope that you

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.779 
down the rope this is so I hope that you
