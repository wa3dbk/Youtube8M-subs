opinion is to have healthier hair and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.620 
opinion is to have healthier hair and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
that's why it saddens me when I see

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.770 
that's why it saddens me when I see
people<00:02:13.840> all<00:02:14.410> hair<00:02:15.100> journeys<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.030> ends

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
people all hair journeys and the ends

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.170 
people all hair journeys and the ends
are<00:02:16.930> not<00:02:17.140> healthy<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:18.250> y'all<00:02:18.459> try<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.730> hang<00:02:18.970> on

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
are not healthy and y'all try to hang on

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.850 
are not healthy and y'all try to hang on
to<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.569> so<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:19.930> can<00:02:20.050> reach<00:02:20.290> your<00:02:20.500> goal<00:02:20.650> and
