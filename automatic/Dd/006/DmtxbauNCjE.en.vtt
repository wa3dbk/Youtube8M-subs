00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.870 
and it's easy you can swing it up and
you<00:01:49.229> go<00:01:49.409> right<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> text<00:01:50.250> or<00:01:50.430> whatever

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
you go right to the text or whatever

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.300 
you go right to the text or whatever
message<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.570> or<00:01:51.780> anything<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.170> that

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
message you have or anything like that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.190 
message you have or anything like that
so<00:01:53.310> overall<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.049> do

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
so overall this is not going to do

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200 
so overall this is not going to do
anything<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.619> iPod<00:01:56.159> or<00:01:56.399> harm<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.850> any<00:01:56.969> kind

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
anything to iPod or harm it in any kind

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.899 
anything to iPod or harm it in any kind
of<00:01:57.240> way<00:01:57.420> or<00:01:57.719> slip<00:01:58.110> off<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:59.070> very<00:01:59.189> easy<00:01:59.579> to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
of way or slip off it's very easy to

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.719 
of way or slip off it's very easy to
detach<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.719> loop<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:01.049> well<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.409> use<00:02:01.950> push<00:02:02.399> up<00:02:02.579> on

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
detach the loop as well I use push up on

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.700 
detach the loop as well I use push up on
it<00:02:02.759> take<00:02:03.570> one<00:02:03.750> side<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.320> slips<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
it take one side out and it slips it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.429 
it take one side out and it slips it
right<00:02:04.829> out<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.729> push<00:02:06.210> down<00:02:06.439> and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
right out and you just push down and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.350 
right out and you just push down and
that's<00:02:07.680> it

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
that's it

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.880 
that's it
overall<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.450> think<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.750> loop<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> great<00:02:10.560> new

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
overall I think the loop is a great new

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.920 
overall I think the loop is a great new
accessory<00:02:11.489> for<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.819> iPod<00:02:12.390> Touch<00:02:12.629> 5th
