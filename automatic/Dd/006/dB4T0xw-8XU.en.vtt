for<00:02:04.980> example<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:06.000> patient<00:02:06.540> does<00:02:06.720> not<00:02:06.750> have

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
for example this patient does not have

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.190 
for example this patient does not have
an<00:02:07.320> expectation<00:02:07.800> of<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.729> midnight<00:02:09.119> stay<00:02:09.479> he

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
an expectation of a to midnight stay he

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.230 
an expectation of a to midnight stay he
sounds<00:02:10.679> quite<00:02:10.830> stable<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.640> may<00:02:11.790> be<00:02:11.850> able<00:02:12.090> to

sounds quite stable and may be able to
go<00:02:12.510> home<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.990> next<00:02:13.020> day

go home the next day

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.430 
go home the next day
observation<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.030> appropriate<00:02:15.630> but<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
observation is appropriate but if the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.230 
observation is appropriate but if the
doctor<00:02:16.860> stated<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> patient<00:02:17.850> had<00:02:18.000> abnormal

vital signs the to midnight expectation

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.440 
vital signs the to midnight expectation
is<00:02:21.780> perfectly<00:02:22.440> reasonable<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:23.400> patient<00:02:24.300> like
