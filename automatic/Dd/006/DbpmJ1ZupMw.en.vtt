00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:10.260
 and if I peju 2008 automatic 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.820
 the most wanted version of this new one is 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.020
 silver french derived from peugeot 208 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.689
 so the 2008 pejor he arrives for 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.769
 compete with eco sport with the jeep 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.619
 elegant then it's the last one that got there 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:31.890
 in that version there top of the line griffe 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.570
 equipped with a 1.6-horsepower 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.950
 an automatic transmission of four 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.410
 marches 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.129
 at first it may seem like a whole 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.739
 mechanic as well as overcome 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.600
 but in the tests of the magazine four wheels 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.930
 This car ran faster than 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.360
 I renegedi from 1.8 with transmission 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.949
 six-speed automatic then it is 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.039
 a very interesting option is for the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.600
 less for the price that car there 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:02.219
 specifically priced around 75 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:06.240
 thousand reais and is a person is an option to 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.610
 if he considers by performance he does of 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.619
 0 to 100 in 14.3 seconds in the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.890
 four wheels is not a brilliant number 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.720
 he ends up falling behind to idol pop 1.0 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.790
 which makes in 14.1 seconds is from 0 to 100 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.350
 but it is a number that is a performance there 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.200
 could be better but neither is 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.970
 no and disaster 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.180
 He is a second faster than me. 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.960
 reneguei of 1.8 automatic or renegade 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.960
 made at 15.3 then the pg 208 with 1.6 engine 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.259
 faster than renegade 1.8 in addition to 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.820
 be more economical also not people 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.869
 you are seeing the visual is the visual of it 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.770
 handsome pretty live he's got this 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.930
 c- shaped rear flashlight that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.810
 invades the right side and the rear has a 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.409
 lightweight design then the look stayed 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.340
 interesting the period of 2008 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.799
 and I believe he should succeed 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.280
 in Brazil because it has a beautiful design a 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.319
 right price is not the main question 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.579
 this automatic transmission indicated 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.650
 males he that car there second four 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.749
 wheels consumption is 10.4 kilometers 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.409
 per liter of gasoline in the city ​​and 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:28.379
 road gets 13.9 very good the steering wheel is 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:31.109
 a great highlight the steering wheel is well 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.099
 with shift paddles for 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.930
 manuals 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.579
 the interior finish is interesting with 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.909
 a partially leather coating 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:42.359
 of air conditioning control seats 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.849
 and the parking brake has this 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.459
 airplane style stick lever 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.250
 we are seeing the lever 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.889
 four-speed automatic transmission 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.840
 do pejô grife 2008 top-of-the-line version 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:00.000
 it's just not the top-of-the-line version 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.280
 that the top-of-the-line same is up to hp 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.199
 unfortunately until hp brand is more or 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.849
 less this same finish there, the people 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:09.000
 can see the back how the 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:12.239
 space is not that in 2008 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.280
 but the question is the following the brand has 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:19.079
 hp has a great engine 1.6 of 173 horses 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.329
 flex is an engine made in partnership between 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:25.019
 the military pj and mp then the engine 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.579
 excellent turbo 1 173 horse racing 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.099
 car have car performance 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.099
 sporting them in 8 seconds is a 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.689
 absurd what he walks up to has some 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.989
 publications in which even speak everything 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:38.849
 It is very motor to him but is 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.699
 whole issue is that he has no exchange 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.189
 automatic thp né sadly this is it 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:46.319
 told afp john to put an exchange 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:49.819
 six-speed automatic that is the same 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:53.970
 corner that goes in a citroen c4 lounge 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:57.180
 there the steering wheel of the 2008 kiss is with the 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.969
 horns stones then the steering wheel andré 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.239
 there is a cool sport footprint the 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:05.489
 multifunctional steering wheel is with a 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.109
 Short then the person get 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.879
 put this automatic transmission of 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.340
 six marches in this griffe version that in 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.840
 terms of internal finish is very much the same 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.329
 then this right 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.829
 There are some really good ones there. 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.690
 there was one of the best 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.060
 mechanical configurations on the market 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.340
 internal space is very good it has a 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.110
 luggage carrier around 350 liters 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.560
 he is 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.229
 weighing around 1,200 kilograms then 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.870
 length of 4.2 meters is not 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.550
 an interesting option pg 2008 has a 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.629
 legal visual mainly in the 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.270
 automatic that the most demanded is 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:44.810
 it folks designer in 2008 21.6 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.810
 automatic
