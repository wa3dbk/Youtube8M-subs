was<00:01:46.120> actually<00:01:46.240> fun<00:01:46.870> well<00:01:47.110> I<00:01:47.140> don't<00:01:47.350> remember

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
was actually fun well I don't remember

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.170 
was actually fun well I don't remember
doing<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:48.040> think<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.430> was<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.760> went<00:01:49.030> out<00:01:49.150> a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
doing it I think I was I went out a

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.130 
doing it I think I was I went out a
couple<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.420> times<00:01:49.630> this<00:01:49.720> weekend<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.080> was

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
couple of times this weekend I was

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.800 
couple of times this weekend I was
pretty<00:01:50.710> drunk<00:01:50.890> on<00:01:51.220> Tuesday<00:01:51.640> night<00:01:51.820> and<00:01:52.720> I

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
pretty drunk on Tuesday night and I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.970 
pretty drunk on Tuesday night and I
think<00:01:52.900> I<00:01:53.110> came<00:01:53.290> back<00:01:53.410> and<00:01:53.590> played<00:01:53.650> this<00:01:53.830> level

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
think I came back and played this level

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.290 
think I came back and played this level
because<00:01:54.220> when<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.370> got<00:01:54.580> here<00:01:54.760> to<00:01:54.910> clean<00:01:55.090> up<00:01:55.210> all

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
because when I got here to clean up all

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.640 
because when I got here to clean up all
the<00:01:55.390> challenges<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:55.930> didn't<00:01:56.140> have<00:01:56.230> any<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.410> them

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
the challenges I didn't have any of them

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.150 
the challenges I didn't have any of them
and<00:01:58.050> so<00:01:59.050> I'd<00:01:59.140> obviously<00:01:59.260> just<00:01:59.590> taught<00:01:59.830> through

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
and so I'd obviously just taught through

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.340 
and so I'd obviously just taught through
it<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.970> didn't<00:02:01.420> remember<00:02:01.600> doing<00:02:02.140> anything

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
it and didn't remember doing anything

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.160 
it and didn't remember doing anything
here<00:02:02.710> so<00:02:03.610> I<00:02:03.640> had<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.060> spend<00:02:04.180> like<00:02:04.450> another<00:02:04.660> two

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
here so I had to spend like another two

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.780 
here so I had to spend like another two
hours<00:02:05.229> just<00:02:05.740> reacquainting<00:02:05.979> myself<00:02:06.310> and

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
hours just reacquainting myself and

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.940 
hours just reacquainting myself and
poking<00:02:07.780> around<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:08.380> looking<00:02:08.649> for<00:02:08.800> all<00:02:08.860> the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
poking around and looking for all the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.060 
poking around and looking for all the
secrets<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:10.600> then<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.230> did<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> run<00:02:11.590> through<00:02:11.830> any

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
secrets and then I did a run through any

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.430 
secrets and then I did a run through any
of<00:02:12.310> this<00:02:12.460> video<00:02:12.700> but<00:02:12.880> up<00:02:13.030> here<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:14.020> second

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
vault signers right there and that leads

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.110 
vault signers right there and that leads
us<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.440> next<00:02:56.530> two<00:02:56.739> stashes<00:02:57.250> there's<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.000> bit

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
us to the next two stashes there's a bit

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.140 
us to the next two stashes there's a bit
of<00:02:58.209> trick<00:02:58.390> jumping<00:02:58.720> for<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.170> next<00:02:59.410> stash<00:03:00.150> you

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
of trick jumping for the next stash you

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.840 
of trick jumping for the next stash you
just<00:03:01.299> hop<00:03:01.450> hop<00:03:01.660> um<00:03:03.120> there<00:03:04.120> we<00:03:04.209> go<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:05.850> that's

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
just hop hop um there we go and that's

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.220 
just hop hop um there we go and that's
the<00:03:06.970> second<00:03:07.269> stash<00:03:07.450> right<00:03:07.630> there<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.019> third

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
the second stash right there the third

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.009 
the second stash right there the third
one<00:03:08.440> is<00:03:08.560> under<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.769> waterfall<00:03:09.160> right<00:03:09.760> nearby<00:03:10.019> so

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
one is under a waterfall right nearby so

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.570 
one is under a waterfall right nearby so
you<00:03:11.080> won't<00:03:11.350> have<00:03:11.530> too<00:03:11.739> much<00:03:11.860> trouble<00:03:12.100> finding

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820

loops back on itself
um<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.120> guess<00:03:28.120> this<00:03:28.299> is<00:03:28.450> where<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.720> fight<00:03:28.959> blood

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
with some wires being pulled away so

notes<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:53.500> I<00:04:53.530> take<00:04:54.160> a<00:04:54.190> bit<00:04:54.370> of<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.490> diesel<00:04:54.699> to<00:04:54.910> get

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.060 
notes so I take a bit of a diesel to get
those<00:04:55.180> but<00:04:55.510> it's<00:04:55.780> at<00:04:55.960> high<00:04:56.110> speed<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:56.470> there's

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
those but it's at high speed so there's

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.010 
those but it's at high speed so there's
nothing<00:04:57.310> too<00:04:57.430> much<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.610> worry<00:04:57.729> about<00:04:58.020> those

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020
