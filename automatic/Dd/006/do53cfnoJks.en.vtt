00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.080
 hello everyone from diego from pietro we are from 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.090
 new in the company of sonic z2 stereo 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.269
 that we want to deepen a little 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.639
 part on the sun of this smartphone that 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.740
 we hide that we like it very much 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.160
 first let's talk about mill 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.440
 technical features 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.470
 the device has a display of 5 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.470
 inch 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.699
 let's focus on the display because 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.070
 you know we know that sony from 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.290
 previous had made a display that yes 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.320
 is seen laterally lost all the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.150
 its brilliance 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.360
 the neck 102 this absolutely not 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.840
 what happens is to finally get the needs 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.860
 from a beautiful and bright display 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.630
 it shows that even to any 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.670
 angle and I must say that 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.579
 absolutely one of the best views 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.050
 even have ever 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.600
 then we close a display part 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.460
 we can ill 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.989
 shut up two very much in the drawn state 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.370
 the 401 from 2.3 reggina with 3 gigabytes of 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.420
 memory will then say a hardware 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.780
 really at the top 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.220
 the internal memory is 16 gigabytes 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.220
 expandable via microsd 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.290
 therefore the possibility to expand the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.840
 memory through this cover 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.570
 then there is the daily 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.600
 indicates that it is not resistant either 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.970
 to water because 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.159
 honor therefore it is a species device yes 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.980
 bathes 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.360
 nothing serious 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.630
 a very interesting thing is that 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.920
 sony 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.810
 did not put it there 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.170
 now the woman 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.640
 and the previous model 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.440
 never a door 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.100
 so let's say this is not going to 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.930
 influence of the device that maintains 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.110
 The line called the icon of 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.260
 balance that repeats the usual design 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.730
 on all sides 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.920
 we have in the part 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.090
 strange the slot for micro sd me 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.290
 I'm wrong before 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.880
 sorry 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.350
 the button to switch off the appliance 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.830
 prof 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.119
 display lock the volume key which 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.490
 a little uneasy little one would come 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.600
 the dedicated camera key 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.119
 on the opposite side 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.550
 we have a slot to insert the sim e 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.260
 the usb port 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.020
 here we have the possibility to insert 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.050
 a strap to put around your neck while 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.990
 this is the economic speaker 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.180
 let us not forget that the sony s2 to a 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.070
 status LED set in the capsule 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.420
 the headset that is really beyond 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.610
 to be beautiful is absolutely also 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.190
 definitely very comfortable 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.160
 let's talk about the audio out of this 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.050
 stereo smartphone we have the speaker here 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.170
 and then the speaker does when we listen 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.570
 we see a video we are immersed 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.560
 in listening to our song I do 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.040
 also hear the volume that the cousin 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.040
 but of them 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.020
 anyway 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.940
 no 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.270
 so to face we are also from 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.270
 way 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.750
 let's go back now also a 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.820
 little of the company therefore also the 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.250
 camera one of yesterday's things follows 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:12.730
 20.7 megapixels with lenses 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.740
 g lens and has a velocity status 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.170
 really an impressive is equipped with 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.050
 optical or optical stabilizer which 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.370
 bride dumps in the 78 kg I do not 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.000
 see now 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.220
 the new collection interface 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.260
 the sounds that added new ones 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.480
 without first we see the mass 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.280
 fire my shot were you see is 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.280
 practically instantaneous 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.800
 let's see the settings vi 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.319
 I do however see a widget a 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.959
 quick connection you can 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.470
 if he lives in our interface if then 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.680
 let's go to the important ones 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.150
 we can choose which setting 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.140
 use because these are all 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.140
 capture modes 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.170
 for example 4k us in verona more money 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.930
 launched the camera is already set 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:07.240
 with the recording of becoming a mother 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.240
 we recorded a quick video 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.250
 let's see is the quality that you 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.990
 will also play the audio as perhaps they are 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.190
 you are also the focus 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.190
 let's see her meet 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.919
 rosary and peter we find the actors 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.409
 we always return to our usual face 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.800
 this is the mode from the bathrooms 5 that there 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.800
 allows to 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.689
 take a picture and see all the 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.759
 movement of the object in the photo 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:43.409
 I am very particular that 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.029
 ability to focus 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.320
 finally don't let the fire change you 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:50.010
 he in my opinion 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.790
 this option is called 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.360
 this case I'll show you how 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.360
 it works 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.330
 we touch to focus on the object 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.710
 this 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.970
 we know we need to keep the 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.550
 device for those who shoot two at the 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.450
 smoker 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.450
 because he failed 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.990
 with this forgive 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.990
 the item 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.260
 the same 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.249
 more 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.880
 all right 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.940
 you come 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.860
 with is the background we can choose to 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.419
 play it so as to keep 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.090
 highlight the project we can 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.340
 choose whether to use the version 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.199
 horizontal or in the version 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.669
 digital or the front version 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.689
 and this is the very function indeed 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.449
 pretty and a lot 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:43.949
 very useful for network play these 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.580
 functions are also already present in the 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.590
 photo 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.340
 and if maybe left in the travelers of the 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.660
 total sunshine 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.280
 let's go back and talk again 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.590
 a screen test I want to show 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.010
 you the quality of the display by playing 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.010
 a video 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.500
 I also believe that not 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.500
 binding 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.130
 we left mine 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:20.910
 certainly we have to bow is a dozen 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.910
 Also the play of light 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.340
 what about the interface alone remains 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.940
 always a little the usual we have 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.300
 the possible 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.300
 Do this 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.990
 we don't call each other 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.820
 the interface that we then have the 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.830
 possibility to add grays and 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.410
 trans 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.000
 and reality because it has not changed 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.790
 quite a lot of 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.580
 even the album application is fine 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.720
 all 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.720
 do the second 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:58.600
 based on date and month, see how 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.639
 absolutely reactive 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.080
 very fast 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.820
 acts quickly and despite 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.020
 this, however, is 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.020
 the software yet 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.530
 android version 4.4 installed 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.639
 kitkat ask for the latest version of 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.099
 Android 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:17.199
 device will arrive in the market a 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.910
 early April and late March at a price 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:22.470
 of 609 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.470
 us more than surely 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.790
 why 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:31.910
 sony really made a device 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.910
 francesca hello from diego the peter
