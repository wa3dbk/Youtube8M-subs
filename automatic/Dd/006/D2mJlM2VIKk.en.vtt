00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
as much as your store purchase shampoo

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.439 
as much as your store purchase shampoo
especially<00:04:50.889> the<00:04:50.979> ones<00:04:51.220> that<00:04:51.430> contain<00:04:51.820> as<00:04:52.060> less

especially the ones that contain as less

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.590 
especially the ones that contain as less
this<00:04:52.840> is<00:04:53.110> more<00:04:53.470> like<00:04:53.740> your<00:04:54.160> hair<00:04:54.639> wash<00:04:55.060> so

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
this is more like your hair wash so

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.840 
this is more like your hair wash so
you're<00:04:55.750> going<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.080> take<00:04:56.350> it<00:04:56.590> right<00:04:56.770> about<00:04:57.070> 1/4

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.820 
you're going to take it right about 1/4
to<00:04:58.060> 1/2<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.539> depends<00:04:58.960> on<00:04:59.020> your<00:04:59.139> hair<00:04:59.380> length<00:04:59.560> so

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
to 1/2 it depends on your hair length so

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.040 
to 1/2 it depends on your hair length so
I<00:05:00.039> would<00:05:00.220> take<00:05:00.400> 1/4<00:05:01.120> for<00:05:01.449> shoulder<00:05:01.870> length

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.120 
that's longer rather Wasteland air and
that's<00:05:07.750> right<00:05:07.990> about<00:05:08.229> how<00:05:08.380> much<00:05:08.560> you<00:05:08.710> need<00:05:08.949> to
