00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.720
 as this season is very hot 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.909
 like what I want, I'm going to move on 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.920
 tell you the ingredients worth I have here 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:36.530
 and cooked and peeled potatoes 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.920
 and then here I have 5 boiled eggs 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.019
 there we would have the salt I have here some 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.910
 mouths of these brands are a fair 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:50.630
 size half of the long 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.370
 me a jar of mayonnaise muse because my 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.470
 husband is what he likes most and in 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.540
 reality is the one that tastes stronger 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.890
 has then for the salad we 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.090
 much like it is then an onion 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.670
 entire 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.670
 a can of sweet corn 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.530
 three tins of bonito 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.900
 and then a packet of olives of these 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.259
 boneless 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.250
 what 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:25.470
 and well, now I'm going to start 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.829
 the potatoes the egg and the olives and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.659
 the mouths of the sea ​​and I tell you how I'm going 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.810
 mixing vale 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.020
 Well, I'll show you how to give birth 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.770
 I the potatoes in this case I make them in 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.770
 squares 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.760
 so now it 's less clear 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.950
 and those that starting as well as falling 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.180
 Now I'm going to do a little more 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.140
 big because it's clearing because 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.640
 same thing happens to me 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.640
 of well-known well 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.500
 a little bit later 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.030
 in these few 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.680
 is one of the men who is most 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.680
 Playing 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.000
 Y 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.650
 We highlight why we do not 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.799
 practically in 4 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.799
 do not 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.640
 and be like that 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.150
 look has stayed like this 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.550
 and now I'm going to take the onion that is 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.550
 split in squares 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.730
 and spurred everything above the 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.890
 potato for me the taste of onion 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.650
 the salad is very basic because it 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.129
 give another touch another touch totally 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.129
 different 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.450
 I would take salt and throw over this va 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.670
 to be the salt that you have to throw it goes to 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.090
 be the salt that carries all the salad 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.730
 then I'm going to take more 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.730
 sprinkle a little 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:59.940
 and so this mixture would be next 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.010
 lame and the egg that I have split more than 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.760
 caddy touch what is the knob here what 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.760
 I also add 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.500
 Now I'm going to pick the olives 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.510
 I have them itchy and it is classified 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.510
 four each 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.769
 now I take the corn and also like that 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.289
 above what I'm doing because we are 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.680
 as layers to then return everything 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.680
 together 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:33.960
 the mouths of sea ​​is so short cracks 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:36.710
 so little and also above 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.710
 a layer 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.860
 and now we would take the bonito and I do 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:50.300
 the same first 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.300
 although so bad 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.530
 we see 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.370
 and 3 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.910
 well then left like this so as not to remove it 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.600
 too 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:33.760
 or what I 'm going to add is the 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:37.040
 mayonnaise directly for later 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.750
 return it at once for no 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.480
 marear the 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.650
 the fir you already know that already commented 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.970
 that is how much it is what would give 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.330
 I'm going to show how the 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.330
 layers 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:58.739
 and now I'm going to go throwing the 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:58.739
 mayonnaise for various places 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.990
 to girls is that they paid the aspect 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:15.070
 it's finished I've already mixed it 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.870
 so you can see there I put it over 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.050
 a capita of 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:23.500
 of mayonnaise so that it is like 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.240
 more presentable and good what I'm going to what 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.190
 what I usually do is that he regretted 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.400
 fridge and while I make a second dish 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:34.660
 then take a little temperature 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.120
 of cold and you eat a lot more richer 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.990
 It's good, well, that's what I hope you 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.870
 I liked my salad retina 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:48.180
 Russian and good we have not comment it down 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.180
 it's worth until the next video bng up
