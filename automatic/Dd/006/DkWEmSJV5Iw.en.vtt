00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
so this will be our channel okay so here

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.570 
so this will be our channel okay so here
we<00:00:14.630> go<00:00:14.750> ready<00:00:15.200> while<00:00:15.680> Bisaya

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
we go ready while Bisaya

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.900 
we go ready while Bisaya
would<00:00:16.940> like<00:00:17.360> to<00:00:17.660> read<00:00:17.930> minds<00:00:18.350> these<00:00:19.010> wires<00:00:19.400> are

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
would like to read minds these wires are

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.400 
would like to read minds these wires are
used<00:00:20.540> to<00:00:21.260> get<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.890> signals<00:00:22.430> from<00:00:22.580> the<00:00:22.670> brain

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
used to get the signals from the brain

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.440 
used to get the signals from the brain
into<00:00:24.410> our<00:00:24.619> electronics<00:00:25.400> so<00:00:25.640> we<00:00:25.759> can<00:00:25.910> interpret

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
into our electronics so we can interpret
