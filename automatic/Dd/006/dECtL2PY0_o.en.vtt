lot<00:01:27.840> more<00:01:28.250> put<00:01:29.250> together<00:01:29.400> rather<00:01:29.880> than

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
lot more put together rather than

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.730 
lot more put together rather than
wearing<00:01:30.299> no<00:01:30.570> makeup<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.320> makes<00:01:31.530> sense

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
wearing no makeup if that makes sense

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.130

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
but in saying that it doesn't even feel

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.390 
but in saying that it doesn't even feel
like<00:01:34.200> you're<00:01:34.560> wearing<00:01:34.710> makeup<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> doesn't

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
that so the quality of it isn't too good

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.630 
that so the quality of it isn't too good
enough

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
enough

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.970 
enough
aspect<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.360> color<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.410> nice<00:02:13.620> so

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
I've been using it quite a lot this

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.460 
I've been using it quite a lot this
month<00:02:15.569> um<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.830> kind<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:18.470> shimmery

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470

champagne any kind of color if that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.890 
champagne any kind of color if that
