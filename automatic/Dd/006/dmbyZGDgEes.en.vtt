00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:10.490
 Let's take a look at the digest that fire racing in Japan once twice 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.560
 The starter was Nippon Ham Tadano 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.610
 This is 2 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.140
 This got momentum 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.140
 You can get out of banna sound 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.120
 This foreball pattern science chosen by root is different 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.790
 Furthermore it is not white 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.560
 Dropped before and 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.560
 Today someone says , 1 point 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.579
 In addition , in the corner in the class 5 in the first stage 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.579
 Hmm 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.030
 It is a clean up of the fifth corner in the third and fourth points 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.310
 And the meaning 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.210
 3 run which caught the tree wonderfully 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.760
 Such I've heard Well they followed the big innings that took 5 points in this one shot 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.040
 It is back of two more times 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.760
 Kiyota throws in light sand 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.240
 with this 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.240
 In addition white cell as a two-run 7 festival 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.320
 Okai Naa I was swinging, so I went to the middle of the image the day I wanted to win 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.060
 say I took the leadership to expand the in sensor 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.470
 And Sakura talk of the starting lineup four times a staple of out runner third base 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.090
 The kind 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.090
 Put the runner in the score area 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.560
 Take a hit or not 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.299
 Also five tables 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.299
 YouRin you can see 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.140
 Second Noro with Nada Mikasa 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:14.200
 It is is further 6 times table 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.489
 1 A strikeout to let you escape to this center with one outlander 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.489
 None- here 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.290
 Note wrap day 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.740
 Nakajima 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.069
 I will introduce Pura at a glance and read 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.300
 Row of trees 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:40.880
 It was a big hit that I heard it 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:45.690
 In the middle of the 7th table people are very stable 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.440
 When we meet that both big sisters are cute, we lose all three 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:54.640
 Let's flow more perfectly 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.640
 I felt like I said, I ended up with three people. 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.740
 And the back of seven times 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:10.030
 Or Naa white cell in one of Blanc's zeal first baseman from Hina excl. 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.100
 Best time to get in the way 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.330
 This is 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.510
 Hey 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.510
 It is timely and this is good, but it is from now on- 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.989
 salary 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.989
 Well then the foot light 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.610
 Bee feeding 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.750
 And the day of the day 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.460
 Straight from the motivation to shoot straight Saburo repo approach 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:41.250
 I enter this by saying a 2- digit score 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.250
 Two turns of the table turn after a long time 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.430
 The last is 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.840
 Struck out should be 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.090
 Taken Te 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.660
 0 times at the end of the game 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.450
 Now in the cold 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.270
 Is it 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.270
 Well that seems to have occupied eight chapters It is unusual family parent
