gonna<00:04:59.250> be<00:04:59.370> able<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.550> take<00:04:59.669> this<00:04:59.760> inhibitor

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
gonna be able to take this inhibitor

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.940 
gonna be able to take this inhibitor
yeah<00:05:00.600> county-owned<00:05:01.169> disarray<00:05:01.650> here<00:05:01.830> they're

though it's not beautiful now look at

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.500 
though it's not beautiful now look at
the<00:05:32.160> amount<00:05:32.400> of<00:05:32.580> damage<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:33.060> in<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.300> backline
