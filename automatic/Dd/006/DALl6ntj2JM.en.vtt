so<00:02:17.200> when<00:02:17.410> they<00:02:17.560> want<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.190> pick<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.610> choose<00:02:18.670> who

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
so when they want to pick and choose who

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.880

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
set in stone the proves what it is and

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.110 
set in stone the proves what it is and
when<00:02:26.110> they<00:02:26.200> talk<00:02:26.470> about<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.920> score<00:02:27.310> okay<00:02:27.880> I

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
when they talk about the score okay I

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.910 
when they talk about the score okay I
guess<00:02:28.510> they<00:02:28.690> can<00:02:28.870> lean<00:02:29.050> towards<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.590> because

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
guess they can lean towards that because

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.920 
guess they can lean towards that because
it<00:02:30.010> was<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.160> 4-1<00:02:30.640> game<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.090> was<00:02:31.210> out<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.420> hand<00:02:31.660> and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
it was a 4-1 game it was out of hand and

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.280 
it was a 4-1 game it was out of hand and
then<00:02:32.530> previous<00:02:33.100> incidence<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.970> okay<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.080> what

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
then previous incidence is okay so what

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.650 
then previous incidence is okay so what
does<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:35.530> mean<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.730> players<00:02:37.000> history

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
does that mean is it the players history

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.050 
does that mean is it the players history
is<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.990> pressing<00:02:38.530> into<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.830> similar<00:02:39.220> situations

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
is it pressing into a similar situations

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.449 
is it pressing into a similar situations
do<00:02:40.600> they<00:02:40.720> factor<00:02:41.200> in<00:02:41.320> gaustad<00:02:41.860> chipping<00:02:42.340> out

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
do they factor in gaustad chipping out

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.150 
do they factor in gaustad chipping out
