00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.140
 you already have a lot of ideas to be 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.630
 the most stylish during these days 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.630
 we have dresses we have lingerie 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.880
 we have shoes but we think that we 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.950
 missing some good accessories 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.810
 for that we are going to resort to our 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.119
 friend the jewelry that offers us a 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.669

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.079

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.360
 well I think that the supplements are 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.860
 something essential to decorate 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.890
 any garment that we have in the background 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:51.670

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.670
 the time of the process of getting pretty 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.960
 the blue of the sea we are dedicated 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.690
 basically to the add-ons that are 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.110
