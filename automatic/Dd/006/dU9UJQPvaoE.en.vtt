00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
is that the Sun and the moon are

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.660 
is that the Sun and the moon are
supposed<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.260> be<00:00:19.490> completely<00:00:20.490> different

supposed to be completely different

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.519 
supposed to be completely different
objects<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.570> most<00:00:21.779> dishonest<00:00:22.170> posed<00:00:22.439> to

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
objects one is most dishonest posed to

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.740 
objects one is most dishonest posed to
me

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.990 

and<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.800> moon<00:00:35.010> used<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.550> much<00:00:35.760> larger

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and then the moon used to be much larger

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.430 
and then the moon used to be much larger
disguised<00:00:36.600> because<00:00:36.930> we're<00:00:37.110> supposed<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.380> be

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
disguised because we're supposed to be

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.960 
disguised because we're supposed to be
going<00:00:37.620> around<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.980> earth<00:00:38.070> much<00:00:38.309> faster<00:00:38.790> much

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
going around the earth much faster much

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.850 
going around the earth much faster much
closer<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.050> future<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.470> will<00:00:40.559> slow

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
closer and in the future it will slow

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.860 
closer and in the future it will slow
down<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.430> spend<00:00:41.790> spiral<00:00:42.360> away<00:00:42.420> from<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
down and spend spiral away from the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.570 
down and spend spiral away from the
earth<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.739> will<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.920> much<00:00:44.070> smaller<00:00:44.370> than

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
earth and it will be much smaller than

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.119 
earth and it will be much smaller than
right<00:00:45.300> now<00:00:45.540> when<00:00:45.900> we're<00:00:46.050> all<00:00:46.230> live<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.800> simply

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
right now when we're all live to simply

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.400 
right now when we're all live to simply
look<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.820> fucking<00:00:48.180> sky<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.809> see<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> two

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
look at the fucking sky and see the two

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.740 
look at the fucking sky and see the two
together<00:00:49.790> who<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.910> same<00:00:51.150> size<00:00:51.510> they're

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
together who the same size they're

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.299 
together who the same size they're
exactly<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> same<00:00:52.320> size<00:00:52.470> there's<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
exactly the same size there's so the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.439 
exactly the same size there's so the
same<00:00:53.519> size<00:00:55.970> you<00:00:56.970> don't<00:00:57.059> see<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:57.420> moon

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
same size you don't see the moon

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.030 
same size you don't see the moon
crossing<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.350> front<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> Sun<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
crossing in front of the Sun what you

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.280 
crossing in front of the Sun what you
see<00:00:59.220> is<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.730> Sun<00:01:00.150> be<00:01:00.300> included<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.049> you<00:01:01.110> see

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
see is the Sun be included and you see

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.740 
see is the Sun be included and you see
the<00:01:01.470> corona<00:01:01.830> of<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.129> Sun<00:01:02.220> you<00:01:02.460> don't<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:03.269> is

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the corona of the Sun you don't it is

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.660 
the corona of the Sun you don't it is
just<00:01:04.019> completely<00:01:04.530> overlaid<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.250> top<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.580> them

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
just completely overlaid on top of them

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.039 
just completely overlaid on top of them
so<00:01:05.700> they're<00:01:05.909> exactly<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> same<00:01:06.479> size<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
so they're exactly the same size and I

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.810 
so they're exactly the same size and I
ask<00:01:07.229> people<00:01:07.409> does<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.010> not<00:01:08.250> smack<00:01:08.640> of

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
ask people does this not smack of

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.870 
ask people does this not smack of
artifice<00:01:10.220> not<00:01:11.220> really<00:01:11.400> knowing<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
artifice not really knowing what the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.700 
artifice not really knowing what the
fuck<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.210> was<00:01:12.299> even<00:01:12.570> trying<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.170> get<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.440> and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
fuck I was even trying to get at and

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.649 
fuck I was even trying to get at and
then<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.310> suddenly<00:01:14.520> had<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.880> realization

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.020 

the<00:01:23.229> day<00:01:23.439> let<00:01:23.680> moon<00:01:23.860> in<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.130> sky<00:01:24.219> many<00:01:24.729> times

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
the day let moon in the sky many times

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.679 
the day let moon in the sky many times
in<00:01:25.210> my<00:01:25.299> life

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
in my life

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.289 
in my life
mood<00:01:26.020> in<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.259> day<00:01:26.380> no<00:01:26.619> problem<00:01:27.039> but<00:01:27.460> after<00:01:27.789> 34

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
mood in the day no problem but after 34

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.690 
mood in the day no problem but after 34
years<00:01:28.329> I<00:01:28.689> simply<00:01:28.990> had<00:01:29.170> no<00:01:29.380> memory<00:01:29.829> of<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.369> Sun

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
years I simply had no memory of the Sun

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.149 
years I simply had no memory of the Sun
and<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.390> moon<00:01:31.420> in<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:31.990> sky<00:01:32.079> visible<00:01:32.680> together

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
and the moon in the sky visible together

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.190 
and the moon in the sky visible together
I<00:01:33.460> started<00:01:34.000> asking<00:01:34.420> other<00:01:34.600> people<00:01:34.899> did<00:01:35.049> you

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
I started asking other people did you

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.499 
I started asking other people did you
have<00:01:36.009> you<00:01:36.189> seen<00:01:36.460> this<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:36.909> most<00:01:37.060> people<00:01:37.360> said

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
have you seen this and most people said

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.929 
have you seen this and most people said
no<00:01:37.750> some<00:01:38.679> people<00:01:38.710> claimed<00:01:39.189> that<00:01:39.310> they<00:01:39.460> had<00:01:39.670> I

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
no some people claimed that they had I

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.610 
no some people claimed that they had I
didn't<00:01:40.270> believe<00:01:40.420> them

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.280 

apparently<00:01:46.400> what<00:01:46.580> I<00:01:46.820> was<00:01:47.330> saying<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.080> am

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
apparently what I was saying and am

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.100 
apparently what I was saying and am
saying<00:01:48.880> is<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:49.940> I<00:01:50.390> started<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.840> believe<00:01:50.990> that

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
saying is that I started to believe that

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.840 
saying is that I started to believe that
they<00:01:51.320> were<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.560> same<00:01:51.830> object<00:01:52.370> actually<00:01:52.580> the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
they were the same object actually the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.210 
they were the same object actually the
same<00:01:53.090> object<00:01:53.660> that<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.080> Sun<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.190> moon

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
same object that the Sun and the moon

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.620 
same object that the Sun and the moon
couldn't<00:01:55.730> be<00:01:55.850> seen<00:01:56.030> in<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.270> same<00:01:56.420> sky

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
couldn't be seen in the same sky

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.740 
couldn't be seen in the same sky
together<00:01:56.870> that's<00:01:57.290> why<00:01:57.410> you<00:01:57.470> won't<00:01:57.680> see<00:01:57.800> it

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
together that's why you won't see it

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.580
