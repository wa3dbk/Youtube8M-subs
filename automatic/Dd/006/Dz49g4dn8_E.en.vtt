00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.169 

every<00:00:01.650> day<00:00:01.800> we<00:00:02.010> throw<00:00:02.310> away<00:00:02.399> millions<00:00:02.909> of

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
every day we throw away millions of

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.970 
every day we throw away millions of
electronic<00:00:03.659> devices<00:00:03.689> because<00:00:04.560> they<00:00:04.680> get<00:00:04.770> old

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
electronic devices because they get old

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.579 
electronic devices because they get old
and<00:00:05.130> become<00:00:05.370> worn<00:00:05.609> out<00:00:06.109> but<00:00:07.109> usually<00:00:07.470> it's

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
and become worn out but usually it's

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.169 
and become worn out but usually it's
only<00:00:07.799> one<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.189> components<00:00:08.490> that<00:00:08.820> causes

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
only one of the components that causes

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.430 
only one of the components that causes
the<00:00:09.210> problem<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:12.480> rest<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.870> device<00:00:13.170> works

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
the problem the rest of the device works

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.290 
the problem the rest of the device works
fine<00:00:13.740> but<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.130> needlessly<00:00:14.519> thrown<00:00:14.849> away

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.910 

simply<00:00:18.300> because<00:00:18.449> electronic<00:00:19.289> devices<00:00:19.590> are

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
simply because electronic devices are

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.730 
simply because electronic devices are
not<00:00:20.250> designed<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.000> last<00:00:21.500> this<00:00:22.500> makes

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
not designed to last this makes

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.410 
not designed to last this makes
electronic<00:00:23.100> waste<00:00:23.430> one<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> fastest

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
electronic waste one of the fastest

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.910 
electronic waste one of the fastest
growing<00:00:24.480> waste<00:00:24.900> streams<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> world<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
growing waste streams in the world and

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.339 
growing waste streams in the world and
our<00:00:26.369> phone<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.910> one<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.480> biggest<00:00:27.630> causes

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.780 

so<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.250> new<00:00:32.520> kind<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.850> phone<00:00:34.579> it's<00:00:35.579> made

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
so this is a new kind of phone it's made

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.920 
so this is a new kind of phone it's made
of<00:00:35.910> blocks<00:00:39.320> detachable<00:00:40.320> blocks<00:00:41.690> they<00:00:42.690> are<00:00:42.750> all

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
of blocks detachable blocks they are all

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.319 
of blocks detachable blocks they are all
connected<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> base<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:45.090> base

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
connected to the base and the base

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.770 
connected to the base and the base
connects<00:00:45.809> everything<00:00:46.140> together<00:00:47.780> electrical

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
connects everything together electrical

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.330 
connects everything together electrical
signals<00:00:49.110> are<00:00:49.230> transferred<00:00:49.710> through<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> pins

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
signals are transferred through the pins

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.080 
signals are transferred through the pins
and<00:00:51.530> two<00:00:52.530> small<00:00:52.920> screws<00:00:53.250> lock<00:00:53.579> everything<00:00:53.850> in

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and two small screws lock everything in

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.930 
and two small screws lock everything in
place<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.010> instance<00:00:56.039> your<00:00:56.579> phone<00:00:56.789> is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
place so if for instance your phone is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.520 
place so if for instance your phone is
getting<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> little<00:00:57.329> slow<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.379> just

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
getting a little slow you can just

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.250 
getting a little slow you can just
upgrade<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.010> block<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.370> affects<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> speed

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
upgrade the block that affects the speed

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.590 
upgrade the block that affects the speed
or<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:01.800> something<00:01:02.190> breaks<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.449> easily
