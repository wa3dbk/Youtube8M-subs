fundamentals of this trick is the side

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.290 
fundamentals of this trick is the side
throw<00:00:15.590> and<00:00:15.830> you<00:00:16.400> can<00:00:16.520> throw<00:00:16.699> this<00:00:16.910> with<00:00:17.119> as

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
throw and you can throw this with as

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.970 
throw and you can throw this with as
many<00:00:17.600> rotations<00:00:17.990> as<00:00:18.320> you<00:00:18.500> want

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
many rotations as you want

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.960 
many rotations as you want
I'd<00:00:19.279> recommend<00:00:19.699> three<00:00:20.089> and<00:00:20.210> above<00:00:20.449> I<00:00:21.970> don't

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
I'd recommend three and above I don't

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.460 
I'd recommend three and above I don't
even<00:00:23.029> know<00:00:23.240> once<00:00:23.539> I<00:00:23.660> do<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.929> trick<00:00:24.109> how<00:00:24.259> many

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
even know once I do the trick how many

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.159 
even know once I do the trick how many
times<00:00:24.650> I<00:00:24.800> rotate<00:00:25.160> it<00:00:25.310> as<00:00:25.689> you<00:00:26.689> know<00:00:26.839> it<00:00:26.990> doesn't

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
times I rotate it as you know it doesn't

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:28.599 
times I rotate it as you know it doesn't
matter<00:00:27.410> just<00:00:27.800> as<00:00:27.859> long<00:00:27.919> as<00:00:28.189> the<00:00:28.279> trick<00:00:28.490> is

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
matter just as long as the trick is

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.220 
matter just as long as the trick is
accomplished<00:00:29.210> okay

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
accomplished okay

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.860 
accomplished okay
another<00:00:30.919> part<00:00:31.189> of<00:00:31.249> this<00:00:31.339> trick<00:00:31.609> is<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:32.599> catch

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
another part of this trick is the catch

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.790 
another part of this trick is the catch
behind<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.350> back<00:00:33.530> which<00:00:34.520> we<00:00:34.670> have<00:00:34.850> here

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.380 

important<00:00:39.800> for<00:00:39.920> this<00:00:40.010> trick<00:00:40.250> is<00:00:40.399> if<00:00:40.550> if<00:00:40.760> you

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
important for this trick is if if you

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.689 
important for this trick is if if you
tend<00:00:41.809> to<00:00:41.899> throw<00:00:42.140> it<00:00:42.260> straight<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:42.890> grab<00:00:43.670> it

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
tend to throw it straight and grab it

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.849 
tend to throw it straight and grab it
straight<00:00:44.379> chances<00:00:45.379> are<00:00:45.530> you're<00:00:45.680> going<00:00:45.800> to

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
straight chances are you're going to

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.459 
straight chances are you're going to
have<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.039> hit<00:00:46.309> you're<00:00:47.019> inside<00:00:48.019> of<00:00:48.140> your<00:00:48.230> forearm

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
have a hit you're inside of your forearm

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.569 
have a hit you're inside of your forearm
here<00:00:49.570> or<00:00:50.570> your<00:00:50.780> shoulder<00:00:51.519> whatever<00:00:53.199> so<00:00:54.199> as<00:00:54.769> I

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
here or your shoulder whatever so as I

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.250 
here or your shoulder whatever so as I
caught<00:00:55.789> that<00:00:56.000> one<00:00:56.149> I<00:00:56.179> could<00:00:56.420> feel<00:00:56.660> it<00:00:56.840> hit<00:00:57.050> here

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
caught that one I could feel it hit here

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.540 
caught that one I could feel it hit here
before<00:00:57.590> he<00:00:57.679> bounced<00:00:57.829> it<00:00:57.980> on<00:00:58.070> my<00:00:58.129> hand<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.519> that

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
before he bounced it on my hand and that

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.209 
before he bounced it on my hand and that
that<00:00:58.879> that<00:00:58.910> catch<00:00:59.390> was<00:00:59.600> purely<00:00:59.960> luck<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:01.160> you

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
that that catch was purely luck so you

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.970 
that that catch was purely luck so you
want<00:01:01.519> to<00:01:01.609> try<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:01.820> angle<00:01:02.269> it<00:01:02.359> a<00:01:02.570> little<00:01:03.289> bit<00:01:03.710> a

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
want to try to angle it a little bit a

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
want to try to angle it a little bit a
little<00:01:04.640> bit<00:01:04.879> forward<00:01:05.300> so<00:01:06.260> that<00:01:06.460> that<00:01:07.460> handle

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
little bit forward so that that handle

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.540 
little bit forward so that that handle
goes<00:01:08.630> away<00:01:08.870> from<00:01:09.080> your<00:01:09.230> forearm<00:01:09.620> and

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
goes away from your forearm and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.520 
goes away from your forearm and
therefore<00:01:10.970> you'll<00:01:11.120> never<00:01:11.360> encounter<00:01:11.960> that

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
therefore you'll never encounter that

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.040 
therefore you'll never encounter that
problem<00:01:13.100> of<00:01:13.280> this<00:01:13.700> club<00:01:14.030> actually<00:01:14.420> hitting

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
problem of this club actually hitting

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.110 
problem of this club actually hitting
the<00:01:15.170> bottom<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.530> your<00:01:15.620> forearm<00:01:16.030> before<00:01:17.030> it

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
the bottom of your forearm before it

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.190 
the bottom of your forearm before it
gets<00:01:17.300> into<00:01:17.510> your<00:01:17.660> hand

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
gets into your hand

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.180 
gets into your hand
another<00:01:18.530> element<00:01:18.980> of<00:01:19.160> this<00:01:19.340> trick<00:01:19.640> is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
another element of this trick is

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.640 
another element of this trick is
juggling<00:01:22.190> three<00:01:22.430> clubs<00:01:22.460> of<00:01:22.820> course<00:01:23.650> it's

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
juggling three clubs of course it's

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.770 
juggling three clubs of course it's
actually<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.160> multiplex<00:01:25.730> throw<00:01:26.030> now<00:01:26.600> there's

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
actually the multiplex throw now there's

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.880 
actually the multiplex throw now there's
two<00:01:26.900> ways<00:01:26.930> to<00:01:27.080> do<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.410> multiplex

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
two ways to do the multiplex

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.770 
two ways to do the multiplex
behind-the-back<00:01:28.310> we<00:01:28.640> can<00:01:28.790> do<00:01:28.910> it<00:01:29.060> like<00:01:29.510> this

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
behind-the-back we can do it like this

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.470 
behind-the-back we can do it like this
as<00:01:30.020> we<00:01:30.920> notice<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.310> clubs<00:01:31.550> come<00:01:31.790> out<00:01:31.940> nearly

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
as we notice the clubs come out nearly

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.650 
as we notice the clubs come out nearly
parallel<00:01:33.550> okay<00:01:35.740> but<00:01:36.740> now<00:01:36.920> if<00:01:37.280> we<00:01:37.360> take<00:01:38.360> the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
parallel okay but now if we take the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.210 
parallel okay but now if we take the
club<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.310> our<00:01:40.310> grip<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.350> we<00:01:42.350> take<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:42.980> first

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
club and our grip and we take the first

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.150 
club and our grip and we take the first
Club<00:01:44.080> move<00:01:45.080> it<00:01:45.200> up<00:01:45.320> into<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.680> position<00:01:46.100> a

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
Club move it up into the position a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.520 
Club move it up into the position a
little<00:01:46.280> bit<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:47.090> happens<00:01:47.420> then<00:01:47.660> is<00:01:47.900> we<00:01:48.410> get

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
little bit what happens then is we get

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.090 
little bit what happens then is we get
something<00:01:48.770> like<00:01:48.890> this<00:01:50.560> notice<00:01:51.560> how<00:01:51.650> that<00:01:51.710> club

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
something like this notice how that club

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.149 
something like this notice how that club
goes<00:01:52.310> higher

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.010 

it's<00:01:55.820> all<00:01:55.909> about<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.330> physics<00:01:56.659> on<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:56.960> one

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
it's all about the physics on that one

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.109 
it's all about the physics on that one
or<00:02:00.020> maybe<00:02:00.290> it's<00:02:00.439> just<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.680> grip<00:02:02.170> anyway<00:02:03.170> so

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
or maybe it's just a grip anyway so

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.490 
or maybe it's just a grip anyway so
these<00:02:05.119> are<00:02:05.330> all<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.570> elements<00:02:05.659> of<00:02:06.049> this<00:02:06.200> trick

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
these are all the elements of this trick

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.930 
these are all the elements of this trick
that<00:02:06.770> we're<00:02:07.280> going<00:02:07.400> to<00:02:07.490> have<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.820> be

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
that we're going to have to be

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.630 
that we're going to have to be
comfortable<00:02:08.569> with<00:02:08.780> doing<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.370> want<00:02:13.580> to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
comfortable with doing so you want to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.390 
comfortable with doing so you want to
get<00:02:13.730> these<00:02:13.850> moves<00:02:14.120> down<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.360> where<00:02:14.690> it's<00:02:14.840> easy

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
get these moves down to where it's easy

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.770 
get these moves down to where it's easy
before<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.489> try<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.930> entire<00:02:18.020> trick<00:02:19.750> what<00:02:20.750> I

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
before you try the entire trick what I

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.670 
before you try the entire trick what I
would<00:02:21.020> practice<00:02:21.200> first<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:24.140> side<00:02:24.410> throw

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
would practice first is that side throw

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.940 
would practice first is that side throw
making<00:02:25.340> sure<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.550> can<00:02:25.670> get<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.790> comfortable

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
making sure you can get a comfortable

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.100 
making sure you can get a comfortable
rotation<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.880> know<00:02:29.000> on<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:29.600> trick<00:02:29.900> if<00:02:30.080> you

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
rotation you know on this trick if you

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.530 
rotation you know on this trick if you
catch<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.440> backwards<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.970> really<00:02:32.209> doesn't

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
catch it backwards it really doesn't

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.370 
catch it backwards it really doesn't
matter<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:33.650> know<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:35.750> try<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:35.989> get<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.260> so

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
matter you know just try to get it so

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.660 
matter you know just try to get it so
that<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.620> can<00:02:36.769> throw<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.950> comfortable<00:02:37.430> side

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
that you can throw a comfortable side

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.870 
that you can throw a comfortable side
throw<00:02:37.970> maybe<00:02:38.870> even<00:02:39.170> multiple<00:02:39.620> ones<00:02:39.880> will

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
throw maybe even multiple ones will

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.930 
throw maybe even multiple ones will
really<00:02:41.150> solidify<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.930> throw<00:02:42.530> for<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:47.830> okay

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
really solidify that throw for you okay

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.210 
really solidify that throw for you okay
now<00:02:49.940> we<00:02:50.000> can<00:02:50.330> try<00:02:50.540> behind<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.440> back<00:02:51.620> on<00:02:51.920> its

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
now we can try behind the back on its

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.620 
now we can try behind the back on its
own<00:02:53.769> from<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.920> Cascade<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.760> well<00:02:56.510> you'll

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
own from the Cascade that is well you'll

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.410 
own from the Cascade that is well you'll
notice<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.430> trick<00:02:58.430> is<00:02:58.610> stopped<00:02:58.940> anyway<00:02:59.360> so

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
notice the trick is stopped anyway so

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.120 
notice the trick is stopped anyway so
whether<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.900> practice<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.410> from<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.650> cascade

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
whether you practice it from a cascade

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.340 
whether you practice it from a cascade
or<00:03:01.340> not<00:03:01.489> really<00:03:01.760> doesn't<00:03:01.940> matter<00:03:02.299> because<00:03:02.780> the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
or not really doesn't matter because the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.410 
or not really doesn't matter because the
trick<00:03:03.620> is<00:03:03.799> stopped<00:03:04.130> once<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.000> go<00:03:05.150> for<00:03:05.360> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
trick is stopped once you go for the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.980 
and there you have it it's a trick that
I<00:04:42.400> like<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.759> think<00:04:42.819> that<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.120> invented<00:04:43.479> but<00:04:43.870> we

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
I like to think that I invented but we

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.110 
I like to think that I invented but we
all<00:04:44.110> know<00:04:44.350> it's<00:04:45.069> probably<00:04:45.370> done<00:04:45.490> 50<00:04:45.669> years<00:04:46.000> ago

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
all know it's probably done 50 years ago

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.509 
all know it's probably done 50 years ago
anyway
