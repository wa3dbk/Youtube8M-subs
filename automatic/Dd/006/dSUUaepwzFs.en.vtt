that<00:04:10.880> would<00:04:11.030> be<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.330> down<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.540> road<00:04:11.810> that's

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
that would be you down a road that's

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.860 
that would be you down a road that's
going<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.170> leave<00:04:12.320> you<00:04:12.500> in<00:04:12.530> poor<00:04:13.190> health<00:04:13.460> but<00:04:13.870> I

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
going to leave you in poor health but I

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.150 
going to leave you in poor health but I
would<00:04:15.590> suggest<00:04:15.890> that<00:04:16.489> you<00:04:17.470> seek<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.500> eliminate

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
would suggest that you seek to eliminate

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.550 
would suggest that you seek to eliminate
insoluble<00:04:22.160> 5

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
insoluble 5

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.610 
insoluble 5
fiber<00:04:22.830> that<00:04:23.010> doesn't<00:04:23.460> break<00:04:23.669> down<00:04:23.700> or

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
fiber that doesn't break down or

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.700 
fiber that doesn't break down or
minimize<00:04:25.620> as<00:04:25.950> much<00:04:25.980> as<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.520> can<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.560> I<00:04:28.560> would

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
minimize as much as you can and I would

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.450 
minimize as much as you can and I would
suggest<00:04:28.980> that<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:30.770> maximize<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:32.040> amount<00:04:32.130> of

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
suggest that you maximize the amount of

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.700 
suggest that you maximize the amount of
soluble<00:04:33.360> fiber<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.870> fiber<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:34.290> breaks<00:04:34.560> down

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
soluble fiber the fiber that breaks down

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.480 
soluble fiber the fiber that breaks down
into<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.100> nice<00:04:35.310> easy<00:04:35.639> to<00:04:35.880> des<00:04:36.150> goop<00:04:37.160> once<00:04:38.160> you

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
into a nice easy to des goop once you

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.250 
into a nice easy to des goop once you
eat<00:04:38.880> it<00:04:38.910> when<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:39.300> comes<00:04:39.540> in<00:04:39.660> contact<00:04:39.690> with

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
eat it when it comes in contact with

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.070 
eat it when it comes in contact with
water<00:04:40.700> this<00:04:41.700> is<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:41.910> stuff<00:04:42.240> that's<00:04:42.389> in<00:04:42.660> fruit

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
water this is the stuff that's in fruit

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.470 
water this is the stuff that's in fruit
and<00:04:43.380> this<00:04:43.530> is<00:04:43.710> why<00:04:43.950> when<00:04:44.580> people<00:04:44.610> adopt<00:04:45.210> fruit

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
and this is why when people adopt fruit

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.900 
and this is why when people adopt fruit
based<00:04:45.690> diets<00:04:46.169> they<00:04:46.590> see<00:04:46.650> so<00:04:47.220> much<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.669> an

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
based diets they see so much of an

genetically defective as my doctor told
me<00:05:31.110> about<00:05:31.200> my<00:05:31.440> colitis<00:05:31.890> in<00:05:32.460> fact<00:05:32.640> these<00:05:32.910> are

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
me about my colitis in fact these are

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.820 
me about my colitis in fact these are
things<00:05:33.300> that<00:05:33.419> if<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:33.990> just<00:05:34.140> change<00:05:34.260> what<00:05:34.740> you

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
things that if you just change what you

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.090 
things that if you just change what you
eat<00:05:35.010> you<00:05:35.700> can<00:05:35.729> probably<00:05:36.150> get<00:05:36.570> rid<00:05:36.720> of<00:05:37.010> so<00:05:38.010> you

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
eat you can probably get rid of so you

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.230 
eat you can probably get rid of so you
might<00:05:38.250> want<00:05:38.400> to<00:05:38.430> check<00:05:38.580> out<00:05:38.729> that<00:05:38.760> book<00:05:38.940> if

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240
