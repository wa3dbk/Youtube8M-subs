00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.870
 because david werker you see us right 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.670
 are still with nintendo still 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.450
 We just looked at each other and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.310
 now I see that there are in any case 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.679
 a little bit more important 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.160
 In any case directly over to 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:25.480
 screen boy 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.000
 the new plant a or the new old wake 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.770
 up because it has a new edition 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.050
 get for the un before the 1080p with 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.420
 shadow light effects with all the drum 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.230
 and where you can see already sees 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.300
 Really compared to the gamecube version 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.449
 really really cool out of there I have to 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.580
 Yes, that's what I 'm told when it comes out 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.370
 you will even get fired and immediately 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.360
 let's play zone fun what do we see then 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.730
 takes I still do not even know 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.980
 we have the inventory on the quasi 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.960
 on the gamepad we have the inventory 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.329
 you can see much more pleasant I have to say 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.309
 and cool abroad so it works out very well 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.619
 very nice so I have to say that 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.570
 that would now say in me now 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.070
 why megageil gloss effect or even 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.440
 almost not a craftsman we have her 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.300
 tent shading look but shadow or something 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.520
 what you could not before by so 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.920
 already looks really cool you have time 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.210
 quite nice is a very different mood 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.340
 And I think that's the game 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.730
 simply completely re-experience 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.080
 easy 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.580
 we are we are also right now 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.540
 on the island so there is now 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.430
 really at the very beginning 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.900
 look like that in the houses themselves 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.820
 looks 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.810
 Maybe something has happened there 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.220
 can now of course I do not know the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.320
 more heart do not know whether the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.450
 detail level still waiting 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.760
 but he does not really pull now 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.330
 then pretty emaciated from yes 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.070
 yes, they are pretty emaciated 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.080
 but you have to say so honestly 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.420
 graphically at the right place out well from the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.420
 play and I believe for all this 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.700
 still do not know at that time in any case 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.450
 Supplement without fun the game is right 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.950
 really cool 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.110
 so you can not say otherwise with 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.030
 one of my favorite titles and 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.920
 for those already know it then too 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.479
 have loved to play need you 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.610
 consider whether it drives you that again 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.619
 is for me in any case, I am happy 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.720
 It was going to take care of everyone 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.760
 case let's play definitely when it 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.120
 comes out and I'm not sure yet 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.350
 when you know yourself better then yes me 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.420
 'm not sure I really 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.880
 so also christian again 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.140
 play or you in any case there 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.150
 you can not really get past it 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.540
 Of course, it's a bit lean now 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.770
 of nintendo again this year I 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.770
 Now first of all have such a remake 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.910
 bring back I find a bit 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.830
 live somewhere but we are not allowed to 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.230
 forget that for the 3ds yes one more 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.130
 link between worlds comes out the second 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.270
 part of the link to the past 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.990
 I'm looking forward to it anyway 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.690
 rough on it but I think for now 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.490
 then left it comes out with the hd 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.260
 wind waker clearly very good 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.940
 served as said treats to 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.810
 beat and we are still looking at each other 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.810
 a bit to skin pure
