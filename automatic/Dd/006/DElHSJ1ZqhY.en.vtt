 I asked him not to stay but 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.670
 our workspace you already know that 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.320
 I am not a professional with which I do not 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.650
 I have clients because my mother and my aunt 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.170
 they do not count, I think, and I got a little bit like that 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.780
 that I'm going to indicate more good then 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.100
 where do I nail and with numbers 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.530
 organize 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.850
 It is worth here I show you my last 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.149
 exhibition that has come to me this same 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.789
 tomorrow that is the handy of practices of 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.420
 wood that buy animal in my brother 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.420
 what good by the way 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.670
 and this is where the pot my desk 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.879
 because I have not said we have 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.370
 nail space and I still do not have how 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.449
 I am skilled everything I need because I do not 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.080
 I usually put it to the right so 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:13.070
 like the acrylics or my mosque 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.020
 my cover the clear here I have the monomer 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.909
 that he used for practices with the dropper 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.429
 Y 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.649
 and the dispenser almost the entire floor 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.530
 I put alcohol in case you make the 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:29.030
 Gel nails 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.340
 I have the big ones I have here I have a 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.909
 believer be here I have hydrated before 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.319
 the landlord and remove possible I need the 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.730
 I have all in small boats and as has been 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.000
 saying 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.330
 to the right then here as you will see 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.340
 I have a little invention it because it 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.080
 they buy a cushion to make nails 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.720
 and here where I live found a store 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.420
 but they were asking me then they were 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.460
 five or seven euros for the cushion and clear 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.610
 well, it does not suit me to spend that 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.850
 money so what I did was with a 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.980
 I bought a toner for my printer that 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.650
 I needed and what is the protector that 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.630
 it did not come from chubby plastic so 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.319
 as told by bubble because if we 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.719
 to make a fix 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.269
 and with my desire that I had here at home 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:25.510
 to make a scarf that comes to do 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:30.280
 the suitcase and very well then here would be 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:33.069
 I took because I have my towel service 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.049
 with the girl before him is bamboo under 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.890
 because I do not think that the table stains 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.540
 from the desk 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.100
 since I have the templates in case 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.290
 I want to do some kind of design I do not know 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.319
 how to do it because what advances in the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.010
 small templates 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.010
 when I need something else and I do not want it 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.870
 put on the table because it is what it is not 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.700
 It is wider and I have drawers or anything 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.180
 like you, what I do is 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.150
 to the end that is next and thus 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.550
 I turn a little bit and you see the printer 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.680
 and the kindle and the computer as I have 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.720
 to have on top of the desk 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.150
 who has everyone here in this base 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.470
 here I support what would be what you need 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.300
 and with the right hand as it is injected 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.660
 as I said the numbers 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.610
 reaching and such and nothing as this would be 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.090
 more or less work units and then 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.430
 also because I'm in my room 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.500
 as you will see, I have a small 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.010
 revisit that it would be this fernando light 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.980
 where I already have the paintbrushes a bit 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.860
 of the biggest alcohol the boat for 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.610
 clean the brushes the oil 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.560
 cuticles the bundle and the teeth that do not 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.720
 It works by drawers is a moment is 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.459
 here I have the wipes and such and then 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.180
 I have these two drawers bought in the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.120
 Chinese from my village 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.379
 ok I have two cashiers these two already 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.140
 which is where I'm already organizing what 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.629
 are the things you will see for example in this 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.129
 from here that is higher is worth here 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.609
 would be what acrylics are 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.900
 colors that I made with the umbrellas here 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.750
 for example I have an idea of what they would be 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.520
 the gels some kind of mix here I have 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.840
 the dual 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:16.800
 ok here would be the tender teaspoons 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.760
 in the practice rites the cups a 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.560
 bit 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.890
 a pigment that about what I have now 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.890
 I think it 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.370
 and already in the last one here because they are the 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:34.240
 raw here I have cuticle in the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.240
 nail treatments 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:43.110
 and these particles is a bit 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:44.409
 in addition the spare brushes and this 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.300
 drawer 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.369
 then here for example is the other 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.370
 chest of drawers that there is a little 

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:53.300
 decoration because 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.099
 is a little bit that is in this drawer is 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.099
 a little bit of decoration and 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:02.460
 the monocytes of 3 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.680
 they 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:10.190
 here is everything that is for 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.190
 action here there is a mode with droplets 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.820
 one 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.120
 and below the leader the foreign pelito 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.970
 the truth 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.150
 right now and in this I have the 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.240
 tips and some glazes I had here 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.360
 to have them more at hand and that's worth 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.160
 and in the last drawer 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.949
 well here for example I keep what they are 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.500
 the decorations the stickers that 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.349
 is the story of many of you and 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.849
 the plates are page is here 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.110
 masks for filing because the 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:49.360
 I have not used it because as I have 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.060
 I do not have a clientele but I do know that 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.039
 I have because I did not have them badly at home 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.340
 I have another spoon game I have to 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.500

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.930
 my mortar that the best example is black 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.590
 I have a picture I do not know I suppose everything 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:07.200
 have a bit of a side and then we passed 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.900
 is here 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:14.370
 it's worth the big chest of drawers here 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.930
 as you see I have open for example here 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:21.160

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:23.000

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.410
 here that is cuticles 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.750
 the clamps to which the molds 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:36.370
 reusable a little in habit 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:40.310
 here I have what are the little boats 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:45.160
 these are colorful acrylics here is 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:47.840
 the lathe and then already in the last drawer 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:52.340
 in that is already 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:56.120

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.300
 grams 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:05.910
 the acrylic work 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.340
 this I think is the summary behind I have 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.690
 to the client plastic decrees and 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.289

 and that's him 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.780
 and that would be what I know 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:27.420
 what to do to have here all as I have 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:31.490
 said and that and approach and that would be my 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.490
 work area what I usually use 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.190
 with blonde anal thanks for leaving 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.200

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.360
 have clients 

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.980
 and giving a pleasure to share with you 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.980
 my little nail space
