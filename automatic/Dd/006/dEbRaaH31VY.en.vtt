which I absolutely love and then the
trim<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.380> know<00:02:42.500> fits<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.040> whole<00:02:43.070> bonnet

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
this side which I thought was odd but

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.320 
this side which I thought was odd but
whatever<00:02:50.870> whatever<00:02:51.380> AG<00:02:51.860> wants<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.250> do<00:02:52.430> it's
