probably know what's in this box or you
have<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.619> clue<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.120> personally<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> think<00:00:34.200> that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
have a clue so personally I think that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.250 
have a clue so personally I think that
it<00:00:35.250> could<00:00:35.280> hold<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> jet<00:00:35.940> pack<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.450> doesn't

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it could hold the jet pack it doesn't

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.930 
it could hold the jet pack it doesn't
have<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:38.010> now<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.820> we

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
have it right now as you can see we

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.400 
have it right now as you can see we
don't<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.239> can't<00:00:39.480> see<00:00:39.690> inside<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.290> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
don't we can't see inside of it it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.500 
don't we can't see inside of it it
possibly<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.670> were<00:00:41.760> not<00:00:41.940> able<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.239> wall

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
possibly can we were not able to wall

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.200 
possibly can we were not able to wall
breach<00:00:42.780> into<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.620> unfortunately<00:00:44.370> by<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> way

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
breach into it unfortunately by the way

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.150 
breach into it unfortunately by the way

what<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.860> guys<00:00:50.070> think<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.360> think

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
what do you guys think in here I think

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.970 
what do you guys think in here I think
it's<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.780> jetpack<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.530> what<00:00:52.710> else<00:00:52.800> could

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
it's the jetpack because what else could

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.279 
it's the jetpack because what else could
be<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.510> right<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.570> front<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.870> those<00:00:55.020> doors

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
be in here right in front of those doors

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.200 
be in here right in front of those doors
over<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.190> could<00:00:56.370> open<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> doors<00:00:56.969> up

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
over there you could open the doors up

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.450 
over there you could open the doors up
and<00:00:57.449> then<00:00:57.570> these<00:00:57.780> concrete<00:00:58.530> block<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.190> could

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and then these concrete block you could

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.840 
and then these concrete block you could
somehow<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.390> something<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.670> open<00:01:02.670> that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
somehow do something to it and open that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.250 
somehow do something to it and open that
up<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.570> could<00:01:03.719> pick<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> jet

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
up and that you could pick up the jet

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.350 
up and that you could pick up the jet
pack<00:01:04.580> that's<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> only<00:01:05.970> thing<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.180> could<00:01:06.240> think

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
pack that's the only thing I could think

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.450 
pack that's the only thing I could think
of<00:01:06.630> right<00:01:06.810> now<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.409> gives<00:01:08.130> us<00:01:08.280> so

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
of right now but it just gives us so

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.480 
of right now but it just gives us so
many<00:01:08.610> things<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.090> work<00:01:09.450> off<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.890> now<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:10.950> really

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
many things to work off of now we really

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.969 
many things to work off of now we really
do<00:01:11.909> because<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.570> wasn't<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.470> old

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
do because this wasn't in the old

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.280 
do because this wasn't in the old
generation<00:01:14.520> consoles<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> Xbox<00:01:15.509> 360<00:01:16.170> or

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
generation consoles like the Xbox 360 or

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.510 
generation consoles like the Xbox 360 or
ps3<00:01:16.520> it's<00:01:17.520> really<00:01:17.970> highly<00:01:18.920> plausible<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.460> it

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
ps3 it's really highly plausible that it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.390 
ps3 it's really highly plausible that it
could<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.500> i<00:01:22.799> think<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
could be in here so i think it's the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.399 
could be in here so i think it's the
jetpack<00:01:23.850> let<00:01:24.509> me<00:01:24.570> know<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> guys<00:01:25.140> think

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
jetpack let me know what you guys think

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.980 
jetpack let me know what you guys think
in<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> comments<00:01:26.130> section<00:01:26.159> below<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.810> we're

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
in the comments section below so we're

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.690 
in the comments section below so we're
going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> switch<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.650> screen<00:01:28.950> shot<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
going to switch the screen shot here and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.520 
going to switch the screen shot here and
now<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.880> guys<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.299> see<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.079> box<00:01:31.320> is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
now you guys can see that the box is

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.859 
now you guys can see that the box is
fully<00:01:31.860> closed<00:01:32.220> off<00:01:32.520> unfortunately<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.479> thought

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
fully closed off unfortunately I thought

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.140 
fully closed off unfortunately I thought
it<00:01:34.020> might<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:34.290> open<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.040> side<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
it might be open on this side if you

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.910 
it might be open on this side if you
open<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> door<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.530> seems<00:01:37.770> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
open like the door because it seems to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.069 
open like the door because it seems to
be<00:01:37.950> there's<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> door<00:01:38.670> right<00:01:38.939> where<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
be there's a door right where the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.230 
be there's a door right where the
writing<00:01:40.500> kind<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.100> over<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.850> left<00:01:41.939> of

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.750 
would ruin the jetpack mystery if we
found<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.530> through<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> glitch<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.520> I'm
