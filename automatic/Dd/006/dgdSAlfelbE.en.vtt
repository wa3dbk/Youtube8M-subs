00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.530
 world give us an unusual 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.590
 but also in some areas 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.610
 half-baked round strategy game 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.290
 In terms of content, he is most likely to be involved 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.870
 genre representatives like might magic heroes 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.340
 and king's bounty, however, compare 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.290
 the focus is more on a pseudo 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.610
 historical middle ages setting magic 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.610
 and fantasy only exist in moderation 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.430
 in the extensive campaign already 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.469
 a variety of quest cards 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.079

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.940
 and lay slaughtering house while it goes in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.769
 the rule very leisurely because the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.129
 Free rotate and zoomable 3d strategy 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.150
 pause at any time and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.190
 character selects you from three 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.259
 predetermined figures from the knight 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.149
 emerges as a close associate the baroness as 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.940
 Farmer Rind and humble quasi as 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.710
 sorcerer what values ​​or talents the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.630
 figures have it on the main 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.950
 Character was 0 info bought quasi the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.950
 cat in the bag silly solved 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.700
 in real time grazed by graphically whole 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.100
 beautifully staged medieval 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.740
 landscapes stuffed castles villages 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.300
 and many npcs once you have a building 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.200
 entered the game switches in 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.200
 corresponding menu like that 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.150
 a powerful troupe 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.110
 establish 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.310
 can you also a variety 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.159
 different units 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.690
 would have to resort to cheer them 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.030
 go to the appropriate building 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.680
 the number of controlled castles 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.479
 Defines how many units here 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.040
 could recruit nothing about it 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.010
 In addition, even the daily 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.810
 want to be paid 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.370
 the units work one 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.900
 strict stone scissors paper principle 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.640
 Memory is the effective one 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.060
 compilation a motivating one though 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.170
 also about constantly tinkering work 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.700
 you may already be missing 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.979
 namely, there is sound 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.020
 but not in heaps and in part 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.460
 long texts in german 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.050
 are quite useful 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.240
 and whoever makes the effort all too 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.950
 reading gets a lot 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.240
 background information to reflect 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.800
 Useful rumors and lay them down 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.110
 it comes to ears to save that 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.760
 automatically play as a memo from it 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.830
 arise next to tasks and puzzles 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.150
 sometimes difficult to crack are you 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.730
 but with valuable equipment 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.770
 reward the individual quest areas 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.990
 should be very big time for 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.310
 long walks are an optional option 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.520
 fast travel function does not exist 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.630
 what a shame 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.980
 at all it is sometimes hard to 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.930
 quest to follow 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.700
 Although there is a conceivable now and then 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.470
 Note points on the card often but 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.390
 also not the quest descriptions 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.520
 let's get you started 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.230
 bombard you with npc names 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.150
 and you the relevant people in 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.800
 troublesome search first find out 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.660
 we have to do this 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.870
 painfully a memo in the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.870
 game 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.660
 a nice feature makes the 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.190
 Equipment box 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.900
 every unit can be combined with one 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.060
 equip a lot of objects 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.860
 weapons armor jewelry and potions 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.050
 influence talents and attributes yours 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.450
 figure that makes for a nice 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.069
 roleplaying aspect is possible 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.989
 that in the inventory for the straight 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.640
 selected figure always the most useful 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.390
 items first and green deposited 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.390
 to be ordered 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.049
 lately have forest stands out 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.810
 especially by its unusual 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.730
 Round fighting system in a battle 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.459
 there is no pure movement but 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.439
 only action trains, therefore, it applies 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.389
 an action in calm the positions and 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.709
 to look at the value units and the 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.010
 to plan next train 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.629
 basically a game of chess 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.970
 on the left side of the screen is 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.709
 the initiative bar shows in 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.840
 which order the units at the train 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.610
 are a high pace of playing is likely 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.409
 do not expect and the contrary 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.799
 battles drag on pretty much in the 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.150
 length 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.049
 therefore we show you this fight 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.049
 course in timelapse 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.950
 Through the fighting your troops are gathering 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.390
 Experience and rising level on for 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.100
 each troop type stand their own 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.420
 classrooms available around one 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.640
 specialize unit 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.080
 this in turn results for each 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.570
 unit different talents and 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.370
 special skills beginner friendly 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.870
 this system is not straight but 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.910
 is more patient and patient 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.560
 experienced players since the 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.090
 Specializations are not reversible 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.710
 can it ever happen that the 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.240
 own army no chance against the 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.320
 If you are on the 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.120
 set wrong units has frequent 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.920
 Try out is therefore the result what 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.310
 sometimes exhausting city ​​entertaining 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.020
 fails 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.850
 finally you have your perfect troupe 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.710
 so they can be together 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.180
 opposing borrow building and warehouse 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.220
 take what you strategic 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.840
 brings benefits we can 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.880
 for example, with the help of garnison 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.590
 station your own troops 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.690
 then the defense automatically 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.320
 take over and staged spectacularly 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.320
 but useful 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.150
 in the course of the game it comes after all 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.040
 even to a pinch of fantasy in the last 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.620
 forest have so fought against zombies 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.660
 Ghosts witches werewolves and undead 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.520
 Summoner da provides extra 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.100
 Variation as he uses new tactics 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.800
 must ghosts are for example immune against 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.840
 Physical attacks are the fundamental ones 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.850
 Ideas in the game are good and nice 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.980
 for the duration of the game, fun costs are 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.510
 to simply call them weak 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.010
 presentation the stale technique and 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.370
 the missing word and dynamics the 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.370
 fight 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.620
 Nevertheless, Legends has iron forest 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.730
 a not to be denied swan 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.260
 patient games with one 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.260
 rewarded unusual medieval game
