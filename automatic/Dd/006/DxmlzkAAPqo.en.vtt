00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
get to it so here you go so this is

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.180 
get to it so here you go so this is
broken<00:00:52.020> down<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> couple<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.890> different

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
broken down to a couple of different

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.740 
broken down to a couple of different
ways<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:54.030> I'm<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.270> focus<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.690> right

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
ways what I'm going to focus on right

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.660 
ways what I'm going to focus on right
now<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.170> called<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> opener<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
now it's called the opener this is the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.040 
now it's called the opener this is the
initial<00:00:56.940> moment<00:00:57.539> where<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.780> introduce

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
initial moment where you introduce

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.500 
initial moment where you introduce
yourself<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> openers<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.940> be<00:01:00.059> broken

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
yourself so the openers can be broken

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.299 
yourself so the openers can be broken
down<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.989> two<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.440> three<00:01:01.680> different<00:01:01.859> ways<00:01:02.100> I'm

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
down to two to three different ways I'm

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.139 
down to two to three different ways I'm
going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> break<00:01:02.640> them<00:01:02.730> down<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.000> two

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
going to break them down to two

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.700 
going to break them down to two
different<00:01:03.329> ways<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.080> that's<00:01:04.589> how

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
different ways because that's that's how

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.260 
different ways because that's that's how
I<00:01:04.769> break<00:01:04.920> them<00:01:05.220> down<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.970> they're<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
I break them down so they're the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.840 
I break them down so they're the
indirect<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> direct<00:01:07.590> ways<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.369> direct

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
indirect and the direct ways the direct

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.880 
indirect and the direct ways the direct
ways<00:01:09.090> guys<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:10.080> those<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.619> who<00:01:10.860> are

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
giving off an incredible energy I had to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.350 
giving off an incredible energy I had to
come<00:01:26.310> over<00:01:26.520> here<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:26.970> what<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.210> day

direct approach keep that in mind so

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.700 
direct approach keep that in mind so
this<00:02:39.180> indirect<00:02:39.630> approach<00:02:39.780> consists<00:02:40.620> of

this indirect approach consists of

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.520 
this indirect approach consists of
things<00:02:41.010> like<00:02:41.340> asking<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.240> girl's<00:02:42.510> opinion<00:02:42.900> you
