00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.790
 Hi guys all right is the following in this 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.440
 video I want to do something a little 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.210
 different with you I kind of 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.340
 did a tutorial on something well 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.619
 simple headstrong because the galley 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.690
 twitter show now that would be a good 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.520
 idea then I'll show you how 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.350
 Do something nice to answer, I'll 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.130
 give her an example of what I now have 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.230
 one button on this wall I buttonhole 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.449
 Thana I have entrance for my 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.270
 My house here to my hiding place I 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.309
 I came in here and hit the button again. 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.140
 it closes and I get here safely 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.200
 inside my hiding place I can come 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.270
 here press the button again to exit and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.030
 do this once again push the button 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.559
 Let's go, I'll talk again. 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.559
 these things all with you now 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.320
 So, people, what I want to show 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.810
 You're how this mechanism works. 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.330
 here the very simple mechanism is 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.220
 you can drive a door on one side 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.440
 or an entry of something from 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.900
 and close on the other side of the 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.610
 The way I showed here this portal 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.750
 What are you seeing here? I already did a 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.280
 his tutorial 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.350
 if you want to know how does the tutorial 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.430
 not the eliza mechanism and to 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.260
 off 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.970
 click on the description bar that I will 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.530
 put the link to the video not only the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.720
 link to the video but I'll put the link 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.520
 for the exact moment of the video where the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.770
 trade is explained which starts 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.990
 explain this portal here for you more 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.330
 Let's talk about this mechanism here I did 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.369
 one something else up here to 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.160
 Show me, let's go, it's the next. 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.619
 this mechanism is called the a-team flip 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.060
 flop this is the name you are what you 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.330
 can do with it you push the button 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.130
 on one side it goes to the ignition of a 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.390
 Tone network system will keep a 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.520
 activated if you are seeing that the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.000
 door is open and you can go through 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.560
 Furthermore press another button and another 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.899
 the deal will close 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.819
 This is how it works how I do it 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.740
 exactly the mechanism I 'm going to 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.810
 show you now is one thing until 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.910
 known in a day-care center but for the last 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.440
 video where I told of the things of 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.819
 harrison had a lot of people here who did not 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440
 understood how to become like who? 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.130
 answer does not understand thing 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.360
 simple 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.190
 so I think there are a lot of people who do not 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.319
 You know what it is worth showing to 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.270
 you for you give an enhanced and 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.940
 in the construction you are doing is 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.560
 the following this type flip flop works 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.930
 this way you will make a hole in the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.150
 ground and you will put a torch 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.190
 in this position here by some 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.660
 reason it does not work with me just 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.099
 they work if I put in dead 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.990
 I know if anything of the mod I am 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.530
 using or if something from maine craft 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.880
 indeed 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.770
 Then you 'll do it from up there. 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.560
 of this torch you will put a block and 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.069
 then you come put 12 blocks on top 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.959
 her 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.400
 then you come with the stick piston and 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.150
 You're going to put a chip on the side. 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.580
 her 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.770
 Aimed at her, she 's back to go. 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.870
 pro block is on top of the torch and you 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.300
 come here put another type I'm facing 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.970
 Let's go, too, here. 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.550
 middle is the following this exit here goes 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.280
 be their output did not put the output 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.840
 your sign here you can only mayor 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.940
 example I'm going to put a torch here 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.800
 red explained it there in the video 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.490
 the beautiful mount tutorial if you already know 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.740
 a line of rexton stone torch 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.540
 red stone is connected to a block 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.190
 has a torch will change the torch signal 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.890
 then this line is changing the signal 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.480
 this torch here and there on the other side 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.100
 you 'll put an input like that 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.890
 You're going to make an input puts two 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.250
 torches on each side of the 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.290
 city ​​flip flop and you come and put two 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.630
 networks tones up and here exactly 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.090
 where your input is going to be 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.790
 side here you come put redstone 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.490
 climbing up there and down to the ground and here you 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.110
 you can put your entry in the 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.880
 truth you can put against the 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.680
 turn it on and off you want 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.770
 so I 'll do it here now lets 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.240
 I put run already put here beauty 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.180
 it's working, I'm going to put 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.800
 another on this side here he is 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.600
 also working, you can see the 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.270
 red rate there said changing signal 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.460
 I'll click here once it will change from 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.760
 sign I can go there on the other side and 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.920
 click again and it will light 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.290
 so that's how flip tic works 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.880
 flop this was a quick tutorial to 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.010
 You want to make these doors 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.200
 double employees on both sides to 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.520
 you can activate a port on the input 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.110
 of your totally personal home is 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.970
 playing hard and have to do 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.710
 Metal door to metal door can be 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.200
 activated by a network system where 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.790
 here how you do it is simple 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.650
 is one thing I have to observe 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.870
 that a lot of people do not know how this thing 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.240
 the double door works you can 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.310
 simply copy this mechanism here 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.690
 always and always remembering that you have 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.490
 who put two red torches 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.130
 under the door and you have to call 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.900
 your torches for one of those repeaters here 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.910
 you can not call the foot for pre 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.800
 red stone because the red stone 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.620
 does the looping does not reach the torch 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.660
 when you put the repeater they do not 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.910
 They are okay this is a good thing 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.380
 of this repeater feature 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.660
 You can have the two forward while 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.100
 two red stones in parallel not 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.419
 can be pushed forward because 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.580
 they close circuit 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.960
 so this is it , this was the tutorial 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.750
 for you I hope you have 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.400
 liked aspects that gives idea more 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.130
 idea for you to do things 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.110
 things on your construction map of the 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.150
 maine craft for people who do not 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.890
 saw a video of the portal the link plus one 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.539
 for part of the video I explain 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.710
 how to make this portal here is a 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.410
 piston portal of the 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.790
 is on the subscription bar if you liked 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.530
 This video does not forget to give your 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.160
 Jorge and add this video to your 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.020
 favorites 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.640
 I'm noticing that people are 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.930
 giving one more year than adding 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.060
 sister favorites that add to the 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.680
 favorites is very important perhaps more 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.120
 important than young women, so if you 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.470
 Can you do this for me, I appreciate it. 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.450
 immensely helps in spreading 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.650
 video this is the first time you 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.000
 You're watching a video here on the non-channel. 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.780
 Forget to click above to get 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.400

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.380
 so this is personal is there for you 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.570
 my flip flop tutorial and the 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.460
 bar description the portal tutorial 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.140
 double is a well- known thing of 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.760
 minecraft but from what I saw here from 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.860
 last time I mentioned reston 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.420
 answer this sensational film thing 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.040
 craft here lets you build some 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.080
 There are a lot of people here that do not 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.000
 knows basic functions of this 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.770
 element of the game is losing a lot of 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.880
 What can I do in the game? I wanted to teach. 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.010
 this for you 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.380
 go there and do cool things now with 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.070
 your type flip flop and that's it folks up to 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.400
 next 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.400
