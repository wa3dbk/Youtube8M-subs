real fast you know all these hammer-ons
and<00:00:48.350> pull-offs<00:00:48.460> but<00:00:49.460> what<00:00:49.579> I'm<00:00:49.670> gonna<00:00:49.760> do<00:00:49.970> is

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
and pull-offs but what I'm gonna do is

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.270 
and pull-offs but what I'm gonna do is
kind<00:00:50.239> of<00:00:50.300> break<00:00:50.510> it<00:00:50.720> down<00:00:50.750> just<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.739> basic

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
kind of break it down just the basic

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.619 
kind of break it down just the basic
technique<00:00:52.970> of<00:00:53.210> a<00:00:53.300> pull<00:00:53.510> off<00:00:53.750> so<00:00:54.410> you<00:00:54.500> can<00:00:54.710> see

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
technique of a pull off so you can see

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.390 
technique of a pull off so you can see
at<00:00:56.629> least<00:00:56.690> how<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.290> how<00:00:57.589> to<00:00:57.620> how<00:00:57.949> to<00:00:57.980> start

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
at least how to how to how to start

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.850 
at least how to how to how to start
getting<00:00:59.390> just<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.690> just<00:00:59.930> a<00:01:00.019> real<00:01:00.230> clean<00:01:00.559> pull

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
getting just a just a real clean pull

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.700 
getting just a just a real clean pull
off<00:01:01.040> okay<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.180> we're<00:01:02.390> at<00:01:02.480> measure<00:01:02.690> 85<00:01:03.260> in<00:01:03.589> your

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
off okay so we're at measure 85 in your

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.859 
off okay so we're at measure 85 in your
tablature<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.460> I<00:01:04.970> got<00:01:05.119> a<00:01:05.150> little<00:01:05.360> exercise

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
tablature and I got a little exercise

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.660 
tablature and I got a little exercise
there<00:01:06.409> where<00:01:06.619> you're<00:01:06.710> just<00:01:06.890> basically<00:01:07.310> going

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
there where you're just basically going

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.859 
there where you're just basically going
to<00:01:08.950> two<00:01:09.950> zero<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.610> then<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.360> just<00:01:11.750> keep

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
to two zero and then you just keep

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.190 
to two zero and then you just keep
repeating<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:16.450> now<00:01:17.450> let's<00:01:17.630> just<00:01:17.750> talk<00:01:17.960> a

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200

repeating that now let's just talk a
little<00:01:18.470> bit<00:01:18.649> about<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.039> technique<00:01:19.460> of<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.789> pull

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
little bit about the technique of a pull

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.810 
little bit about the technique of a pull
off<00:01:20.259> okay<00:01:21.259> what<00:01:22.070> you're<00:01:22.190> gonna<00:01:22.310> want<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.640> do

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
sort okay so most of these lower strings

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.949 
sort okay so most of these lower strings
are<00:01:42.740> muted<00:01:43.069> out<00:01:43.330> you<00:01:44.330> know<00:01:44.450> what<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:44.660> want<00:01:44.869> to

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
do when you do a pull off is just

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.589 
do when you do a pull off is just
actually<00:01:48.679> pull<00:01:49.160> back<00:01:49.580> on<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.119> note<00:01:50.330> you're

pulling straight back and then that

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.790 
pulling straight back and then that
string<00:02:10.670> just<00:02:11.030> kind<00:02:11.239> of<00:02:11.300> slips<00:02:11.780> right<00:02:12.050> off<00:02:12.560> the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
string just kind of slips right off the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.150 
string just kind of slips right off the
end<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:13.040> my<00:02:13.130> bar<00:02:13.370> now<00:02:14.209> it's<00:02:14.480> really<00:02:14.780> nice<00:02:15.160> when

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
end of my bar now it's really nice when

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.680 
end of my bar now it's really nice when
you're<00:02:16.280> doing<00:02:16.520> pull<00:02:16.730> offs<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.209> have<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> bar

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
you're doing pull offs to have a bar

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.070 
you're doing pull offs to have a bar
like<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:18.680> see<00:02:19.250> how<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.370> tip<00:02:19.700> goes<00:02:20.450> out<00:02:20.750> and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
like this see how the tip goes out and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.890 
like this see how the tip goes out and
it's<00:02:21.290> not<00:02:21.470> just<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.800> straight<00:02:22.569> straight<00:02:23.569> shot

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
it's not just a straight straight shot

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.869 
it's not just a straight straight shot
tip<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.440> kind<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.739> curves<00:02:25.220> out<00:02:25.459> like<00:02:25.670> that

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
tip it kind of curves out like that

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.600 
tip it kind of curves out like that
flared<00:02:26.870> flared<00:02:27.440> tip<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:27.920> guess<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.370> what<00:02:28.489> they

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
flared flared tip I guess is what they

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.540 
flared flared tip I guess is what they
call<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:29.560> what<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.709> does<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.129> that<00:02:31.310> kind<00:02:31.489> of

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
call it what that does is that kind of

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.150 
call it what that does is that kind of
flares<00:02:31.940> out<00:02:32.300> there<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.319> when<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.560> do<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.950> pull

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
flares out there so when you do the pull

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.130 
flares out there so when you do the pull
off<00:02:35.650> makes<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.830> lot<00:02:36.980> easier<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:38.660> pop<00:02:38.870> that

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
off makes it a lot easier to to pop that

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.110 
off makes it a lot easier to to pop that
string<00:02:39.590> right<00:02:39.890> off<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.550> tip<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:40.879> that<00:02:41.030> bar

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
string right off the tip of that bar

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.150 
string right off the tip of that bar
that's<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.870> idea<00:02:44.140> just<00:02:44.290> pull<00:02:44.560> straight<00:02:44.980> back

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
that's the idea just pull straight back

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.130 
that's the idea just pull straight back
now<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.580> put<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.910> little<00:02:45.970> bit<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.510> pressure<00:02:46.780> with

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
now I put a little bit of pressure with

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.050 
now I put a little bit of pressure with
my<00:02:47.860> index<00:02:48.160> finger<00:02:50.220> now<00:02:51.220> what<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.520> also<00:02:51.700> got<00:02:52.030> to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
my index finger now what you also got to

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.030 
my index finger now what you also got to
watch<00:02:52.270> out<00:02:52.510> for<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:53.020> see<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.440> ring<00:02:53.650> finger

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
watch out for is see that ring finger

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.970 
watch out for is see that ring finger
there<00:02:54.900> I'm<00:02:55.900> sure<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.200> lot<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.680> will<00:02:56.770> run

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
there I'm sure a lot of you will run

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.130 
there I'm sure a lot of you will run
into<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:59.760> see<00:03:00.760> how<00:03:00.940> I'm<00:03:01.120> muting<00:03:01.660> out<00:03:01.840> with<00:03:01.989> my

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
into this see how I'm muting out with my

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.660 
into this see how I'm muting out with my
ring<00:03:02.380> finger<00:03:02.410> there<00:03:02.860> when<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.040> do<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.280> pull<00:03:03.489> off

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670

and<00:03:32.549> that's<00:03:32.670> basically<00:03:32.909> it<00:03:33.209> for<00:03:33.329> a<00:03:33.540> good<00:03:33.719> pull

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
and that's basically it for a good pull

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.319

off<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.439> in<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.709> exercise<00:03:35.099> there<00:03:35.549> measure<00:03:35.819> 85

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
off so in that exercise there measure 85

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.179 
off so in that exercise there measure 85
you're<00:03:37.109> just<00:03:37.319> doing<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.709> over<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.129> over

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
you're just doing that over and over

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.130 
you're just doing that over and over
again<00:03:38.400> two<00:03:38.700> two<00:03:38.909> zero<00:03:38.939> two<00:03:39.450> two<00:03:39.480> zero<00:03:39.659> and

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
again two two zero two two zero and

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.020 
again two two zero two two zero and
that's<00:03:40.530> what<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.859> looks<00:03:40.890> like<00:03:41.280> in<00:03:41.519> tablature

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
that's what it looks like in tablature

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.550 
that's what it looks like in tablature
what<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.420> pull<00:03:42.569> offs<00:03:42.780> look<00:03:42.959> like<00:03:43.140> see<00:03:43.349> how<00:03:43.439> is

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
what the pull offs look like see how is

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.610 
what the pull offs look like see how is
two<00:03:44.400> with<00:03:44.849> a<00:03:44.879> curved<00:03:45.269> line<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.989> then<00:03:46.109> zero

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
two with a curved line and then zero

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.670 
two with a curved line and then zero
that<00:03:47.040> means<00:03:47.900> you're<00:03:48.900> gonna<00:03:48.989> pull<00:03:49.349> off<00:03:49.530> so

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
that means you're gonna pull off so

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.280 
that means you're gonna pull off so
you're<00:03:49.799> not<00:03:49.890> actually<00:03:50.159> picking<00:03:50.959> not<00:03:51.959> actually

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
you're not actually picking not actually

picking that with your with your writing

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.360 
picking that with your with your writing
you're<00:03:54.870> just<00:03:55.019> picking<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.890> first<00:03:56.129> one

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
you're just picking the the first one

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.110 
you're just picking the the first one
and<00:03:56.579> then<00:03:57.030> pulling<00:03:57.299> it<00:03:57.480> off<00:03:57.629> there<00:03:59.000> now<00:04:00.000> I'm
