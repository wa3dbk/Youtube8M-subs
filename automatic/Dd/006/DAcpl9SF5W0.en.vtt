00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.360
 hello here rock giguère welcome to 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.889
 this capsule so garden point tv 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.690
 so today we are still lucky 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.840
 to be at the roger botanical garden 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.539
 vandenbergue at laval university and one 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.450
 will you talk about is so I'm going 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.160
 show you different trees or 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.460
 conifers that can enter the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 composition of one of course each one or 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.200
 each has its particularity 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.700
 so we'll see that as we go 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.219
 when first successful she is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.499
 composed of noise then it is the buxus 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.149
 micro philo ie small 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:44.850
 then leaves a foliage 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.170
 persistent he just detail here then 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.719
 you see we are in the Quebec region 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.059
 worried and you see who behaves 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.079
 very well the noise as we see in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.719
 euros the next is composed of soul to 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.539
 saint-jeures sadic soil smiaa bea 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.699
 does not have a spell that comes not very high and 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.739
 which is easily controllable by 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.070
 against if you opt for seven lots to 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.500
 growth rapids but also is going 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.070
 to have the size is quickly between 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.070
 detail another plant that was very 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.259
 used some time ago and a little 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.869
 less Tunisian today the pinus mess 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.920
 gerba niqueurs then it's still 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.840
 a hideout we are much less 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.640
 accustomed to seeing in the gardens then 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.409
 you see what we can control well 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 and we see the news for what is 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.950
 a little red here to here that's a 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.229
 nec and was very popular what we 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.000
 called the alpine crime guy then you 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.979
 see we are able to maintain very 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.840
 very low and you see that still 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.189
 a certain width then for those who 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.649
 want to make French-style gardens 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.600
 while cissé lô the gold this Simplonhalle 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.409
 focus on the edge of a lake in a 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.509
 riparian border 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.429
 so you can take your nails and 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.469
 detailed against that requires a lot 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.969
 of time and sometimes it entails a little 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.100
 of diseases 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.320
 the runs then we can detail the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.030
 let go then we see here this art 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.649
 at the frontenacs is a very rock 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.140
 rustic then of course when we 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.520
 is an aid to roses it is necessary 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.040
 take varieties that are hardy 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.400
 so lucie frontenac a rose bush of the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.290
 series of exploring and here we have a 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.540
 dogwood plume and that is a 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.700
 old plan that was used a lot 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.390
 along the buildings and we see here 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.160
 that it can constitute an aid 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.440
 we continue training no way with 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.760
 this faithful were final rifle 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.710
 original that makes white flowers 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.840
 so we can also opt for a 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.210
 shrub that is going to be big enough and that 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.710
 can rejuvenate from time to time or 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.880
 four or five hours so that asks 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.230
 some maintains some 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.380
 knowledge of culture 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.210
 the cara gano here the siberian weight that 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.470
 makes yellow flowers and makes 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.630
 loopholes goes next they were very 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.090
 used formerly is less and less 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.700
 used he has he is less and less 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.330
 used in favor of beautiful shrubs 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.920
 decorative as here the fiso cap at most 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.260
 false gods sasair with wicker leaves 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.150
 copertino so we see it a beautiful where 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.150
 I'm there and not carved so we could 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.010
 then carve a hedge that is 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.470
 decorative and that is also very colorful 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.720
 of course we have the pipes and you 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.190
 notice if the pipe is still 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.350
 a plant that can grow 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.650
 so you have to be careful you have to 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.600
 every size we try to keep the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.130
 good proportion otherwise you see it's 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.170
 a plant that can expand in a 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.170
 certain dimension 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.030
 here we went the sucked so inspired here 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.580
 greenstein what is not in bloom 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.410
 currently but who sees who is in 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.110
 flowers all through the spring and who 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.400
 after is a beautiful little ray and 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.180
 you see that we are capable of 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.420
 bass war 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.000
 we have seven more is here who the 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.160
 Japanese quince that can also be used to 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.830
 to one year the quince elsewhere 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.260
 we see its fruits kidding here we see 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.170
 it's very very rare so it's cynthia 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.080
 flowery in spring then the cognitive of the 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.700
 japan species and finally I finish with 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.500
 a plant that is rarely used in 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.010
 Quebec but we should use more 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.350
 it is the country maple hr campestri 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.930
 then unite to blanket fish sees it 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.459
 here on the screen so we see it's a 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.590
 wood that like spongy 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.660
 it's a very very beautiful and it's like 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.760
 a small leaf is easy to 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.340
 control because it's an error that 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.780
 remains very very low and you see the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.880
 beautiful shape she does 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.590
 then you have seen you have the choice 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.300
 you can build your with 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.460
 several recent woody 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.560
 mainly arts bus is not 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.810
 it's always upkeep it's a 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.810
 young player who says hello tina
