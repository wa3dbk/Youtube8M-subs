00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
guess but we're going to test it and see

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.209 
guess but we're going to test it and see
how<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.030> goes<00:00:48.440> there's<00:00:49.440> any<00:00:49.589> substantial

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
how this goes there's any substantial

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.220 
how this goes there's any substantial
differences<00:00:50.730> between<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.239> two<00:00:51.269> versions<00:00:51.539> I'm

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
differences between the two versions I'm

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.569 
differences between the two versions I'm
going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.469> try<00:00:52.589> to<00:00:52.620> make<00:00:52.859> this<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.070> short<00:00:53.249> as

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
possible because you know it's a bit

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.040

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.330 

hmm

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
hmm

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.300 
hmm
well<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.000> suppose<00:02:55.360> this<00:02:55.569> is<00:02:55.920> slightly<00:02:56.920> better

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
well I suppose this is slightly better

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.690 
well I suppose this is slightly better
than<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.700> can<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.400> nice<00:03:01.060> kind<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.480> crisp

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
than the can so nice kind of crisp

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.890 
than the can so nice kind of crisp
flavor<00:03:04.319> hoppy<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.349> I<00:03:06.250> guess<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.660> bottle

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
flavor hoppy and I guess this the bottle

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.140 
flavor hoppy and I guess this the bottle
version<00:03:08.019> is<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.260> bit<00:03:08.819> fruit<00:03:09.819> here<00:03:10.319> maybe<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:12.150> kind

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
version is a bit fruit here maybe a kind

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.270

refreshing<00:03:26.120> that<00:03:27.280> what<00:03:28.280> I've<00:03:28.400> been<00:03:28.580> used<00:03:28.760> to

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
refreshing that what I've been used to

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.570 
refreshing that what I've been used to
in<00:03:29.120> growth<00:03:29.470> but<00:03:30.470> I<00:03:30.530> don't<00:03:31.190> give<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.490> the

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
in growth but I don't give you the

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.220 
in growth but I don't give you the
people<00:03:31.790> say<00:03:32.060> it's<00:03:32.210> totally<00:03:32.690> different<00:03:32.840> means

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
people say it's totally different means

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.900 
people say it's totally different means
still<00:03:33.760> around<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:35.000> same<00:03:35.270> kind<00:03:35.630> of<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:36.710> know

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
still around the same kind of you know

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.490 
still around the same kind of you know
place<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:38.240> go<00:03:38.540> with<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.780> girls<00:03:38.990> I<00:03:39.230> mean<00:03:39.380> it's

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
place you go with the girls I mean it's

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.760 
place you go with the girls I mean it's
nothing<00:03:40.090> this<00:03:41.090> exactly<00:03:41.720> different<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:45.650> this

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
nothing this exactly different but this

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.800 
nothing this exactly different but this
is<00:03:45.920> definitely<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.430> now<00:03:46.970> like<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.480> bottle

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
is definitely a now like the bottle

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.950 
is definitely a now like the bottle
version<00:03:47.960> is<00:03:48.200> definitely<00:03:48.590> better<00:03:48.710> than<00:03:48.920> Stella

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
version is definitely better than Stella

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.790 
version is definitely better than Stella
well<00:03:50.960> as<00:03:51.260> before<00:03:52.130> as<00:03:53.000> I've<00:03:53.180> said<00:03:53.420> that<00:03:53.720> Golf<00:03:54.650> is

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
well as before as I've said that Golf is

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.860 
well as before as I've said that Golf is
a<00:03:54.860> small<00:03:55.130> step<00:03:55.400> above<00:03:55.670> Stella<00:03:56.030> meaning<00:03:56.780> that

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
a small step above Stella meaning that

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.870 
a small step above Stella meaning that
the<00:03:57.080> count<00:03:57.320> version<00:03:57.650> is<00:03:57.770> a<00:03:57.800> small<00:03:58.070> step<00:03:58.400> above

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
the count version is a small step above

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.910 
the count version is a small step above
that<00:03:59.120> thing<00:03:59.360> but<00:03:59.570> I<00:04:00.020> guess<00:04:00.470> this<00:04:00.650> is<00:04:00.740> a<00:04:00.770> bit

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
that thing but I guess this is a bit

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.670 
that thing but I guess this is a bit
better<00:04:01.070> than<00:04:01.370> that<00:04:02.080> it's<00:04:03.080> for<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.320> great<00:04:03.530> i'm

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
better than that it's for the great i'm

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.350 
better than that it's for the great i'm
going<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:03.920> give<00:04:04.100> this<00:04:04.130> i'm<00:04:04.580> going<00:04:04.610> to<00:04:04.910> you<00:04:05.240> know
