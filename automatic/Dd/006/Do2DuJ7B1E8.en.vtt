00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
servo pull that through and plug it into

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.439 
servo pull that through and plug it into
channel<00:00:57.309> one<00:00:58.170> either<00:00:59.170> one<00:00:59.410> will<00:00:59.590> work<00:00:59.879> now

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
channel one either one will work now

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.490 
channel one either one will work now
and<00:01:02.350> move<00:01:02.590> that<00:01:02.739> up<00:01:03.210> open<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:05.080> compartment

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
and move that up open the compartment

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.040 
and move that up open the compartment
and<00:01:06.660> here<00:01:07.660> is<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:08.170> ESC<00:01:09.539> I'm<00:01:10.539> gonna<00:01:10.720> go<00:01:10.960> ahead

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
and here is the ESC I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.510 
and here is the ESC I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:11.289> slide<00:01:12.039> that<00:01:12.399> in<00:01:12.460> not<00:01:13.390> all<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.720> way<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
also gonna feed this through the hole

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.920 
also gonna feed this through the hole
and<00:01:21.460> plug<00:01:21.939> it<00:01:22.119> in<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.560> channel<00:01:23.560> two<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:26.380> like

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and plug it in to channel two just like

the<00:02:35.550> motor<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.360> held<00:02:36.600> on<00:02:36.780> by<00:02:37.380> two<00:02:37.410> screws

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
the motor and it's held on by two screws

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.410 
the motor and it's held on by two screws
one<00:02:38.400> here<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.030> one<00:02:39.360> there<00:02:40.100> okay<00:02:41.100> next<00:02:41.850> step<00:02:42.150> is

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
one here and one there okay next step is

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.230 
one here and one there okay next step is
I<00:02:42.690> need<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.110> attach<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.860> pinion<00:02:44.220> gear<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:45.120> if

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
I need to attach the pinion gear and if

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.880 
I need to attach the pinion gear and if
you<00:02:45.390> can<00:02:45.570> see<00:02:45.840> there<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.290> little<00:02:46.590> groove<00:02:46.860> right

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
you can see there is little groove right

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.270 
you can see there is little groove right
there<00:02:47.370> because<00:02:47.700> basically<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.990> need<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:50.040> push

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
there because basically I need to push

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.960 
there because basically I need to push
this<00:02:50.520> down<00:02:51.020> pass<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.740> lip<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.760> motor

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
this down pass the lip of the motor

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.640 
this down pass the lip of the motor
mount<00:02:54.300> otherwise<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:55.110> gonna<00:02:55.200> rub<00:02:55.500> up

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
mount otherwise it's gonna rub up

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.900 
mount otherwise it's gonna rub up
against<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.010> motor<00:02:56.160> mount<00:02:56.400> plate<00:02:56.580> and

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
against the motor mount plate and

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.120 
against the motor mount plate and
believe<00:02:57.209> me<00:02:57.360> that's<00:02:57.480> not<00:02:57.690> gonna<00:02:57.840> be<00:02:57.990> good<00:02:58.130> now

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
believe me that's not gonna be good now

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.320 
believe me that's not gonna be good now
I<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.790> tighten<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:03.209> we<00:03:03.300> are

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
I just have to tighten it and we are

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.720 
I just have to tighten it and we are
done<00:03:03.690> with<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.020> part<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:05.340> now<00:03:05.520> I'm<00:03:05.640> gonna

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
done with this part so now I'm gonna

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.140 
done with this part so now I'm gonna
slide<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.989> peg<00:03:07.380> into<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:08.040> hole<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
slide that peg into this hole to the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.260 
slide that peg into this hole to the
mount<00:03:09.330> promoter

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
mount promoter

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.060 
mount promoter
once<00:03:12.270> that's<00:03:12.540> on<00:03:12.840> I'm<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.530> gonna<00:03:13.680> go<00:03:13.950> ahead

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
once that's on I'm just gonna go ahead

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.820 
once that's on I'm just gonna go ahead
and<00:03:14.310> push<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.390> pinion<00:03:15.720> gear<00:03:15.750> into<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.440> spur

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
now there's this one screw that holds it

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.120 
now there's this one screw that holds it
in<00:03:20.730> position<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.750> goes<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.230> right<00:03:22.650> here

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
in position that goes in right here

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.699

install this so all that I really need

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.560 
install this so all that I really need
to<00:04:05.459> do<00:04:05.670> is<00:04:06.000> feed<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:08.160> antenna<00:04:08.730> through<00:04:09.180> the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
to do is feed the antenna through the

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.370 
to do is feed the antenna through the
antenna<00:04:09.959> -<00:04:11.330> now<00:04:12.330> I<00:04:12.360> just<00:04:12.480> got<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.959> push<00:04:13.170> the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
antenna - now I just got to push the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.530 
antenna - now I just got to push the
tube<00:04:13.590> into<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.010> receiver<00:04:14.430> box<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.090> it's<00:04:15.209> held

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
tube into the receiver box and it's held

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.289

goes in at an angle and I just got a

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.600 
goes in at an angle and I just got a
screw<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.079> in<00:04:22.169> there<00:04:22.380> enough<00:04:22.650> so<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.580> doesn't

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
screw it in there enough so it doesn't

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.630 
screw it in there enough so it doesn't
come<00:04:23.970> back<00:04:24.120> out<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.750> all<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.950> electronics

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
come back out and all the electronics

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.300 
come back out and all the electronics
are<00:04:26.880> done<00:04:27.450> with<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.440> was<00:04:28.740> looking<00:04:29.040> over<00:04:29.130> the

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
a while to figure it out but I forgot to

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.960 
a while to figure it out but I forgot to
install<00:04:40.330> them<00:04:40.750> they<00:04:41.230> go<00:04:41.410> underneath<00:04:41.710> all<00:04:42.310> for

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970

the<00:04:43.120> shocks<00:04:43.420> so<00:04:44.320> what<00:04:44.470> I'm<00:04:44.560> gonna<00:04:44.680> do<00:04:44.950> is

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
the shocks so what I'm gonna do is

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.000 
the shocks so what I'm gonna do is
remove<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:46.090> lower<00:04:46.300> screws<00:04:46.810> that<00:04:47.140> hold<00:04:47.440> on<00:04:47.650> the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
remove the lower screws that hold on the

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.400 
remove the lower screws that hold on the
rear<00:04:48.220> shocks<00:04:49.410> okay<00:04:50.440> take<00:04:51.100> those<00:04:51.400> off<00:04:51.700> and<00:04:52.120> now

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
rear shocks okay take those off and now

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.200 
rear shocks okay take those off and now
just<00:04:53.410> go<00:04:53.620> ahead<00:04:53.650> and<00:04:54.040> move<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.670> shock<00:04:54.910> to<00:04:55.120> the

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
just go ahead and move the shock to the

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.800 
just go ahead and move the shock to the
side<00:04:55.480> and<00:04:55.810> tada<00:04:56.320> that<00:04:57.010> is<00:04:57.580> where<00:04:58.360> two<00:04:58.660> of<00:04:58.690> the

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
side and tada that is where two of the

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.430 
side and tada that is where two of the
screws<00:04:59.140> go<00:04:59.170> right<00:05:00.040> here<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:00.610> there<00:05:01.440> alright

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
screws go right here and there alright

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.590 
screws go right here and there alright
and<00:05:02.860> if<00:05:03.400> you're<00:05:03.550> wondering<00:05:03.790> these<00:05:04.240> screws

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
and if you're wondering these screws

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.870 
and if you're wondering these screws
hold<00:05:04.960> is<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.410> diff<00:05:05.590> housing<00:05:06.070> to<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.280> chassis

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
hold is the diff housing to the chassis

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.910 
hold is the diff housing to the chassis
so<00:05:07.150> I<00:05:07.180> guess<00:05:07.570> you<00:05:07.720> can<00:05:07.840> say<00:05:08.020> they<00:05:08.230> are<00:05:08.410> pretty
