00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
bit of camber here on the ski as you can

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.300 
bit of camber here on the ski as you can
see<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:33.120> that's<00:02:33.959> good<00:02:34.230> for<00:02:34.260> for<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.099> skin

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
track the tails are not rockered which I

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.850 
track the tails are not rockered which I
like<00:02:39.959> because<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.260> can<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.470> take<00:02:40.769> them

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860
