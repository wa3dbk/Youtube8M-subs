00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
then I started hearing a garbled

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.360 
then I started hearing a garbled
transmission<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.770> he<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.070> trying<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
transmission it's like he was trying to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.670 
transmission it's like he was trying to
talk<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.670> me<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.930> apparently<00:00:58.020> whatever

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
talk to me but apparently whatever

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.459 
talk to me but apparently whatever
controlling<00:00:59.489> entity<00:00:59.719> was<00:01:00.719> responsible<00:01:01.320> for

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
controlling entity was responsible for

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.160 
controlling entity was responsible for
this<00:01:01.710> craft<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.250> my<00:01:02.370> planet<00:01:02.750> there<00:01:03.750> their

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
this craft on my planet there their

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.440 
this craft on my planet there their
technology<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.280> poor<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:06.030> they

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
technology was so poor that they

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.050 
technology was so poor that they
couldn't<00:01:06.900> even<00:01:06.930> hit<00:01:07.170> audio<00:01:07.590> through<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
couldn't even hit audio through in a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.160 
couldn't even hit audio through in a
quarter<00:01:09.360> fashion<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:11.610> speak<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.780> seem<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
quarter fashion now we speak we seem to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.780 
quarter fashion now we speak we seem to
speak<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> same<00:01:13.740> language<00:01:13.799> because<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.580> could

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
speak the same language because I could

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.120 
speak the same language because I could
make<00:01:14.970> out<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.210> few<00:01:15.450> words<00:01:15.740> but<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:16.950> so

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
make out a few words but it was so

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.399 
make out a few words but it was so
garbled<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.880> uh<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.930> kind<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.170> gave<00:01:19.350> up

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
garbled that uh I just kind of gave up

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.080 
garbled that uh I just kind of gave up
and<00:01:19.799> then<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.950> walked<00:01:20.189> away<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.759> started

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
and then I walked away and it started

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.649 
and then I walked away and it started
chasing<00:01:21.540> me<00:01:21.680> but<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.799> thing's<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.310> slow<00:01:23.729> it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
chasing me but this thing's so slow it

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.969 
chasing me but this thing's so slow it
wouldn't<00:01:24.960> even<00:01:25.110> go<00:01:25.259> about<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.530> mile<00:01:25.770> per<00:01:25.950> hour

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
wouldn't even go about a mile per hour

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.429 
wouldn't even go about a mile per hour
so<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.700> kind<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.970> laughed<00:01:27.210> at<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.840> then

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
so I just kind of laughed at it and then

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.929 
so I just kind of laughed at it and then
I'll<00:01:28.560> walk<00:01:28.740> back<00:01:28.770> around<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.460> know<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.670> gotta

I'll walk back around you know I gotta
move<00:01:30.720> some<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.020> my<00:01:31.079> stuff<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> way

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799

channel I've got a I've got a device and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.690 
channel I've got a I've got a device and
I<00:02:55.349> communicate<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.920> YouTube<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.640> know

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
I communicate with YouTube I know

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.240 
I communicate with YouTube I know
youtube<00:02:57.629> is<00:02:57.840> actually<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.290> service<00:02:58.739> that's<00:02:58.950> not

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
youtube is actually a service that's not

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.460 
youtube is actually a service that's not
on<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.519> planet<00:03:00.030> Mars<00:03:00.239> but<00:03:00.750> access<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.440> from

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
on the planet Mars but access it from

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.949 
on the planet Mars but access it from
there<00:03:01.709> I've<00:03:01.829> got<00:03:01.859> really<00:03:02.129> good

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
there I've got really good

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.930 
there I've got really good
interplanetary<00:03:03.959> cell<00:03:04.590> phone<00:03:04.829> system<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.910> i

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
interplanetary cell phone system so i

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.360 
interplanetary cell phone system so i
can<00:03:06.180> see<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.900> actually<00:03:07.470> i<00:03:07.739> think<00:03:07.829> that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
can see that and actually i think that

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.240 
can see that and actually i think that
youtube<00:03:08.819> is<00:03:09.060> based<00:03:09.359> on<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.720> planet<00:03:10.109> earth<00:03:10.260> if

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
youtube is based on the planet earth if

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.309 
youtube is based on the planet earth if
I'm<00:03:11.519> if<00:03:11.790> I'm<00:03:11.970> correct<00:03:12.209> if<00:03:12.660> I'm<00:03:12.840> thinking

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
I'm if I'm correct if I'm thinking

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.770 
I'm if I'm correct if I'm thinking
correctly<00:03:13.560> yes<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.849> beg<00:03:15.030> planet<00:03:15.450> Earth<00:03:15.569> is

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
correctly yes and I beg planet Earth is

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.020 
correctly yes and I beg planet Earth is
where<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.109> Voyager<00:03:16.620> came<00:03:16.859> from<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.880> that
