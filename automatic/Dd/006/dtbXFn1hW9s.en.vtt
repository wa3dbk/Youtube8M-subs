00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.520
 Yes 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.289
 so sea lunch death she so in 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.539
 anyway believed the character of one 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.810
 famous movie and realized in 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.980
 what is right judge for yourself the events 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.930
 the first yakuza had to deliver 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.090
 Japanese motives are now grouped into 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.619
 the brink of extinction 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.539
 but 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.539
 counted once 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.450
 a year after it started 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.590
 bloodshed 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.160
 and the body is full of strength again this is expensive if 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.330
 alanya to fight 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.190
 yes yes we did not speak 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.220
 instead of collectively overcoming 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.050
 the effects of the crisis heads of various 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.510
 Clans many think as if polchchee 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.060
 fruit 500 each other's throats 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.480
 true without provocation edition matter seems 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.699
 no cost 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.209
 someone obviously wants to set off a local 

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:00.609
 godfathers and at the same time get rid 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:01.740
 with capsule 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.750
 the main character of the first series 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.050
 Kazuma tried to start a new life 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.620
 without massacre and similar manifestations 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.910
 violence 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.500
 however, these plans seem to come true 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.610
 not destined anyway 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.950
 however disassembly disassembly 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.070
 and the plot of the yakuza 2 is not at all as obvious as 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.610
 may seem at first glance 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.310
 next collision 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.820
 interests 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.100
 in reality it turns out to be strong 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.300
 tightly tied to the long tragedy 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.300
 which you still have to unravel 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.890
 proper investigation 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.400
 mechanics will be not much different from 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.560
 past adventures of kazum by urban 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.470
 the streets 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.030
 watching the movements 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.189
 third person protagonist 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.399
 you slowly get from knowing 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.610
 people required information 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.970
 as a rule, communicate with one informant 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.930
 makes you go searching 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.930
 next and so on the chain 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.390
 unfortunately, not everyone is ready to share 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.830
 valuable information voluntarily 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.860
 moreover even on busy urban 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.040
 the streets 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.859
 there is always a pair of three Kostolomov 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.549
 who imagines himself to be masters 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:10.909
 hand-to-hand combat 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.769
 understand what we tend to 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.579
 fool them 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.650
 and the closer to the final the more aggressive 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.199
 becoming opponents and those 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:20.919
 more attention will have to be paid 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.809
 another brawl 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.919
 combat system and year 2 lets you not 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:27.879
 only kill enemies with your hands and feet 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.109
 tying punches to short powerful kombat 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.029
 You can also use 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.119
 a variety of special techniques working 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.669
 fact 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.629
 in a set on dependence of commands 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.319
 or a couple of tenants how heavy 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.199
 the subject 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.419
 which by the way will markedly increase your 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:46.729
 chances of winning 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.500
 some characters 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.469
 also ready to fight on your side 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.409
 and this in turn opens up 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.519
 new opportunities for joint 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.070
 combo of a kind of reference times so 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.260
 which is not able to withstand more than one 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.260
 span 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.480
 Well, if you are tired of the track and development 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.389
 storyline want 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.239
 temporarily set aside 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.279
 yakuza 2 provided 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.650
 fair amount of non-burdensome 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.260
 mini games that will surely help 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.049
 to diversify stay 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.819
 virtual underworld 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.409
 the truth is not worth it to suspect 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.349
 project implementation place 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.469
 what would you not think to do early or 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.990
 late take you on the rails of the story 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.680
 because dear tax is provided 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.919
 only one 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.919
 Russian mission 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.579
 earlier 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.599
 Lviv Mayor Andrei Garden 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.599
 four 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.899
 Euro 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:15.899
 4 pages 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.009
 I know 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.050
 but 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.050
 but 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.090
 I think 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.260
 whether to spend annually
