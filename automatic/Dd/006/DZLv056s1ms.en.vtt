00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.899
 hi this is marco d'otto von today 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.029
 video unpacking a mobile that you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.529
 have been very many to claim me in 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.540
 test tests that had 20 by a few 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.719
 days at most a few weeks from 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.330
 samsung galaxy to 3 any of the three 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.660
 first born of this new range of 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.080
 samsung the galaxy has game that there is the a3 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.660
 the a5 and the a7 that I will necessarily all 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.430
 tested for you here we are in front of the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.980
 galaxy has three who is the most 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.359
 will say accessible from strait the most 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.160
 entry level even if it's not 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.149
 really an entry-level mobile 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.329
 which incidentally I want to thank the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.350
 it was loaned by rueducommerce.com I 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.180
 really want to thank 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.820
 you can find this mobile at 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.110
 best prices at home 1,289 euros 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.719
 it's price at which you can buy this 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.180
 phone in March 2015 so do not hesitate 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.750
 not to go to the shop 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.360
 rueducommerce.com which you will find 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.379
 the link at the top of this clickable video 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.050
 throughout the video from elsewhere 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.000
 so a mobile you understood it is 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.020
 sold at a price of 289 euros what is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.789
 that means it's good to modify 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.680
 rather tend to medium range 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.660
 antraigues bringing outright no way 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.100
 of range outright if only by 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.119
 its price and we are obviously not 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.680
 in the high end and even less 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.720
 in ultra high end 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.130
 we are on a mobile and soon we will 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.350
 go around the owner of course 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.030
 when testing here in a fast first 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.590
 overview but what matters to us here 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.820
 it's mostly the box and especially the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.990
 accessories that are supplied with 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.090
 then the woods a pretty box 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.920
 classic at samsung especially and well 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.560
 with this format is forming a little bit 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.000
 a little compact enough rectangular 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.259
 knowing that little parenthesis 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.700
 extra well the box here does not 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.869
 do not present the decor a little bit 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.270
 imitation wood that we had on the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.159
 galaxy range s so much here that we are 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.380
 on the galaxy range has it's a range 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.670
 rather colorful more fun then on the face 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.860
 before the box we find the letter a 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.220
 announced the samsung galaxy s lineup iii 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.110
 his models the model galaxy brand to 3 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.149
 still on the side on the top of the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.470
 protective sticker sealed on the 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.270
 right side we learn that this phone 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.340
 must be unlocked with a card 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.719
 European sim because it's a 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.000
 phone for the European market and 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.680
 that samsung is pretty fussy enough 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.790
 with the location of these mobiles and 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.560
 so if you buy a mobile on the 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.610
 non- European markets and that you 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.020
 want to unlock it with a card 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.450
 European sim you could have some 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.340
 jokes and conversely 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.540
 under one of the box 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.590
 forgiveness underneath the box on 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.400
 find and well just the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.810
 salt numbers etc 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.700
 we learn that we are on the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.560
 white version the pearl white of this 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.610
 mobile on the back of the mobile that is 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.019
 that the entrance to the box sorry 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.299
 find the specifications so we 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.519
 learns we're on the 16 gigabyte version 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.440
 that the screen is a super amoled kid is 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.150
 with a sublime design it's not me 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.709
 who says it is samsung and you 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.620
 can succeed your most beautiful one son 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.690
 and girl in case you a lot in case 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.900
 where you forgot she did a self y 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.459
 that's a good joke aside I think there 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.780
 have a small mistake there at the level of the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.430
 creation of the box at the level of others 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.829
 syntax and text level 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.690
 the processor is a dot either 104 4.2 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.129
 gigahertz who is this phone is endowed 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.720
 4g connection 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.310
 he has all the necessary tape to 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.260
 France in particular it has a 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.810
 4.5 inch super amoled sajoo screen 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.549
 lady has a resolution that edge 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.659
 ten quartz hours and Thursday not helping 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.819
 quad hd 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.829
 it has a back camera of 5 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.500
 may be 8 megapixels and 5 megapixels in 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.849
 front side this is the reference that 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.230
 it's interesting to point out because 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.180
 works the reference could have 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.500
 differences in the mobile 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.769
 certainly but also in terms of content 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.180
 of the box is the sm 300 has been seen 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.790
 by donation for the European market 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.799
 that you understood it so there are four 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.709
 of which there are three parent stickers that I 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.910
 must simply cut with my 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.150
 magic cup cut 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.430
 here we go we do it cleanly on the 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.510
 left side right forgiveness on the to 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.129
 you opted bay and on the right under there 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.220
 at least the box opens to little pass 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.060
 green for transport that's for sure 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.530
 So is what we managed to cut 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.620
 properly the four strait these 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.430
 departures of which this one puts me a whole 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.199
 little bit of resistance so go hop 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.959
 I obviously cut the 4 selections 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.699
 and yeah that's the case and we'll be able to 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.620
 see the open the box properly 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:00.419
 so a potting of the box like 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.000
 still at samsung we find the 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.760
 phone present directly with his 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.530
 protective film is laid on the inversion 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.250
 Cardboard phone protective film 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.079
 on the front 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.699
 protective film on the back and on 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.250
 sides it's a phone that picks up 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:17.219
 clearly clarens typically the design 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.269
 Samsung Galaxy is no mistakes and 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:22.599
 we even have this little side a little bit 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.120
 Samsung Galaxy Note especially with this 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:28.120
 aluminum frame with a paint on 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.400
 the particular side and that it appeared 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.770
 it's a style note that has appeared 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.599
 with the samsung galaxy ace 6 with a 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.120
 sort of curves at the bottom of the 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.590
 chassis or there you see here this so 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.949
 curves that are found at the bottom of 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.990
 frame 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.599
 it reminds me a little bit of the very 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.280
 recent samsung galaxy ace 6 that's that 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.750
 we have seen and that we have 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.159
 covered for you during his 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.650
 official presentation in barcelona 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:52.120
 so here is a pretty successful design 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.849
 but of course I will come back to this 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.050
 last during the test video then 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.030
 but on the unpacking video 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.849
 so we continue the TV had to ask 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.830
 on a cradle assures you the carton 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.360
 under which we find good 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.740
 documentation so we learn that he 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.539
 is indeed Samsung Galaxy three 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.449
 models and I confirm it 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.759
 reference sm to 300 at sight ok so that 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.849
 this is the record we also find the 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.379
 usb micro usb cable that looks to me a little 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.169
 short despite everything that looks a little 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:22.659
 short and plastic sir du 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.210
 plastic here we find also a 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:28.000
 usb power adapter charger 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.259
 france or more widely in europe 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.990
 very classic at samsung with the 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.819
 samsung tagging largely copied by 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.610
 Chinese builders behind this 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:39.520
 AC adapter goes the mobile too 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.800
 by the way, it's a little bit the trick 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.060
 we also find the pedestrian kit 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.800
 good quality are intra 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.380
 ears very classic at samsung 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.460
 also with the remote control button against 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.440
 wanted it more - end to hang 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.770
 bah hooks but it is a good 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.029
 note 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.349
 it's a good intonation a mobile 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.990
 medium range that is well endowed 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:58.659
 especially with this pedestrian kit and we 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.460
 find additional adapters 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.719
 could title times are here we 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.849
 found in the extra end 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:05.710
 because we do not have all the 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.479
 same sizes of hearing sticks the 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.509
 same ears and necessarily that that you 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.039
 allows to better adapt the pedestrian kit 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:15.039
 to your ears and we finally find 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.539
 finally this famous little this little 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.979
 accessory is wrong that's how 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:22.569
 the call that usually allows 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:24.849
 remove the micro sim card slot 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:26.169
 same or nano target it depends but it 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:30.399
 it's for memory cards and so 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:32.439
 here micro sd microsd so the cards 

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:34.479
 nano target so to remove these two 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.679
 locations and well we need this 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.270
 famous accessory that is provided to you 

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:38.740
 thankfully with the phone so 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.330
 little recap of this roof clan in 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.759
 the boot the little trombone that remained 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.399
 in the box there you see the end 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:47.679
 additional pedestrian cable 

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:49.990
 usb micro usb the power adapter the 

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:51.069
 everything is very very offbeat with a 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.679
 small documentation 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.959
 here we close everything so there we are 

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:57.369
 on the box as it happens to you 

00:06:55.959 --> 00:07:00.129
 when it is simply
