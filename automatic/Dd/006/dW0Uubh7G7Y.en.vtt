00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
the mini gastric bypass and we need to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.299 
the mini gastric bypass and we need to
to<00:00:52.050> let<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.469> know<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.739> you're<00:00:52.890> thinking<00:00:53.070> about

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
to let you know if you're thinking about

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
having surgery with me there are

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.510 
having surgery with me there are
failures<00:00:55.110> there<00:00:55.469> are<00:00:55.590> time<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.190> don't<00:00:56.370> get

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
failures there are time so we don't get

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.700 
failures there are time so we don't get
all<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.969> weight<00:00:57.120> loss<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:58.289> wouldn't<00:00:58.469> say

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
all the weight loss but we wouldn't say

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.160 
all the weight loss but we wouldn't say
necessarily<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.250> grade<00:00:59.520> f<00:00:59.820> maybe<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:00.930> give

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
necessarily a grade f maybe we give

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.100 
necessarily a grade f maybe we give
myself<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.739> C+<00:01:02.550> or<00:01:02.789> B<00:01:02.969> minus<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.930> got

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
myself a C+ or B minus because you got

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.770 
myself a C+ or B minus because you got
still<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> hundred<00:01:04.799> pounds<00:01:05.040> weight<00:01:05.189> loss<00:01:05.339> yeah

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
still a hundred pounds weight loss yeah

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.120 
still a hundred pounds weight loss yeah
well<00:01:06.780> hundred<00:01:07.170> pounds<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.500> weight<00:01:07.650> loss<00:01:07.830> yeah

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
well hundred pounds of weight loss yeah

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.070 
well hundred pounds of weight loss yeah
and<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:08.700> pretty<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.630> because<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.930> was

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and that's pretty really because I was

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.800 
and that's pretty really because I was
in<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.409> well<00:01:10.530> into<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> 300<00:01:11.490> right<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.570> that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
in a well into the 300 right so that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.750 
in a well into the 300 right so that
weight<00:01:13.049> loss<00:01:13.260> we're<00:01:13.470> happy<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.280> then

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
weight loss we're happy with and then

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.399 
weight loss we're happy with and then
the<00:01:14.790> other<00:01:14.939> nice<00:01:15.270> thing<00:01:15.299> particularly<00:01:16.110> about

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the other nice thing particularly about

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
the other nice thing particularly about
the<00:01:16.590> mini<00:01:16.770> gastric<00:01:17.250> bypass<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:18.000> it's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the mini gastric bypass is it's

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.410 
the mini gastric bypass is it's
revisable<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.680> again<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.000> quick<00:01:21.210> note

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
revisable and again just a quick note

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.320 
revisable and again just a quick note
when<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> surgery<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.220> estimate<00:01:23.909> we

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
when we do the surgery we estimate we

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.320 
when we do the surgery we estimate we
guess<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:25.200> judge<00:01:25.590> how<00:01:26.340> much<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.670> bypass<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
guess we judge how much to bypass and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.969 
guess we judge how much to bypass and
sometimes<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.619> gues<00:01:28.860> perfect<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:30.450> sun<00:01:30.979> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
sometimes we gues perfect the sun and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.550 
sometimes we gues perfect the sun and
sometimes<00:01:32.790> not<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.390> perfect<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.259> case

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
sometimes not so perfect in which case

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.100 
sometimes not so perfect in which case
like<00:01:35.549> Trish<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.060> sandy<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.720> had<00:01:36.900> have

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
like Trish and sandy they had have

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.770 
like Trish and sandy they had have
revisions<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.729> feel<00:01:38.909> bad<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.420> on

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
revisions and we feel bad about that on

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.990 
revisions and we feel bad about that on
