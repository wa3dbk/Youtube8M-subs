00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
lankans but the problem is when you

to<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.650> grave<00:00:31.769> get<00:00:32.340> set<00:00:32.550> up<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.300> go

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
to the grave get set up but if you go

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.180 
to the grave get set up but if you go
and<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:33.809> goes<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.260> cold<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.680> should<00:00:34.829> go

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and just goes it's cold you should go

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.500 
and just goes it's cold you should go
I'd<00:00:35.250> look<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.640> runs<00:00:35.880> over<00:00:36.030> everything<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
I'd look like a runs over everything and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.420 
I'd look like a runs over everything and
even<00:00:36.930> if<00:00:37.200> macro<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.680> out<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.010> still<00:00:38.190> get<00:00:38.340> your

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
even if macro is out you still get your

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.619 
even if macro is out you still get your
guy<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:38.730> effect<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.090> it's<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:39.510> going

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
guy but effect because it's just going

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.270 
guy but effect because it's just going
to<00:00:39.660> destroy<00:00:40.020> hey<00:00:40.320> I'm<00:00:40.649> monster<00:00:40.950> my<00:00:41.070> bowel

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
to destroy hey I'm monster my bowel

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.590 
to destroy hey I'm monster my bowel
doesn't<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> send<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.059> Graveyard<00:00:42.090> or

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
doesn't have to send to the Graveyard or

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.330 
doesn't have to send to the Graveyard or
anything<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.680> hydro<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.190> you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
anything like that with hydro get on you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.049 
anything like that with hydro get on you
actually<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> send<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.030> Graveyard

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
actually have to send to the Graveyard

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.910 
actually have to send to the Graveyard
so<00:00:45.480> that's<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:45.989> downside<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.680> hydro

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
so that's just one downside to hydro

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
so that's just one downside to hydro
ghana<00:00:47.100> vs<00:00:47.520> guava<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.450> said<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.809> really

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
ghana vs guava but that said I really

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.720 
ghana vs guava but that said I really
think<00:00:49.260> drug<00:00:49.590> why<00:00:49.739> was<00:00:49.920> actually<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> really

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
think drug why was actually a really

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.310 
think drug why was actually a really
good<00:00:50.879> card<00:00:51.300> against<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.870> deck<00:00:52.050> because

which<00:01:10.020> actually<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> pretty<00:01:10.530> good<00:01:10.830> card<00:01:11.040> as

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
which actually is a pretty good card as

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.950 
which actually is a pretty good card as
well<00:01:11.159> especially<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.299> actually<00:01:12.450> hide<00:01:12.810> or

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
well especially if you actually hide or

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.550 
well especially if you actually hide or
get<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.200> because<00:01:13.320> hydro<00:01:13.650> cannon<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.330> water

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560

so<00:01:16.560> that's<00:01:16.799> pretty<00:01:16.950> cool<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.909> use

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
so that's pretty cool that you can use

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.760 
so that's pretty cool that you can use
like<00:01:18.210> Hydra<00:01:18.479> gun<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.720> aspect<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.470> yeah
