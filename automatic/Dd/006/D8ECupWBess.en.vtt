00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
I'm sure it does and I think it's if

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.310 
I'm sure it does and I think it's if
they<00:01:10.700> were<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:11.030> say<00:01:11.210> yes<00:01:11.510> let's<00:01:11.810> do<00:01:11.990> what<00:01:12.200> we

they were to say yes let's do what we
want<00:01:12.530> that's<00:01:12.740> fine<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.490> there's<00:01:13.970> no<00:01:14.150> way<00:01:14.390> I'm

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630

disputing the girls skating

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.400 
disputing the girls skating
I<00:01:16.610> think<00:01:16.970> a<00:01:17.150> great<00:01:17.450> admirer<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.050> Russians

it

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
it

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.680 
it
I<00:01:21.140> must<00:01:22.070> admit<00:01:22.190> overall<00:01:22.760> piece<00:01:23.000> for<00:01:23.300> me<00:01:23.420> was<00:01:23.570> I

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
I must admit overall piece for me was I

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.990 
I must admit overall piece for me was I
was<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:23.840> delightful<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:24.680> did<00:01:24.890> not<00:01:25.370> the<00:01:25.610> costume

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
was a delightful I did not the costume

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.700 
was a delightful I did not the costume
didn't<00:01:26.300> offend<00:01:26.540> me<00:01:26.720> in<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.930> least<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.620> I

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
didn't offend me in the least and I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.770 
didn't offend me in the least and I
think<00:01:27.950> thing<00:01:28.670> one<00:01:28.880> has<00:01:28.910> to<00:01:29.120> sort<00:01:29.510> of<00:01:29.630> draw

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
think thing one has to sort of draw

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.540 
think thing one has to sort of draw
comparisons<00:01:30.020> to<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.830> Summer<00:01:31.070> Olympics

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
comparisons to the Summer Olympics

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.980 
comparisons to the Summer Olympics
really<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.880> flo-jo<00:01:32.420> can<00:01:32.980> appear<00:01:33.980> as<00:01:34.159> she<00:01:34.370> did<00:01:34.580> I

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
really a flo-jo can appear as she did I

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.149 
really a flo-jo can appear as she did I
really<00:01:35.990> think<00:01:36.230> the<00:01:36.290> comparison<00:01:36.680> should<00:01:37.040> be

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
really think the comparison should be

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.500 
really think the comparison should be
made<00:01:37.310> there<00:01:37.490> whilst<00:01:37.670> we<00:01:37.820> do<00:01:37.970> have<00:01:38.150> rules<00:01:38.330> and

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
made there whilst we do have rules and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.100 
made there whilst we do have rules and
regulations<00:01:39.370> I<00:01:40.370> think<00:01:41.030> probably<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.570> judges

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
regulations I think probably the judges

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.230 
regulations I think probably the judges
did<00:01:42.380> deduct<00:01:42.770> because<00:01:43.159> it<00:01:43.310> was<00:01:43.400> a<00:01:43.430> very<00:01:43.730> high

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
did deduct because it was a very high

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.290 
did deduct because it was a very high
quality<00:01:44.890> dance<00:01:45.890> that<00:01:46.220> they<00:01:46.370> gave<00:01:46.580> performers

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
quality dance that they gave performers

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.460 
quality dance that they gave performers
and<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.479> think<00:01:47.659> they<00:01:47.720> probably<00:01:47.900> would<00:01:48.440> have

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
and I think they probably would have

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.820 
and I think they probably would have
deducted<00:01:49.130> 0.1<00:01:49.640> 0.2<00:01:50.120> so<00:01:50.720> really<00:01:51.409> I<00:01:51.440> would<00:01:51.710> have

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
deducted 0.1 0.2 so really I would have

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.890 
deducted 0.1 0.2 so really I would have
been<00:01:51.950> furious<00:01:52.250> as<00:01:52.580> their<00:01:53.150> coach<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.690> allow

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.400 
fair to say that your marks are often
out<00:05:48.040> of<00:05:48.070> step<00:05:48.310> with<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.520> others<00:05:48.730> I<00:05:49.140> am<00:05:50.140> often

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
out of step with the others I am often

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.430 
out of step with the others I am often
out<00:05:50.710> but<00:05:51.070> I'm<00:05:51.910> not<00:05:52.480> that<00:05:52.690> much<00:05:52.870> out<00:05:53.080> it<00:05:53.200> often

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
out but I'm not that much out it often

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.200 
out but I'm not that much out it often
looks<00:05:53.620> worse<00:05:53.830> I<00:05:54.040> have<00:05:54.310> a<00:05:54.340> very<00:05:54.580> big<00:05:54.790> range<00:05:54.970> of

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
looks worse I have a very big range of

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.790 
looks worse I have a very big range of
marks<00:05:55.600> and<00:05:55.810> I<00:05:55.990> make<00:05:56.200> a<00:05:56.230> big<00:05:56.440> difference

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
marks and I make a big difference

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.070 
marks and I make a big difference
between<00:05:56.890> very<00:05:57.250> good<00:05:57.430> and<00:05:57.550> very<00:05:57.610> bad<00:05:57.910> so<00:05:58.240> you

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
between very good and very bad so you

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.540 
between very good and very bad so you
don't<00:05:59.260> always<00:05:59.380> have<00:05:59.620> to<00:05:59.770> give<00:05:59.890> somebody<00:06:00.100> 6<00:06:00.430> to

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
don't always have to give somebody 6 to

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.460 
don't always have to give somebody 6 to
have<00:06:00.700> them<00:06:00.850> first<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.600> public<00:06:01.990> often<00:06:02.260> think

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
have them first the public often think

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.010 
have them first the public often think
of<00:06:02.530> a<00:06:02.620> judge<00:06:02.830> is<00:06:02.980> marking<00:06:03.400> low<00:06:03.580> that<00:06:04.390> they're

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
of a judge is marking low that they're

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.050 
of a judge is marking low that they're
not<00:06:05.140> much<00:06:05.380> good<00:06:05.710> the<00:06:06.310> marks<00:06:06.610> aren't<00:06:06.850> any<00:06:06.970> good

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
not much good the marks aren't any good

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.400 
not much good the marks aren't any good
but<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.330> isn't<00:06:07.630> that<00:06:07.660> at<00:06:07.870> all<00:06:08.080> it's<00:06:08.290> the

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
but it isn't that at all it's the

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.690 
but it isn't that at all it's the
placing<00:06:08.800> at<00:06:08.890> the<00:06:08.980> end<00:06:09.100> of<00:06:09.220> the<00:06:09.280> day<00:06:09.430> is<00:06:09.490> what

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
placing at the end of the day is what

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.070 
placing at the end of the day is what
counts<00:06:09.880> and<00:06:10.270> think<00:06:10.420> it<00:06:10.480> was<00:06:10.570> the<00:06:10.660> times<00:06:10.900> this

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
counts and think it was the times this

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.450 
counts and think it was the times this
morning<00:06:11.470> said<00:06:11.740> you<00:06:11.830> were<00:06:11.920> never<00:06:12.130> one<00:06:12.310> to

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
morning said you were never one to

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.800 
morning said you were never one to
follow<00:06:12.640> the<00:06:12.820> herd<00:06:12.970> what<00:06:13.360> do<00:06:13.420> you<00:06:13.480> think<00:06:13.690> of

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
follow the herd what do you think of

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.900 
follow the herd what do you think of
that<00:06:14.050> I<00:06:14.350> should<00:06:15.250> take<00:06:15.400> it<00:06:15.550> as<00:06:15.640> a<00:06:15.730> compliment

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
that I should take it as a compliment

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.420 
that I should take it as a compliment
perhaps<00:06:16.450> shudder<00:06:16.660> okay<00:06:17.260> any<00:06:17.860> idea<00:06:18.250> whether

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
perhaps shudder okay any idea whether

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.070 
perhaps shudder okay any idea whether
the<00:06:18.610> other<00:06:18.730> judges<00:06:19.180> might<00:06:19.450> actually<00:06:19.840> follow
