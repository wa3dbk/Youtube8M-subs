Parker

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.030 
Parker
I<00:02:13.790> think<00:02:14.030> Jack<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.450> herb<00:02:14.569> were<00:02:14.689> very<00:02:14.870> similar

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
I think Jack and herb were very similar

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.280 
I think Jack and herb were very similar
forget<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.790> passion<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.269> coach<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.750> teach<00:02:17.930> I

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
forget the passion to coach and teach I

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.569 
forget the passion to coach and teach I
mean<00:02:18.439> that's<00:02:18.590> that's<00:02:18.860> something<00:02:19.280> that's<00:02:19.459> very

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
mean that's that's something that's very

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:20.860 
mean that's that's something that's very
special<00:02:19.849> in<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.150> coach<00:02:20.329> but<00:02:20.510> they<00:02:20.599> were<00:02:20.689> both

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
special in a coach but they were both

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.170 
special in a coach but they were both
very<00:02:21.110> honest<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:22.549> think<00:02:22.730> honesty<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.090> a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
very honest and I think honesty is a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.899 
very honest and I think honesty is a
very<00:02:23.360> important<00:02:23.780> quality<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.200> have<00:02:24.379> in

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
very important quality to have in

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.330 
very important quality to have in
brutally<00:02:25.909> honest<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.689> point<00:02:27.010> but<00:02:28.010> they

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
brutally honest to the point but they

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.979 
brutally honest to the point but they
both<00:02:28.549> taught<00:02:28.879> me<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.209> about<00:02:29.480> about<00:02:29.780> being

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
herb was able to showcase it on a bigger

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.660 
herb was able to showcase it on a bigger
stage<00:02:42.019> because<00:02:42.709> of<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:42.950> Olympic<00:02:43.250> Games<00:02:43.430> where

stage because of the Olympic Games where

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.349 
stage because of the Olympic Games where
I<00:02:43.909> think<00:02:44.390> when<00:02:44.780> coach<00:02:44.989> Parker<00:02:45.409> for<00:02:45.620> 30<00:02:45.859> years

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
I think when coach Parker for 30 years

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.119 
I think when coach Parker for 30 years
many<00:02:47.359> years<00:02:47.450> he's<00:02:47.780> been<00:02:47.989> here<00:02:48.200> displays<00:02:48.920> that

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
many years he's been here displays that

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.039 
many years he's been here displays that
same<00:02:49.489> quality<00:02:49.819> that<00:02:50.180> same<00:02:50.359> integrity<00:02:50.930> and

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
same quality that same integrity and

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.930 
same quality that same integrity and
that<00:02:51.079> same<00:02:51.379> commitment<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.040> those<00:02:52.670> are<00:02:52.790> the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
that same commitment and those are the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.210 
that same commitment and those are the
values<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.389> I<00:02:53.510> think<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.590> herb<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:54.950> Jack

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
values that I think the herb and Jack

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.129 
values that I think the herb and Jack
had<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.180> qualities<00:02:56.629> that<00:02:56.659> I<00:02:56.810> think<00:02:57.019> they

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
had and the qualities that I think they

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:58.890 
had and the qualities that I think they
were<00:02:57.200> able<00:02:57.379> to<00:02:57.530> instill<00:02:57.980> in<00:02:58.159> me<00:02:58.310> as<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.489> player

unless you win a national championship
so<00:04:05.629> I<00:04:05.659> guess<00:04:06.049> my<00:04:06.409> four<00:04:06.680> years<00:04:06.919> here<00:04:06.980> we<00:04:07.220> fell<00:04:07.459> a

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
so I guess my four years here we fell a

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:08.619 
so I guess my four years here we fell a
little<00:04:07.669> short

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
little short

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.439 
little short
we<00:04:08.930> offer<00:04:09.139> we're<00:04:09.379> awfully<00:04:09.709> good<00:04:10.060> my<00:04:11.060> junior

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
year we were very very good but we

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.610 
year we were very very good but we
weren't<00:04:13.970> able<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.299> pull<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.049> trigger<00:04:15.079> and<00:04:15.500> win
