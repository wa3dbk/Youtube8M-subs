of<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.080> time<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.559> really<00:00:10.950> like<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.639> way<00:00:11.730> that

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
of the time I really like the way that

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.249 
of the time I really like the way that
they<00:00:12.000> turn<00:00:12.240> out<00:00:12.269> when<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.599> use<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.870> round<00:00:13.170> brush

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.200 
they turn out when I use a round brush
usually<00:00:13.740> if<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.219> thought<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.670> earn<00:00:14.790> them<00:00:15.059> or

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
usually if I thought I earn them or

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.970 
usually if I thought I earn them or
anything<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.690> end<00:00:15.839> up<00:00:16.020> hating<00:00:16.230> them<00:00:16.529> afterwards

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
anything I end up hating them afterwards

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.050 
so I just end up rewetting my bangs and
doing<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.560> with<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.830> blow<00:00:19.980> dryer<00:00:20.250> run<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.880> this

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
doing it with the blow dryer run so this

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.599
