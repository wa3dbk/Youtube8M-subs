going to take this right here on top of
my<00:01:53.250> cheekbone<00:01:53.640> because<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> place

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
my cheekbone because that's the place

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:10.570 
my cheekbone because that's the place
I'd<00:01:54.720> normally<00:01:55.880> highlight

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:55.370 

the<00:02:11.120> highest<00:02:11.450> point<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.990> your<00:02:12.350> brows

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.040 

right<00:02:56.070> towards<00:02:56.430> your<00:02:56.550> goal<00:02:56.790> line<00:02:57.050> which

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
right towards your goal line which

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.510 
right towards your goal line which
normally<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.740> where<00:02:59.010> your<00:02:59.130> contour

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
normally this is where your contour

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.130 
normally this is where your contour
would<00:02:59.670> go<00:02:59.820> but<00:03:00.030> since<00:03:00.270> we're<00:03:00.390> not<00:03:00.510> contouring

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
would go but since we're not contouring
