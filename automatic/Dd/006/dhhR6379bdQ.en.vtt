00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
how this is one piece goes with the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.639 
how this is one piece goes with the
Merlin<00:02:04.170> wand<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.649> kind<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.890> made<00:02:05.070> me<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.450> well

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
Merlin wand it kind of made me go well

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.330 
Merlin wand it kind of made me go well
because<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:08.340> its<00:02:08.550> fact<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:10.800> was<00:02:10.950> probably

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
because of its fact that it was probably

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.130 
because of its fact that it was probably
made<00:02:11.520> out<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.790> two<00:02:11.940> pieces

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
made out of two pieces

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.310 
made out of two pieces
I<00:02:15.230> like<00:02:16.230> one<00:02:16.410> piece<00:02:16.730> but<00:02:17.730> also<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:19.020> so

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
I like one piece but also this is so

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.920 
I like one piece but also this is so
smooth<00:02:19.710> it's<00:02:20.130> unreal<00:02:21.090> how<00:02:21.390> smooth<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.260> is

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.040 

yeah<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.440> think<00:02:28.710> that's<00:02:28.860> probably<00:02:29.190> my

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
yeah so I think that's probably my

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.730 
yeah so I think that's probably my
favorite<00:02:31.050> wand<00:02:31.500> oh<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:34.050> here's<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.620> little

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.520 
favorite wand oh and here's a little
thingy

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
thingy

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.360 
thingy
well<00:02:37.530> first<00:02:38.010> here's<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.460> COA<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:40.050> impa's<00:02:40.350> it

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.250 

the<00:02:46.010> apprentice<00:02:47.010> wand<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.840> was<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.140> very

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
the apprentice wand that was the very

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.390 
the apprentice wand that was the very
first<00:02:49.590> one<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.890> ever<00:02:50.160> got<00:02:50.900> it's<00:02:51.900> also<00:02:52.260> made<00:02:53.220> of

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
first one I ever got it's also made of

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.979 
first one I ever got it's also made of
rosewood<00:02:53.959> it's<00:02:54.959> not<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.350> beautiful<00:02:56.780> but<00:02:57.780> it

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
rosewood it's not this beautiful but it

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.040 
rosewood it's not this beautiful but it
is<00:02:58.220> technically<00:02:59.220> made<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.520> rosewood<00:02:59.989> but<00:03:00.989> I

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
is technically made of rosewood but I

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.130 
is technically made of rosewood but I
think<00:03:01.380> they<00:03:01.500> do<00:03:01.560> say<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:03.570> apprentice<00:03:04.020> is

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
think they do say that the apprentice is

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.120 
think they do say that the apprentice is
made<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:05.840> Indian<00:03:06.840> rosewood<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.860> I'm<00:03:07.950> not<00:03:08.070> sure

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
made of Indian rosewood so I'm not sure

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.110 
made of Indian rosewood so I'm not sure
if<00:03:08.430> there's<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> real<00:03:09.050> big<00:03:10.050> difference<00:03:10.290> there

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
if there's a real big difference there

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.020 
if there's a real big difference there

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.759 
looks kind of like a flower that starts
there<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:02.970> then<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.510> petals<00:04:03.810> go<00:04:04.019> down<00:04:04.530> and
