 the super bowl the most sporting event 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.770
 followed the world 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.510
 even more incredible than a video of 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.380
 dario moccia more social 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.450
 and do more islands 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.950
 actions of subscribers even more followed 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.330
 of the final of the world cup of 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.279
 football meets in a day 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.140
 memorable two strongest teams of 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.700
 american football one 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.170
 game that is such a deep echo from 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.770
 even influence culture 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.869
 Japanese 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.759
 and we know when the games are inspired 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.759
 from something here they make us a manga 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.379
 soccer basketball box martial arts go apnea 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.570
 baseball tennis still basketball volleyball 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.250
 and even American football that i 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.260
 Japanese went crazy for him 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.670
 sports is certainly not a novelty indeed among 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.229
 these series we find some of the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.149
 cornerstones of the cartoon of the uprising 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.250
 such as slam dunk gold that this 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.659
 so certainly not by little but 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.339
 between the spoke on or the shonen 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.020
 sports setting they had 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.970
 a success that is well below the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.520
 average at least in Italy there is just 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.289
 eyeshield 21 series of 37 exit numbers 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.460
 a few years ago for the planet manga that 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.350
 unfortunately it is following the path 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.119
 of extinction and there is no way 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.009
 to stop this shitty advance 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.600
 sportsmen perhaps too fine 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.100
 today but there have been very few 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.240
 that left me something at the end 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.979
 of reading 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.899
 a kind of inner completeness like 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.940
 if all the pieces so far presented in the 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.560
 the course of publication arrived at 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.299
 a final climax already written but 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.860
 equally unpredictable load of 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.690
 melancholy all this and much more 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.429
 tried when I read the last page 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.470
 of the final volume of this 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.060
 amazing manga on a sport almost 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.649
 unknown to most despite the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.060
 premise of video beginning, moreover 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.920
 we are talking about a sport that has a 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.750
 crazy response only at home 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.159
 while in the rest of the world it is capable of 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.689
 outclass all others only 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.729
 in the instant in which a 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.289
 important match like super bowl for then 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.119
 return to oblivion but what it renders 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.740
 eyeshield 21 manga that verges on 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.840
 masterpiece naturally within the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.130
 the kind that deals with is the everyday life that 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.200
 is able to infuse as if in 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.340
 this case all the Japanese 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.750
 practiced this discipline e 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.979
 took years in the body to 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.420
 achieve the ultimate goal 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.340
 of course this situation we can 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.410
 find in many other sports mangas 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.940
 but here nothing is left to chance and the 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.799
 narrative coherence that one breathes in 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.600
 I had every page in every volume 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.400
 perceived only in two pillars as 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.049
 slam dunk and rocky joe a story that 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.180
 it goes beyond the usual clichés of schools 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.980
 superiors with established sports clubs 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.750
 from phenomena already unreachable or 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.370
 even van clubs minus i 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.230
 players needed to play one 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.450
 match and when those of other clubs 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.310
 are kindly invited to 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.840
 participate in tournaments do not have the minimum 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.459
 idea of ​​how you are in the field and in 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.079
 effects not surprisingly given the 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.160
 complexity and endless strategy that 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.049
 can be taken in any action 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.819
 anyone would definitely find himself 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.680
 frightened lost in front of the 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.940
 violence used in this sport as 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.180
 for example the protagonist of the story 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.189
 mayor go home 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.959
 a small, thin boy and 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.519
 restive to any activity that could 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.349
 to undermine his personal security 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.209
 but something in him will change a bit 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.500
 game a little for simple challenge is also 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.180
 thanks to a matured talent 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.040
 unconsciously over the years his 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.629
 character his personality so closed 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.280
 submissive will gradually evolve 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.409
 becoming one of the reference points 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.489
 of the team and not only him but also i 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.719
 comrades who slowly became 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.129
 will stabilize within the 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.139
 team will bring out their own 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.579
 skills that individually are not 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.230
 superhuman like those of most 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.030
 part of the opponents they will meet 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.620
 it will indeed be the bond of a group like this 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.659
 heterogeneous but at the same time so 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.159
 incredibly united that will allow to 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.900
 achieve tool milestones 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.639
 unthinkable a team with a single one 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.470
 heart that beats in unison where everyone 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.209
 demonstrates the classic Japanese pride 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.950
 without to show off security or 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.010
 recklessness except this character 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.750
 qua biciroma captain quaterback mente 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.549
 of the team and crazy lover of weapons 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.629
 if you immediately prove a true e 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.250
 not just the devil 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.349
 in appearance with an infinite network of 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.639
 sneaky blackmail contacts can stand 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.379
 in step with anyone who equals him 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.139
 in front and threatening having won it 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.519
 always perhaps the male character 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.500
 better than the whole panorama 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.449
 manga shows with expertise 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.919
 in the choices adopted inside and outside the 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.519
 field that is not found anywhere else 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.959
 part 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.489
 the rum and the first in a long series of 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.560
 key characters who made this 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.449
 more unique than rare manga describing them 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.099
 such as meticulousness of details and ability 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.060
 athletics that actively adapt to 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.099
 this kind of sport 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.959
 sometimes exaggerating but remaining bastard 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.609
 true to real standards but if you do 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.109
 wait for the classic sports manga 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.699
 full of match not finish or 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.329
 vittorio as if it were raining you are wrong 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.220
 big 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.810
 here in fact every player will have to spit 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.190
 blood to guarantee your own 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.440
 team access to the much sought after 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.180
 christmas bowl adaptation of the best known 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.979
 superbollo that will crown the best 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.080
 japan team without counting the 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.610
 multiple situations of everyday life 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.870
 the past of each character who 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.000
 echoes in most situations 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.530
 disparate the goals and sacrifices of the 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.840
 founders of the team but above all 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.430
 those details here and there that are not 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.349
 throw yourself at random but are used 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.889
 repeated with full knowledge of the facts 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.449
 at the end 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.669
 a less obvious conclusion than what 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.110
 expect that he left me one 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.030
 sort of nostalgia for all those 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.770
 characters that 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.270
 strange inside from the beginning as if 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.290
 they would also welcome you over siena 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.790
 within the team 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.230
 then passing to the graphic side is 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.450
 impossible not to be amazed 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.830
 in front of the drawings of use that he built 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.080
 a name that for me is 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.700
 become synonymous with quality capable of 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.530
 to rival illustrious colleagues e 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.180
 win a place of honor in mine 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.830
 personal ranking of the best 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.960
 manga designers a clean stroke 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.250
 incredibly dynamic realistic 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.900
 lays the foundation for an easier one 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.090
 understanding of game actions 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.170
 increasing the pathos in the most moments 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.060
 highlights of the story 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.800
 and if you ever happen to see it 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.540
 during a game of the players that yes 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.490
 turn into knights and dinosaurs or 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.050
 they disappear behind lights not of smoke 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.640
 be alarmed because everything is normal 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.800
 I want to end the video so this 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.480
 my tribute from gilles 21 praising 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.440
 the inimitable irony that oozes from every 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.940
 cartoon 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.500
 will be that these years of eating beds 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.330
 really so many and so my 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.890
 standard there are some facts but 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.720
 I honestly don't remember which state 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.880
 the last comic with which I laughed like this 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.620
 both the gags and the drawings are very tasteful 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.060
 dialogues and paradoxical situations that 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.610
 although redundant they are never trivial 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.350
 they are fused together breaking the rhythm 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.150
 but keeping the attention in the reader 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.740
 the end result something 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.600
 incredible I challenge anyone not to laugh 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.130
 in front of certain scenes and if you do 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.540
 I don't do it I think you have problems 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.460
 finally returning to the initial discussion 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.530
 I want to invite you to watch the big match 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.540
 this Sunday that ok will start a little 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.580
 but delay for a time so that it will do 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.170
 4 am hangouts try to do 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.940
 something else but I also would go 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.740
 spent a different night from the others 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.210
 I would say that we can close it here 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.040
 thank you for listening to me and 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.960
 naturally I invite all those who do not 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.880
 have yet to recover the manga 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.530
 which will certainly help you 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.600
 understanding of the game of this 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.130
 weekend buy it read airport flights
