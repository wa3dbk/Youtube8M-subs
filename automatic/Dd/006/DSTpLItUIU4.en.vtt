00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.590
 pasta and gum arabic 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.759
 so for those who live in america 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.000
 in Europe 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.590
 you can find her in pharmacy she 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.250
 will be ground ready 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.670
 or we can prepare it for you 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.960
 tablespoon cinnamon 40 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.420
 centilitres of water and 20 g of ground corn 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.770
 also past 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:39.140
 it's very important to all past 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.420
 sieve here and salt a good pinch 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.610
 of salt and honey of course to make it 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.710
 soak here for now I'm going 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.780
 pass all sieve and resume it 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.970
 later 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.740
 well here is between having everything to bet have me 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.049
 read and all a museum I am using in a 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.540
 robot or you can do that to me 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:01.720
 the hand is very possible so I 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.720
 add hut but this yeast 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:22.150
 in oil my butter kept you 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:25.239
 pistils the big spoon of canes the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.970
 20 g was very soft to him at 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:35.970
 sieve always of course I repeat myself 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:39.010
 maybe map enough salt consistency and 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.500
 and here and I do not doubt my robot there 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.800
 do not miss it well it is necessary that the 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.989
 dough are gathering at the kneading hall 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.660
 as you perceived not bread 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:56.220
 it must not be too far away 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.220
 bad and arduous no more 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.260
 so after kneading your pass you 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.700
 divide it into six or seven balls and that 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.440
 you let rest well twenty minutes 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.630
 very important rest time 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.160
 why your dough are tearing apart 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.700
 so how to learn a piece of 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.360
 dough 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.130
 we will try to shape this piece myself 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:31.300
 I cut it in two it's easier 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:34.240
 like me a little bit not too much and I do not 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.600
 can switch to spalletti machine I 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.110
 do go directly to number 3 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.110
 like this 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:54.400
 here and I get a fine paste here 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.160
 arrived a little really really hard 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.290
 insists for part and I do not know if you 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.990
 know this footprint of 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.080
 chebakia this one or you can 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:12.460
 cut with these 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:17.019
 so with with this tobacco as we say 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:20.080
 in Arabic it's easier and it takes 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.630
 less time than with claude roulleau 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.130
 but by roll if you can do it 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:29.430
 you make a rectangle with five 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.430
 bands 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.939
 that you cut like that I usually 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.090
 1 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:50.159
 this is then to bend it 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:53.319
 you take a tape out of two that you 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:56.740
 pinch well for the side and makes you 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:05:01.650
 drop your dough like these in 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.650
 spreading well I'll start again 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:25.289
 yes on two like this I pinch and I 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:28.740
 go right like this and I have 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.740
 I start again 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:40.680
 here I started talking again 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.110
 associated with one more band or that's it 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.880
 watched every two people she did 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.390
 three years ba 3 years oat two years bastard 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:14.390
 where I spend the ends and I do 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:18.400
 fall back here and I have you 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.400
 people start to ausy for another 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:33.130
 that's it and the dough when she stays like 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.350
 you can not do anything anymore 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.330
 you put it in a ball and the ag is 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.020
 rest and when you're done all 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.490
 your dough 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.080
 you resume this date sailing to 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.300
 fry the host heads not to 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.000
 to let the oil bousdira it is necessary that she 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.700
 be very hot but not hot and 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.500
 soak them in honey and you 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.990
 leave in the honey the time that a 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.720
 frying is ready 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.690
 after wanted to have a stalemate 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.110
 or sometimes like that let drain 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:08.260
 arrange to emit sesames over 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.980
 and it freezes very well and this is what 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.750
 that it gave 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.400
 do not hesitate to ask me questions 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.940
 I will be very happy to answer them 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.940
 thank you goodbye
