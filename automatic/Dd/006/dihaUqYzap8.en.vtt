and that's actually a split-level living
room<00:01:00.239> which<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.899> think<00:01:01.170> turned<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.500> fairly

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
nice now we're moving over in to the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.399 
nice now we're moving over in to the
back<00:01:05.369> adding<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.880> windows<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.659> added<00:01:07.380> some

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
back adding the windows and added some

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.469 
back adding the windows and added some
nice<00:01:07.680> big<00:01:08.130> windows<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.000> living<00:01:09.030> room

nice big windows in the living room

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.530

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
pretty cool now we're moving over to the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.520 
pretty cool now we're moving over to the
past<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:56.969> backyard<00:01:57.240> which<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.259> fairly

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
past to the backyard which is fairly

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.969 
past to the backyard which is fairly
nice<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.310> nice<00:02:00.060> stone<00:02:00.780> path<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.829> got

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
nice it's a nice stone path and you got

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.499 
nice it's a nice stone path and you got
some<00:02:02.189> beautiful<00:02:02.310> flowers<00:02:02.670> off<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> side

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
some beautiful flowers off to the side

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.539 
some beautiful flowers off to the side
and<00:02:03.810> actually<00:02:04.350> left<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.560> backyard<00:02:05.070> empty

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
and actually left the backyard empty

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.550 
and actually left the backyard empty
because<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.270> download<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.840> house<00:02:07.110> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
because you can download this house and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.320 
because you can download this house and
I<00:02:07.979> figured<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.700> download<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
I figured that if you download it you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.390 
I figured that if you download it you
might<00:02:09.479> want<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.899> make<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.590> backyard<00:02:11.069> your<00:02:11.250> own

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
might want to make the backyard your own

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.610 
might want to make the backyard your own
design<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.750> can<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.050> that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
design so you can do that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.050 
design so you can do that
so<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.069> can<00:02:14.159> see<00:02:14.400> them<00:02:14.519> just<00:02:14.640> adding<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
so as you can see them just adding the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.690 
so as you can see them just adding the
walls<00:02:15.330> inside<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.739> outline<00:02:17.250> where<00:02:17.549> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
walls inside to outline where the
