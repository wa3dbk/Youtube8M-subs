00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
do it yourself so first thing we're

going to do is we're going to drop going
to<00:01:08.760> pull<00:01:08.880> both<00:01:09.090> plugs<00:01:09.360> we're<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> pull

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
to pull both plugs we're going to pull

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.719 
to pull both plugs we're going to pull
the<00:01:10.260> fill<00:01:10.920> plug<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:12.450> drain<00:01:12.900> plug<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.729> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the fill plug and the drain plug and the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.249 
the fill plug and the drain plug and the
reason<00:01:15.090> why<00:01:15.210> we're<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.960> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
reason why we're going to do that is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.990 
reason why we're going to do that is
because<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.890> want<00:01:17.130> all<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> transmission

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
because we want all the transmission

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.730 
because we want all the transmission
fluid<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.299> drain<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.840> course<00:01:19.080> there<00:01:19.560> isn't

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
fluid to drain out of course there isn't

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980 
fluid to drain out of course there isn't
a<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.670> don't<00:01:20.759> fill<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> from<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.479> top

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
a you don't fill it from the top

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.270 
a you don't fill it from the top
you<00:01:22.200> fill<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.530> from<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> bottom<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.189> I'll

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you fill it from the bottom and I'll

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.560 
you fill it from the bottom and I'll
show<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.640> procedure<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.479> bit

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
show you that procedure a little bit

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.539 
show you that procedure a little bit
later<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:25.890> when<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.310> underneath

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
later but for now when I get underneath

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.510 
later but for now when I get underneath
there<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.000> drain<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.049> by<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> way<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.250> should

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
there and drain it by the way you should

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.760 
there and drain it by the way you should
warm<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> vehicle<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.689> before<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.470> drain<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
warm the vehicle up before you drain the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.859 
warm the vehicle up before you drain the
transmission<00:01:32.310> fluid<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.090> drive<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.600> 10<00:01:33.780> or

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
transmission fluid so drive it for 10 or

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.840 
transmission fluid so drive it for 10 or
15<00:01:34.140> minutes<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.950> a1<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> transmission

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
15 minutes that a1 the transmission

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.450 
15 minutes that a1 the transmission
fluid<00:01:35.970> make<00:01:36.299> your<00:01:36.420> drip<00:01:36.600> out<00:01:36.750> nice<00:01:37.220> that's<00:01:38.220> it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
fluid make your drip out nice that's it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.060 
fluid make your drip out nice that's it
like<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:40.110> cracking<00:01:40.890> these

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
like this one because cracking these

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.219 
like this one because cracking these
loose<00:01:41.430> takes<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.030> little<00:01:42.270> bit<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.509> force<00:01:42.810> I've

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
loose takes a little bit of force I've

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.450 
loose takes a little bit of force I've
already<00:01:43.500> loosened<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.040> one<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.780> basically

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
already loosened this one but basically

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.789 
already loosened this one but basically
just<00:01:47.460> make<00:01:48.240> sure<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.509> got<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> long<00:01:48.960> ratchet<00:01:49.619> or

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
just make sure you got a long ratchet or

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.190 
just make sure you got a long ratchet or
a<00:01:50.360> breaker<00:01:51.360> bar<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.670> notice<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.750> nasty

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
a breaker bar and notice that nasty

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.760 
a breaker bar and notice that nasty
transmission<00:01:55.950> fluid<00:01:57.049> coming<00:01:58.049> out<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> little

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
transmission fluid coming out a little

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.149 
transmission fluid coming out a little
bit<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.009> redness<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.579> it<00:02:00.409> let's<00:02:01.409> go<00:02:01.619> ahead<00:02:01.649> and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
bit of redness to it let's go ahead and

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.770 
bit of redness to it let's go ahead and
work<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:16.370 

fill<00:02:05.290> side

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.630 

yeah<00:02:17.380> notice<00:02:17.860> how<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.040> took<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.340> little<00:02:18.550> bit

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
yeah notice how that took a little bit

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:38.339 
yeah notice how that took a little bit
of<00:02:18.730> force<00:02:28.620> there<00:02:29.620> we<00:02:29.980> go

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.990 

there's<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.099> tunnel<00:02:39.370> well<00:02:40.319> now<00:02:41.819> these<00:02:42.819> either

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
there's a tunnel well now these either

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.319 
there's a tunnel well now these either
take<00:02:43.329> 3.2<00:02:44.200> or<00:02:44.230> 4.8<00:02:45.099> and<00:02:45.310> I'm<00:02:45.519> not<00:02:45.700> sure<00:02:46.030> which

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
take 3.2 or 4.8 and I'm not sure which

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.780 
take 3.2 or 4.8 and I'm not sure which
is<00:02:46.510> which<00:02:46.739> you'll<00:02:47.739> notice<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.159> got<00:02:48.280> lots<00:02:48.519> of<00:02:48.609> RAM

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
is which you'll notice I got lots of RAM

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.750 
is which you'll notice I got lots of RAM
under<00:02:49.060> here<00:02:49.299> because<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:49.719> is<00:02:49.870> where<00:02:50.079> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
under here because this is where the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.130 
under here because this is where the
rest<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:51.909> the<00:02:52.000> drive<00:02:52.239> shaft<00:02:52.269> if<00:02:52.810> this<00:02:52.959> was<00:02:53.109> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
rest of the drive shaft if this was a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.970 
rest of the drive shaft if this was a
four-wheel<00:02:53.560> drive<00:02:53.829> model<00:02:54.219> would<00:02:54.340> be<00:02:55.980> I'm

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
four-wheel drive model would be I'm

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.940 
four-wheel drive model would be I'm
assuming<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:58.000> two-wheel<00:02:58.959> drives<00:02:59.260> has

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
assuming that the two-wheel drives has

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.720 
assuming that the two-wheel drives has
less<00:03:00.280> fluid<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.909> it<00:03:01.150> might<00:03:01.329> be<00:03:01.359> just<00:03:01.510> 3.2

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
less fluid and it might be just 3.2

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.030 
less fluid and it might be just 3.2
liter<00:03:04.049> leaders<00:03:05.049> to<00:03:05.200> fill<00:03:05.379> it<00:03:05.470> back<00:03:05.590> up<00:03:05.650> or

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
liter leaders to fill it back up or

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.030 
liter leaders to fill it back up or
quarts<00:03:06.370> but<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:08.170> better<00:03:08.409> check<00:03:08.739> your

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
quarts but you better check your

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.789 
quarts but you better check your
application<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.780> I'm<00:03:11.200> gonna<00:03:11.379> actually

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
application and I'm gonna actually

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.050 
application and I'm gonna actually
measure<00:03:12.069> how<00:03:12.250> much<00:03:12.579> oil<00:03:13.540> comes<00:03:13.900> out<00:03:14.049> of<00:03:14.260> here

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.759 

so<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.239> when<00:03:19.359> I<00:03:19.389> refill<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.019> I<00:03:20.109> know<00:03:20.169> exactly

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
so that when I refill it I know exactly

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.420 
so that when I refill it I know exactly
I've<00:03:20.919> got<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.189> right<00:03:21.340> amount<00:03:21.459> in<00:03:21.730> there<00:03:23.430> of

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
I've got the right amount in there of

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.789 
I've got the right amount in there of
course<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:25.599> way<00:03:25.720> this<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.049> designed<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.769> you

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
course the way this is designed is you

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.920 
course the way this is designed is you
pump<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.489> fluid<00:03:27.639> in<00:03:27.939> from<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.299> bottom<00:03:28.659> on<00:03:28.870> the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
pump the fluid in from the bottom on the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.629 
pump the fluid in from the bottom on the
fill<00:03:29.829> side<00:03:30.189> and<00:03:31.439> when<00:03:32.439> it's<00:03:32.650> full<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.069> starts

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
fill side and when it's full it starts

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.949 
fill side and when it's full it starts
to<00:03:33.760> leak<00:03:33.909> back<00:03:34.209> out<00:03:36.299> since<00:03:37.299> I<00:03:37.419> don't<00:03:37.480> have<00:03:37.659> the

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
to leak back out since I don't have the

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.720 
to leak back out since I don't have the
Audi<00:03:38.139> tool<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.769> has<00:03:38.919> like<00:03:39.129> a<00:03:39.220> little<00:03:39.340> hook<00:03:39.579> in

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
Audi tool that has like a little hook in

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.539 
Audi tool that has like a little hook in
it<00:03:39.909> I'm<00:03:40.239> going<00:03:40.450> to<00:03:40.510> use<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.750> hose<00:03:41.409> and<00:03:41.859> I'm

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
it I'm going to use a hose and I'm

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.099 
it I'm going to use a hose and I'm
probably<00:03:42.760> going<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.000> make<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.180> big<00:03:43.389> ol<00:03:43.540> mess<00:03:43.750> but

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
probably going to make a big ol mess but

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.229 
probably going to make a big ol mess but
yeah<00:03:44.970> that's<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.090> way<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.299> goes<00:03:48.030> I'm<00:03:49.030> going<00:03:49.180> to

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
yeah that's the way it goes I'm going to

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.659 
yeah that's the way it goes I'm going to
let<00:03:49.329> that<00:03:49.359> continue<00:03:50.109> to<00:03:50.199> drain<00:03:50.440> as<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.430> matter

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
let that continue to drain as a matter

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.069 
let that continue to drain as a matter
of<00:03:51.760> fact<00:03:51.970> I'm<00:03:52.120> gonna<00:03:52.209> let<00:03:52.389> it<00:03:52.479> drain<00:03:52.659> for<00:03:52.690> about

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
of fact I'm gonna let it drain for about

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.530 
of fact I'm gonna let it drain for about
an<00:03:53.199> hour

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
an hour
