00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.579
 twenty-something my name is marisa and I come 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.420
 to show them how we can do 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.800
 a neil glossy matt cabinet from reb le 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.170
 we open the sides of our 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.450
 fingers so that we can avoid 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.489
 stain the skin do not forget 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.770
 download the brochita because that is very 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.899
 important for us to have a drying 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.420
 faster we open in the center what 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.170
 more you can and we cover almost the entire nail 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.840
 the second step is that small we take the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.229
 right lateral and we finish with the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.229
 left lateral 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.189
 our next step we are going to trace 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.619
 a very thin line with our brush 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.080
 of nail are not we forget that always 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.600
 we must download and start the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.920
 center and we will go sliding towards 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.500
 down 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.799
 we continue with our neila let's play 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.680
 with lines we make one in the center of 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.439
 right lateral to the left with 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.840
 this same brush we make one below 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.840
 and nothing more from the center to the left 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.490
 follow us playing with our 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.220
 lines and what we are going to create right now 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.740
 are going to be some pictures we draw a 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.650
 line in the middle of the left side 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.430
 towards the right since we have our 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.650
 cross 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.670
 we are going to fill in the part of 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.170
 down we start from top to bottom 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.990
 we open what we can with our 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.800
 brush and go with the following chart 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:11.570
 that is being diagonal and above 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.310
 towards the center to finish us 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.860
 with our disassembled or neill art 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.020
 our next step is to clean 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.959
 our finger having a complexion with 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.870
 Enamel remover without touching our 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.180
 nail for us not to hurt our 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.540
 effect 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.159
 to end up as a last tip never 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.569
 we forget that before closing 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.250
 our enamels 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.469
 we should always take a little ball with 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.510
 enamel remover and clean our 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:40.540
 mouthpiece so we're going to prevent our 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.329
 enamel to dry and the other to be done 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.549
