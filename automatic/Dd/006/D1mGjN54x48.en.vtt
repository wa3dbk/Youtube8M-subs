00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
okay what we're doing here is we're

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.280 
okay what we're doing here is we're
going<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.640> dispel<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.030> myth<00:00:12.150> about<00:00:12.900> these

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
going to dispel a myth about these

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.060 
going to dispel a myth about these
bananas<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.070> potatoes<00:00:14.490> being<00:00:14.730> radioactive

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
bananas and potatoes being radioactive

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.490 
bananas and potatoes being radioactive
what<00:00:17.070> we're<00:00:17.220> going<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.430> do<00:00:17.580> we've<00:00:17.850> got<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.500> got

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
what we're going to do we've got the got

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.970 
what we're going to do we've got the got
the<00:00:19.650> pulse<00:00:19.950> logger<00:00:20.250> on<00:00:20.369> zero<00:00:21.500> and<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.710> got<00:00:22.860> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the pulse logger on zero and we got the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.300 
the pulse logger on zero and we got the
log<00:00:23.160> clear<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.700> we're<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.000> start<00:00:24.779> it

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
log clear and we're going to start it

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.770 
log clear and we're going to start it
you'll<00:00:26.310> see<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.640> start<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:26.970> change<00:00:27.300> numbers

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
you'll see it start to change numbers

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.150 
you'll see it start to change numbers
there<00:00:28.610> see<00:00:29.610> you're<00:00:29.760> getting<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.180> couple<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
there see you're getting a couple a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.890 
there see you're getting a couple a
couple<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.400> hits<00:00:32.580> off<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.150> but<00:00:33.300> very<00:00:33.540> few

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
couple of hits off of it but very few

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.170 
couple of hits off of it but very few
now<00:00:34.800> let's<00:00:34.830> go<00:00:35.100> over<00:00:35.129> and<00:00:35.280> look<00:00:35.309> at<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.520> meter

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.660 

we're<00:00:39.180> using<00:00:39.330> our<00:00:39.510> linea<00:00:39.840> Geiger<00:00:40.050> counter

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
we're using our linea Geiger counter

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.750 
we're using our linea Geiger counter
that<00:00:41.670> set<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.120> x1<00:00:42.829> which<00:00:43.829> means<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:45.170> that

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
that set on x1 which means that that

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.880 
that set on x1 which means that that
point<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:48.510> there<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.410> tenth<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
point one there is one tenth of a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
point one there is one tenth of a
milligram<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.239> see<00:00:51.450> that<00:00:51.630> it's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
milligram and you can see that it's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.819 
milligram and you can see that it's
pretty<00:00:52.230> steady<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.890> about<00:00:53.250> four<00:00:53.790> or<00:00:53.850> five<00:00:54.829> that

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
pretty steady on about four or five that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.040 
pretty steady on about four or five that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
radiation coming from the soil probably

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.380 
radiation coming from the soil probably
a<00:01:01.950> little<00:01:02.070> bit<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.280> everything<00:01:02.430> mostly<00:01:03.030> gamma

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
a little bit of everything mostly gamma

a little bit of everything mostly gamma
though<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:05.240> see<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> neither<00:01:06.600> flick<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
though and see the neither flick a

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.690 
though and see the neither flick a
little<00:01:07.289> bit<00:01:07.500> that's<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.039> couple<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.520> hits

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
little bit that's a couple of hits

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.999 
little bit that's a couple of hits
probably<00:01:08.910> from<00:01:09.240> outer<00:01:09.360> space<00:01:09.800> today<00:01:10.800> we're

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
probably from outer space today we're

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.290 
probably from outer space today we're
having<00:01:11.160> a<00:01:11.369> little<00:01:11.759> bit<00:01:11.940> of<00:01:12.000> background

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.080 
having a little bit of background
radiation<00:01:12.810> hardly<00:01:13.289> normal<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:14.399> think<00:01:14.970> it's

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
radiation hardly normal I think it's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.430 
radiation hardly normal I think it's
probably<00:01:15.209> a<00:01:15.420> solar<00:01:15.630> flare<00:01:15.840> or<00:01:15.959> something<00:01:16.350> like

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
probably a solar flare or something like

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.779 
probably a solar flare or something like
that<00:01:17.090> if<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.240> look<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.690> this<00:01:19.440> meter<00:01:19.789> it's

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
that if you look at this this meter it's

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.359 
that if you look at this this meter it's
it's<00:01:21.179> going<00:01:21.479> for<00:01:21.630> 100<00:01:21.959> seconds<00:01:22.410> every<00:01:22.979> second

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it's going for 100 seconds every second

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.219 
it's going for 100 seconds every second
it's<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.729> take<00:01:23.910> a<00:01:23.940> it's<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.929> to<00:01:24.990> count
