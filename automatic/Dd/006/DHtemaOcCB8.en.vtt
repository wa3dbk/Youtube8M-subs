hard to see how he returned that was for

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.030 
hard to see how he returned that was for
me<00:02:22.430> as<00:02:22.550> it<00:02:22.700> was<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.910> stemming<00:02:23.300> from<00:02:23.330> him<00:02:24.040> that

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
me as it was the stemming from him that

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
that what we want to try and do is make

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.810 
that what we want to try and do is make
sure<00:03:32.630> they<00:03:32.959> did<00:03:33.140> got<00:03:33.320> lot<00:03:33.500> of<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.799> and<00:03:34.609> keep

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
sure they did got lot of it and keep

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.699 
sure they did got lot of it and keep
intensity<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.630> pressing<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.079> ball<00:03:36.230> again<00:03:36.530> so

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
intensity and pressing the ball again so

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.699 
intensity and pressing the ball again so
nothing<00:03:37.010> we<00:03:37.130> did<00:03:37.310> that<00:03:37.459> quite<00:03:37.670> well<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:39.049> the

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
nothing we did that quite well the the

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.520 
nothing we did that quite well the the
defense<00:03:40.459> of<00:03:40.609> a<00:03:40.670> dollar<00:03:40.850> problem<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.660> back<00:03:42.260> for

Bill<00:03:42.769> saw<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.579> no<00:03:43.850> no

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
Bill saw it no no

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.780 
Bill saw it no no
which<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.970> was<00:03:45.390> all<00:03:45.650> North<00:03:46.650> issued<00:03:47.430> over<00:03:47.519> that

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
which it was all North issued over that

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.750 
which it was all North issued over that
the<00:03:48.780> weakness<00:03:48.959> for<00:03:49.500> this<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.950> when<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.519> play<00:03:50.730> a

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
the weakness for this is when you play a

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.600 
the weakness for this is when you play a
young<00:03:51.060> 19<00:03:51.420> year<00:03:51.629> old<00:03:51.900> as<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.110> centre-forward

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
young 19 year old as a centre-forward

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.850 
young 19 year old as a centre-forward
with<00:03:53.610> what<00:03:54.239> we<00:03:54.390> experienced<00:03:54.840> there's<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.709> big

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
with what we experienced there's a big

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.449 
with what we experienced there's a big
need<00:03:56.040> for<00:03:56.069> them<00:03:56.659> difficult<00:03:57.659> a<00:03:57.780> problem<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.459> so

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
need for them difficult a problem and so

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.860 
need for them difficult a problem and so
therefore<00:03:59.670> although<00:04:00.120> we<00:04:00.329> worked<00:04:00.540> really<00:04:00.750> hard

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
therefore although we worked really hard

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.039 
therefore although we worked really hard
as<00:04:01.939> going<00:04:02.939> to<00:04:03.000> be<00:04:03.120> used<00:04:03.359> as<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.599> learning<00:04:03.750> curve
