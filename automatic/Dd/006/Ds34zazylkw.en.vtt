up a higher drop percentage when you

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.250 
up a higher drop percentage when you
carve<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.159> tail<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.879> say<00:02:17.700> number<00:02:18.700> three<00:02:19.260> now

last item I needed to make a particular

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.319 
last item I needed to make a particular
weapon<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.250> came<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.669> conclusion<00:03:09.700> that

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
weapon I came to the conclusion that

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.209 
weapon I came to the conclusion that
some<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.930> drop<00:03:11.169> percentages<00:03:11.829> are<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.069> bit

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:12.219 
some of the drop percentages are a bit

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.689 
some of the drop percentages are a bit
on<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.489> absurdly<00:03:12.939> low<00:03:13.450> side<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.980> probability

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:15.699 
on the absurdly low side the probability

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:17.879 
on the absurdly low side the probability
of<00:03:15.729> obtaining<00:03:15.970> some<00:03:16.569> rare<00:03:16.870> drops<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.530> as<00:03:17.680> low

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
of obtaining some rare drops is as low

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.559 
of obtaining some rare drops is as low
as<00:03:17.919> 1<00:03:18.340> percent<00:03:18.879> which<00:03:19.030> means<00:03:19.239> you're<00:03:19.389> going<00:03:19.510> to

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
as 1 percent which means you're going to

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.569 
as 1 percent which means you're going to
be<00:03:19.629> spending<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:20.199> lot<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.709> time<00:03:20.919> going<00:03:21.340> after

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
be spending a lot of time going after

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.360 
be spending a lot of time going after
some<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.120> these<00:03:22.209> materials<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:24.159> usually

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
some of these materials and you usually

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.140 
some of these materials and you usually
need<00:03:24.849> more<00:03:25.150> than<00:03:25.329> one<00:03:25.829> now<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:27.189> grind<00:03:27.519> is<00:03:27.760> part

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
need more than one now the grind is part

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.149 
need more than one now the grind is part
of<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.419> fun<00:03:28.689> and<00:03:28.959> why<00:03:29.079> finally<00:03:29.620> obtaining

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
of the fun and why finally obtaining

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.979 
of the fun and why finally obtaining
this<00:03:30.310> stuff<00:03:30.549> is<00:03:30.729> so<00:03:30.760> fulfilling<00:03:31.150> but<00:03:31.659> what<00:03:31.900> if

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
this stuff is so fulfilling but what if

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.979 
this stuff is so fulfilling but what if
you<00:03:32.109> could<00:03:32.290> go<00:03:32.470> after<00:03:32.949> a<00:03:32.979> monster<00:03:33.699> and<00:03:33.989> target

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
you could go after a monster and target

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.979 
you could go after a monster and target
a<00:03:35.049> specific<00:03:35.280> reward<00:03:36.720> you've<00:03:37.720> already

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
captured enough of them to know how to

captured enough of them to know how to
get<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.299> so<00:03:40.449> if<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:40.689> specify<00:03:41.319> at<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.590> start<00:03:41.949> of

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
get it so if you specify at the start of

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.339 
get it so if you specify at the start of
a<00:03:42.220> quest<00:03:42.639> that<00:03:43.329> you're<00:03:43.540> going<00:03:43.840> after<00:03:44.019> this
