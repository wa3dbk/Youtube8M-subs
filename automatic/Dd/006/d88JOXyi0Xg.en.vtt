00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.690
 we are going to prepare pasta salad 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.780
 curry with chicken the ingredients that 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.170
 we need are for about 4 or 6 people 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.059
 300 grams of pasta short to taste 300 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.520
 grams of fresh chicken breast or 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.770
 remains of roasted chicken chicken fillets 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.050
 the griddle or some chicken rest that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.900
 let's have a ripe avocado at home 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.720
 fresh pineapple cherry cherry tomatitos 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.410
 canned purple onion and cured cheese 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.830
 of strong flavor and for the sauce a yogurt 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.290
 Natural 4 tablespoons mayonnaise or sauce 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.810
 lightly 2 or 3 teaspoons of curry in 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.630
 powder a tablespoon of lemon juice one 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.390
 teaspoon of sugar or sweetener and 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.760
 a pinch of salt and let's start what 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.240
 first of all putting our water to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.460
 boil with salt to cook the pasta according to 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.070
 indicate the manufacturer's cooking the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.950
 let's do a minute or two less to 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.280
 that is al dente and while we are going to go 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.620
 on a plate with a little oil 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.630
 making our chicken this is in the 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.310
 case it's cool support 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.049
 I recommend that this salad 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.899
 do with chicken remains that I have 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.820
 left over from a roast or over again 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.149
 you have done chicken steaks is much 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.149
 best 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.600
 as we flip them over the pan 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.540
 we season it a little bit and leave it 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.110
 golden but juicy that we do not know 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.380
 dry too 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.530
 we reserve 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.930
 and when we see that the pasta is in 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.299
 his point was quickly drained and the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.340
 rinse with cold water to cut the 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.969
 cooking strongly 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.579
 we dry them well drained and we throw 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:49.649
 to a big bowl where we are going to join with 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.259
 the cured cheese that has to be strong 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.030
 so that contrast with the pineapple the corn 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.090
 the tomato the onion 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.970
 and so all the flavors have their 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.240
 contrast now let's prepare the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.600
 sauce we put the light sauce with the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.600
 yogurt 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.140
 and we are going to add a little sugar 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.410
 a spoonful of lemon juice the curry 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.290
 that looks great especially with the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.800
 pineapple in this recipe and we're going to mix it 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.220
 all very well until the curry is 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.450
 is well homogeneous in the sauce 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.959
 then we will throw it in our 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.959
 salad 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.730
 and mix it well so that everything 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.730
 Be well impregnated 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.030
 Finally, let's go with the avocado 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.890
 we wanted to cut it before so that 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.890
 do not oxidize us and leave us black 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.739
 it has to be an avocado that is in its 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.780
 point neither too soft nor too hard what 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.700
 we cut in half we take away the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.909
 bone and we take it out with the help of a 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.909
 spoon 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.800
 and we 're going to cut it in more cubes or 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.239
 less of the same thickness that we have the 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.230
 rest of ingredients of our 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.800
 salad 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.220
 we miss it and now that the chicken has been 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.940
 chilled completely we will cut it too 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.940
 in cubes 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.140
 we add it to our salad 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.239
 and finally if the chicken was fresh we 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.670
 will have been a bit of played in the 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.860
 dish that is perfect to finish off 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.400
 give the touch to our salad the 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.130
 We move well and serve and ready and 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.650
 we have our pasta salad with 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.349
 chicken curry that you see is very 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.349
 easy and there's the touch of curry with the 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:49.599
 pineapple and with the chicken is great and 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.599
 it's really delicious
