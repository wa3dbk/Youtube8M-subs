00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
the front and one of the sides what we

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.470 
the front and one of the sides what we
did<00:00:15.389> we<00:00:15.690> use<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.350> 3<00:00:16.529> inch<00:00:16.740> coat<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.850> cut<00:00:18.330> out<00:00:18.449> a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
did we use the 3 inch coat to cut out a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.210 
did we use the 3 inch coat to cut out a
hole<00:00:18.779> that's<00:00:19.170> what<00:00:19.380> squirrels<00:00:19.710> need<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.100> get

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
hole that's what squirrels need to get

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.400 
hole that's what squirrels need to get
in<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.550> out<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.930> also<00:00:22.109> cut<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.650> here<00:00:23.369> for

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
in and out and we also cut it here for

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.529 
in and out and we also cut it here for
predators<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:25.980> put<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.460> itself<00:00:27.330> right

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
predators so you put it itself right

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.710 
predators so you put it itself right
here<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.380> predators<00:00:29.039> can't<00:00:29.640> just<00:00:29.849> stick<00:00:30.420> their

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
here so predators can't just stick their

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.900 
here so predators can't just stick their
arm<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.410> get<00:00:31.529> them<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.040> we've<00:00:32.250> already<00:00:32.489> cut

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
to get the square the reason we use

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.770 
to get the square the reason we use
these<00:02:35.610> shoes<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:36.060> because<00:02:36.360> they're<00:02:36.540> special
