anatomy<00:01:06.210> book<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.830> divided<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.460> four

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
anatomy book so it's divided in four

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.399 
anatomy book so it's divided in four
parts<00:01:09.830> four<00:01:11.510> sections<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.780> first<00:01:12.810> section<00:01:13.049> is

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
parts four sections the first section is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.800 
parts four sections the first section is
a<00:01:13.470> figure<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:13.950> torso<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> second<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.659> head

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
a figure in torso and the second is head

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.289 
a figure in torso and the second is head
and<00:01:15.990> neck<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.320> an<00:01:16.590> upper<00:01:16.920> limb<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and neck and an upper limb and the the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.999 
and neck and an upper limb and the the
final<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.780> lower<00:01:19.020> limb<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.500> basically<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
final is lower limb so basically the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.490 
final is lower limb so basically the
order<00:01:20.250> how<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.460> sculpt<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:22.200> unique

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
order how you sculpt and the unique

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.499 
order how you sculpt and the unique
about<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.860> book<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.159> also<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.850> color<00:01:24.030> coding

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
about this book is also the color coding

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.450 
about this book is also the color coding
so<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.049> every<00:01:25.229> muscle<00:01:25.560> has<00:01:25.830> its<00:01:26.040> own<00:01:26.159> color

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
so the every muscle has its own color

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.140 
so the every muscle has its own color
suppose<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.299> if<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.600> follow<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
suppose with you if you follow the the

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.910 
suppose with you if you follow the the
muscle<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.659> deltoid<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.290> example<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.710> red

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
muscle like deltoid for example is red

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.649 
muscle like deltoid for example is red
and<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.280> always<00:01:32.490> red<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.030> whenever<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.450> turn

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and it's always red so whenever you turn

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.630 
and it's always red so whenever you turn
whenever<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> different<00:01:35.220> view<00:01:35.400> so

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
whenever you have a different view so

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.490 
whenever you have a different view so
you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.880> always<00:01:36.119> say<00:01:36.240> okay<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.320> is

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you can always say okay this is this is

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.399 
you can always say okay this is this is
not<00:01:37.650> other<00:01:37.920> muscle<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:40.049> helps

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
not other muscle then and it just helps

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.370 
not other muscle then and it just helps
it<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.369> helps<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:43.079> see<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
it just helps you to to to see the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.590 
it just helps you to to to see the
difference<00:01:43.740> where<00:01:44.070> because<00:01:44.970> sometimes<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
difference where because sometimes the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.590 
difference where because sometimes the
deform<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.259> not<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.399> pronounced<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.090> but

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
deform is not that pronounced and but

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719 
deform is not that pronounced and but
this<00:01:48.720> color<00:01:48.960> helps<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:50.310> separate

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
this color helps you to to separate

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.100 
this color helps you to to separate
where<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.240> deltoid<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.750> where<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
where the deltoid and where is the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.440 
where the deltoid and where is the
triceps<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.770> stuff<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.490> other

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
triceps and stuff like that and other

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.740 
triceps and stuff like that and other
the<00:01:54.600> good<00:01:54.750> thing<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.670> multiple<00:01:56.750> angles

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the good thing is it's a multiple angles

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.440 
the good thing is it's a multiple angles
so<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.619> see<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.159> always<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.000> front

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
so you see you always have this front

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.149 
so you see you always have this front
angle<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> back<00:02:01.590> view<00:02:01.890> then<00:02:02.130> you

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
angle then you have a back view then you

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.649 
angle then you have a back view then you
have<00:02:02.369> one<00:02:02.579> quarter<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.030> sometimes<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.450> even

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
have one quarter and sometimes you even

of talking about the little tricks and
the<00:03:10.739> differences<00:03:11.280> for<00:03:11.459> example<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.939> female

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
the differences for example the female

eyebrow and the male eyebrow what is

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.770 
eyebrow and the male eyebrow what is
different<00:03:14.549> so<00:03:14.700> it's<00:03:14.849> easy<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.209> understand

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
different so it's easy to understand

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.649 
different so it's easy to understand
it's<00:03:15.989> very<00:03:16.079> simple<00:03:16.650> very<00:03:17.159> simple<00:03:17.430> image<00:03:18.209> so

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
it's very simple very simple image so

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.360 
it's very simple very simple image so
you<00:03:18.720> basically<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.379> look<00:03:19.680> at<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:19.949> once<00:03:20.159> and

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
you basically you look at it once and

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.129 
you basically you look at it once and
then<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.519> understand<00:03:21.389> and<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.569> remember<00:03:22.049> you

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
then you understand and you remember you

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.849 
then you understand and you remember you
don't<00:03:22.260> need<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.709> always<00:03:23.120> look<00:03:24.120> into<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.510> book

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
don't need to always look into the book

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.259 
don't need to always look into the book
so<00:03:25.859> that's<00:03:26.099> about<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.519> knowledge<00:03:26.669> but

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
so that's about the knowledge but

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.210 
so that's about the knowledge but
reference<00:03:28.109> materials<00:03:28.590> they<00:03:28.769> are<00:03:28.799> always

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
reference materials they are always

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.939 
reference materials they are always
there<00:03:29.639> so<00:03:29.939> you<00:03:30.030> can<00:03:30.180> really<00:03:30.359> use<00:03:30.479> so<00:03:31.229> it's<00:03:31.680> all

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
part and there is complicated part like

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.490 
part and there is complicated part like
muscles<00:03:38.699> and<00:03:38.939> there's<00:03:39.510> all<00:03:39.720> Latin<00:03:40.109> names<00:03:40.319> of

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
deep analysis of movements for example

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.089 
deep analysis of movements for example
the<00:03:55.530> shoulder<00:03:55.889> people<00:03:56.489> you<00:03:57.060> people<00:03:57.569> often

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
the shoulder people you people often

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.439 
the shoulder people you people often
have<00:03:59.099> troubles<00:03:59.579> with<00:03:59.639> understanding<00:04:00.299> what

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
have troubles with understanding what

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.360 
have troubles with understanding what
happens<00:04:00.780> with<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.019> shoulder<00:04:01.349> when<00:04:01.919> it<00:04:02.040> when

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
happens with the shoulder when it when

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.429 
happens with the shoulder when it when
it<00:04:02.489> goes<00:04:02.669> up<00:04:02.909> and<00:04:03.209> when<00:04:03.629> it<00:04:03.780> goes<00:04:03.930> down<00:04:04.139> so<00:04:04.349> you

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
it goes up and when it goes down so you

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.050 
it goes up and when it goes down so you
can<00:04:04.560> really<00:04:04.799> follow<00:04:04.979> step<00:04:05.430> by<00:04:05.609> step<00:04:05.879> what

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
can really follow step by step what

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.550 
can really follow step by step what
happens<00:04:06.419> with<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:06.629> muscles<00:04:06.959> what<00:04:07.169> happens

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
happens with the muscles what happens

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.409 
happens with the muscles what happens
with<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.829> shapes<00:04:08.069> and<00:04:08.340> then<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.120> can<00:04:09.269> see

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
with the shapes and then you can see

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.390 
with the shapes and then you can see
also<00:04:09.629> photograph<00:04:10.319> so<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:10.590> can<00:04:10.769> really<00:04:11.189> see

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400
