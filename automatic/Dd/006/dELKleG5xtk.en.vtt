plunge router I purchased this several
years<00:00:20.310> ago<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.939> soon<00:00:21.330> after<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.750> purchased

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
years ago and soon after I purchased

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.130 
years ago and soon after I purchased
this<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.680> stopped<00:00:23.609> working<00:00:23.789> well<00:00:24.300> what<00:00:24.960> they

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
this it stopped working well what they

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.650 
this it stopped working well what they
stopped<00:00:25.380> working<00:00:25.640> what<00:00:26.640> happened<00:00:26.970> was<00:00:27.180> I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
stopped working what happened was I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.109 
stopped working what happened was I
would<00:00:28.230> turn<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.279> would<00:00:29.460> ramp<00:00:29.910> up

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
would turn it on and it would ramp up

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.740 
would turn it on and it would ramp up
full<00:00:30.480> speed<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.080> then<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.439> shut<00:00:31.650> off<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.360> I

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
full speed and then just shut off so I

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.100 
full speed and then just shut off so I
took<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.460> get<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.270> fixed<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
took it in to see to get it fixed and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.660 
took it in to see to get it fixed and
they<00:00:37.320> wanted<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.680> couple<00:00:37.860> hundred<00:00:38.070> dollars<00:00:38.430> for

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
they wanted a couple hundred dollars for

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
they wanted a couple hundred dollars for
what<00:00:39.600> appeared<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.410> new<00:00:40.590> speed

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
what appeared to be a new speed

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.930 
what appeared to be a new speed
controller<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.760> sending<00:00:42.300> unit<00:00:42.920> which<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.340> felt

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
controller and sending unit which I felt

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.459 
controller and sending unit which I felt
that<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> router<00:00:45.420> really<00:00:45.719> wasn't<00:00:45.899> worth<00:00:46.230> that

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that the router really wasn't worth that

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.520 
that the router really wasn't worth that
and<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.219> me<00:00:47.820> being<00:00:48.090> me<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.539> decided<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.500> what

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
and I me being me I decided to see what

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.770 
and I me being me I decided to see what
I<00:00:49.739> could<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.430> see<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.270> could<00:00:51.420> fix<00:00:51.600> it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
I could do to see if I could fix it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.459 
I could do to see if I could fix it
myself<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> access<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.719> speed<00:00:55.020> controller

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
myself so to access the speed controller

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.810 
myself so to access the speed controller
what<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> need<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.610> get<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> Torx<00:00:57.690> t15

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
what you need to do is get a Torx t15

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.770 
what you need to do is get a Torx t15
screwdriver<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.180> unscrew<00:01:02.510> backing<00:01:03.510> plate

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
screwdriver and unscrew backing plate

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.870 
screwdriver and unscrew backing plate
here<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.320> you'll<00:01:05.100> gain<00:01:05.280> access<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:07.880> what's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
here and you'll gain access to what's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
here and you'll gain access to what's
going<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.299> here<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> took<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> apart<00:01:13.500> I

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
going on here so when I took it apart I

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.340 
going on here so when I took it apart I
noticed<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.790> round<00:01:15.270> disc<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:15.990> had

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
noticed that that round disc here had

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.219 
noticed that that round disc here had
come<00:01:16.619> off<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:18.090> was<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.600> running<00:01:18.869> freely

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
come off and it was just running freely

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.560 
come off and it was just running freely
around<00:01:19.530> there<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.640> loose<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.330> spun

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
around there and was loose and it spun

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.320 
around there and was loose and it spun
and<00:01:21.810> melted<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.220> controlling<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.030> and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and melted this be controlling in it and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.899 
and melted this be controlling in it and
it<00:01:24.540> also<00:01:24.750> had<00:01:25.110> melted<00:01:25.830> onto<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.280> cap<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.790> it

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
it also had melted onto the cap that it

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.069 
it also had melted onto the cap that it
was<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:27.270> melt<00:01:27.630> into<00:01:28.049> molten<00:01:29.009> melted<00:01:30.079> plastic

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
was all melt into molten melted plastic

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.590 
was all melt into molten melted plastic
that<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:31.950> all<00:01:32.159> kind<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.610> compiled<00:01:33.030> there<00:01:33.299> so

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
that was all kind of compiled there so

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.780 
that was all kind of compiled there so
that<00:01:34.140> pretty<00:01:34.590> much<00:01:34.770> stopped<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.369> from<00:01:35.520> working

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that pretty much stopped it from working

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.109 
that pretty much stopped it from working
so<00:01:36.770> what<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.799> end<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:37.979> doing<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.549> mine<00:01:38.759> here's

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
so what I end up doing with mine here's

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.319 
so what I end up doing with mine here's
I<00:01:39.920> cleaned<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:41.040> all<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.340> melted<00:01:42.060> plastic

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
I cleaned up all the melted plastic

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.109 
I cleaned up all the melted plastic
around<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.500> capped<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.130> make<00:01:44.759> sure<00:01:44.909> there

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
around on the capped and make sure there

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.760 
around on the capped and make sure there
was<00:01:45.210> enough<00:01:45.360> clearance<00:01:45.630> there<00:01:45.930> between<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
was enough clearance there between the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.230 
was enough clearance there between the
speed<00:01:46.979> controller<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.549> unit<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.909> sending

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
speed controller in the unit the sending

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.749 
speed controller in the unit the sending
unit<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.380> got<00:01:49.590> some<00:01:49.799> epoxy<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.670> could

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
unit and I got some epoxy or you could

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.630 
unit and I got some epoxy or you could
probably<00:01:50.880> use<00:01:51.090> jb<00:01:51.390> weld<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.130> i<00:01:53.130> cleaned<00:01:53.549> it

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
probably use jb weld and i cleaned it

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.139 
probably use jb weld and i cleaned it
all<00:01:53.700> off<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.860> put<00:01:55.860> epoxy<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.790> set<00:01:56.969> back

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
all off and put epoxy on it and set back

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.789 
all off and put epoxy on it and set back
the<00:01:57.450> little<00:01:57.719> speed<00:01:57.990> controller<00:01:58.290> cap<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
the little speed controller cap on the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.760 
the little speed controller cap on the
back<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> shop<00:01:59.399> there<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.619> let<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.649> sit

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
back of the shop there and let it sit

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.010 
back of the shop there and let it sit
for<00:02:01.890> 24<00:02:02.280> hours<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:03.299> me<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.659> seemed<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
for 24 hours and for me that seemed to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.359 
for 24 hours and for me that seemed to
do<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> trick<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.770> router<00:02:04.979> has<00:02:05.189> been

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
do the trick and the router has been

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.770 
do the trick and the router has been
working<00:02:05.640> flawlessly<00:02:05.759> ever<00:02:06.210> since<00:02:06.479> then<00:02:06.630> so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
working flawlessly ever since then so

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.389 
working flawlessly ever since then so
it's<00:02:06.899> been<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.229> for<00:02:07.290> copiers<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.129> I'm

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
it's been like that for copiers and I'm
