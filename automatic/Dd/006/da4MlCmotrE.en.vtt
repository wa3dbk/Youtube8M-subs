00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.150
 the butt 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.090
 opportunity risk is more important 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.360
 now I'll make the most of it 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.360
 possible 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.379
 kisses him of the players who are very 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.309
 so concentrated are making a 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.900
 great job 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.970
 we suffered two are still more 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.260
 important the identification of the whole 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.180
 team on the defensive 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.949
 they play a key role as well. 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.610
 In this game press the defenders after 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.119
 Young easy for us behind 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.640
 it has been great an incredible experience 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.710
 I had taffarel as an idol when 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.180
 I played neither a person who is always 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.420
 passing tranquility is a great thing 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.420
 simple 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.500
 We have to try on the training of the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.869
 intensity that is more similar to that 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.600
 people have in the game we have been given 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.750
 this intensity of the game in training 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.750
 also 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.220
 in the first possession of a ball by hand 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.900
 two teams is with the possession a marking 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.630
 pressing her when she stole 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.370
 was passed with the possession of ball in the attack 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.370
 and the other that he missed by marking 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.890
 the second very intense part that repaired 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.910
 a very or similar intensity of play 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.910
 with game situations 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.130
 a team attacked the priority 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.390
 other numerical defended with 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.760
 numerical inferiority a transition 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.740
 fast defense attack attack defense 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.400
 also with a very good intensity and 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.400
 excellent workout 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.820
 We take the I study very extremes. 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.180
 methodology methodology 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.790
 that was thus employed in the 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.170
 situation of the game and we can do 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.180
 this here for the talking triangle 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.180
 with the senator studying reading a lot 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.120
 their quality and training in the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.160
 their clubs 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.660
 they come here with a clear short period 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.190
 what do we have to train people? 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.870
 tries to do the best possible way 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.260
 snaps into the system which is dunga 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.930
 from inside the field in the game to the hour 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.740
 of the fan game as we have done our 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.740
 five past games
