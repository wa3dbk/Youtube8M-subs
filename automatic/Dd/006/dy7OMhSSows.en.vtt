00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.720
 mercedes shows before the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.820
 actual fair held at its 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.719
 media night four new vehicles 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.519
 three full amg and the new b class for 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.039
 the right backdrop ensures that 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.750
 famous bath monitor where once was the first 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.760
 bikini was presented 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.220
 for the right musical frame 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.140
 has engaged mercedes one republic 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.460
 currently probably one of the world 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.460
 most successful bands 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.129
 What 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.100
 the highlight and the fight announcement to the 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.500
 second swabian car manufacturer with seat 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.969
 in the stuttgart area, the new one is likely 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.969
 amg gt be 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:02.510
 when developing new v8 engine with 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:06.750
 a biturbo 510ps incredible 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:10.800
 Performance designed by the car convinced 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.030
 by a great weight distribution 47 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.920
 53 percent ideal in handling and thus 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.460
 also pure driving performance 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.260
 we have a lot of light metal installed 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.040
 which we are especially proud of 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:30.800
 have to be a great power 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:34.229
 power output 308 kilograms per ps 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.300
 benchmark in the segment and the software 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.160
 Car is hotly sought after the first customers 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.990
 have your copy already secured 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.979
 So who wants to have one should not 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.750
 think long 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.470
 And there is not even the price 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.110
 the interest for the gt is huge 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.869
 I'm sure there's one in the beginning 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.220
 reasonable wait will be and we will 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.030
 Also make sure in such a way 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.320
 exclusive segment that we will end march 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.460
 so to speak harmonize with each other 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.720
 if you have one probably in the next 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.850
 year I would already mean mine 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.530
 to place an order 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.630
 who at the base of the automobiles 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.470
 The new b 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.600
 be great 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.400
 next to a rather gentle outer 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.050
 Revision has become under the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.300
 bonnet done a lot 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.070
 the new b class comes with three 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.230
 new drive options on the 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.140
 market 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.110
 with the b class we have this one 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.640
 rollout now allows 150,000 cars 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.069
 already sold all are happy 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.440
 Competitors come now and try 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.580
 to copy us and her in exactly that 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.030
 moment we already have the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.769
 model care have the icon gently in the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.900
 exterieur evolved and have 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.660
 except that we have five petrol and five 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.030
 diesel engines now offer two more 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.340
 alternative drives a lot 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.170
 efficient and environmentally friendly gas 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.769
 vehicle and the all-electric 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.780
 Vehicles in the B class audi shows in 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.910
 Paris for the first time the new tt 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.069
 roadster of the public the new 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.099
 Two-seater is purist from the outside 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.349
 as his predecessor the new one is 41 7 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.489
 centimeters even shorter by two centimeters 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.769
 as his predecessor 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.890
 it should not be on the driving fun either 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.440
 lack of tts makes 310 ps 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.239
 even more ps offers audi with this 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.250
 concept vehicle a faster 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.579
 sports car with four seats and five 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.760
 doors of the tt sportback concept under the 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:34.269
 hood is a high performance aggregate of the 2.0 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:36.160
 tfsi inflated to 400 ps bmw there 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.620
 in Paris also open and 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.810
 presents the new two convertibles 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.700
 fabric roof and four seats it is almost 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.859
 the spiritual successor of the legendary 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.859
 three convertibles from the 90s 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.049
 This vehicle will be the sportiest 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.880
 most dynamic in the segment with the 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.690
 powerful six-cylinder engines 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.130
 up to transmitting ps as m 235 g so 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.840
 certainly the sportiest convertible 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.720
 but on the other hand, too 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.630
 economical engines with the title with only 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.299
 109 grams of co2 vehicle has grown 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.720
 something offers more comfort more interior space 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.489
 a larger load-through unit so one 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.940
 that's why it's called half class jump 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.700
 on two second news at bmw is 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.919
 actually only a revision of the x6 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.669
 visually, he hardly differs from the 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.680
 predecessor 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.460
 There is something under the tin 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.520
 more economical diesel engine 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.340
 on this vehicle meanwhile very much 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.680
 Consumption reduces below 160 grams 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.160
 diesel in this segment, I think so too 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.410
 a technical statement that fits into the 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.270
 Time as a vehicle is also strong 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.450
 improves the interior in a higher 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.580
 valence better comfort very precise 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.760
 Steering so all in all, I believe 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.590
 a big jump to the predecessor something 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.690
 smaller is it at opel on the well 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.910
 the longest stage of the fair 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.580
 opel the fifth generation of the corsas 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.140
 The successful small car is now available 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.800
 for 32 years 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.210
 he was sold 32 million times 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.280
 Generation 5 is mostly inside 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.230
 completely redesigned and can be 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.020
 on request with a lot of innovative 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.090
 Technique from automatic parking till 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.090
 towards traffic sign recognition 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.090
 equip
