00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.980

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.980
 treat cars that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.990
 banished from abroad because 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.900
 customs duty is so high that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.590
 the car is usually bought there in a terrible 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.750
 condition 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.810
 somewhere along the way to being done or here to 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.640
 made in general is some 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.320

 I know how to use the prostate 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.890

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:46.870

 carfax did not print one 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.050
 page here if we are in the Carpathians 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.660
 in general we will not give anything and machines here 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.270
 it will not be well that is, these are bad cars 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.260

 I just don't understand her 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.440
 different languages says but look 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.780
 let me just ask you a direct question 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.580
 I want to know confirmation of the run 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.300
 Each car in America can be pierced by 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.550
 carfax y 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.800

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:29.389
 and how it will I have my 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.400
 and a piece of paper is well we you know well 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:35.150
 different pieces of paper can be different places 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.340
 check teach you think that I do not 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.259
 professional do you think that I am not 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.630
 professional and above all learned 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.539
 empty dollar on which item is taken 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.880
 now i don't care what course you are 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.910
 it took me why it is important to me her 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:54.139
 buy and do not want dinner little let 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.820
 other it is the price they are not and generally not about 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:02.150
 talk all go let me see 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:06.110
 the car is not well you step aside give 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.970

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.990
 lan then all the best all with you 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.990
 ok guys bye 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.729
 but just no other word clowns 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.250
 otherwise, in the first video ended so 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.320
 quickly because you saw at the beginning how 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.849
 we drove through some garages in 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.729
 some dead end, I specifically put 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:28.030
 car what is called on the course of the muzzle 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:30.770
 on departure so you can quickly get away 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.050
 I had such a desire as soon as 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.740
 we put our feet on the pad on 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.960
 the territory of this site is generally funny 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.520
 everything from going somewhere 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.430
 carfax destroyed 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.349
 gone somewhere since the car is already a month 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.759
 how it stands on the general is just full 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:54.229
 delirious car with a mileage of 26 thousand miles for 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:55.960
 something all doused inside run 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:59.720
 impossible to know because replaced 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:02.900
 seats gear knob steering pedals 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.270
 that is, it's just like a new car 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.720
 but what is there in reality technically 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.580
 it's impossible to find out all the cars are such 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.590
 because even getting out of the car I 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.530
 I saw from a distance that all the cars 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.270
 freshly doused and that's the problem 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.400
 everything is really very beautiful that is 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:23.000
 still bad as when she wants to herself beautiful 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.490
 car but does not understand what is outside 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.699
 the beauty of God which are in technical 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.699
 Problems
