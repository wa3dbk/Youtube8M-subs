00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.490
 let's not go with mesbah before he explains 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.970
 that beautiful goal was a beautiful one 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.830
 goals 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.990
 I'm really happy because not 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.080
 I have been scoring goals for a year and a half 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.180
 I am happy and beautiful goal and are 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.310
 really happy because he seemed 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.010
 all easy then they took you back then 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.220
 you have taken off then there is to be defined 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.740
 the episode of you are a bit 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.660
 complicated by themselves after yes yes yes I had 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.610
 made a very good offensive level 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.850
 anyway he had taken three after 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.070
 goal and it is not that we have suffered so much 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.360
 we took three goals on let's say 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.760
 situations a bit negative but let's go 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.129
 forward we see these three points of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.930
 today they were very important and 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.820
 however we know that we work 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.460
 every day we are not yet one hundred 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.680
 per cent on a collective level 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.570
 of play we can do much more 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.270
 we are working every day for 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.969
 that and now we rest 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.329
 we go to florence to do a battle 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.329
 there 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.210
 and still make a good performance 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.800
 as today is in my opinion yes yes we are good 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.810
 in the field we can also beat the 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.120
 Florentine, how much it weighed until today 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.180
 he had not yet won 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.060
 yes when the jobs don't win anyway 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.760
 a lot of training the week and not 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.100
 win is not good because all I wanted 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.650
 win 15 we want these three points 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.500
 this victory tonight and move on 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.360
 so feel instead with regards to the 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.710
 your match the strength of the parma year 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.570
 last was also to insert 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.370
 players who played less and find 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.260
 performance happened tonight in 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.640
 fund because until now you and rosi 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.230
 giving an example you played less 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.170
 of the other bills made both goals 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.090
 yes yes like last week against 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.820
 the Catania team played they played 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.070
 free player made a beautiful one 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.850
 game today we played with mendes 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.230
 unveil en rose ii I had done 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.480
 let's say a good game we won 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.690
 and this is what the coach knows 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.060
 all that 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.400
 that we are a group we are 23 I say with 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.000
 a lot of sincerity and a lot of tranquility that 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:19.640
 we are mature boys who 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.230
 how about the coach after this one 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.420
 what must be a force for us to 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.700
 make a great championship and at the end 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.110
 we are doing one of the championship 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.820
 we would be very great ranking 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:38.480
 everyone satisfied everyone 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:41.150
 how to say yes gratified for that 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.250
 because you can do 30 season game 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:49.780
 goes in series be nothing 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.040
 you do yesterday you do not only against ibc ha 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.410
 combined and you make a great deal 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.450
 championship with a team at the end 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.670
 evening to have confessed of you have one 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.519
 dedicates dedicated brigle ie rosita 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.190
 leonardi you will not bring everyone to all 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.519
 the team supporting the director who 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.850
 however I have known him for four years but 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.220
 always wanted so I do it to all 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.400
 the team 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.280
 to players and staff and society 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.170
 last goal juve milan coppa italia yes yes 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.690
 also a nice goal 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:28.060
 a year and a half ago 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.380
 yes, however , right -headed from what not 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.760
 they score a goal as there is 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.520
 this is one of the most beautiful goals of yours 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.710
 career in italy honestly yes yes yes 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.690
 yes but I had already made two goals from 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.100
 right in series a in series b against la 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.870
 juve no dai is as quiet as but how 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.420
 the atanta brings me luck because if the 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.670
 second goal but let's go ahead 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:54.490
 this shot the omitted book after we see 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.230
 if I can confirm this there was city 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.240
 since it was on that band what it is 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.670
 success with angry amauri now 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.390
 with me listen I was a little behind not 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.400
 I followed I saw the red card 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.760
 what can I say 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.799
 it happens but I hope you don't 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.319
 we lose for so long because he loves the 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:18.090
 important player for us 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:22.199
 but let's say mature is a smart guy 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.419
 therefore he will have his reasons 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.490
 as I said before we hope that not 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.500
 takes so many many days 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.060
 the last one is also approaching the world championship 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.039
 if the play-off for the world championship for the 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.020
 your geria in a while think about it a little 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.210
 a game that can really change you 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.139
 also career and I think about it already 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.810
 time and now I think of the Parma after 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:47.370
 I think about that gallery 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:50.370
 make them but let's say a part gone 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.729
 very important return for algeria e 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.590
 also for me personally because 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:58.860
 go make a world second would be 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.720
 but a great thing I work here 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.340
 we still work a few days later 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.060
 a thought to this challenge lia 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.060
