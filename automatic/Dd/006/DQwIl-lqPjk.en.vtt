00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
that for us with copying of discs it's

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.070 
that for us with copying of discs it's
kind<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.010> touchy<00:00:23.850> subject<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.779> hard

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
kind of it's a touchy subject it's hard

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.769 
kind of it's a touchy subject it's hard
to<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.830> costs<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.730> lot<00:00:26.789> more<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.390> get<00:00:27.630> it

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
to do it costs you a lot more to get it

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.779 
to do it costs you a lot more to get it
so<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:28.740> uncomfortable<00:00:29.189> there's<00:00:29.580> there's

so it's uncomfortable there's there's

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.550 
so it's uncomfortable there's there's
some<00:00:30.119> discs<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.599> believe<00:00:30.990> are<00:00:31.140> called<00:00:31.289> hex

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
some discs that I believe are called hex

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.760 
some discs that I believe are called hex
lock<00:00:32.009> they<00:00:32.790> cost<00:00:33.030> about<00:00:33.329> $10<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.110> disc<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.559> it's

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
lock they cost about $10 a disc but it's

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.709 
lock they cost about $10 a disc but it's
absolutely<00:00:35.489> sure<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.790> no<00:00:36.270> one<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.600> ever

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
absolutely sure that no one can ever

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.780 
absolutely sure that no one can ever
copy<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.380> other<00:00:37.890> ways<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.700> you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
copy that other ways to do that is you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.369 
copy that other ways to do that is you
can<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.239> make<00:00:39.270> programs<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.200> disc

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
can you can make programs on the disc

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.229 
can you can make programs on the disc
itself<00:00:40.800> that'll<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.670> know<00:00:41.700> prevent<00:00:42.059> copying

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
itself that'll you know prevent copying

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.790 
itself that'll you know prevent copying
that<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:42.989> only<00:00:43.110> play<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.590> certain

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
that you can only play in certain

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.970 
that you can only play in certain
players<00:00:44.430> that's<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> lot<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.980> like

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
players that's what a lot of the like

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.590 
players that's what a lot of the like
moving<00:00:47.219> people<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:47.789> producers<00:00:48.270> they<00:00:48.390> put

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
moving people and we producers they put

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.880 
moving people and we producers they put
you<00:00:48.870> know<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.170> software<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.559> there<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.829> he

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
you know just software on there that he

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.160 
you know just software on there that he
can<00:00:50.010> put<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.250> into<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.539> computer<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.660> won't<00:00:51.840> read

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
can put it into a computer it won't read

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.020 
can put it into a computer it won't read
you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> same<00:00:53.219> thing<00:00:53.460> with<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:53.699> disc

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
you can do the same thing with your disc

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.819 
you can do the same thing with your disc
it's<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> software<00:00:55.140> side<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
it's on the software side of it the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
it's on the software side of it the
content<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.489> put<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> disc<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.390> lock<00:00:57.780> it

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
content you put on the disc can lock it

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.860 
content you put on the disc can lock it
up<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.710> that's<00:00:59.340> kind<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.609> what<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.940> so

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
up but that's kind of what it is so

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.319 
up but that's kind of what it is so
basically<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:02.010> gonna<00:01:02.190> cost<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.730> more<00:01:02.789> it's

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
basically it's gonna cost you more it's

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.719 
basically it's gonna cost you more it's
gonna<00:01:03.510> cost<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.019> get<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.369> uncopyable<00:01:05.369> disc

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
gonna cost you to get a uncopyable disc

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.969 
gonna cost you to get a uncopyable disc
it's<00:01:06.000> gonna<00:01:06.119> cost<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.869> significant<00:01:07.799> amount

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it's gonna cost you a significant amount

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.950 
it's gonna cost you a significant amount
more<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.820> don't<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.570> software

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
more if you don't have the software

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.350 
more if you don't have the software
behind<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:11.460> are<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.970> discs<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.299> I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
behind it there are the discs like I

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.330 
behind it there are the discs like I
said<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> hex<00:01:12.869> lock<00:01:13.140> or<00:01:13.380> there's<00:01:14.280> another

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
said the hex lock or there's another

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
said the hex lock or there's another
program<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.720> lock<00:01:15.869> discs

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
program that we have that can lock discs

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.620 
program that we have that can lock discs
but<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> use<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> special<00:01:18.390> kind<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
but you have to use a special kind of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.880 
but you have to use a special kind of
disc<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> use<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> special<00:01:19.590> kind<00:01:19.619> of

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
disc you have to use a special kind of

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.950 
disc you have to use a special kind of
program<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.369> order<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> burn<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.000> which<00:01:21.780> is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
program in order to burn it which is

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
program in order to burn it which is
fairly<00:01:22.320> expensive<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:23.759> we<00:01:23.850> talking

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
fairly expensive and are we talking

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.140 
fairly expensive and are we talking
about<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.659> overall<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> program

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
about so overall if you have a program

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.569 
about so overall if you have a program
which<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.689> cheaper<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.799> you're<00:01:29.400> talking

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
which is cheaper so you're talking

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.640 
which is cheaper so you're talking
overall<00:01:30.150> still<00:01:30.540> probably<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:31.049> two<00:01:31.439> or<00:01:31.619> three

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
overall still probably like two or three

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.140 
overall still probably like two or three
times<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> cost<00:01:32.400> two<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:32.820> three<00:01:32.970> yeah

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
times the cost two or three yeah

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.060 
times the cost two or three yeah
probably<00:01:33.960> two<00:01:34.079> or<00:01:34.110> three<00:01:34.229> times<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.710> cost<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
probably two or three times the cost and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.819 
probably two or three times the cost and
then<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.880> end<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.060> someone<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.350> what

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
then in the end if someone this is what

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.710 
then in the end if someone this is what
duplication<00:01:38.610> it'll<00:01:38.909> make<00:01:39.060> sure<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.509> is

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
