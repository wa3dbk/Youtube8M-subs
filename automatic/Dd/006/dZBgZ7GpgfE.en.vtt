hop over in the HTML file and start

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.629 
hop over in the HTML file and start
actually<00:00:11.910> making<00:00:12.410> the<00:00:13.410> crap<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:14.130> makes<00:00:14.400> this

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
actually making the crap that makes this

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.779 
actually making the crap that makes this
stuff<00:00:14.849> work<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.870> what<00:00:16.619> we<00:00:16.770> did<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.310> already

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
unordered list

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.560 
unordered list
remember<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.320> entire<00:01:16.740> footer<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.570> an

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
remember this entire footer is an

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.450 
remember this entire footer is an
unordered<00:01:19.110> list<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.500> each<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.770> these<00:01:19.950> buttons

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
unordered list in each of these buttons

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.910 
unordered list in each of these buttons
the<00:01:20.670> home<00:01:20.880> button<00:01:21.240> account<00:01:21.720> profile<00:01:22.350> two

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the home button account profile two

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.820 
the home button account profile two
columns<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:24.030> list<00:01:24.330> item<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.740> your

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
columns it's a list item so in your

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.020 
columns it's a list item so in your
unordered<00:01:26.369> list<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:27.060> gave<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.659> ID<00:01:27.869> of

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
unordered list we gave this the ID of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.899 
unordered list we gave this the ID of
footer<00:01:30.030> menu<00:01:31.939> I<00:01:32.939> think<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:34.850> now<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
footer menu I think it was now the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.330 
footer menu I think it was now the
footer<00:01:36.329> menu<00:01:36.530> if<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.740> could<00:01:37.920> find<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:40.070> where<00:01:41.070> are

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
footer menu if I could find it where are

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.520 
footer menu if I could find it where are
you<00:01:41.520> all<00:01:41.790> right<00:01:42.000> now<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> footer<00:01:42.930> menu<00:01:43.020> we

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
you all right now the footer menu we

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.340 
you all right now the footer menu we
pretty<00:01:43.950> much<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.570> did<00:01:45.570> some<00:01:45.750> housekeeping

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
pretty much just did some housekeeping

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.950 
pretty much just did some housekeeping
stuff<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.220> said<00:01:47.399> okay<00:01:47.729> reset<00:01:48.630> all<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
stuff and we said okay reset all the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.950 
stuff and we said okay reset all the
margins<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.770> padding<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.430> width<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.240> zero<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
margins and padding in width to zero and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.440 
margins and padding in width to zero and
also<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:53.189> pretty<00:01:53.369> much<00:01:53.460> set<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.909> up<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
also we pretty much set it up so it

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.719 
also we pretty much set it up so it
isn't<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.990> regular<00:01:55.229> unordered<00:01:56.040> list<00:01:56.250> because<00:01:56.549> a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
isn't a regular unordered list because a

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.789 
isn't a regular unordered list because a
regular<00:01:57.090> unordered<00:01:57.810> list<00:01:58.049> would<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.590> a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
regular unordered list would be like a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.660 
regular unordered list would be like a
grocery<00:01:59.250> list<00:01:59.280> where<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.939> tuna<00:02:00.649> bacon

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
grocery list where you have tuna bacon

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.330 
grocery list where you have tuna bacon
one<00:02:02.670> item<00:02:03.060> right<00:02:03.479> under<00:02:04.049> each<00:02:04.259> other<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:05.189> in

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
one item right under each other but in

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.160 
one item right under each other but in
this<00:02:05.549> unordered<00:02:06.210> list<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.659> course<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.049> going

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
this unordered list of course it's going

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.839 
this unordered list of course it's going
to<00:02:07.229> be<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> little<00:02:07.530> bit<00:02:07.649> different<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:08.489> want<00:02:08.700> our

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
to be a little bit different we want our

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.999 
to be a little bit different we want our
items<00:02:09.239> side-by-side<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.319> we're<00:02:10.500> basically

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
items side-by-side so we're basically

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.850 
items side-by-side so we're basically
setting<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.879> framework<00:02:12.180> there

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
setting the framework there

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.460 
setting the framework there
now<00:02:14.010> that's<00:02:14.940> all<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.450> need<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.810> do<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.140> set<00:02:16.350> it

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
now that's all you need to do to set it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.080 
now that's all you need to do to set it
up<00:02:16.560> pretty<00:02:16.980> freakin<00:02:17.460> sweet<00:02:17.490> huh

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
up pretty freakin sweet huh

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.060 
up pretty freakin sweet huh
so<00:02:18.450> now<00:02:18.720> what<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:18.990> can<00:02:19.170> do<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.770> start

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
so now what we can do is we can start

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.760 
so now what we can do is we can start
creating<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.640> individual<00:02:21.300> buttons<00:02:22.020> now

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
creating the individual buttons now

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.220 
creating the individual buttons now
these<00:02:23.010> are<00:02:23.160> very<00:02:23.400> easy<00:02:23.460> like<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.360> said<00:02:24.570> each

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
these are very easy like I said each

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.190 
these are very easy like I said each
individual<00:02:25.920> button<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.820> list<00:02:27.330> item<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:28.050> what
