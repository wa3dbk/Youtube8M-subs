so much water for the amount of rice
we're<00:01:24.940> using<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.420> that's<00:01:25.930> because<00:01:26.320> we<00:01:26.710> are

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
we're using and that's because we are

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.830 
we're using and that's because we are
going<00:01:27.009> to<00:01:27.220> end<00:01:27.460> up<00:01:27.610> straining<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.630> water

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
going to end up straining the water

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.870 
going to end up straining the water
excess<00:01:29.320> water<00:01:29.530> out<00:01:29.680> at<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.070> end<00:01:30.250> this<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.700> a

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
excess water out at the end this is a

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.760 
excess water out at the end this is a
really<00:01:31.149> healthy<00:01:31.390> way<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.720> cooking<00:01:31.990> since<00:01:32.500> most

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
really healthy way of cooking since most

of the starch and the rice gets removed
at<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.810> end<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:37.479> it's<00:01:37.600> been<00:01:37.750> ten<00:01:37.990> minutes<00:01:38.140> now

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
at the end so it's been ten minutes now
