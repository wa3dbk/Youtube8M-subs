00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
best present I ever got was probably a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.640 
best present I ever got was probably a
new<00:01:26.939> drum<00:01:27.210> set<00:01:27.479> or<00:01:27.630> something<00:01:27.840> when<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.200> was<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
new drum set or something when I was you

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.649

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
know getting really into music a little

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.109 
know getting really into music a little
bit<00:01:30.780> more<00:01:31.079> probably<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.130> Sears<00:01:32.579> drum<00:01:32.880> kit

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.850 
bit more probably that Sears drum kit
does<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.570> started<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.049> whole<00:01:34.079> journey<00:01:34.470> I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.530 
does that started the whole journey I
mean<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.369> guess<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.670> could<00:01:35.850> say<00:01:36.000> when<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> was<00:01:36.390> like
