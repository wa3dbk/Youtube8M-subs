00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
into it it was kind of murky about him

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.270 
into it it was kind of murky about him
being<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.510> lower<00:02:26.720> class<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.530> things<00:02:28.040> being

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
being in a lower class and things being

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.630 
being in a lower class and things being
crazy<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.909> stuff<00:02:29.319> basically<00:02:30.319> there's<00:02:30.920> magic

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
crazy and stuff basically there's magic

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.240 
crazy and stuff basically there's magic
there's<00:02:32.209> some<00:02:32.390> classism<00:02:32.959> there's<00:02:33.769> some<00:02:33.950> human

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
there's some classism there's some human

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.180 
there's some classism there's some human
sacrifices<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.269> so<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.440> sounds<00:02:36.799> very<00:02:36.980> much

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
sacrifices and so it sounds very much

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.699 
sacrifices and so it sounds very much
like<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.730> very<00:02:38.060> intense<00:02:38.569> version<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.500> beauty

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
like a very intense version of beauty
