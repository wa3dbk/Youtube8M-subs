the Xperia z3 V doesn't feel good in the
hands<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.910> just<00:03:36.239> doesn't<00:03:36.540> feel<00:03:36.690> quite<00:03:36.750> as<00:03:37.380> good

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
hands it just doesn't feel quite as good

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.210 
hands it just doesn't feel quite as good
as<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.459> standard<00:03:38.880> z3<00:03:39.680> also<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.829> other<00:03:40.980> main

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
as the standard z3 also the other main

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.099 
as the standard z3 also the other main
difference<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.850> camera<00:03:42.450> because<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
difference is the camera because the

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.199 
difference is the camera because the
20-point<00:03:43.739> second<00:03:44.160> megapixel<00:03:44.670> camera<00:03:45.030> on<00:03:45.060> the

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.559 
aren't quite as high but with that said
I'll<00:04:08.010> have<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.250> test<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.609> out<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.030> next<00:04:09.209> few

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
I'll have to test it out in the next few

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.300 
I'll have to test it out in the next few
days<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.870> really<00:04:10.260> see<00:04:10.500> how<00:04:10.709> much<00:04:10.859> worse<00:04:11.099> it<00:04:11.280> is

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
days to really see how much worse it is

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.390 
days to really see how much worse it is
or<00:04:11.970> if<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.359> is<00:04:12.540> even<00:04:12.900> any<00:04:13.049> worse<00:04:13.319> it<00:04:13.650> does<00:04:14.190> have

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
or if it is even any worse it does have

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.069 
or if it is even any worse it does have
wireless<00:04:14.819> charging<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.389> a<00:04:15.510> larger<00:04:15.870> battery

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
wireless charging and a larger battery

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.839 
wireless charging and a larger battery
though<00:04:16.410> so<00:04:16.739> those<00:04:16.979> are<00:04:17.130> certainly<00:04:17.489> some<00:04:17.820> good

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
though so those are certainly some good

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.979 
though so those are certainly some good
pros<00:04:18.479> but<00:04:19.320> overall<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:20.070> Xperia<00:04:20.640> z3<00:04:20.940> v<00:04:21.630> really

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
pros but overall the Xperia z3 v really

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.360 
pros but overall the Xperia z3 v really
seems<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.320> have<00:04:22.530> potential<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.130> I'm<00:04:23.190> just

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
seems to have potential and I'm just

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.830 
seems to have potential and I'm just
really<00:04:23.550> looking<00:04:23.640> forward<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.150> reviewing<00:04:24.630> it

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840
