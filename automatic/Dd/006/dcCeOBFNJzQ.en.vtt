tweak<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.309> Wi-Fi<00:00:53.989> drivers<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:56.370> getting

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
tweak the Wi-Fi drivers but just getting

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.060 
tweak the Wi-Fi drivers but just getting
a<00:00:57.090> Wi-Fi<00:00:57.420> driver<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:58.020> matched<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.770> Windows

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
a Wi-Fi driver that matched for Windows

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.209 
a Wi-Fi driver that matched for Windows
8<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.609> Wi-Fi<00:01:00.030> card<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.020> system<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.649> that

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
8 the Wi-Fi card in the system and that

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.210 
8 the Wi-Fi card in the system and that
seems<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.820> functioning<00:01:03.420> well<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:05.100> can

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
seems to be functioning well now you can

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.620 
seems to be functioning well now you can
see<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.630> this<00:01:06.630> system<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.670> can

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
see that this system here is the I can

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.230 
see that this system here is the I can
get<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.900> focus<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:12.590> there<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.680> is

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
get it to focus here there it is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.990 
get it to focus here there it is
so<00:01:15.890> it<00:01:16.890> seems<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.310> running<00:01:17.549> fairly

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
so it seems to be running fairly

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.920 
so it seems to be running fairly
smoothly<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:19.170> Windows<00:01:19.590> 8<00:01:20.540> all<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.720> drivers

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
smoothly with Windows 8 all the drivers

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.399 
smoothly with Windows 8 all the drivers
on<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> HP<00:01:22.680> website<00:01:23.689> seem<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.930> function

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
on the HP website seem to function

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.270 
on the HP website seem to function
fairly<00:01:25.830> well<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> lot<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.450> issues<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.710> HP

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
fairly well not a lot of issues and HP

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.510 
fairly well not a lot of issues and HP
is<00:01:29.570> moving<00:01:30.570> up<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:31.140> new<00:01:31.380> drivers<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
is moving up with new drivers for all of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.749 
is moving up with new drivers for all of
its<00:01:32.670> different<00:01:33.829> computers<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.040> are<00:01:35.100> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
its different computers that are you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.030 
its different computers that are you
know<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.150> 1<00:01:36.450> year<00:01:36.659> old<00:01:36.869> category<00:01:37.500> 2<00:01:37.860> so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
know in that 1 year old category 2 so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.710 
know in that 1 year old category 2 so
that<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.369> accessible<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.210> Windows<00:01:39.509> 8

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
that can be accessible to Windows 8

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.780 
that can be accessible to Windows 8
however<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.560> system<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.130> doesn't<00:01:41.460> seem<00:01:41.490> to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
however this system here doesn't seem to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.600 
however this system here doesn't seem to
have<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> lot<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.180> issues<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:43.560> stretching<00:01:44.430> of

have a lot of issues the stretching of

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.359 
have a lot of issues the stretching of
the<00:01:44.970> tiles<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.350> Internet<00:01:46.890> Explorer

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the tiles and of the Internet Explorer

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.490 
the tiles and of the Internet Explorer
or<00:01:47.610> Windows<00:01:47.970> Explorer<00:01:48.390> doesn't<00:01:49.020> seem<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
or Windows Explorer doesn't seem to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.980 
or Windows Explorer doesn't seem to
affect<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.950> too<00:01:50.130> much<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.180> active<00:01:51.630> tiles

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
affect it too much and the active tiles

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.469 
affect it too much and the active tiles
are<00:01:52.290> functional<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.939> know<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.390> get

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
are functional so you know you can get

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.240 
are functional so you know you can get
in<00:01:54.570> here<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.079> do<00:01:55.259> let's<00:01:55.829> check<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
in here and we can do let's check the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.670 
in here and we can do let's check the
the<00:01:57.229> weather<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.899> here's<00:02:00.899> how<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.140> active

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
the weather so here's how the active

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.959 
the weather so here's how the active
tiles<00:02:02.009> work<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:03.630> works<00:02:03.990> smoothly<00:02:04.820> not<00:02:05.820> as

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
tiles work and it works smoothly not as

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.650 
tiles work and it works smoothly not as
fast<00:02:06.329> as<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:07.530> lot<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.160> newer<00:02:08.340> computers<00:02:08.910> but

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
fast as a lot of the newer computers but

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.619 
fast as a lot of the newer computers but
for<00:02:10.170> under<00:02:10.349> 500<00:02:10.770> bucks<00:02:10.950> for<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.310> tablet<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:12.450> is

for under 500 bucks for a tablet that is

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.699 
for under 500 bucks for a tablet that is
full<00:02:12.870> functioning

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709
