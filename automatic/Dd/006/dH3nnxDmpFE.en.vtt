00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 the one plus one was one of the best 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.440
 android smartphones of the past 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.899
 year now there is a new one 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.610
 operating system for oxygen us us 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.389
 Just look at how you feel about it 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.389
 device gets 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.470
 by kerstin some oxygen there as one 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.760
 alternative to the swat dir 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.950
 usually on the one plus one 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.640
 we do the work together 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.400
 to install 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.869
 right away so there are in front of you 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.520
 that just so can flash me you 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.110
 Stop doing a few things before they are 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.050
 very complicated they are not too 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.760
 beginner when to plaster with a 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.230
 The solution is that it is easy 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.790
 they do not have such a big deal 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.820
 said so moment it is for 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.560
 The craftsman and the requirement is that you 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.930
 stop for example the android sdk on 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.520
 your computer on your pc or or 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.520
 macbook or something installed and 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.019
 above this then a recovery module 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.309
 installed that is as I said not 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.960
 Quite simply I can tell you that in the video 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.350
 not everything would explain too far now 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.230
 to lead 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.239
 But we often have articles in which 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.190
 similarly explained for other circumstances 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.809
 So you just have to remember 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.710
 you have to install android sdk her 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.620
 then you have a camera over hdb you 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.660
 install modules and then you can 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.310
 you almost flash that arrow 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.130
 bring device and about the recovery 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.780
 modules on the phone then bottles and 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.799
 to make that last step 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.740
 we together now 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.229
 the first step after you do this 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.259
 team green recovery project installed 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.610
 So have recovery module way to do so 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.479
 a quick note before going to the first 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.710
 step first step is 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.430
 Incidentally, the device was off 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.079
 I already done here 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.310
 important note I am in fact 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.470
 several times during installation 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.570
 desperate the house had found 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.579
 before you get the recovery module 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.140
 you have to install in the developer 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.909
 settings 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.330
 the software version that was there before 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.700
 on it is the point cm recovery 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.080
 protection and withdraw 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.869
 So that's about it otherwise 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.420
 every time you use the recovery module 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.160
 have installed when booting the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.750
 automatically gets for the old despite it 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.190
 does not work with the old one 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.810
 important I write it again one 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.060
 article linked under the video 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.530
 disable this point developers 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.119
 stand up developer else set 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.970
 you have no follower now 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.190
 succeeded so I have tb rp on it and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.010
 to get there 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.989
 I start now recovery module 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.970
 and I think that first the 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.340
 volume down button and then the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.420
 power button pressed and then there is 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.090
 short vibrations I can already 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.340
 let go again and then it drives 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.300
 gets into high recovery mode 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.940
 other preparation that we 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.739
 do what is oxygen, the image file 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.650
 download gives place on the bank 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.050
 page we also link below in 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.130
 article that invites you down if it 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.500
 Do not download directly to your device 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.510
 then on the computer and would have to persist 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.430
 push over and packs that best 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.930
 falls on the deep as possible into a 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.600
 so it's best to go down the list 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.720
 directly in the internal memory 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.519
 Excuse me 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.430
 then you will find it fast 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.880
 First step before you start 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.989
 install is far that's what I said yes 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.730
 Data is lost, that is you 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.690
 stay first that looks so out of her 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.510
 Do not do anything to me here now 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.370
 just so vision then he does that briefly 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.230
 gets gets empty relies on 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.430
 factory setting and that 's it then goes 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:17.480
 her on Beck why now asked me 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.660
 again I'm here again so 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.579
 Well, there I have to go down the road so and so 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.890
 Now it's time to install install 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.360
 is up here we tap it and you 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.100
 You see, I would already be indicated 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.540
 I'll show you this again though 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.730
 the sd card that is the directory 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.480
 so to speak, and here below is the folder 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.840
 touch oxygen os 1.0.0 once and then 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.370
 Here you can choose the file flexibly 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.350
 important the hook you should not 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.900
 set so no cross but empty 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.280
 Otherwise, an error message and out 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.620
 You can ignore that and then 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.060
 just swept to confirm flash or 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.300
 he starts flashing that lasts now 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.300
 in small 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.380
 during the installation process 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.940
 you can take here now for a relatively long time 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.720
 it is to be that emanating display 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.760
 not bad 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.930
 You can just go back over the power 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.470
 Button on make then you would have here 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.820
 attract 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.290
 and then you can keep watching her 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.290
 But you can just go out 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.150
 if the whole thing is done then 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.590
 logs the device anyway as 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.840
 has seen with a small one now 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.750
 vibration and the screen goes on 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.660
 two years lures everything I can 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.880
 now almost the same reboot system 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.200
 give 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.250
 no, yes, well, I could do it now 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.650
 super user in the gate 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.650
 that is there i would have to stop i have good 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.020
 I can access the same take time 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.910
 then we have that and now 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.780
 now the device goes up i hope 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.040
 Now I have the root now 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.530
 access not here somehow my whole 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.270
 installation torpedo no that looks 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.400
 Well, that is the logo of the 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.390
 oxygen it buht logo now he goes up 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.100
 is probably here still the 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.600
 update whole apps that you know 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.340
 yes, always when you have a new company on it 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.680
 did on the device that lasts 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.600
 a little moment like that and if 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.360
 then upgrade thenroid is finished 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.040
 you are almost in the settings menu menu 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.750
 of oxygen is so and so is oxygen it 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.430
 on the euro we were watching us 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.810
 now of course also oxygen os to what 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.430
 bring it what does it look like you are 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.450
 in our channel the video and otherwise 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.740
 See you next time I am 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.890
 all by craft friendly until then 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.890
 bye 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.880
 who before the installation of oxygen us 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.260
 on the band you want to know if 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.820
 the effortless even worth the 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.550
 is looking for a little walk 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.620
 through the new operating system and 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.780
 More information on flashing will come up 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.580
 smartphones would like to see me 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.290
 to like me the factory images of 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.290
 Lollipop often bring the nexus
