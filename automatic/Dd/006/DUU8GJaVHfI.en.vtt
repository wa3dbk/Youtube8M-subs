00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.760 
and speed there and then here you've got
a<00:01:50.429> digital<00:01:50.969> delay<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.569> an<00:01:51.929> analog<00:01:52.200> delay<00:01:52.469> both

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
a digital delay and an analog delay both

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.260 
a digital delay and an analog delay both
of<00:01:52.920> which<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.249> sort<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.819> different<00:01:54.090> type<00:01:54.240> of

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
of which have sort of different type of

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.349 
of which have sort of different type of
zambra<00:01:55.259> delay<00:01:56.009> sounds<00:01:56.429> and<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.240> right

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
zambra delay sounds and on the right

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.209 
zambra delay sounds and on the right
hand<00:01:57.569> side<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:57.990> you've<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.409> got<00:01:58.529> a<00:01:58.560> overall

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
hand side here you've just got a overall

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.159 
hand side here you've just got a overall
master<00:01:59.399> reverb<00:01:59.819> control<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:00.869> all<00:02:00.959> very

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:01.169 
master reverb control so it's all very

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:03.949 
master reverb control so it's all very
very<00:02:01.349> simple<00:02:01.709> and<00:02:01.829> very<00:02:01.889> very<00:02:02.009> hands<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
very simple and very very hands on the

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.019 
very simple and very very hands on the
actual<00:02:04.259> guts<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.829> machine<00:02:04.859> it's<00:02:05.609> based<00:02:05.849> on

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:06.029 
actual guts of the machine it's based on

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:07.999 
actual guts of the machine it's based on

it<00:02:13.019> combines<00:02:13.409> waveforms<00:02:14.099> but<00:02:14.189> it<00:02:14.400> also<00:02:14.519> models

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
it combines waveforms but it also models

it combines waveforms but it also models
things<00:02:15.360> like<00:02:15.540> the

things like the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.839 
things like the

really really really really sort of
spot-on<00:02:19.890> sounds<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.090> also<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.299> 128<00:02:22.019> note

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.009 
spot-on sounds and it's also a 128 note
polyphonic<00:02:23.189> so<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.540> use<00:02:24.659> it<00:02:24.810> as<00:02:24.900> an

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
polyphonic so you can use it as an

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.050 
polyphonic so you can use it as an

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
tone module or in the studio just take

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.099 
tone module or in the studio just take
some<00:02:29.609> of<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.760> processing<00:02:30.659> power<00:02:30.840> away<00:02:31.079> from

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
some of the processing power away from

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.660 
some of the processing power away from
the<00:02:31.290> computer<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.890> stop<00:02:32.069> it<00:02:32.189> all<00:02:32.280> hanging<00:02:32.579> all

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
the computer to stop it all hanging all

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.390 
the computer to stop it all hanging all
the<00:02:32.760> time<00:02:33.470> enough<00:02:34.470> talking<00:02:34.680> I'm<00:02:35.010> gonna<00:02:35.220> run

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
the time enough talking I'm gonna run

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.949 
the time enough talking I'm gonna run
you<00:02:35.430> through<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.730> few<00:02:35.849> of<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.000> sounds<00:02:36.359> and<00:02:36.540> then

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
you through a few of the sounds and then

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.750 
you through a few of the sounds and then
see<00:02:37.290> what<00:02:37.379> you<00:02:37.439> think<00:02:37.620> as<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.400> said<00:02:38.549> this<00:02:38.640> is

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
see what you think as I said this is

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.250 
see what you think as I said this is
very<00:02:38.790> expressive<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:39.689> I'm<00:02:39.780> going<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.989> show<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
very expressive so I'm going to show the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.720 
very expressive so I'm going to show the
different<00:02:40.530> levels<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.069> playing<00:02:41.430> okay<00:02:41.670> so

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
different levels of playing okay so

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:56.800 
different levels of playing okay so
we're<00:02:41.939> going<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.120> kick<00:02:42.269> off<00:02:42.329> with<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.569> roads

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:09.420 

really<00:02:57.810> digging<00:02:58.200> it

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:21.690 

again<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.519> can<00:03:10.640> put<00:03:10.760> some<00:03:10.879> tremolo<00:03:11.239> on<00:03:11.359> that

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:30.850 

it's<00:03:22.700> all<00:03:22.819> very<00:03:22.939> hands<00:03:23.329> on<00:03:23.420> up<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.260> reverb

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:39.429 

down<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.980> reverb<00:03:32.250> put<00:03:32.430> some<00:03:32.549> delay<00:03:32.760> on<00:03:32.879> it

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.439 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:45.640 

just<00:03:40.439> take<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.620> little<00:03:40.769> cool<00:03:41.189> effects<00:03:41.519> as<00:03:41.640> well

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.440 

excellent<00:03:46.650> now<00:03:47.549> gonna<00:03:47.700> roll<00:03:47.909> onto<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.239> roads

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
excellent now gonna roll onto the roads

00:03:48.450 --> 00:04:11.300 
excellent now gonna roll onto the roads
we're<00:03:49.019> gonna<00:03:49.109> drop<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.439> down<00:03:49.530> an<00:03:49.680> octave<00:03:49.769> I<00:04:10.310> can

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
we're gonna drop it down an octave I can

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.379 
we're gonna drop it down an octave I can
show<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.670> expressiveness<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.299> the

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469 
to the toy piano up an octave again and

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:13.659 
to the toy piano up an octave again and
cuz<00:06:12.680> they're<00:06:12.800> modeling<00:06:13.069> again<00:06:13.189> you<00:06:13.370> can<00:06:13.460> even

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
cuz they're modeling again you can even

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:21.689 
cuz they're modeling again you can even
hear<00:06:13.819> whether<00:06:14.000> it's<00:06:14.180> got<00:06:14.300> a<00:06:14.330> a<00:06:14.719> key<00:06:15.020> off<00:06:15.169> sample
