being a low-fat raw vegan and this is
one<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.100> my<00:01:29.340> favorites<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.780> you're<00:01:30.960> no

longer<00:01:31.409> killing<00:01:32.040> innocent<00:01:32.549> animals<00:01:32.700> for<00:01:33.360> food

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
longer killing innocent animals for food

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.760 
longer killing innocent animals for food
and<00:01:35.390> you're<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.570> having<00:01:36.810> other<00:01:37.170> people<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.740> it

for you and that's a really big deal

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.090

because<00:01:41.329> we<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.570> need<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.049> eat<00:01:43.229> animals<00:01:43.829> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
because we don't need to eat animals to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.520 
because we don't need to eat animals to
survive<00:01:44.479> we've<00:01:45.479> been<00:01:45.630> told<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> whole

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.679 
survive we've been told that a whole
life<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> reality<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.390> we

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
life but the reality of it is that we

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.800

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
can survive on fruits and vegetables and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.460 
can survive on fruits and vegetables and
live<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.829> much<00:01:53.369> healthier<00:01:53.820> more<00:01:54.750> abundant<00:01:55.380> life

live a much healthier more abundant life

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.920 
live a much healthier more abundant life
than<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.130> ever<00:01:56.280> could<00:01:56.750> consuming<00:01:57.750> animal

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
than we ever could consuming animal

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.440 
than we ever could consuming animal
products<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.250> said<00:01:59.310> before<00:01:59.520> you'll<00:02:00.210> be

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
products and as I said before you'll be

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.380 
products and as I said before you'll be
so<00:02:00.780> much<00:02:01.049> healthier<00:02:01.490> you'll<00:02:02.490> rarely<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:03.360> sick

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
so much healthier you'll rarely get sick

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.100 
so much healthier you'll rarely get sick
if<00:02:04.020> ever<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.060> you'll<00:02:06.060> most<00:02:06.390> likely<00:02:06.509> live

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
if ever and you'll most likely live

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.430 
if ever and you'll most likely live
longer<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:08.280> environmental

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440

pact<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:09.920> eating<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:10.970> low-fat<00:02:11.180> raw<00:02:11.750> vegan<00:02:12.170> diet

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
pact of eating a low-fat raw vegan diet

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.590 
pact of eating a low-fat raw vegan diet
is<00:02:13.070> so<00:02:13.730> big<00:02:14.180> because<00:02:15.820> raising<00:02:16.820> cattle<00:02:17.120> for

is so big because raising cattle for

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.840 
is so big because raising cattle for
food<00:02:18.520> uses<00:02:19.520> an<00:02:19.730> enormous<00:02:20.360> amount<00:02:20.750> of<00:02:20.960> land

here's a statistic for you this one
sounds<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:00.560> crazy<00:03:00.920> but<00:03:01.700> it's<00:03:01.910> true<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:04.700> waste

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
sounds so crazy but it's true the waste

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.640 
sounds so crazy but it's true the waste
that<00:03:05.570> livestock<00:03:06.550> produces<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:08.320> let<00:03:09.320> me<00:03:09.440> put

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
are contributing to global warming it's

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.350 
are contributing to global warming it's
causing<00:03:39.500> air<00:03:39.709> pollution<00:03:40.430> it's<00:03:41.150> also

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
causing air pollution it's also

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.680 
causing air pollution it's also
polluting<00:03:42.320> our<00:03:42.470> soil<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:44.680> when<00:03:45.680> it<00:03:46.190> rains<00:03:46.730> the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
polluting our soil and when it rains the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.280 
polluting our soil and when it rains the
runoff<00:03:48.310> then<00:03:49.310> pushes<00:03:50.239> all<00:03:50.390> that<00:03:50.600> stuff<00:03:50.930> into

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
runoff then pushes all that stuff into

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.290 
runoff then pushes all that stuff into
the<00:03:51.440> lakes<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:52.100> streams<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.760> into<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.150> ocean

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.880 
the lakes and streams and into the ocean
and<00:03:53.750> it's<00:03:53.900> causing<00:03:54.380> water<00:03:54.560> pollution<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:57.140> you

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
and it's causing water pollution so you

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.620 
and it's causing water pollution so you
can<00:03:58.100> see<00:03:58.430> how<00:03:59.290> being<00:04:00.290> vegan<00:04:00.620> is<00:04:01.070> making<00:04:01.760> a<00:04:02.000> big

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
can see how being vegan is making a big

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.320 
can see how being vegan is making a big
difference<00:04:03.100> here's<00:04:04.100> another<00:04:04.400> statistic<00:04:04.730> for

that<00:05:01.080> is<00:05:03.050> too<00:05:04.050> much<00:05:04.080> water<00:05:04.590> that's<00:05:05.340> just<00:05:05.670> so

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
that is too much water that's just so

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.390 
that is too much water that's just so
much<00:05:06.630> so<00:05:07.470> by<00:05:07.710> being<00:05:07.980> vegan<00:05:08.570> we're<00:05:09.570> saving<00:05:10.400> 1.3

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
much so by being vegan we're saving 1.3
