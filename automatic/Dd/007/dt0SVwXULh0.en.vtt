00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
him back on the field a little bit

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.580 
him back on the field a little bit
faster

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590

because<00:02:16.540> if<00:02:16.629> you<00:02:16.720> do<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.200> he<00:02:17.260> gets<00:02:17.410> hit

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
because if you do that and he gets hit

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.449 
because if you do that and he gets hit
again<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.819> might<00:02:19.000> not<00:02:19.150> ever<00:02:19.360> get<00:02:19.599> him<00:02:19.750> back<00:02:19.900> on

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
again you might not ever get him back on

again you might not ever get him back on

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
that are just a little too effective

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.650 
that are just a little too effective
like<00:02:58.750> all<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.230> time<00:02:59.640> but<00:03:00.640> then<00:03:00.879> again<00:03:00.970> this<00:03:01.480> is

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
like all the time but then again this is

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.869 
like all the time but then again this is
kind<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.170> arcade<00:03:02.470> football<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.459> kind<00:03:03.790> of

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
kind of arcade football and you kind of

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.990 
kind of arcade football and you kind of
don't<00:03:04.030> really<00:03:04.480> care<00:03:05.190> necessarily<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.430> it's

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
don't really care necessarily and it's

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.150 
don't really care necessarily and it's
really<00:03:07.299> fun<00:03:07.599> regardless<00:03:08.200> there's<00:03:09.069> no

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
really fun regardless there's no

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.119 
really fun regardless there's no
franchise<00:03:09.640> mode<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.150> blitz<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.480> league<00:03:10.660> but

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
franchise mode and blitz the league but

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.530 
franchise mode and blitz the league but
would<00:03:12.129> you<00:03:12.220> really<00:03:12.370> expect<00:03:12.849> there<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.030> be<00:03:13.180> one

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
would you really expect there to be one

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.839 
would you really expect there to be one
necessarily<00:03:14.349> what<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.250> do<00:03:15.400> get<00:03:15.549> is<00:03:15.610> this

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
necessarily what you do get is this

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.059 
necessarily what you do get is this
campaign<00:03:16.420> mode<00:03:16.690> where<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.440> sort<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.680> take<00:03:17.860> on

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
campaign mode where you sort of take on

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.210 
campaign mode where you sort of take on
this<00:03:18.310> like<00:03:18.549> really<00:03:19.170> overly<00:03:20.170> dramatic<00:03:20.410> crazy

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
this like really overly dramatic crazy

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.640 
this like really overly dramatic crazy
football<00:03:21.790> storyline<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:23.139> the<00:03:23.260> owner<00:03:23.380> clears

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.970 
you even get to select like your rookie
and<00:03:27.489> your<00:03:27.670> veteran<00:03:28.000> players<00:03:28.269> it's<00:03:29.049> not<00:03:29.680> a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
and your veteran players it's not a

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.220 
and your veteran players it's not a
particularly<00:03:30.489> good<00:03:31.329> storyline

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
particularly good storyline

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.009 
particularly good storyline
exactly<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:33.310> just<00:03:33.609> kind<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.120> crazy<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.900> just

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
exactly it's just kind of crazy and just

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.199 
exactly it's just kind of crazy and just
an<00:03:35.139> excuse<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.500> be<00:03:35.709> real<00:03:36.010> foul<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.790> swear<00:03:37.180> a

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
lot and make all these weird indie

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.580 
lot and make all these weird indie
windows<00:03:39.250> during<00:03:39.579> a<00:03:39.790> football<00:03:40.150> game<00:03:40.349> but<00:03:41.349> again

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
somehow it all works it all kind of ties

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.089 
somehow it all works it all kind of ties
together<00:03:43.329> into<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.049> theme<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.470> game<00:03:44.500> you
