your neck I use the Q minor on my neck
so<00:04:00.420> that<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.600> have<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.930> readily<00:04:01.590> available<00:04:01.740> for

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
so that I have it readily available for

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.850 
so that I have it readily available for
me<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.780> can<00:04:03.930> see<00:04:03.960> here<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.350> adjustment

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
me and you can see here the adjustment

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.130 
me and you can see here the adjustment
way<00:04:05.550> that<00:04:05.790> it's<00:04:05.910> set<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.510> everything<00:04:06.900> else

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
way that it's set up and everything else

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.530 
way that it's set up and everything else
and<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.500> course<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.890> tends<00:04:08.520> to<00:04:08.700> move<00:04:08.940> I'm<00:04:09.270> an<00:04:09.390> X

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
and of course it tends to move I'm an X

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.830 
and of course it tends to move I'm an X
Y<00:04:09.690> Z<00:04:09.990> or<00:04:10.230> an<00:04:10.650> extra<00:04:10.950> sort<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:11.940> X<00:04:12.150> Y<00:04:12.390> let's<00:04:12.660> call

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
Y Z or an extra sort of X Y let's call

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.060 
Y Z or an extra sort of X Y let's call
it<00:04:12.960> I<00:04:13.050> guess

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
it I guess

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.430 
it I guess
up<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.550> down<00:04:14.730> where<00:04:15.360> you<00:04:15.600> can<00:04:15.810> adjust<00:04:16.080> it<00:04:16.230> in

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
up and down where you can adjust it in

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.200 
up and down where you can adjust it in
my<00:04:16.620> case<00:04:16.859> you'll<00:04:17.130> see<00:04:17.310> how<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.609> works<00:04:17.670> once<00:04:18.060> we

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.210 
my case you'll see how it works once we

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.320 
my case you'll see how it works once we
attach<00:04:18.480> it<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.020> camera<00:04:19.790> okay<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:21.000> here<00:04:21.299> you

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
attach it to a camera okay so here you

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.570 
attach it to a camera okay so here you
can<00:04:21.480> see<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:21.810> set<00:04:21.989> up<00:04:22.080> on<00:04:22.200> my<00:04:22.260> canon<00:04:22.800> d<00:04:22.950> 70<00:04:23.430> it

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
can see it set up on my canon d 70 it

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.000 
can see it set up on my canon d 70 it
even<00:04:23.790> comes<00:04:23.970> with<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> built<00:04:24.570> in<00:04:24.750> hex<00:04:25.590> where<00:04:25.919> you

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
even comes with a built in hex where you

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.170 
even comes with a built in hex where you
can<00:04:26.160> take<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.580> adjust

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
can take and adjust

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.730 
can take and adjust
up<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.570> down<00:04:27.690> now<00:04:27.900> since<00:04:28.169> I<00:04:28.259> have<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:28.440> battery

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
up and down now since I have a battery

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.310 
up and down now since I have a battery
expansionpak<00:04:29.460> this<00:04:30.210> will<00:04:30.479> slide<00:04:30.720> up<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.139> down

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
expansionpak this will slide up and down

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.159 
expansionpak this will slide up and down
to<00:04:31.860> fit<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.250> battery<00:04:32.580> expansion<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.539> be<00:04:34.050> able

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
to fit the battery expansion and be able

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.980 
to fit the battery expansion and be able
to<00:04:34.350> close<00:04:34.740> over<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.130> back<00:04:35.460> area<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.419> my<00:04:36.630> screen

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
to close over the back area of my screen

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.070 
to close over the back area of my screen
so<00:04:37.620> this<00:04:38.400> actually<00:04:38.820> goes<00:04:39.030> up<00:04:39.300> inside<00:04:39.750> this

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
so this actually goes up inside this

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.230 
so this actually goes up inside this
slider<00:04:40.380> thing<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:41.190> hex<00:04:41.520> nut<00:04:41.759> so<00:04:42.000> you<00:04:42.090> can

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
slider thing the hex nut so you can

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.999 
slider thing the hex nut so you can
always<00:04:42.570> travel<00:04:42.870> with<00:04:43.050> you<00:04:43.320> keep<00:04:43.590> it<00:04:43.740> with<00:04:43.860> you

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
always travel with you keep it with you

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.159 
always travel with you keep it with you
and<00:04:44.160> have<00:04:44.880> with<00:04:45.120> you<00:04:45.240> at<00:04:45.360> all<00:04:45.479> times<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:46.080> you

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
and have with you at all times so you

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.290 
and have with you at all times so you
can<00:04:46.289> adjust<00:04:46.590> all<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.190> different<00:04:47.520> aspects<00:04:48.150> of

can adjust all the different aspects of

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.820 
can adjust all the different aspects of
the<00:04:48.570> bottom<00:04:48.960> if<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.139> look<00:04:49.320> at<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.500> bottom

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
the bottom if you look at the bottom
