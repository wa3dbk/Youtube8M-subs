sure<00:02:19.220> she<00:02:19.370> gets<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.580> rematch<00:02:19.880> clause<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.330> she

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
sure she gets a rematch clause and she

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.690 
sure she gets a rematch clause and she
could<00:02:20.600> just<00:02:20.750> recap<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.770> her<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.100> never

could just recap it in on her I never

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.510 
could just recap it in on her I never
understood<00:02:23.210> rematch<00:02:23.600> clauses<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.280> full

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
understood rematch clauses to the full

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.910 
understood rematch clauses to the full
extent<00:02:26.290> but<00:02:27.290> Kelly<00:02:27.500> Kelly<00:02:27.740> is<00:02:27.830> definitely

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
extent but Kelly Kelly is definitely

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.770
