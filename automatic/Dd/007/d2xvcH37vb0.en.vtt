00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
it's just been so dry for so long it's

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.469 
it's just been so dry for so long it's
actually<00:04:24.490> just<00:04:24.639> pull<00:04:24.820> apart<00:04:25.120> of<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.240> crack

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
actually just pull apart of the crack

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.659 
actually just pull apart of the crack
that's<00:04:26.050> how<00:04:26.229> my<00:04:26.320> burger<00:04:26.680> was<00:04:26.830> doing<00:04:27.130> not

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
that's how my burger was doing not

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.129 
that's how my burger was doing not
literally<00:04:28.060> but<00:04:28.300> it<00:04:28.419> did<00:04:28.540> have<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:28.720> crack<00:04:28.930> in<00:04:28.960> it

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
literally but it did have a crack in it

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.810 
literally but it did have a crack in it
and<00:04:29.290> it<00:04:29.350> was<00:04:29.470> really<00:04:29.650> dry<00:04:29.889> so<00:04:30.160> maybe<00:04:30.520> that<00:04:30.700> was

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
and it was really dry so maybe that was

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.800 
and it was really dry so maybe that was
an<00:04:30.940> option<00:04:31.090> actually<00:04:33.360> I'm<00:04:34.360> sure<00:04:34.510> if<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.660> got<00:04:34.780> a

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
an option actually I'm sure if I got a

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.110 
an option actually I'm sure if I got a
fresh<00:04:35.020> one<00:04:35.139> it<00:04:35.229> would<00:04:35.350> be<00:04:35.380> much<00:04:35.590> better<00:04:35.800> but

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
fresh one it would be much better but

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.010 
fresh one it would be much better but
honestly<00:04:37.770> angus<00:04:38.770> is<00:04:39.010> a<00:04:39.520> type<00:04:39.850> of<00:04:40.000> cow<00:04:40.210> which<00:04:40.870> is

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
honestly angus is a type of cow which is

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.930 
honestly angus is a type of cow which is
the<00:04:41.110> type<00:04:41.290> of<00:04:41.320> beef<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.889> sirloin<00:04:42.310> is<00:04:42.550> a<00:04:42.580> cut<00:04:42.820> of

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
the type of beef and sirloin is a cut of

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.170 
the type of beef and sirloin is a cut of
beef<00:04:43.090> so<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:44.169> really<00:04:44.560> is<00:04:44.800> just<00:04:44.830> like<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.790> exact

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
beef so it really is just like the exact

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.350 
beef so it really is just like the exact
same<00:04:46.419> thing<00:04:46.720> as<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.820> angus<00:04:48.820> third<00:04:48.970> pounders
