in<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.410> tutorial<00:00:01.650> you<00:00:02.190> are<00:00:02.490> going<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.970> model

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
in this tutorial you are going to model

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.170 
in this tutorial you are going to model
this<00:00:03.419> fish<00:00:03.720> shown<00:00:04.049> in<00:00:04.290> front<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.650> you<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:05.180> we

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
this fish shown in front of you and we

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.299 
this fish shown in front of you and we
are<00:00:06.210> going<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.629> start<00:00:06.810> modeling<00:00:07.319> by<00:00:07.710> creating

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
are going to start modeling by creating

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.490 
are going to start modeling by creating
a<00:00:08.429> cylinder<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.030> then<00:00:09.870> we<00:00:10.019> are<00:00:10.110> going<00:00:10.170> to

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
a cylinder and then we are going to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.129 
a cylinder and then we are going to
continue<00:00:10.710> modifying<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.670> cylinder<00:00:12.179> until

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
continue modifying this cylinder until

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.240 
continue modifying this cylinder until
we<00:00:13.259> reach<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.830> figure<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.400> fish<00:00:16.100> this<00:00:17.100> is

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
we reach the figure of the fish this is

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.550 
we reach the figure of the fish this is
the<00:00:17.430> basic<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.910> box<00:00:18.119> modeling<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.810> it's

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the basic of box modeling and it's

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.070 
the basic of box modeling and it's
considered<00:00:20.160> as<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> great<00:00:20.730> tool<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.300> creating
