welcome<00:00:11.440> to<00:00:11.590> part<00:00:11.770> two<00:00:12.010> in<00:00:12.700> the<00:00:12.820> previous

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
welcome to part two in the previous

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.430 
welcome to part two in the previous
video<00:00:13.390> we<00:00:13.420> showed<00:00:13.750> you<00:00:13.870> how<00:00:13.900> to<00:00:14.050> change<00:00:14.230> the

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
video we showed you how to change the

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.230 
video we showed you how to change the
primary<00:00:14.950> and<00:00:15.510> the<00:00:16.510> secondary<00:00:16.740> fuel<00:00:17.740> filters

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
primary and the secondary fuel filters

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.130 
primary and the secondary fuel filters
in<00:00:19.240> this<00:00:19.390> video<00:00:19.630> we're<00:00:19.810> going<00:00:19.900> to<00:00:19.960> show<00:00:20.020> you

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
in this video we're going to show you

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.730 
in this video we're going to show you
how<00:00:20.410> to<00:00:20.470> bleed<00:00:20.800> the<00:00:20.980> fuel<00:00:21.190> system<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.500> we<00:00:23.619> need

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
how to bleed the fuel system so we need

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.410 
how to bleed the fuel system so we need
to<00:00:23.890> start<00:00:24.100> by<00:00:24.279> turning<00:00:24.670> the<00:00:24.760> fuel<00:00:25.000> back<00:00:25.210> on

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
to start by turning the fuel back on

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.999 
to start by turning the fuel back on
after<00:00:25.750> turning<00:00:26.260> it<00:00:26.380> off<00:00:26.500> to<00:00:26.680> change<00:00:26.890> filters

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
after turning it off to change filters

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.890 
after turning it off to change filters
first<00:00:30.009> stage<00:00:30.250> is<00:00:30.490> to<00:00:30.520> fill<00:00:31.029> the<00:00:31.060> primary<00:00:31.660> fuel

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
first stage is to fill the primary fuel

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.260 
first stage is to fill the primary fuel
filters<00:00:32.259> with<00:00:32.560> fuel<00:00:32.860> now<00:00:33.400> we<00:00:33.460> did<00:00:33.820> that<00:00:33.850> on

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
filters with fuel now we did that on

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.850 
filters with fuel now we did that on
these<00:00:34.540> fuel<00:00:34.780> filters<00:00:35.079> before<00:00:35.350> we<00:00:35.440> fitted<00:00:35.710> them

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
these fuel filters before we fitted them

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.350 
these fuel filters before we fitted them
simply<00:00:36.130> because<00:00:36.370> they<00:00:36.520> are<00:00:36.550> higher<00:00:36.970> than<00:00:37.210> the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
simply because they are higher than the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.100 
simply because they are higher than the
fuel<00:00:37.780> tank<00:00:38.050> so<00:00:38.140> we<00:00:38.350> can't<00:00:38.530> use<00:00:38.710> gravity<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:40.600> you

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
fuel tank so we can't use gravity if you

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.689 
fuel tank so we can't use gravity if you
can<00:00:41.320> use<00:00:41.470> gravity<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:41.980> way<00:00:42.070> to<00:00:42.130> do<00:00:42.370> it<00:00:42.460> is<00:00:42.550> to

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
can use gravity the way to do it is to

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.729 
can use gravity the way to do it is to
loosen<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.300> bleed<00:00:43.870> valve<00:00:44.170> which<00:00:44.350> we<00:00:44.440> on<00:00:44.559> top

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
loosen the bleed valve which we on top

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.459 
loosen the bleed valve which we on top
of<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.010> fuel<00:00:45.370> filter<00:00:45.960> with<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.050> fuel<00:00:47.260> turned

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
of the fuel filter with the fuel turned

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.020 
of the fuel filter with the fuel turned
on<00:00:47.710> as<00:00:47.980> soon<00:00:48.160> as<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.340> open<00:00:48.430> that<00:00:48.760> they're

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
on as soon as you open that they're

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.610 
on as soon as you open that they're
going<00:00:49.149> to<00:00:49.239> start<00:00:49.420> filling<00:00:49.629> and<00:00:49.899> as<00:00:50.320> soon<00:00:50.469> as<00:00:50.500> it

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
going to start filling and as soon as it

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.840 
going to start filling and as soon as it
starts<00:00:50.829> bubbling<00:00:50.980> at<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.280> top<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:51.579> can<00:00:51.699> just

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
starts bubbling at the top you can just

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.939 
starts bubbling at the top you can just
close<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.480> bleed<00:00:52.660> valve<00:00:52.899> that<00:00:53.500> fills<00:00:53.769> them

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
close the bleed valve that fills them

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.860 
close the bleed valve that fills them
for<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.250> on<00:00:54.399> these<00:00:55.300> ones<00:00:55.539> you<00:00:55.629> don't<00:00:55.719> actually

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
for you on these ones you don't actually

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.900 
for you on these ones you don't actually
have<00:00:56.019> a<00:00:56.140> fuel<00:00:56.440> bleed<00:00:57.010> valve<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:57.609> what<00:00:57.789> we

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
have a fuel bleed valve so what we

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.220 
have a fuel bleed valve so what we
probably<00:00:58.120> have<00:00:58.300> to<00:00:58.390> do<00:00:58.539> is<00:00:58.660> just<00:00:58.840> if<00:00:59.050> they<00:00:59.170> were

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
probably have to do is just if they were

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.810 
probably have to do is just if they were
blow<00:00:59.469> the<00:00:59.590> fuel<00:00:59.800> filter<00:01:00.129> we<00:01:00.219> could<00:01:00.340> just<00:01:00.489> crack

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
blow the fuel filter we could just crack

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.450 
blow the fuel filter we could just crack
them<00:01:00.940> open<00:01:01.059> slightly<00:01:01.660> let<00:01:01.839> a<00:01:01.870> bit<00:01:01.989> of<00:01:02.079> air<00:01:02.260> in

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
them open slightly let a bit of air in

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.680 
them open slightly let a bit of air in
they<00:01:03.460> will<00:01:03.640> feel<00:01:03.850> and<00:01:04.120> as<00:01:04.180> soon<00:01:04.330> as<00:01:04.360> you<00:01:04.449> start

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
they will feel and as soon as you start

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.030 
they will feel and as soon as you start
seeing<00:01:04.720> fuel<00:01:05.140> come<00:01:05.260> out<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.500> top<00:01:05.680> we<00:01:05.830> just

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
seeing fuel come out the top we just

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.590 
seeing fuel come out the top we just
type<00:01:06.640> them<00:01:06.760> up<00:01:06.790> again<00:01:07.030> that's<00:01:07.150> another<00:01:07.330> way<00:01:07.570> of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
type them up again that's another way of

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.690 
type them up again that's another way of
doing<00:01:07.690> it<00:01:07.930> what<00:01:08.680> we<00:01:08.770> need<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:08.980> do<00:01:09.070> now<00:01:09.250> is<00:01:09.460> to

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
doing it what we need to do now is to

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.930 
doing it what we need to do now is to
bleed<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.120> secondary<00:01:10.510> filter<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:12.400> do<00:01:12.550> that<00:01:12.730> by

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
bleed the secondary filter we do that by

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.880 
bleed the secondary filter we do that by
loosening<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.690> bleed<00:01:14.050> valve<00:01:14.320> on<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.740> top

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
loosening the bleed valve on the top

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.080 
loosening the bleed valve on the top
just<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.340> couple<00:01:15.610> of<00:01:15.700> turns<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.700> it's<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:18.909> loose

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
just a couple of turns so it's a loose

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.660 
just a couple of turns so it's a loose
and<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:20.380> activate<00:01:20.740> an<00:01:20.979> elite<00:01:21.220> pump<00:01:21.400> which<00:01:21.549> is

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
and then activate an elite pump which is

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.819 
and then activate an elite pump which is
usually<00:01:21.939> alongside<00:01:22.180> it<00:01:22.540> now<00:01:23.049> if<00:01:23.259> you<00:01:23.560> can't

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
usually alongside it now if you can't

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.460 
usually alongside it now if you can't
get<00:01:24.009> full<00:01:24.220> trouble<00:01:24.610> on<00:01:24.729> this<00:01:24.970> pump<00:01:25.570> handle<00:01:26.049> it

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
get full trouble on this pump handle it

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.399 
get full trouble on this pump handle it
might<00:01:26.649> be<00:01:26.799> because<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.100> can<00:01:27.280> behind<00:01:27.610> it<00:01:27.850> is

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
might be because the can behind it is

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.569 
might be because the can behind it is
stopping<00:01:29.409> it<00:01:29.619> and<00:01:29.950> what<00:01:30.100> you<00:01:30.189> might<00:01:30.340> need<00:01:30.460> to

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
stopping it and what you might need to

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.969 
stopping it and what you might need to
do<00:01:30.700> then<00:01:30.909> is<00:01:31.119> take<00:01:31.540> a<00:01:31.600> big<00:01:31.840> socket<00:01:32.470> of<00:01:32.860> the

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
do then is take a big socket of the

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.310 
do then is take a big socket of the
right<00:01:33.100> size<00:01:33.310> or<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.640> spanner<00:01:34.390> you<00:01:34.930> put<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.200> on

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
right size or a spanner you put it on

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.380 
right size or a spanner you put it on
the<00:01:35.640> nut<00:01:36.640> on<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:36.880> end<00:01:36.909> of<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.119> crankshaft

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
the nut on the end of the crankshaft

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.870 
the nut on the end of the crankshaft
just<00:01:38.170> give<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:38.409> a<00:01:38.500> quarter<00:01:38.799> of<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.070> turn<00:01:39.310> like

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
just give it a quarter of a turn like

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.350 
just give it a quarter of a turn like
that<00:01:40.469> an<00:01:41.469> actual<00:01:41.680> reposition<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.430> can<00:01:42.610> and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
that an actual reposition the can and

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.870 
that an actual reposition the can and
allow<00:01:43.570> full<00:01:43.810> travel<00:01:44.049> on<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.530> pump<00:01:44.890> we<00:01:45.640> keep

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
allow full travel on the pump we keep

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.469 
allow full travel on the pump we keep
pumping<00:01:46.329> until<00:01:46.509> we<00:01:46.780> see<00:01:47.020> some<00:01:48.009> diesel<00:01:48.479> clear

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.090 
pumping until we see some diesel clear
diesel<00:01:49.719> without<00:01:50.110> any<00:01:50.290> air<00:01:50.409> bubbles<00:01:50.710> in<00:01:50.829> coming

out<00:01:51.219> of<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.430> blue<00:01:51.579> valve<00:01:51.850> at<00:01:51.969> the<00:01:52.000> top<00:01:52.090> it

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
out of the blue valve at the top it

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.109 
out of the blue valve at the top it
might<00:01:52.780> take<00:01:52.990> some<00:01:53.200> time<00:01:53.640> make<00:01:54.640> sure<00:01:54.789> we<00:01:54.880> stop

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
might take some time make sure we stop

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.870 
might take some time make sure we stop
getting<00:01:56.009> air<00:01:57.009> bubbles<00:01:57.399> out<00:01:57.490> of<00:01:57.549> there<00:01:57.759> which

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
getting air bubbles out of there which

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.080 
getting air bubbles out of there which
we<00:01:58.000> have<00:01:58.149> now<00:01:59.100> we<00:02:00.100> can<00:02:00.130> just<00:02:00.460> nip<00:02:00.759> that<00:02:00.909> up

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
we have now we can just nip that up

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.600 
we have now we can just nip that up
tight

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.970 

and<00:02:04.610> that's<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.940> secondary<00:02:05.330> filter<00:02:05.480> blade

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
and that's the secondary filter blade

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.140 
and that's the secondary filter blade
that's<00:02:06.980> usually<00:02:07.340> enough<00:02:07.430> now<00:02:07.730> to<00:02:07.790> get<00:02:08.030> the

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.150 
that's usually enough now to get the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.770 
that's usually enough now to get the
engine<00:02:08.390> running

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
engine running

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.969 
engine running
but<00:02:08.900> if<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:09.140> find<00:02:09.320> you<00:02:09.440> are<00:02:09.560> still<00:02:09.770> having

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
but if you find you are still having

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.170 
but if you find you are still having
trouble<00:02:10.310> there<00:02:10.490> are<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.640> few<00:02:10.820> more<00:02:10.940> things<00:02:11.150> that

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
trouble there are a few more things that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.600 
trouble there are a few more things that
you<00:02:11.270> can<00:02:11.360> try<00:02:11.680> firstly<00:02:12.680> some<00:02:13.070> engines<00:02:13.430> will

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
you can try firstly some engines will

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.760 
you can try firstly some engines will
have<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:14.030> bleed<00:02:14.330> valve<00:02:14.600> or<00:02:14.840> maybe<00:02:15.050> even<00:02:15.140> two<00:02:15.500> on

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
have a bleed valve or maybe even two on

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.680 
have a bleed valve or maybe even two on
the<00:02:16.010> injector<00:02:16.340> pump<00:02:16.490> itself<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.360> need<00:02:17.600> to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
the injector pump itself so you need to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.470 
the injector pump itself so you need to
find<00:02:17.900> those<00:02:18.080> slacken<00:02:18.770> them<00:02:18.890> off<00:02:19.330> activate<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
find those slacken them off activate the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.450 
find those slacken them off activate the
lift<00:02:20.600> pump<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:21.020> few<00:02:21.170> more<00:02:21.320> times<00:02:21.620> until<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.310> get

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
lift pump a few more times until you get

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.850 
lift pump a few more times until you get
clean<00:02:22.670> fuel<00:02:22.910> coming<00:02:23.120> out<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.650> tie<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.710> up

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
clean fuel coming out and tie it up

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.580 
clean fuel coming out and tie it up
again<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.420> that's<00:02:26.420> drop<00:02:26.630> dump<00:02:26.870> if<00:02:27.080> you're

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
again and that's drop dump if you're

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.110 
again and that's drop dump if you're
still<00:02:27.740> having<00:02:27.830> problems<00:02:27.980> getting<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:28.910> engine

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
still having problems getting the engine

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.570 
still having problems getting the engine

pump<00:02:31.790> you're<00:02:32.450> going<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.630> need<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.840> look<00:02:32.930> up

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
pump you're going to need to look up

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.270 
pump you're going to need to look up
doing<00:02:33.350> some<00:02:33.500> work<00:02:33.620> on<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.860> high<00:02:34.010> pressure

doing some work on the high pressure
side<00:02:34.520> now<00:02:35.390> many<00:02:35.660> modern<00:02:36.140> engines<00:02:36.500> are<00:02:36.740> self

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
the high pressure side it will just be a

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.260 
the high pressure side it will just be a
case<00:02:39.770> of<00:02:39.830> cranking<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.400> engine<00:02:40.490> over<00:02:40.970> until

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
the engine fires but if you do need to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.500 
the engine fires but if you do need to
do<00:02:43.460> some<00:02:43.640> work<00:02:43.820> on<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.090> what<00:02:44.240> you're<00:02:44.330> going<00:02:44.450> to

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
do some work on it what you're going to

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.240 
do some work on it what you're going to
be<00:02:44.570> looking<00:02:44.840> at<00:02:44.990> is<00:02:45.140> slackening<00:02:45.740> off<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.040> nuts

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
be looking at is slackening off the nuts

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.400 
be looking at is slackening off the nuts
on<00:02:46.460> the<00:02:46.610> injectors<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.660> with<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.870> suitable<00:02:48.230> size

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
on the injectors so with a suitable size

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.530 
on the injectors so with a suitable size
spanner<00:02:48.710> you<00:02:49.070> need<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.550> just<00:02:49.820> slacking<00:02:50.420> off

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
spanner you need to just slacking off

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.310 
spanner you need to just slacking off
the<00:02:50.690> injector<00:02:51.200> nut<00:02:51.470> just<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.610> turn<00:02:53.360> or<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:53.810> so

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
the injector nut just a turn or so so

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.140 
the injector nut just a turn or so so
it's<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.500> bit<00:02:54.620> loose<00:02:54.790> then<00:02:55.790> you're<00:02:55.910> gonna<00:02:56.000> have

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
it's a bit loose then you're gonna have

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150 
it's a bit loose then you're gonna have
to<00:02:56.180> get<00:02:56.330> somebody<00:02:56.510> else<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.960> be<00:02:57.620> ready<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:57.980> the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
to get somebody else to be ready on the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.380 
to get somebody else to be ready on the
ignition<00:02:58.460> key<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.850> they<00:02:58.940> will<00:02:59.030> just<00:02:59.210> start

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
ignition key and they will just start

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.180 
ignition key and they will just start
turning<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.810> engine<00:03:00.020> over<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.620> let<00:03:00.770> your<00:03:00.920> get

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
turning the engine over and let your get

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.920 
turning the engine over and let your get
is<00:03:01.430> you'll<00:03:01.670> get<00:03:01.820> some<00:03:02.000> air<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.480> some<00:03:02.660> fuel

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
is you'll get some air and some fuel

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.260 
is you'll get some air and some fuel
coming<00:03:03.140> out<00:03:03.320> here<00:03:03.640> that's<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.790> bubble<00:03:05.090> stop

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
coming out here that's the bubble stop

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.300 
coming out here that's the bubble stop
and<00:03:05.420> you<00:03:05.510> get<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.660> nice<00:03:05.870> flow<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.620> fuel<00:03:06.980> without

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
and you get a nice flow of fuel without

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.220 
and you get a nice flow of fuel without
a<00:03:07.370> nearing<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:08.360> just<00:03:08.600> nip<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.900> back<00:03:09.050> down

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
a nearing you just nip it back down

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.199 
a nearing you just nip it back down
again

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
again

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.360 
again
before<00:03:11.690> moving<00:03:11.810> on<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.230> next<00:03:12.410> one<00:03:12.590> and

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
before moving on to the next one and

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.250 
before moving on to the next one and
what<00:03:13.790> will<00:03:13.880> happen<00:03:14.180> is<00:03:14.330> probably<00:03:14.720> before<00:03:15.020> you

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
what will happen is probably before you

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.449 
what will happen is probably before you
get<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.590> last<00:03:15.709> one<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.100> engine<00:03:16.370> will

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
get to the last one the engine will

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.490 
get to the last one the engine will
actually<00:03:16.489> fire<00:03:16.940> itself<00:03:17.360> but<00:03:17.570> mainly<00:03:18.140> its<00:03:18.320> door

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
actually fire itself but mainly its door
