00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.750
 and yes that gets really hot under 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.969
 And that's why it's so clear 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.739
 ladder and if you are him now it is 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:03.739

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.930
 Project starts on the first of January 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.990
