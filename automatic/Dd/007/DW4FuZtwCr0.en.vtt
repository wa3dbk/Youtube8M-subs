00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.870
 yes 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.370
 owner of children 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.280
 and good option 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.890
 yes 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.360
 and up 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.580
 Sea 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.670
 hello how about very good embedded portal 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.280
 coches.net we are going to give us a return in 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.280
 This bmw x4 accompanies our favor 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.969
 we started 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:24.009
 You've seen it on the outside, no more 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:27.679
 less than 4 meters and 67 centimeters 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:31.280
 exactly 20 centimeters less than his 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:33.469
 bmw x6 older brother and that good 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.439
 Well, as you have seen, you trust every copy 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:39.979
 the background with of the forms simply 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.349
 is one x6 20 centimeters more shorter and 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.439
 also a little more economical is 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:48.980
 available from 47 thousand 900 euros this 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.380
 unit that is a diesel 3.0 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.650
 with all-wheel drive of course we're 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.090
 talking about 60 thousand four hundred euros 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.850
 this gives me in particular we see each other 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.200
 78,000 because good because it does not lack 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.470
 you have nothing from head-up-display 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.450
 has the driving modes from the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.700
 echo but to try to save the most 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.670
 from gasoline to sport plus that 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.150
 truth is that the car takes out all its 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.960
 maximum sporting degree that it has has 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.140
 descent of slopes has start of 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.550
 survey has a professional browser 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.020
 that we have made good use during these 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.940
 this testing time the truth is that 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.830
 we are very happy with him however 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.390
 has some points to improve by 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.970
 example almost two thousand kilos of weight we 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.380
 They look like maybe too many for a car 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.960
 it's good that he 's halfway between the 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.700
 psuv and the coupÃ© and that it should have 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.650
 a little more agility the truth is 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.420
 I 'm not going to tell you to worry 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.630
 a little the subject of agility but 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.360
 yes it should be a little more coupe 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.450
 and less psuv maybe to see we've done 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.880
 quite utilization by snow even 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.100
 through mud by very difficult trucks 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.380
 also that obviously seems a lot 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.870
 better surf than coupe I also tell you that 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.950
 even the seat is located so high 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.600
 it's good that you surpass almost 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.550
 limited to the form although it is true 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.230
 that if we took a gasoline unit 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.700
 for sure we would not be more that 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.610
 punch and that push that does not lack in 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.350
 this unit eye 258 horses and you've already 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.950
 seen a pack m well with some tires 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.330
 19 inches three precious and then m by 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.460
 everywhere both inside and through 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.380
 outside and the truth is that we liked it 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.570
 quite a few percent seats 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.760
 that if you see them with silkscreen 2 and others 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.140
 the truth is that it is very very very nice to 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.240
 dynamic level then at dynamic level 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.960
 it depends a lot on these buttons here 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.110
 that are capable of transforming this bmw 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.330
 x4 well in an excellent wheeler that in 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.320
 motorway can make 7- liter socks or 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.480
 if we go to sport plus there you will see how 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.300
 it becomes and how everything is used then 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.720
 the direction hardens a barbarity 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.420
 the response to the accelerator is incredible 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.350
 and I can assure you that 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.670
 Well, there are 258 diesel horses but 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.020
 let's stop that we enter a zone of 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.090
 30 I can assure you that the answer is 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.560
 fantastic feels the sportsmanship and 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.710
 what a shame that center the life of a tad 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.060
 so high because the truth is that it 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.010
 can enjoy a lot with this concept 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.400
 I would say it is a car if you can 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.290
 allow the first thing in him is the car 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.230
 total because the mammoth is not 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.540
 like the x6 but you enjoy a dynamic 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.180
 pretty good despite those 2000 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.310
 kilos of weight and above all allows you to go 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.440
 by parts or by sites where 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.480
 Well, so far they were only 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.280
 reserved for all terrain and I tell you you're going 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.300
 to see photos with a layer of snow 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.950
 pretty decent by super roads 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.020
 lost with very careful with ruts 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.430
 a lot of mud and the car has gone through 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.570
 there without any problem so the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.430
 true in that sense we do not have any 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.210
 no complaints rear seats then there 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.010
 you can see three pretty decent seats 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.900
 for this size you could expect a 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.250
 tad more but it is very good and the 500 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.570
 liters of trunk with an opening 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.129
 Automatic automatic closing the truth 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.039
 is that is 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.659
 minimum required height that can be 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.800
 ask 500 liters are many liters you 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.039
 I can assure that they fit very many 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.209
 things so the only problem of this 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.249
 Well, we have already said that 

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:23.179
 maybe the driving seat a 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:25.189
 little elevated in terms of their 

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:26.719
 daily use that is fine for the day 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:28.699
 to day but as soon as you want to look for that 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:30.439
 the sportsmanship as it sins a 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.849
 little bit a big tall center and the weight 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.139
 of those 2,000 kilos the truth is that no 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.879
 we liked it quite sure that it 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.469
 can put a little more problems a 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:38.449
 perfect car that would take me to my house 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:41.209
 for a lifetime because I already tell you 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.469
 allows a very eclectic use 

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:43.639
 very heterogeneous the same goes for a 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:46.699
 broken that for a rip and the truth 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.800
 is that we love it so I analyzed you 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.929
 quite in this in this video what 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.759
 this bmw x 4 but I'm going to 

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:53.389
 dissect to infinity and a lot 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.709
 plus 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.059
 in the text that we do as always 

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:57.889
 portal coches.net website of 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:59.360
 reference where the engine there you go to go 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.669
 can see all the details of this 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.959
 good car to say enough if you want 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.259
 there we see in the next one 

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:05.259
 they will have touched
