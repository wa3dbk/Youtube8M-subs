online from the next door now let me
just<00:02:21.620> zoom<00:02:21.800> in<00:02:22.069> on<00:02:22.190> on<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.670> this<00:02:22.880> woven

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
just zoom in on on this this woven

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.460 
just zoom in on on this this woven
material<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.780> think<00:02:23.959> this<00:02:24.020> is<00:02:24.080> what's<00:02:24.319> causing

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
material I think this is what's causing

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.760 
material I think this is what's causing
a<00:02:24.650> bit<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:24.830> controversy<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:27.140> material<00:02:27.650> is

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
a bit of controversy the material is

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.820 
a bit of controversy the material is
fully<00:02:28.280> woven<00:02:29.030> every<00:02:29.599> there<00:02:30.050> isn't<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.410> bit<00:02:30.709> on

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
fully woven every there isn't a bit on

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.770 
fully woven every there isn't a bit on
it<00:02:30.860> which<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.310> not<00:02:31.610> woven<00:02:32.090> if<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.569> makes

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
it which is not woven if that makes

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.040 
it which is not woven if that makes
sense<00:02:32.989> um<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:34.220> it's<00:02:34.819> not<00:02:35.060> one<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.300> those<00:02:35.510> woven

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
sense um and it's not one of those woven

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.140 
sense um and it's not one of those woven
materials<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.680> actually<00:02:37.069> has<00:02:37.220> much<00:02:37.489> give<00:02:37.849> or

doesn't know that's how the laces are so

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.400 
doesn't know that's how the laces are so
the<00:03:27.410> laces<00:03:27.799> firstly<00:03:28.400> are<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:31.930> waxed<00:03:32.930> kind<00:03:33.260> of

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
the laces firstly are a a waxed kind of

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.550 
the laces firstly are a a waxed kind of
lever<00:03:33.709> kind<00:03:34.280> of<00:03:34.370> material<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.290> which<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.470> I

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
lever kind of material and which is I

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.220 
lever kind of material and which is I
think<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:36.859> a<00:03:36.890> good<00:03:37.130> is<00:03:37.609> a<00:03:38.420> good<00:03:38.690> little<00:03:38.840> add-on

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
think is a good is a good little add-on

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.020 
think is a good is a good little add-on
I<00:03:39.440> think<00:03:39.859> that<00:03:39.980> they<00:03:40.160> should<00:03:40.190> put<00:03:40.489> those<00:03:40.700> wax

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
I think that they should put those wax

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.120 
I think that they should put those wax
and<00:03:41.239> material<00:03:41.690> laces<00:03:41.989> on<00:03:42.140> most<00:03:42.410> trainers<00:03:42.799> now

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
and material laces on most trainers now

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.599 
and material laces on most trainers now
well<00:03:43.790> anyway<00:03:43.970> um<00:03:44.799> you<00:03:45.799> can<00:03:45.980> just<00:03:46.220> make<00:03:46.400> out

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
well anyway um you can just make out

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.160 
well anyway um you can just make out
that<00:03:46.880> it's<00:03:47.030> not<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:47.329> not<00:03:47.389> like<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.600> pull<00:03:47.930> tab

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
that it's not it's not like a pull tab

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.319 
that it's not it's not like a pull tab
but<00:03:48.440> it's<00:03:48.560> just<00:03:48.680> like<00:03:48.799> a<00:03:48.829> sign<00:03:49.220> which<00:03:49.850> is<00:03:49.880> their

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
but it's just like a sign which is their

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.030 
but it's just like a sign which is their
leverage<00:03:50.720> or<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.170> sandwiches<00:03:51.650> obviously

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
leverage or and sandwiches obviously

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.340 
leverage or and sandwiches obviously
stitched<00:03:52.340> in<00:03:52.549> which<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.299> think<00:03:53.510> looks<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:54.200> just

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
stitched in which I think looks it just

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.870 
stitched in which I think looks it just
adds<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.650> little<00:03:54.680> bit<00:03:55.130> of<00:03:55.250> class<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.790> the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
adds a little bit of class to the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.800 
adds a little bit of class to the

with<00:04:33.689> the<00:04:33.780> way<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.590> think<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.830> few<00:04:34.949> people

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
with the way and I think a few people

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.369 
with the way and I think a few people
have<00:04:35.340> commented<00:04:35.520> on<00:04:35.849> those<00:04:36.060> but<00:04:36.659> again<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:37.259> is

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
have commented on those but again it is

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:38.990 
have commented on those but again it is
such<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.650> minor<00:04:37.979> thing<00:04:38.219> I<00:04:38.400> don't<00:04:38.699> think<00:04:38.879> it

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
such a minor thing I don't think it

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.679 
such a minor thing I don't think it
bears<00:04:39.210> thinking<00:04:39.780> about<00:04:41.270> away<00:04:42.270> from<00:04:42.509> that

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:42.689 
bears thinking about away from that

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.200 
bears thinking about away from that
these<00:04:43.379> because<00:04:43.710> of<00:04:43.979> it<00:04:44.069> because<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.580> woven

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
these because of it because the woven

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.200 
these because of it because the woven
material<00:04:45.479> doesn't<00:04:46.050> really<00:04:46.349> give<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:47.210> would

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
material doesn't really give I would

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.179 
material doesn't really give I would
suggest<00:04:48.419> if<00:04:48.870> you<00:04:49.080> can<00:04:49.319> get<00:04:49.500> a<00:04:49.530> pair<00:04:50.039> of<00:04:50.069> these

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:50.189 
suggest if you can get a pair of these

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.670 
suggest if you can get a pair of these
you<00:04:50.550> buy<00:04:50.699> a<00:04:50.729> size<00:04:51.030> up<00:04:51.300> that's<00:04:51.990> what<00:04:52.139> my<00:04:52.169> advice

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
you buy a size up that's what my advice

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.010 
you buy a size up that's what my advice
would<00:04:52.830> be<00:04:52.969> if<00:04:53.969> I<00:04:54.060> just<00:04:54.210> go<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.509> the<00:04:54.689> back<00:04:54.719> of<00:04:54.870> the

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
would be if I just go to the back of the

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.730 
would be if I just go to the back of the
trainer<00:04:55.259> so<00:04:55.680> this<00:04:55.949> is<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.669> suede<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.719> want<00:04:58.530> to<00:04:58.620> say

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
trainer so this is a suede I want to say

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.890 
trainer so this is a suede I want to say
it's<00:04:58.860> actual<00:04:59.250> suede<00:04:59.610> but<00:05:00.330> i'm<00:05:00.479> going<00:05:00.629> to<00:05:00.719> say

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
it's actual suede but i'm going to say

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.080 
it's actual suede but i'm going to say
for<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.250> benefit<00:05:02.250> of<00:05:02.280> someone<00:05:02.759> coming<00:05:02.879> back

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
for the benefit of someone coming back

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.390 
for the benefit of someone coming back
and<00:05:03.210> saying<00:05:03.389> I<00:05:03.569> know<00:05:04.110> you're<00:05:04.319> wrong<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.800> think

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
and saying I know you're wrong I think

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.510 
and saying I know you're wrong I think
this<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.520> just<00:05:05.639> a<00:05:05.849> suede<00:05:06.180> material<00:05:06.539> and<00:05:07.520> which

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
this is just a suede material and which

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.939 
this is just a suede material and which
is<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:08.789> same<00:05:09.090> kind<00:05:09.930> of<00:05:10.080> material<00:05:10.620> which<00:05:10.770> is

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
is the same kind of material which is

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.600 
is the same kind of material which is
inside<00:05:11.639> the<00:05:12.120> actual<00:05:12.330> trainer<00:05:13.430> composers<00:05:14.430> make

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
inside the actual trainer composers make

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.450 
inside the actual trainer composers make
that<00:05:14.729> out<00:05:14.879> and<00:05:15.479> they<00:05:16.469> didn't<00:05:16.710> put<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:16.919> 23<00:05:17.340> on

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
that out and they didn't put the 23 on

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.249 
that out and they didn't put the 23 on
there<00:05:17.639> and<00:05:17.819> that's<00:05:18.090> what<00:05:18.240> comes<00:05:18.449> synonymously

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
there and that's what comes synonymously

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.800 
there and that's what comes synonymously
with<00:05:19.349> the<00:05:19.710> jordan<00:05:20.189> 11s<00:05:20.729> you<00:05:21.120> have<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.300> 23

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
with the jordan 11s you have the 23

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.689 
with the jordan 11s you have the 23
which<00:05:21.960> sits<00:05:22.229> on<00:05:22.349> the<00:05:22.439> back<00:05:22.590> definitely<00:05:23.520> it's

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
which sits on the back definitely it's

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.249 
which sits on the back definitely it's
not<00:05:23.849> on<00:05:23.969> there<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.389> probably<00:05:24.719> when<00:05:24.990> its<00:05:25.110> foot

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
not on there and probably when its foot

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.990 
not on there and probably when its foot
on<00:05:25.379> there<00:05:25.500> because<00:05:25.650> of<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.919> suede<00:05:26.159> who<00:05:26.819> knows

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
on there because of the suede who knows

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.709 
on there because of the suede who knows
and<00:05:28.219> just<00:05:29.219> going<00:05:29.370> back<00:05:29.490> to<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.729> soul<00:05:29.969> what<00:05:30.629> I'm

and just going back to the soul what I'm
going<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:30.900> do<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:31.560> can<00:05:31.710> probably<00:05:32.009> work<00:05:32.129> out

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
going to do you can probably work out
