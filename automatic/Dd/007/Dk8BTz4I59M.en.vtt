00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
because he's in the most hostile place

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.449

in<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.540> world<00:03:37.780> at<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:38.709> point<00:03:38.890> in<00:03:39.250> time<00:03:39.280> so

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
the film is very much about those

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.970 
the film is very much about those
dynamics<00:03:42.100> about<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.670> trust<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:44.709> about
