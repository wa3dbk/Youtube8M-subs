00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
were done so naturally you think you
have<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:47.860> get<00:02:47.980> out<00:02:48.130> of<00:02:48.220> there<00:02:48.310> pretty<00:02:48.370> quickly

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
have to get out of there pretty quickly

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.310 
have to get out of there pretty quickly
but<00:02:49.000> going<00:02:49.209> straight<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.630> which<00:02:49.900> was<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.140> only

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
but going straight up which was the only

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.110 
but going straight up which was the only
direction<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.800> could<00:02:50.860> see<00:02:51.190> when<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.760> entrance

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
direction I could see when the entrance

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.979 
direction I could see when the entrance
was<00:02:52.750> not<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.350> right<00:02:53.500> way<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.730> died<00:02:54.989> so

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
was not the right way and I died so

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.660 
was not the right way and I died so
naturally<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:56.800> thought<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.190> should<00:02:57.310> stay<00:02:57.640> away

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
naturally I thought I should stay away

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.550 
naturally I thought I should stay away
from<00:02:57.880> that<00:02:58.150> area<00:02:58.300> but<00:02:58.630> as<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.020> turns<00:02:59.200> out<00:02:59.350> you

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
from that area but as it turns out you

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.990 
from that area but as it turns out you
were<00:02:59.650> supposed<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.070> go<00:03:00.250> right<00:03:00.640> from<00:03:00.820> the

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
were supposed to go right from the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.520 
were supposed to go right from the
entrance<00:03:01.480> but<00:03:01.810> because<00:03:02.050> it's<00:03:02.200> out<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.380> my

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
entrance but because it's out of my

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.070 
entrance but because it's out of my
sight<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.160> couldn't<00:03:03.640> see<00:03:03.820> it<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.180> hated<00:03:04.840> that

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
sight I couldn't see it I hated that

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.289 
sight I couldn't see it I hated that
design<00:03:05.350> with<00:03:05.530> bright<00:03:05.770> intensity<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:07.060> other

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
design with bright intensity the other

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.390 
design with bright intensity the other
one<00:03:07.540> was<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.720> final<00:03:08.200> dungeon<00:03:08.350> with<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.040> time

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
one was the final dungeon with a time

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.400 
one was the final dungeon with a time
warp<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.820> once<00:03:10.030> again<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.480> puzzle<00:03:10.900> too<00:03:11.080> far<00:03:11.320> out

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
warp and once again a puzzle too far out

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.710

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
of reach to actually see clearly this

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.199 
of reach to actually see clearly this
next<00:03:14.110> one<00:03:14.290> truly<00:03:15.190> based<00:03:15.580> on<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:15.850> personal

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
the motion controls for the items work

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.630 
the motion controls for the items work
great<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.410> sword<00:03:20.709> combat<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.370> little

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
great the sword combat is a little

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.699 
great the sword combat is a little
different<00:03:22.000> story<00:03:22.330> most<00:03:23.170> of<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.350> time<00:03:23.560> it

not<00:03:26.650> too<00:03:26.890> sure<00:03:27.130> how<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.400> recalibrate<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.209> there

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
not too sure how to recalibrate it there

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.300

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
to mention that there were ties I made a

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.600 
to mention that there were ties I made a
horizontal<00:03:38.260> slash<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:39.220> read<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.489> as<00:03:39.579> a

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
horizontal slash and it read it as a

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.670 
horizontal slash and it read it as a
diagonal<00:03:40.239> slash<00:03:40.420> causing<00:03:41.110> me<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.350> miss<00:03:41.560> the

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
diagonal slash causing me to miss the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.069 
diagonal slash causing me to miss the
area<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.160> needed<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.549> hit<00:03:42.730> or<00:03:43.180> if<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:43.750> attacked

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
area I needed to hit or if I attacked

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.840 
area I needed to hit or if I attacked
and<00:03:44.290> it<00:03:44.350> was<00:03:44.440> blocked<00:03:44.739> and<00:03:45.040> trying<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.640> quickly

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
and it was blocked and trying to quickly

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.970 
and it was blocked and trying to quickly
hit<00:03:46.150> from<00:03:46.299> another<00:03:46.570> angle<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:47.530> would<00:03:47.709> make<00:03:47.860> the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
hit from another angle it would make the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.190 
hit from another angle it would make the
same<00:03:48.100> attack<00:03:48.370> again<00:03:48.850> I'm<00:03:49.630> not<00:03:49.840> sure<00:03:50.019> what<00:03:50.140> the

same attack again I'm not sure what the

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.660 
same attack again I'm not sure what the
problem<00:03:50.290> is<00:03:50.560> but<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.769> sword<00:03:51.040> combat<00:03:51.220> became<00:03:51.640> a

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
problem is but the sword combat became a

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.000 
problem is but the sword combat became a

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
if you fail to do the shield bash

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.499 
if you fail to do the shield bash
correctly<00:05:29.800> but<00:05:30.400> I<00:05:30.430> felt<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:31.180> game<00:05:31.360> never

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
correctly but I felt the game never

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.510 
correctly but I felt the game never
properly<00:05:32.289> trained<00:05:32.680> you<00:05:32.770> on<00:05:32.889> how<00:05:33.009> to<00:05:33.039> do<00:05:33.310> that

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
properly trained you on how to do that

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.399 
properly trained you on how to do that
there<00:05:34.389> was<00:05:34.509> an<00:05:34.629> area<00:05:34.810> you<00:05:35.020> could<00:05:35.139> train<00:05:35.379> with

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
there was an area you could train with

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:36.839 
there was an area you could train with
it<00:05:35.650> but<00:05:35.770> it<00:05:35.919> never<00:05:36.129> really<00:05:36.250> taught<00:05:36.520> you<00:05:36.699> the

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
it but it never really taught you the

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.089 
it but it never really taught you the
advantages<00:05:37.360> of<00:05:37.419> how<00:05:37.629> to<00:05:37.690> use<00:05:37.930> it<00:05:38.110> or<00:05:38.259> if<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:38.919> did

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
advantages of how to use it or if it did

advantages of how to use it or if it did
I<00:05:39.129> just<00:05:39.250> went<00:05:39.490> completely<00:05:39.909> over<00:05:40.270> my<00:05:40.300> head<00:05:41.250> well

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
I just went completely over my head well

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.890 
I just went completely over my head well
I<00:05:42.279> didn't<00:05:42.669> encounter<00:05:42.940> this<00:05:43.240> because<00:05:43.509> I<00:05:43.539> got<00:05:43.750> my

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
I didn't encounter this because I got my

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.570 
I didn't encounter this because I got my
game<00:05:44.080> late<00:05:44.289> and<00:05:44.529> avoided<00:05:44.949> this<00:05:45.039> with<00:05:45.219> all<00:05:45.430> the
