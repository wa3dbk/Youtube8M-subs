00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.200
 the number 9 is considered a number 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:09.080
 magical since it has several properties 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.940
 that no other number does not have 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.850
 one property that you have is that when you 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.540
 have a number and suppose I put the 8 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.540
 and 9 while as one of your digits is 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:25.400
 9 if you add your digits in this 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.590
 case for example 8 9 gives the sum 17 that to 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.150
 in turn to add to having it to have 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.900
 one digit 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.809
 this would be one plus 7 that at the end gives 8 2 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.760
 it seems like the 9 disappears or 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.960
 does magic and this happens with any 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:46.909
 number that has a minimum of 9 can have 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:51.170
 several for example the 599 in this case 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:56.449
 is a 5 + 9 + 9 the total sum is going to be 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.430
 equal to 23 which in turn adds 2 + 3 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.600
 arrives at another 5 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.620
 that is, the digit was reached that was not 9 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.720
 disappeared the 9 were made magic 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.830
 that is a characteristic obviously if 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.160
 you have other digits and nine the sum 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.210
 it will be equal to that of all the digits 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.010
 except 9 this is in addition not in the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.750
 multiplication case there is also another 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.850
 property that if you have a number 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:32.850
 suppose 13 and multiply by nine 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:36.000
 would be 90 plus 27 would be 117 always everything 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.340
 multiple of 9 when adding your digits gives 9 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.310
 always simplifying it up to a digit 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.070
 also the number 9 is considered as a 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.620
 spiritual number and wisdom since 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.840
 if all the digits of 1 are added 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.100
 until 9 of 2ยบ plus two plus three more 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.750
 456 plus 7 more 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.120
 89 the sum is going to be 45 going back to 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.330
 apply the property to add your 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.880
 digits gives 9 so all at the end of 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.560
 accounts there is a 9 hidden there in turn 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:15.360
 all digits are added by removing 9 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.510
 the sum we are going to save this 8 the sum 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.450
 of 36 that reapplying is also 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.989
 another 9 so in this case we could 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.290
 say that 9 is complete of all 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.599
 other numbers less than him a data 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.069
 curious or quick division that has to 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.340
 see with 9 would be that whenever you 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.620
 has a division for example 3 between 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.209
 9 here intervenes the 9 the result in 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.519
 this case would be point 3 3 3 as well 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.040
 suspensive if you have for example 15 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:51.299
 between 99 already because they are two digits the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.280
 result will come out point 15 15 15 and it's 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:58.610
 something curious that is preserved and has to 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:03.750
 see with 9 finally you have 99 in 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:06.000
 387 the result will be point 187 187 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.980
 is repeating itself now that can be 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.830
 be a fast division 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.900
 a particular case is the number 666 that 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.299
 the number of the beast was known 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.629
 it also has to do with 9 since 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:23.200
 there is still 66 this number if they add up 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:26.319
 its digits 66 + 6 equals 18 that a 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.400
 turn 18 add 1 and 8 is a 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.709
 9 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.190
 and the same thing happens if you multiply 6 times 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:36.040
 6 by 6 of 216 that at the same time adding their 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.190
 digits gives another 9 there are many games in 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.959
 which number 9 is used in these 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.970
 tricks games in case seemingly 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.129
 the people who make numerical games 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.930
 and they guess what's going to come out without 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.120
 But it has to do with the 9 at the end 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.760
 of accounts one of these games would be by 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.250
 example write a date of birth 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.040
 of a person starting with the day and 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.280
 then the month and then the year or with four 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.280
 digits 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:09.030
 May 31, 1985 ok of preference 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.760
 this number has to have some 9 for 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.460
 that works and now writes the digits 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.410
 in the bne in another order 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.050
 and then the subtraction of 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.450
 these two numbers obviously you take the 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.720
 first number the biggest minus 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.290
 the minor who changes his fasts we go to 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.290
 do the subtraction 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.330
 although zinc azsa lagoon is left 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.520
 find everyone 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.520
 then to le monde comes one 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.610
 well then this is going to be the 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.159
 result reached 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.740
 if we add all these digits of one 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:56.310
 national Amazon +9 the zone a ribbon 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:59.030
 magenta +4 will give 3 13 23 27 that your 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.970
 time 27 is 2 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.760
 + 79 always when doing this 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.940
 procedure will come out 9 at the end is 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.360
 a curiosity is all a little game 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.759
 Another another 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.310
 when you have a calculator you can 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:18.960
 make a game type trick you have yourself 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:21.509
 enter this number 4 5 6 7 9 nothing else 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.729
 that does not carry the 8 a person is asked 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:27.780
 multiply it by any number 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:31.050
 from 1 to 9 for example by 5 and the 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.020
 result in turn the other person what 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.020
 multiply by nine here between 9 and 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.580
 the result will be the previous digit 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.580
 what the person put 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.569
 here it would be fine this would come out if 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.240
 here it changes if this whole number is 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:52.120
 multiply now by a 3 then by 9 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.680
 the result would now be pure 3 and so 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.680
 we can be playing with this 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.580
 a well- known character that influenced the 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.860
 9 in his life was John Lennon the up 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:11.000
 he made two songs one 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:15.310
 revolution 9 and the other was number 9 and 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.469
 number nine dream also their children 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.300
 minimum 1 was born with on some date that 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.340
 started with 9 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.940
 two important people in your life that 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.789
 was me with paul mccartney were born in a 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:31.009
 18 but by adding 9 gives much thought good 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.830
 in 9 then he is a person who 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:36.789
 he knows that for him the number 9 was a 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.789
 very important number
