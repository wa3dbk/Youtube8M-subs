let's recall up and to the right lower

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.580 
let's recall up and to the right lower
first<00:01:20.340> shot<00:01:20.760> recoil<00:01:20.790> multiplier<00:01:21.590> less

spreading peace per shot the ace has a
bit<00:01:26.940> faster<00:01:27.450> pirate<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.530> that's<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.210> if<00:01:30.210> you

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
bit faster pirate but that's it if you

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.969 
bit faster pirate but that's it if you
compare<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> lot<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> other<00:01:31.590> assault

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.820 
compare it to a lot of the other assault
rifles<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:32.640> find<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.060> new<00:01:33.830> newly

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
rifles you will find that the new newly

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.969 
rifles you will find that the new newly
improved<00:01:35.130> AR<00:01:35.880> 160s<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.780> par<00:01:37.050> in<00:01:37.320> almost<00:01:37.800> all

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
improved AR 160s on par in almost all

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.550 
improved AR 160s on par in almost all
features<00:01:38.580> but<00:01:38.940> with<00:01:39.120> a<00:01:39.150> lot<00:01:39.420> better<00:01:39.840> recoil

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
features but with a lot better recoil

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.430 
features but with a lot better recoil
values<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.330> this<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.810> change<00:01:43.020> this

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
values so do this I and change this
