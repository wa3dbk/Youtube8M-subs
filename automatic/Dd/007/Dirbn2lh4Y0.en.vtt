survival island on the xbox 360 edition
of<00:00:12.960> minecraft<00:00:13.280> so<00:00:14.280> let's<00:00:14.849> start<00:00:15.059> out<00:00:15.240> with

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
of minecraft so let's start out with

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.650 
of minecraft so let's start out with
this<00:00:15.719> one<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.890> very<00:00:17.789> very<00:00:18.060> good<00:00:18.330> seed

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
this one it is a very very good seed

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.040 
this one it is a very very good seed
with<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> decent<00:00:20.010> size<00:00:20.340> island<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.180> but

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
with a decent size island on it but

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.470 
with a decent size island on it but
there's<00:00:22.560> not<00:00:22.980> any<00:00:23.279> trees<00:00:23.760> which<00:00:24.090> kind<00:00:24.390> of

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
there's not any trees which kind of

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.660 
there's not any trees which kind of
sucks<00:00:24.750> because<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.800> definitely<00:00:26.010> need<00:00:26.430> those

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
sucks because you definitely need those

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.089 
sucks because you definitely need those
to<00:00:26.970> start<00:00:27.330> out<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.660> build<00:00:28.010> pretty<00:00:29.010> much

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
to start out and build pretty much

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.919 
to start out and build pretty much
anything<00:00:29.340> not<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.970> need<00:00:30.119> trees<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> wood

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
anything not you need trees in the wood

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.500 
anything not you need trees in the wood
for<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.369> definitely<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.940> bad<00:00:33.180> thing

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
for so that is definitely a bad thing

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.510 
for so that is definitely a bad thing
but<00:00:34.050> there<00:00:34.230> are<00:00:34.410> some<00:00:34.739> other<00:00:35.010> islands<00:00:35.430> that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
but there are some other islands that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
but there are some other islands that
are<00:00:35.610> kind<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.180> far<00:00:36.390> away<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.260> could

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
are kind of far away but you could

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.750 
are kind of far away but you could
probably<00:00:37.559> swim<00:00:37.829> there<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:38.430> five

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
probably swim there in about five

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.979 
probably swim there in about five
minutes<00:00:39.030> if<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.390> want<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.629> keep<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.899> in

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
minutes if you want to keep it in

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.130 
minutes if you want to keep it in
survival<00:00:40.430> or<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.390> could<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.690> small<00:00:42.960> one

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
survival or on you could just small one

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.959 
survival or on you could just small one
in<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.410> creative<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.370> were<00:00:44.550> okay<00:00:44.850> with

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
in and creative if you were okay with

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.670 
in and creative if you were okay with
that<00:00:45.180> or<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.750> guess<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.079> could<00:00:46.110> even<00:00:46.289> use<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
that or I guess you could even use the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.250 
that or I guess you could even use the
hosts<00:00:46.920> privileges<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.910> fly<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> little<00:00:48.899> bit<00:00:49.050> and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
hosts privileges to fly a little bit and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.580 
hosts privileges to fly a little bit and
go<00:00:50.250> over<00:00:50.340> there<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.730> get<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:52.350> you're

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
go over there and get one but if you're

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.260 
go over there and get one but if you're
okay<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.520> would<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> good

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
okay with that that would be a good

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.060 
okay with that that would be a good
thing<00:00:54.570> because<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> pretty<00:00:55.649> big<00:00:55.829> size

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
thing because this is a pretty big size

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.330 
thing because this is a pretty big size
island<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.629> over<00:00:58.620> or<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.920> could<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.070> come

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
island or on over or you could just come

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.470 
island or on over or you could just come
over<00:00:59.430> here<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.820> you're<00:00:59.969> okay<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.300> that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
over here if you're okay with that

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240 
over here if you're okay with that
you're<00:01:00.750> trying<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> little<00:01:01.559> casual

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
you're trying to do like a little casual

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.969 
you're trying to do like a little casual
survival<00:01:02.879> island<00:01:03.229> because<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> pretty

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
survival island because this is a pretty

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.890 
survival island because this is a pretty
decent<00:01:05.760> sized<00:01:05.909> dollar<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.420> also<00:01:06.659> has<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
decent sized dollar and also has a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.710 
decent sized dollar and also has a
mushroom<00:01:07.470> volume<00:01:08.070> near<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.570> can

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
mushroom volume near it but as you can

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.060 
mushroom volume near it but as you can
see<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> map<00:01:10.229> there's<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.860> lot<00:01:11.010> of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
see on the map there's just a lot of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.580 
see on the map there's just a lot of
little<00:01:11.340> islands<00:01:11.790> there's<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.270> one

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
little islands there's not really one

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.850 
little islands there's not really one
one<00:01:13.590> big<00:01:13.830> area<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:15.229> with<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.350> island<00:01:16.740> there

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
one big area and with this island there

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.450 
one big area and with this island there
is<00:01:17.070> no<00:01:17.400> tree<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.710> that's<00:01:19.710> him<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.159> kind<00:01:20.369> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
is no tree so that's him it kind of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.830 
is no tree so that's him it kind of
difficult<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> think<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.540> would<00:01:21.630> still<00:01:21.810> be

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
difficult but I think it would still be

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.590 
difficult but I think it would still be
a<00:01:21.960> good<00:01:22.259> island<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.119> second

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
a good island and this is the second

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.780 
a good island and this is the second
seat<00:01:24.840> i<00:01:24.990> found<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.070> actually<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.549> scene

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
seat i found this is actually the scene

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.980 
seat i found this is actually the scene
that<00:01:27.030> i'm<00:01:27.240> doing<00:01:27.479> my<00:01:27.869> oh<00:01:28.159> my<00:01:29.159> survival<00:01:29.759> island

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
that i'm doing my oh my survival island

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.140 
that i'm doing my oh my survival island
series<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:31.290> channel<00:01:31.520> but<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.790> isn't<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
series on my channel but this isn't the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.660 
series on my channel but this isn't the
on<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.630> i'm<00:01:33.750> using<00:01:34.100> there's<00:01:35.100> some<00:01:35.310> sugarcane

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
on that i'm using there's some sugarcane

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.640 
on that i'm using there's some sugarcane
hear<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.360> no<00:01:36.570> my<00:01:36.869> guess<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.320> take<00:01:37.470> with

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
hear that no my guess you can take with

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.649 
hear that no my guess you can take with
you<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.040> want<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:39.210> i<00:01:39.240> guess<00:01:39.540> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
you if you want and but i guess you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.319 
you if you want and but i guess you
could<00:01:39.780> take<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.770> though

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
could take that with you in though

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.550 
could take that with you in though
there's<00:01:42.329> another<00:01:42.659> Island<00:01:43.110> over<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:43.470> that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
there's another Island over here that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.200 
there's another Island over here that
actually<00:01:43.710> has<00:01:44.040> trees<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.030> island

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
actually has trees and this is island

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.630 
actually has trees and this is island
i'm<00:01:45.479> doing<00:01:45.720> my<00:01:45.920> survival<00:01:46.920> island<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.460> just

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
i'm doing my survival island and I just

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.940 
i'm doing my survival island and I just
came<00:01:47.790> over<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.890> started<00:01:49.890> over

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
came over to this one and started over

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.039 
came over to this one and started over
here<00:01:50.250> it's<00:01:50.369> pretty<00:01:50.790> small<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.570> does<00:01:51.810> have

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
here it's pretty small but it does have

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.350

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the sugarcane and the wheat seeds and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.670 
the sugarcane and the wheat seeds and
all<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.570> good<00:01:54.689> stuff<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.290> would<00:01:55.439> need

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and I'm gonna leave all these seed

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.639 
and I'm gonna leave all these seed
numbers<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> description<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.469> the<00:02:01.469> first

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
numbers in the description in the first

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.630 
numbers in the description in the first
video<00:02:01.829> um<00:02:02.570> be<00:02:03.570> first<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.200> it'll<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.340> go<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
video um be first and it'll just go the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.069 
video um be first and it'll just go the
second<00:02:05.909> video<00:02:06.000> will<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.270> second<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.719> all<00:02:06.869> that

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
second video will be second and all that

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.680 
second video will be second and all that
but<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.099> could<00:02:08.310> come<00:02:08.789> over<00:02:08.819> here<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.450> swim

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
but you could come over here and swim

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.360 
but you could come over here and swim
over<00:02:09.929> here<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.229> not<00:02:10.470> very<00:02:10.649> far<00:02:10.920> at<00:02:11.099> all<00:02:11.160> it's

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
over here it's not very far at all it's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.970 
over here it's not very far at all it's
about<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.550> two

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
about a two

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.960 
about a two
swim<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.580> use<00:02:13.569> this<00:02:13.720> one<00:02:13.959> so<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.590> definitely<00:02:15.550> swim

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
swim I use this one so I definitely swim

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.259 
swim I use this one so I definitely swim
over<00:02:16.269> here<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.840> get<00:02:17.739> over<00:02:17.860> here<00:02:18.159> to<00:02:18.340> find<00:02:19.030> this

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
over here to get over here to find this

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.320 
over here to get over here to find this
island<00:02:19.750> for<00:02:19.780> my<00:02:20.049> video<00:02:20.409> so<00:02:21.159> it's<00:02:21.909> definitely

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
island for my video so it's definitely

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.600 
island for my video so it's definitely
not<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.510> far<00:02:22.780> swim<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:24.040> could<00:02:24.220> just<00:02:24.400> come

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
not a far swim and you could just come

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.610 
not a far swim and you could just come
over<00:02:24.760> here<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.120> grab<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.420> sapling<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.200> leave

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
over here and grab a sapling and leave

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.110 
over here and grab a sapling and leave
if<00:02:26.799> you<00:02:26.830> wanted<00:02:27.159> to<00:02:27.310> come<00:02:27.580> back<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:28.000> this

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
if you wanted to come back to this

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.300 
if you wanted to come back to this
little<00:02:28.330> bit<00:02:28.540> bigger<00:02:28.780> island<00:02:29.049> it's<00:02:29.980> probably<00:02:30.250> a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
little bit bigger island it's probably a

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.650 
little bit bigger island it's probably a
little<00:02:30.370> bit<00:02:30.549> better<00:02:30.760> for<00:02:31.000> survival<00:02:31.510> island

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
little bit better for survival island

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.190 
little bit better for survival island
but<00:02:32.140> umm<00:02:32.410> it'll<00:02:32.730> work<00:02:33.730> either<00:02:34.060> way<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.690> here's

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
but umm it'll work either way and here's

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.140 
but umm it'll work either way and here's
another<00:02:35.470> really<00:02:36.160> good<00:02:36.370> Island<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.420> um<00:02:39.150> it's

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
another really good Island it is um it's

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.110 
another really good Island it is um it's
actually<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.660> very<00:02:40.720> very<00:02:41.319> big<00:02:41.560> island<00:02:42.040> but<00:02:42.640> yet

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
actually a very very big island but yet

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.630 
actually a very very big island but yet
again<00:02:43.379> pretty<00:02:44.379> sure<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.650> doesn't<00:02:45.069> have<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.250> tree

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
again pretty sure it doesn't have a tree

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.920 
again pretty sure it doesn't have a tree
which<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.629> big<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.709> big<00:02:48.610> disadvantage<00:02:49.299> here

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
which is a big a big disadvantage here

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.710 
which is a big a big disadvantage here
so<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.230> have<00:02:50.349> to<00:02:50.829> swim<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.489> another<00:02:52.150> Island

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
so you have to swim to another Island

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.309 
so you have to swim to another Island
and<00:02:52.980> definitely<00:02:53.980> go<00:02:54.250> get<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.430> tree<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.170> as<00:02:56.170> you

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
and definitely go get a tree and as you

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.559 
and definitely go get a tree and as you
can<00:02:56.470> see<00:02:56.500> on<00:02:56.620> this<00:02:56.829> map<00:02:56.890> as<00:02:57.340> well<00:02:57.730> there's<00:02:58.269> no

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
can see on this map as well there's no

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.860 
can see on this map as well there's no
big<00:02:58.840> big<00:02:59.470> islands<00:03:00.040> or<00:03:00.190> big<00:03:00.849> laying<00:03:01.450> there<00:03:01.720> is

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
big big islands or big laying there is

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.410 
big big islands or big laying there is
it's<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.560> whole<00:03:02.890> bunch<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.220> small<00:03:03.760> islands<00:03:04.150> and

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
it's a whole bunch of small islands and

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.839 
it's a whole bunch of small islands and
there's<00:03:04.599> no<00:03:04.720> mature<00:03:05.049> like<00:03:05.709> mushroom<00:03:06.280> islands

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
there's no mature like mushroom islands

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.240 
there's no mature like mushroom islands
and<00:03:07.000> stuff<00:03:07.239> but<00:03:08.109> elmwood<00:03:08.769> survive<00:03:09.040> on<00:03:09.220> your

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
and stuff but elmwood survive on your

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.250 
and stuff but elmwood survive on your
kind<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.819> supposed<00:03:09.970> stay<00:03:10.209> on<00:03:10.359> one<00:03:10.599> island<00:03:11.079> or

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
kind of supposed stay on one island or

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.039 
kind of supposed stay on one island or
just<00:03:11.470> go<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.590> another<00:03:11.920> one<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.310> start<00:03:12.579> then

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
just go to another one and start then

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.660 
just go to another one and start then
but<00:03:14.049> you<00:03:14.290> could<00:03:14.440> come<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.829> island<00:03:15.069> it<00:03:15.430> has

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
but you could come to this island it has

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.729 
but you could come to this island it has
a<00:03:15.700> tree<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:16.930> pretty<00:03:17.169> decent<00:03:17.560> sized

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
a tree and it's pretty decent sized

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.940 
a tree and it's pretty decent sized
island<00:03:18.419> but<00:03:19.419> I<00:03:19.450> yeah<00:03:20.260> it's<00:03:20.440> pretty<00:03:20.620> decent

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
island but I yeah it's pretty decent

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.059 
island but I yeah it's pretty decent
sized<00:03:21.130> island<00:03:21.669> and<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:23.290> would<00:03:23.440> work<00:03:23.590> very<00:03:23.650> very

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
sized island and it would work very very

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.190 
sized island and it would work very very
well<00:03:24.310> or<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.239> could<00:03:25.419> just<00:03:25.450> come<00:03:25.810> over<00:03:25.930> here

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
well or you could just come over here

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.500 
well or you could just come over here
and<00:03:26.380> grab<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.709> sapling<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.609> go<00:03:28.060> back<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.389> the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
and grab a sapling and go back to the

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.970 
and grab a sapling and go back to the
other<00:03:28.599> Island<00:03:28.959> because<00:03:29.500> it's<00:03:29.680> probably<00:03:29.919> a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
other Island because it's probably a

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.530 
other Island because it's probably a
little<00:03:30.130> bit<00:03:30.340> bigger<00:03:30.639> and<00:03:30.940> probably<00:03:31.329> work<00:03:31.450> a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
little bit bigger and probably work a

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.690
