a review on the Jaguar deluxe I got it

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.810 
a review on the Jaguar deluxe I got it
from<00:00:17.940> lay<00:00:18.300> play<00:00:18.720> about<00:00:19.260> two<00:00:19.800> months<00:00:20.100> ago<00:00:20.189> so

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
from lay play about two months ago so

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.460 
from lay play about two months ago so
I've<00:00:20.939> had<00:00:21.119> some<00:00:21.150> time<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.600> play<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:24.470> it's

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
I've had some time to play with it it's

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.269 
I've had some time to play with it it's
really<00:00:25.680> heavy<00:00:26.300> heavy<00:00:27.300> knife<00:00:27.529> about<00:00:28.529> six<00:00:28.949> point

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
really heavy heavy knife about six point

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.439 
really heavy heavy knife about six point
four<00:00:29.550> ounces

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
four ounces

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.650 
four ounces
I<00:00:31.460> thought<00:00:32.460> these<00:00:32.640> inserts<00:00:33.030> when<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> first<00:00:33.540> got

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
I thought these inserts when I first got

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.440 
I thought these inserts when I first got
it<00:00:33.870> would<00:00:33.989> help<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.350> grip<00:00:34.620> but<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:36.180> doesn't

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
it would help with grip but it doesn't

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.280 
it would help with grip but it doesn't
really<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.809> actually<00:00:36.899> makes<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.260> more

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
really it actually makes it more

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.880 
really it actually makes it more
slippery<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.219> that's<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.790> unfortunate<00:00:39.890> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
slippery so that's that's unfortunate it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.209 
slippery so that's that's unfortunate it
has<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.399> big<00:00:41.550> boss<00:00:41.730> finish<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.770> not<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
has the big boss finish it it's not a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.580 
has the big boss finish it it's not a
real<00:00:44.550> drag<00:00:44.940> wire<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.780> see<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.260> doesn't

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
real drag wire as you can see it doesn't

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.340 
real drag wire as you can see it doesn't
have<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.219> trademark<00:00:47.539> drag<00:00:48.539> wire<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.989> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
have the trademark drag wire on it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.189 
have the trademark drag wire on it
the<00:00:49.500> writing<00:00:49.890> or<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.309> little<00:00:50.789> jumping<00:00:51.719> cat

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
the writing or the little jumping cat

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.770 
the writing or the little jumping cat
the<00:00:55.199> latch<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.190> he<00:00:56.340> latch<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.940> wasn't<00:00:57.690> really

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the latch is it he latch I wasn't really

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.900 
the latch is it he latch I wasn't really
a<00:00:57.899> fan<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.859> decided<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.609> put<00:00:59.789> some

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
a fan of it so I decided to put some

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.010 
a fan of it so I decided to put some
electrical<00:01:00.329> tape<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:05.750> lot<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.869> leg

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
electrical tape on it and a lot of leg

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.260 
electrical tape on it and a lot of leg
play<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.470> here

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.350 

from<00:01:10.900> two<00:01:11.110> months<00:01:11.350> of<00:01:11.409> use<00:01:11.619> has<00:01:12.490> one<00:01:12.850> tank<00:01:13.119> pin

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
from two months of use has one tank pin

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.710 
from two months of use has one tank pin
and<00:01:13.630> uses<00:01:14.500> pin<00:01:14.740> construction<00:01:15.490> instead<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.180> the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
and uses pin construction instead of the

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.170 
and uses pin construction instead of the
screws<00:01:17.110> I<00:01:18.869> think<00:01:19.869> it's<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.110> really<00:01:20.500> good

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
screws I think it's a really good

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:33.450 
screws I think it's a really good
starter<00:01:22.180> knife<00:01:22.390> ooh<00:01:24.810> very<00:01:26.700> good<00:01:32.460> fines

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
starter knife ooh very good fines

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.050 
starter knife ooh very good fines
actually<00:01:33.909> starting<00:01:34.299> to<00:01:34.330> rust<00:01:35.549> well<00:01:36.549> I<00:01:36.759> don't

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
actually starting to rust well I don't

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.580 
actually starting to rust well I don't
think<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.360> would<00:01:37.509> be<00:01:37.720> able<00:01:37.929> to<00:01:38.020> see<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.289> but

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
think you would be able to see it but

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.230 
think you would be able to see it but
it's<00:01:38.740> starting<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.070> rest<00:01:39.310> so<00:01:39.880> I'm<00:01:40.090> going<00:01:40.210> to

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
it's starting to rest so I'm going to

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:50.070 
it's starting to rest so I'm going to
put<00:01:40.390> some<00:01:40.600> wd-40<00:01:41.200> on<00:01:41.380> there<00:01:41.590> something

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.090 

it's<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:51.370> good<00:01:51.700> starter<00:01:52.150> but<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.810> really<00:01:53.110> takes

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
it's a good starter but it really takes

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.680 
it's a good starter but it really takes
a<00:01:54.190> toll<00:01:54.430> when<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.850> hit<00:01:55.030> your<00:01:55.150> knuckles<00:01:55.510> with

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
a toll when you hit your knuckles with

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.800 
a toll when you hit your knuckles with
it<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.310> I've<00:01:57.310> noticed<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:57.970> pinches<00:01:58.360> you<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.540> lot

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
it and I've noticed it pinches you a lot

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.270 
it and I've noticed it pinches you a lot
and<00:01:59.050> it<00:01:59.980> became<00:02:00.460> really<00:02:00.700> sharp<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.710> I<00:02:02.740> like

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
and it became really sharp but I like

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.460 
and it became really sharp but I like
that<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.700> used<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.510> put<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.990> lot<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.230> short

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
that I used to put a lot of short

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.070 
that I used to put a lot of short
electrical<00:02:06.460> tape<00:02:06.670> on<00:02:06.820> here<00:02:07.120> but<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.750> got<00:02:07.840> kind

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
electrical tape on here but it got kind

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.590 
electrical tape on here but it got kind
of<00:02:08.140> annoying<00:02:08.820> because<00:02:09.820> it<00:02:10.150> would<00:02:10.240> always<00:02:10.360> wear

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
of annoying because it would always wear

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.590 
of annoying because it would always wear
out<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.640> yeah<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:13.500> don't<00:02:14.500> do<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.800> anymore

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
out so yeah I don't do that anymore

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.840 
out so yeah I don't do that anymore
but<00:02:16.600> I've<00:02:16.720> gotten<00:02:16.990> even<00:02:17.080> better<00:02:17.610> I'm<00:02:18.610> gonna

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
but I've gotten even better I'm gonna

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:28.560 
but I've gotten even better I'm gonna
cut<00:02:19.180> myself<00:02:25.530> that's<00:02:26.530> pretty<00:02:26.890> much<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.570> about

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
cut myself that's pretty much it about

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.230 
cut myself that's pretty much it about
this<00:02:28.750> knife<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:29.200> was<00:02:29.950> choosing<00:02:30.160> between<00:02:30.370> this

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
this knife I was choosing between this

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.490 
this knife I was choosing between this
Jaguar<00:02:32.140> deluxe<00:02:32.680> or<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:34.080> tank<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:37.720> chose<00:02:38.230> this

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
Jaguar deluxe or the tank I chose this

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.670 
Jaguar deluxe or the tank I chose this
because<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:40.270> wasn't<00:02:40.630> serrated<00:02:41.140> over<00:02:41.320> here<00:02:41.500> and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
because it wasn't serrated over here and

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.050 
because it wasn't serrated over here and
I'm<00:02:41.770> not<00:02:41.920> really<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.130> fan<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.400> serrations

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
I'm not really a fan of serrations

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.690 
I'm not really a fan of serrations
because<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.870> cut<00:02:44.620> my<00:02:44.710> hand<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.280> was<00:02:45.370> really

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
because I cut my hand and it was really

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.010 
because I cut my hand and it was really
bad<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.900> I've<00:02:47.620> decided<00:02:48.040> no<00:02:48.490> longer<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.880> get

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
bad so I've decided no longer to get

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.040 
bad so I've decided no longer to get
serrated<00:02:50.020> blade<00:02:50.670> nice<00:02:51.690> better<00:02:52.690> but<00:02:52.960> if<00:02:53.050> I<00:02:53.110> dice

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
serrated blade nice better but if I dice

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.630 
serrated blade nice better but if I dice
here's<00:02:56.050> one<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.410> have<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.739> serrated<00:02:59.640> Park

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
here's one that have that serrated Park
