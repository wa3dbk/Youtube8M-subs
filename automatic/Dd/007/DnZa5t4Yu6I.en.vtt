the purpose of the game is for the

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.810 
the purpose of the game is for the
player<00:00:10.270> to<00:00:10.300> solve<00:00:10.780> individual<00:00:11.469> rooms<00:00:11.820> these

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
player to solve individual rooms these

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.209 
player to solve individual rooms these
are<00:00:13.030> separate<00:00:13.450> problems<00:00:14.020> one<00:00:14.620> screen<00:00:14.980> at<00:00:15.129> a

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
are separate problems one screen at a

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.510 
are separate problems one screen at a
time<00:00:15.490> and<00:00:15.910> the<00:00:16.600> goal<00:00:16.810> at<00:00:17.110> each<00:00:17.350> screen<00:00:17.830> is<00:00:18.280> to

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
time and the goal at each screen is to

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.880 
time and the goal at each screen is to
get<00:00:18.670> fish<00:00:19.000> and<00:00:19.300> other<00:00:19.480> creatures<00:00:19.810> that<00:00:20.320> happen

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
get fish and other creatures that happen

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.730 
get fish and other creatures that happen
to<00:00:21.040> be<00:00:21.190> in<00:00:21.280> the<00:00:21.400> screen<00:00:21.700> out<00:00:22.090> of<00:00:22.120> the<00:00:22.300> room<00:00:22.740> as

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
to be in the screen out of the room as

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.220 
to be in the screen out of the room as
the<00:00:24.100> fish<00:00:24.340> have<00:00:24.640> no<00:00:24.820> arms<00:00:25.150> and<00:00:25.270> hands<00:00:25.480> they<00:00:26.170> can

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
the fish have no arms and hands they can

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.200 
the fish have no arms and hands they can
only<00:00:26.560> pick<00:00:26.890> and<00:00:27.100> push<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.520> obstacles<00:00:28.030> in

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
only pick and push the obstacles in

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.660 
only pick and push the obstacles in
their<00:00:28.360> path<00:00:29.040> therefore<00:00:30.040> they<00:00:30.310> have<00:00:30.490> to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
their path therefore they have to

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.910 
their path therefore they have to
cooperate<00:00:30.880> in<00:00:31.420> solving<00:00:31.840> the<00:00:31.960> rooms<00:00:32.169> for

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
cooperate in solving the rooms for

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.799 
cooperate in solving the rooms for
example<00:00:33.430> here<00:00:33.940> they<00:00:34.149> have<00:00:34.360> to<00:00:34.539> get<00:00:34.690> this

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
example here they have to get this

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.380 
example here they have to get this
hooked<00:00:35.110> item<00:00:35.559> above<00:00:35.770> the<00:00:35.950> water<00:00:36.160> line<00:00:36.460> they

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
hooked item above the water line they

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.330 
hooked item above the water line they
will<00:00:37.480> have<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:37.900> use<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.200> barrel<00:00:38.440> because<00:00:38.950> they

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
will have to use the barrel because they

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.810 
will have to use the barrel because they
themselves<00:00:39.630> cannot<00:00:40.630> break<00:00:40.900> the<00:00:41.050> water<00:00:41.200> level

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
themselves cannot break the water level

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.960 
themselves cannot break the water level
notice<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:42.940> big<00:00:43.120> steel<00:00:43.420> pole<00:00:43.750> here<00:00:44.700> only<00:00:45.700> the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
notice the big steel pole here only the

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.000 
notice the big steel pole here only the
big<00:00:46.150> fish<00:00:46.420> can<00:00:46.810> manipulate<00:00:47.079> these<00:00:47.590> types<00:00:47.890> of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
big fish can manipulate these types of

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.700 
big fish can manipulate these types of
items<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:49.210> this<00:00:49.420> is<00:00:49.600> how<00:00:49.750> the<00:00:49.810> abilities<00:00:50.440> of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
items and this is how the abilities of

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.710 
items and this is how the abilities of
the<00:00:50.920> individual<00:00:51.460> fish<00:00:51.790> complement<00:00:52.600> each

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
the individual fish complement each

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.500 
the individual fish complement each
other<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:54.100> small<00:00:54.430> fish<00:00:54.730> on<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.120> other<00:00:55.180> hand

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
other the small fish on the other hand

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.110 
other the small fish on the other hand
can<00:00:56.170> reach<00:00:56.200> regions<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.160> big<00:00:57.340> fish<00:00:57.670> cannot

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
can reach regions the big fish cannot

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.500 
can reach regions the big fish cannot
get<00:00:58.329> into<00:00:58.950> in<00:00:59.950> order<00:01:00.309> to<00:01:00.489> successfully<00:01:00.940> solve

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
get into in order to successfully solve

get into in order to successfully solve
the<00:01:01.660> puzzle<00:01:02.050> you<00:01:02.290> will<00:01:02.770> usually<00:01:03.010> have<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:03.640> use

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
the puzzle you will usually have to use

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.240 
the puzzle you will usually have to use
both<00:01:04.059> of<00:01:04.089> your<00:01:04.420> fish

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.130 

the<00:01:11.250> goal<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> some<00:01:11.939> rooms<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.930> free

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the goal of some rooms is not to free

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.170 
the goal of some rooms is not to free
the<00:01:13.289> fish<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.219> free<00:01:14.430> some<00:01:14.670> other<00:01:14.789> animal

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the fish but to free some other animal

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.859 
the fish but to free some other animal
for<00:01:15.930> example<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.100> crab<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
for example this little crab it is

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.919 
for example this little crab it is
necessary<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.500> think<00:01:19.829> ahead<00:01:20.060> for<00:01:21.060> example<00:01:21.570> now

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
necessary to think ahead for example now

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.340 
necessary to think ahead for example now
we<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.289> locked<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.829> way<00:01:22.979> out<00:01:23.990> because<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
we have locked the way out because the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.679 
we have locked the way out because the
big<00:01:25.530> fish<00:01:25.829> cannot<00:01:26.280> swim<00:01:26.579> here<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.090> cannot

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
big fish cannot swim here and cannot

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.559 
big fish cannot swim here and cannot
pick<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.350> steel<00:01:28.619> chest<00:01:29.149> well<00:01:30.149> we<00:01:30.299> can

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
pick up the steel chest well we can

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.490 
pick up the steel chest well we can
restart<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> room<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.929> little<00:01:34.259> fish

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
restart the room so the little fish

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.309 
restart the room so the little fish
cannot<00:01:34.979> swim<00:01:35.280> through<00:01:35.719> can't<00:01:36.719> move<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.020> chest

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
cannot swim through can't move the chest

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.050 
cannot swim through can't move the chest
so<00:01:37.950> she's<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.399> options

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
so she's out of options

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.320 
so she's out of options
we<00:01:39.299> tried<00:01:39.569> big<00:01:39.840> or<00:01:40.170> tried<00:01:40.469> small<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.789> the<00:01:42.209> only

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
we tried big or tried small so the only

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.539 
we tried big or tried small so the only
thing<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.959> do<00:01:43.110> now<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.649> try<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.039> item

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
thing we can do now is try this item

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.660 
thing we can do now is try this item
here<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:45.149> scope

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
here the scope

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
right here now the small fish can

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.720 
right here now the small fish can
prepare<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.020> for<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.320> big<00:02:20.500> fish<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.550> big
