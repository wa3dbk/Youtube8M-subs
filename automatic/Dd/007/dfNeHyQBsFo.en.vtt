percent of Asia's that aren't straight

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.490 
percent of Asia's that aren't straight
A's<00:03:02.489> all<00:03:02.819> right<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:03.900> one<00:03:04.139> time<00:03:04.170> this

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500

joven key hubby algebra 2 homework I'm

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.750 
joven key hubby algebra 2 homework I'm
in<00:03:12.090> geometry<00:03:12.680> but<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.739> thought<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.159> were<00:03:14.280> Asian

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
in geometry but I thought you were Asian

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.930 
in geometry but I thought you were Asian
yeah<00:03:15.510> then<00:03:16.049> what<00:03:16.230> are<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.879> I'm<00:03:17.879> filipina<00:03:18.599> oh

first<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.769> all<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:29.699> Philippines<00:03:30.299> made<00:03:30.629> me<00:03:30.780> a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
first of all the Philippines made me a

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.080 
first of all the Philippines made me a
small<00:03:31.079> island<00:03:31.290> but<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.159> is<00:03:32.280> located<00:03:32.849> on<00:03:33.000> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
small island but it is located on the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.039 
small island but it is located on the
continent<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:34.019> Asia<00:03:34.470> okay<00:03:35.750> being<00:03:36.750> on<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
continent of Asia okay being on the

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.449 
continent of Asia okay being on the
constant<00:03:37.530> of<00:03:37.560> Asia<00:03:37.829> means<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:38.930> am<00:03:40.099> asian<00:03:41.099> okay

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
constant of Asia means I am asian okay

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.149 
constant of Asia means I am asian okay
Filipinos<00:03:42.209> are<00:03:42.449> Asian<00:03:43.109> all<00:03:43.290> right<00:03:43.409> no<00:03:43.919> I<00:03:43.949> know

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
Filipinos are Asian all right no I know

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.979 
Filipinos are Asian all right no I know
understand<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:45.209> when<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.629> get<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.870> high

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
understand is when you get to high

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.159 
understand is when you get to high
school<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.680> do<00:03:46.829> your<00:03:46.979> algebra<00:03:47.310> one<00:03:47.669> right

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
school you do your algebra one right

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.770 
school you do your algebra one right
well<00:03:49.169> if<00:03:49.440> you're<00:03:49.709> dumb<00:03:50.669> like<00:03:50.909> me<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.599> get

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
well if you're dumb like me you get

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.080 
well if you're dumb like me you get
stuck<00:03:52.079> in<00:03:52.199> algebra<00:03:52.560> war<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:53.220> your<00:03:53.370> algebra<00:03:53.760> 1

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
stuck in algebra war so your algebra 1

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.659 
stuck in algebra war so your algebra 1
then<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.930> go<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.109> geometry<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.889> then<00:03:56.430> it's

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
then you go to geometry and then it's

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.170 
then you go to geometry and then it's
algebra<00:03:56.819> to<00:03:57.299> come<00:03:58.109> on<00:03:58.319> really<00:03:58.680> geometry<00:03:59.549> why

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
algebra to come on really geometry why

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.399 
algebra to come on really geometry why
is<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.510> haven't<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.840> have<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.079> cut<00:04:01.290> in

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
is you haven't you have to cut in

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.339 
is you haven't you have to cut in
between<00:04:01.530> algebra<00:04:02.280> 1<00:04:02.489> algebra<00:04:03.030> two<00:04:03.269> shanbe<00:04:04.019> is

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
between algebra 1 algebra two shanbe is

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.050 
between algebra 1 algebra two shanbe is
12<00:04:04.919> why<00:04:05.250> do<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.340> have<00:04:05.459> to<00:04:05.549> go<00:04:05.669> through<00:04:05.879> algebra

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
12 why do you have to go through algebra

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.629 
12 why do you have to go through algebra
1<00:04:06.510> forget<00:04:07.379> everything<00:04:07.500> how's<00:04:07.889> your<00:04:08.129> one<00:04:08.310> then

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
1 forget everything how's your one then

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.520 
1 forget everything how's your one then
go<00:04:08.819> geometry<00:04:09.389> then<00:04:09.900> once<00:04:10.109> you<00:04:10.229> forgot

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
go geometry then once you forgot

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.469 
go geometry then once you forgot
everything<00:04:10.859> about<00:04:11.159> algebra<00:04:11.519> they<00:04:12.060> put<00:04:12.269> you<00:04:12.419> in

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479 
everything about algebra they put you in

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:16.670 
everything about algebra they put you in
algebra<00:04:12.959> two<00:04:14.120> really<00:04:15.120> it's<00:04:16.019> not<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.229> hard

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
algebra two really it's not that hard

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.860 
algebra two really it's not that hard
just<00:04:16.859> put<00:04:17.220> us<00:04:17.310> in<00:04:17.400> algebra<00:04:17.880> 2<00:04:18.120> i'm<00:04:18.359> sure<00:04:18.630> it's

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
just put us in algebra 2 i'm sure it's

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.920 
just put us in algebra 2 i'm sure it's
the<00:04:19.049> same<00:04:19.079> kind<00:04:19.349> of<00:04:19.799> stuff<00:04:20.099> okay<00:04:20.849> so<00:04:20.909> 13<00:04:21.659> that

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
the same kind of stuff okay so 13 that

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.800 
the same kind of stuff okay so 13 that
pissed<00:04:22.380> me<00:04:22.469> off<00:04:22.560> about<00:04:22.770> school

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
pissed me off about school

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.220 
pissed me off about school
created<00:04:24.800> is<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.400> oh<00:04:25.550> cool<00:04:26.060> now<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:26.630> can<00:04:26.900> decide

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
created is the oh cool now I can decide

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.580 
created is the oh cool now I can decide
what<00:04:27.440> I'm<00:04:27.500> gonna<00:04:27.620> be<00:04:27.919> when<00:04:28.160> I<00:04:28.190> grow<00:04:28.460> up<00:04:28.490> right

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
well this year we didn't even get to

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.820 
well this year we didn't even get to
choose<00:04:33.500> our<00:04:33.980> classes<00:04:34.820> for<00:04:35.000> creative<00:04:35.450> so
