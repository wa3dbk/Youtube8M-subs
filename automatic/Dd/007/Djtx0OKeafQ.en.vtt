expensive but it's the best quality in

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.789 
expensive but it's the best quality in
my<00:01:12.360> opinion<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.930> one<00:01:13.080> hundred<00:01:13.140> percent<00:01:13.320> pure

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
my opinion it's one hundred percent pure

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.609 
my opinion it's one hundred percent pure
whey<00:01:14.070> protein<00:01:14.580> there's<00:01:14.760> no<00:01:14.909> uh<00:01:15.470> sunflower<00:01:16.470> or

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
whey protein there's no uh sunflower or

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.039 
whey protein there's no uh sunflower or
soy<00:01:16.860> lecithin<00:01:17.130> which<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.540> not<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> deal<00:01:19.020> breaker

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
soy lecithin which is not a deal breaker

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.630 
soy lecithin which is not a deal breaker
but<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.680> because<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.040> usually<00:01:20.189> less<00:01:20.610> than

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
but it because it's usually less than

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.840 
but it because it's usually less than
one<00:01:20.909> percent<00:01:21.270> per<00:01:21.420> volume<00:01:21.630> anyways<00:01:22.520> but<00:01:23.520> i

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
one percent per volume anyways but i

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.609 
one percent per volume anyways but i
guess<00:01:24.299> there's<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> pure<00:01:24.869> stuff<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.320> highest

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
guess there's the pure stuff the highest

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
guess there's the pure stuff the highest
concentrated<00:01:26.400> protein<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.939> i've<00:01:27.060> seen<00:01:27.090> for

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
concentrated protein that i've seen for

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.210 
concentrated protein that i've seen for
a<00:01:27.540> whey<00:01:27.720> protein<00:01:28.140> concentrate<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.070> from

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
a whey protein concentrate and it's from

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.730 
a whey protein concentrate and it's from
all<00:01:29.430> natural<00:01:29.640> grass<00:01:30.090> fed<00:01:30.390> cows<00:01:30.659> most<00:01:31.530> whey

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
final product is uh is a process this is

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.920 
final product is uh is a process this is

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
cold filtered from cold process so it's

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.340 
cold filtered from cold process so it's
not<00:01:46.079> bleach<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.680> not<00:01:46.860> acid<00:01:47.240> treated<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:49.200> none

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
not bleach it's not acid treated so none

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the immuno growth factors there you go

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.889 
the immuno growth factors there you go
so<00:02:07.110> that's<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:08.330> another<00:02:09.330> product<00:02:09.629> i<00:02:09.869> use

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
so that's in that another product i use

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.970 
so that's in that another product i use
is<00:02:10.640> true<00:02:11.640> athlete<00:02:12.360> all-natural<00:02:13.290> again

private-label<00:02:18.030> whey<00:02:18.390> protein<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.769> is<00:02:22.040> about

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
private-label whey protein this is about

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.089 
private-label whey protein this is about
seventy<00:02:23.519> seven<00:02:23.849> percent<00:02:24.269> whey<00:02:24.450> protein<00:02:25.099> per

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
seventy seven percent whey protein per

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.490 
seventy seven percent whey protein per
serving<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:26.849> it's<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.780> little<00:02:28.019> low<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
serving and it's a little low and the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.470 
serving and it's a little low and the
reason<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:29.040> because<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.849> whey<00:02:30.030> protein

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
reason is because it is a whey protein

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.539 
reason is because it is a whey protein
concentrate<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:31.319> it's<00:02:31.500> also<00:02:31.709> vanilla<00:02:32.190> flavor

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
concentrate but it's also vanilla flavor

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.839 
concentrate but it's also vanilla flavor
and<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.569> has<00:02:33.780> probiotics<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.340> lactase

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
and it has probiotics and the lactase

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.559 
and it has probiotics and the lactase
enzyme<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:37.080> digest<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> lactose<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:39.090> for<00:02:39.390> some

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
enzyme to digest the lactose so for some

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.350 
enzyme to digest the lactose so for some
people<00:02:39.599> that<00:02:40.349> are<00:02:40.769> lactose<00:02:41.220> intolerant<00:02:41.579> this

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
people that are lactose intolerant this

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.420 
people that are lactose intolerant this
will<00:02:42.540> help<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.959> this<00:02:43.709> will<00:02:43.860> pass<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.310> other

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
will help and this will pass to other

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.199 
will help and this will pass to other
enzymes<00:02:44.819> so<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.980> does<00:02:47.220> make<00:02:47.250> when<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.180> a

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
enzymes so it does make when you have a

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.089 
enzymes so it does make when you have a
lot<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.390> protein<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.230> does<00:02:49.440> make<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.799> easier<00:02:49.920> to

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
lot of protein it does make it easier to

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.890 
lot of protein it does make it easier to
digest<00:02:50.430> some<00:02:51.180> people<00:02:51.480> even<00:02:51.540> though<00:02:51.750> they're

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
digest some people even though they're

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.569 
digest some people even though they're
not<00:02:51.930> lactose<00:02:52.470> intolerant<00:02:53.010> they<00:02:53.129> might<00:02:53.310> just

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
not lactose intolerant they might just

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.670 
not lactose intolerant they might just
have<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.790> hard<00:02:54.000> time<00:02:54.299> consuming<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.379> lot<00:02:55.530> of

have a hard time consuming a lot of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.220 
have a hard time consuming a lot of
protein<00:02:56.510> this<00:02:57.510> shake<00:02:57.750> right<00:02:57.900> here<00:02:58.079> is<00:02:58.140> going

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
protein this shake right here is going

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.410 
protein this shake right here is going
to<00:02:58.290> be<00:02:58.379> about<00:02:58.470> 45<00:02:58.920> grams<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.609> whey<00:02:59.730> protein<00:03:00.239> so

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
to be about 45 grams of whey protein so

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.770 
to be about 45 grams of whey protein so
this<00:03:00.599> is<00:03:00.750> 20<00:03:01.109> grams<00:03:01.799> a<00:03:02.160> whey<00:03:02.940> protein<00:03:03.420> per

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
this is 20 grams a whey protein per

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.830 
this is 20 grams a whey protein per
serving<00:03:03.810> The<00:03:04.709> Naked<00:03:04.920> way<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.430> 25<00:03:06.000> grams<00:03:06.329> so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
serving The Naked way is 25 grams so

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.199
