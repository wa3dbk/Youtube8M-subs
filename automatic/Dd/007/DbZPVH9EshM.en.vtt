00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.250
 I think it must be something constructive 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.110
 I said I told you my experience 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.270
 from the first moment until the day of 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.849
 today since we started designing a 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.220
 engine until the test was finished 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.460
 of two vehicles with many thousands of 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.539
 kilometers each without problems without 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.340
 wear while maintaining the power to 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.550
 through all the mileage of the car 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.230
 I have great respect for the work of the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.620
 original cylinder layer that they extracted 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.750
 here that although we have it in 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.140
 we have modified it in a certain sense 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.870
 enough in the fundamental parts 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.020
 for the life of the cap really does not 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.480
 we have touched to have a parameter by 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.640
 well call it how much it can help that those 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.129
 bikers bring the current engines 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.170
 in the next few days I think they were left 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.180
 an agreement on that that's what you 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.520
 we ask to know a bit what they are 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.110
 the differences between brand and brand and 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.229
 finish us to subtract some 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.570
 parameters at least to say 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.640
 theoretically we started with engines that 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.250
 they work although they are 23 motorcycles 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.979
 different and possibly a fourth 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.990
 version although it would be possible that 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.350
 let's make a version for 2 of a 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.200
 version for the torino but we have to 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.250
 know what are the basics of 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.759
 do different things is to have a 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.950
 career bring a typical good engine of 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.420
 each of the brands know us 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.759
 what are the differences and try to 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.590
 incorporate that difference as a point 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.430
 initial of what you are going to do all 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.110
 the presidents voluntarily because 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.530
 it seems to me that the work he is 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.530
 doing 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.510
 it's very interesting and you need to have the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.510
 the support of our and know the 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.480
 truth of everything in this area in 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.820
 this environment is sometimes a bit 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.010
 complicated everyone wants to save something 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.200
 true and then problems appear 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.780
 that appear those were one of the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.150
 first 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.420
 in offering to bring the car because 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.880
 I think we got a car 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.290
 each brand we will clarify many 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.300
 things open for him to follow 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.340
 working on the engine in principle the 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.970
 closed motors sealed by three 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.130
 racing is fine 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.380
 look there are a lot of new things that 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.380
 Must see 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.310
 me from the top part deciding all that 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.430
 maybe and from the bottom of the engine 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.400
 I would like to review it but well, that's 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.580
 very things for the future to discuss and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.099
 to take into account very in the future 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.900
 I believe that avoiding breakage is what 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.090
 main and good is what you have to 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.370
 do how much work changes to 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.670
 you do not know if the race but still 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.950
 during the week in the previous good 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.530
 everything will depend if the engines are going to 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.200
 associate more unarmed people I think 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.480
 which is engines that out there 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.390
 and they should be reviewed the entire race 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.650
 and well, they will be organized. 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.049
 is going to do with cylinder caps 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.030
 but maybe we have less work but 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.459
 equal to work we will not miss there 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.830
 that put together the engines 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.170
 and that's work so I think it's going to 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.780
 follow everything if it's not very similar 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.510
 in the sunset for 2015 is already 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.980
 confirmed without continuing bets for 2015 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.349
 the effort that has been made is much 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.079
 we have to continue manufacturing in 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:41.290
 thirsty other elements all these 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:46.540
 spare parts of cams cylinder covers 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:50.940
 of valves multiple springs carter de 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.650
 all this that make it so 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.290
 numerical so that everyone that 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.450
 have a problem come and get 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.970
 the element of spare parts all this without 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.730
 make it so once we have 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.410
 finished the development you have to 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.959
 implement contracts with 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.360
 suppliers delivery times for 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.860
 be able to launch the category at first 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.319
 instance the road tourism for 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.540
 that later the others follow 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.540
 but the project is to start
