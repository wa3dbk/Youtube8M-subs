really doing I think I'll try using that
by<00:05:15.100> itself<00:05:15.640> after<00:05:16.360> I<00:05:16.419> do<00:05:16.480> my<00:05:16.600> co<00:05:16.960> wash<00:05:17.260> i'll<00:05:18.190> use

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.100 
by itself after I do my co wash i'll use
the<00:05:18.790> conditioner<00:05:19.390> instead<00:05:19.660> of<00:05:19.750> putting<00:05:20.020> on

styling gel with the soy try wheat
leaving<00:05:29.229> conditioner<00:05:29.380> I<00:05:30.040> think<00:05:30.820> with<00:05:31.650> the

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
leaving conditioner I think with the

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.610 
leaving conditioner I think with the
shea<00:05:32.979> butter<00:05:33.010> and<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:34.750> styling<00:05:35.380> gel

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
shea butter and the styling gel

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.920 
shea butter and the styling gel
combination<00:05:38.940> that's<00:05:39.940> what<00:05:40.180> makes<00:05:40.390> that<00:05:40.570> flake

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
combination that's what makes that flake

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.230 
combination that's what makes that flake
itch<00:05:41.169> and<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:41.950> think<00:05:42.190> that's<00:05:42.370> what<00:05:42.580> happened<00:05:42.729> so

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
itch and I think that's what happened so

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.640 
itch and I think that's what happened so
maybe<00:05:43.510> if<00:05:43.630> I<00:05:43.720> use<00:05:43.930> more<00:05:44.229> of<00:05:44.260> a<00:05:44.410> clear

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
maybe if I use more of a clear

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.040 
maybe if I use more of a clear
conditioner<00:05:45.250> or<00:05:45.400> work<00:05:45.610> out<00:05:45.790> properly<00:05:46.210> but<00:05:47.020> I

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
conditioner or work out properly but I

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
conditioner or work out properly but I
