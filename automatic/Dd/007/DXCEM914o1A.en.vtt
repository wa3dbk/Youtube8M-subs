parts<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.099> video<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.090> part

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
parts to this video is going to be part

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.010 
parts to this video is going to be part
1<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.000> first<00:00:36.180> thing<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.870> is

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
1 so the first thing you have to do is

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.850 
1 so the first thing you have to do is
you<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.620> find<00:00:37.980> your<00:00:38.129> pattern<00:00:38.579> print<00:00:39.540> it

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
you have to find your pattern print it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.299 
you have to find your pattern print it
copy<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.550> printer<00:00:41.940> or<00:00:42.180> wherever<00:00:42.480> and

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
copy it on the printer or wherever and

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.380 
copy it on the printer or wherever and
take<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> pattern<00:00:45.329> that

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
take it out so you have a pattern that

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.279 
take it out so you have a pattern that
looks<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:47.539> then<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.750> next<00:00:48.899> thing<00:00:49.079> you

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
looks like this then the next thing you

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.900 
looks like this then the next thing you
want<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.649> there's<00:00:49.860> two<00:00:50.100> ways<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.579> do

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
want to do there's two ways you can do

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.720 
want to do there's two ways you can do
it<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.480> either<00:00:51.719> sit<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.550> cut<00:00:53.550> out<00:00:53.699> all

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it you can either sit and cut out all

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.000 
it you can either sit and cut out all
these<00:00:54.149> pieces<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.820> trace<00:00:56.820> them<00:00:57.030> or<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.800> can

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
these pieces and trace them or you can

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.869 
these pieces and trace them or you can
use<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.460> light<00:00:59.699> box<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.920> for<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> lightbox<00:01:02.370> you

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
use a light box and for a lightbox you

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.289 
use a light box and for a lightbox you
just<00:01:03.210> take<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.629> pattern<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.909> you<00:01:05.909> sit<00:01:06.180> it

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
just take your pattern and you sit it

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.800 
just take your pattern and you sit it
the<00:01:07.080> piece<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.619> want<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.450> pick<00:01:09.450> out<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the piece that you want and pick out the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.990 
the piece that you want and pick out the
color<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.770> now<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.159> case<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
color and now in this case I'm going to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000 
color and now in this case I'm going to
trace<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.450> star<00:01:12.780> I've<00:01:13.080> pre<00:01:13.500> done<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> lot<00:01:13.979> of

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
trace the star I've pre done a lot of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.870 
trace the star I've pre done a lot of
these<00:01:14.189> pieces<00:01:14.490> already<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.310> take<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
these pieces already so you take the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.020 
these pieces already so you take the
star<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.979> see<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.520> don't<00:01:20.580> know<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:20.850> you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
star and I can see I don't know if you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.120 
star and I can see I don't know if you
guys<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.710> pattern

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
guys can but I can see the pattern

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.730 
guys can but I can see the pattern
through<00:01:23.520> my<00:01:23.700> yellow<00:01:23.970> paper<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.250> take

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
through my yellow paper so then I take

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.179 
through my yellow paper so then I take
my<00:01:28.740> pen<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:30.290> I<00:01:31.290> trace<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:33.770> now<00:01:34.770> they<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.040> have

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
my pen and I trace it now they do have

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.499 
my pen and I trace it now they do have
these<00:01:35.340> nice<00:01:35.640> big<00:01:36.740> full-size<00:01:37.740> page<00:01:38.509> lightboxes

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
these nice big full-size page lightboxes

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.620 
these nice big full-size page lightboxes
my<00:01:39.750> mom<00:01:39.960> has<00:01:40.200> one<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.740> want<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.670> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
my mom has one I want to get one that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.719 
my mom has one I want to get one that
you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:43.049> use<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.520> when<00:01:44.610> you're

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
you can use for this so that when you're

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.609 
you can use for this so that when you're
done<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.240> your<00:01:45.479> patterns<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.350> that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
done you have your patterns like that

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.330 
done you have your patterns like that
now<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.509> had<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.750> use<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> darker<00:01:49.590> color<00:01:49.860> say

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
now if you had to use a darker color say

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.260 
now if you had to use a darker color say
like<00:01:50.520> black<00:01:50.880> or<00:01:51.470> dark<00:01:52.470> brown<00:01:52.729> you<00:01:53.729> can't<00:01:54.000> see

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
like black or dark brown you can't see

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.940 
like black or dark brown you can't see
them<00:01:54.450> through<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> light<00:01:54.990> box<00:01:55.200> unless<00:01:55.619> you

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
them through the light box unless you

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.010 
them through the light box unless you
buy<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.189> ones<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.850> think<00:01:57.180> they're<00:01:57.509> from<00:01:57.719> close

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
buy the ones I think they're from close

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
buy the ones I think they're from close
to<00:01:58.049> my<00:01:58.290> heart's<00:01:59.060> they<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.360> white<00:02:01.670> the

something that's in black or bro
round<00:02:13.049> I<00:02:13.319> end<00:02:14.189> up<00:02:14.370> cutting<00:02:15.120> out<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.530> piece<00:02:16.769> and

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
I've already currently done this so we

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.420

don't<00:02:24.090> have<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.450> cut<00:02:24.599> out<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.750> pieces<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:26.220> this

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
don't have to cut out the pieces so this

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.209 
don't have to cut out the pieces so this
is<00:02:26.579> the<00:02:26.730> end<00:02:26.939> of<00:02:28.040> paper<00:02:29.040> piecing<00:02:29.609> part<00:02:29.939> 1
