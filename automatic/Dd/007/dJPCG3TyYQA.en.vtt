00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
coolest thing about this system is that

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.480 
coolest thing about this system is that
drivers<00:03:07.140> can<00:03:07.260> adjust<00:03:07.590> acceleration<00:03:08.280> for

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
and I should say that we here at FLD do

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.840 
and I should say that we here at FLD do
