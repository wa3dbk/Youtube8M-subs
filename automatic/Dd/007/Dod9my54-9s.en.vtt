hello<00:00:05.730> guys<00:00:05.940> on<00:00:06.150> minecraft<00:00:06.569> dummies<00:00:06.960> and

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
hello guys on minecraft dummies and

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.839 
hello guys on minecraft dummies and
today<00:00:07.470> I've<00:00:07.680> got<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.919> new<00:00:07.950> little<00:00:08.460> invention

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
today I've got a new little invention

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.749 
today I've got a new little invention
for<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.870> generally<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.980> normal<00:00:11.519> bring

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
for you so generally in a normal bring

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.280 
for you so generally in a normal bring
room<00:00:11.969> like<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.630> have<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.019> get<00:00:13.200> your

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
room like this you have to get your

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.770 
room like this you have to get your
glass<00:00:13.500> bottles<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.370> then<00:00:14.730> just<00:00:15.000> get<00:00:15.690> you

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
glass bottles and then just get you

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.330 
glass bottles and then just get you
three<00:00:16.080> bits<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.590> water<00:00:16.710> out<00:00:17.010> from<00:00:17.220> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
three bits of water out from the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.450 
three bits of water out from the
cauldron<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.000> usually<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.560> water<00:00:20.100> would<00:00:20.369> all

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
cauldron and usually the water would all

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.679 
cauldron and usually the water would all
be<00:00:20.550> gone<00:00:20.699> but<00:00:20.939> with<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.300> little<00:00:21.480> invention

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
be gone but with this little invention

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.109 
be gone but with this little invention
the<00:00:22.199> wall<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.619> actually<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.130> comes<00:00:23.789> back<00:00:23.880> in

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the wall so actually just comes back in

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.730 
the wall so actually just comes back in
front<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.140> fill<00:00:25.470> up<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
front of you and you can fill up the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.550 
front of you and you can fill up the
other<00:00:25.769> three<00:00:26.750> and<00:00:27.750> then<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> water<00:00:28.470> will

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
other three and then the water will

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.089 
other three and then the water will
appear<00:00:28.830> again<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> very<00:00:31.710> simple

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
appear again so this is a very simple

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.060 
appear again so this is a very simple
concept<00:00:32.279> basically<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.800> block<00:00:34.800> swapper

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
concept basically it is a block swapper

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.389 
concept basically it is a block swapper
down<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> bottom<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.270> piston<00:00:36.989> reel<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
down the bottom and a piston reel so the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.910 
down the bottom and a piston reel so the
piston<00:00:39.090> reel<00:00:39.270> takes<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.809> cauldrons<00:00:40.530> round<00:00:40.770> in

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
piston reel takes the cauldrons round in

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.520 
piston reel takes the cauldrons round in
a<00:00:40.980> circle<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.270> one's<00:00:42.450> only<00:00:42.629> got<00:00:42.750> five<00:00:43.320> in

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
a circle so this one's only got five in

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.790 
a circle so this one's only got five in
use<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.520> could<00:00:44.670> extend<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.870> however

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
use but you could extend it to however

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.190 
use but you could extend it to however
many<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.039> want<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:48.020> basically<00:00:49.020> this

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
many you want really so basically this

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.639 
many you want really so basically this
one<00:00:49.379> uses<00:00:49.620> five<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.100> said<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.460> then<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
one uses five as I said and then the

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.080 
one uses five as I said and then the
when<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> detects<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.520> cauldron<00:00:54.000> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
when it detects that the cauldron is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.869 
when it detects that the cauldron is
empty<00:00:54.449> using<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> comparator<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.730> signal<00:00:56.730> pulse

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
empty using a comparator a signal pulse

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.410 
empty using a comparator a signal pulse
will<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.469> caused<00:00:58.469> which<00:00:58.739> will<00:00:58.890> basically

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
will be caused which will basically

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.360 
will be caused which will basically
retract<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.629> empty<00:01:01.590> cauldron<00:01:02.010> down<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
retract that empty cauldron down to the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.979 
retract that empty cauldron down to the
bottom<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> piston<00:01:03.449> reel<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.809> get<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
bottom see the piston reel so you get a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.770 
bottom see the piston reel so you get a
fill<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:05.100> one<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:06.000> put<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> back<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
fill for one and then put it back to the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.380 
fill for one and then put it back to the
top<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.229> use<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> again<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:09.090> idea

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
top so you can use it again and the idea

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.850 
top so you can use it again and the idea
behind<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.900> well<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.680> go

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
behind this as well is so you can go

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.710 
behind this as well is so you can go
down<00:01:11.040> through<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> little<00:01:12.060> trapdoor<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.630> if

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
down through a little trapdoor and if

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.480 
down through a little trapdoor and if
you<00:01:12.810> wanted<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.920> could<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.369> your

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
you wanted to you could just get your

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.179 
you wanted to you could just get your
water<00:01:14.640> bucket<00:01:14.850> out<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.590> fill<00:01:17.070> up

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
water bucket out and then just fill up

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.890 
water bucket out and then just fill up
the<00:01:17.220> ones<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.909> you've<00:01:18.000> used<00:01:18.240> before<00:01:18.570> just

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the ones that you've used before just

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.649 
the ones that you've used before just
from<00:01:19.350> under<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:20.060> sadly<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.150> not<00:01:21.180> totally

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
from under here sadly it's not totally

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.940 
from under here sadly it's not totally
infinite<00:01:22.020> because<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.500> can't<00:01:22.710> use<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
infinite because you can't use a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.740 
infinite because you can't use a
dispenser<00:01:23.700> or<00:01:23.759> anything<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.180> fill<00:01:24.479> up<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
dispenser or anything to fill up the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.870 
dispenser or anything to fill up the
cauldrons<00:01:25.740> again<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.610> that'd<00:01:26.759> be

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
cauldrons again but I think that'd be

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.840 
cauldrons again but I think that'd be
really<00:01:27.150> cool<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.600> could<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.850> certainly

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
really cool if you could but certainly

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.090 
really cool if you could but certainly
for<00:01:30.000> now<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> best<00:01:31.590> way<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.770> filling

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
for now this is the best way of filling

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.740 
for now this is the best way of filling
up<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> cauldrons<00:01:32.640> again<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> guess<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.720> this

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
up the cauldrons again I guess so this

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.840 
up the cauldrons again I guess so this
is<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.170> nice<00:01:34.320> high-tech<00:01:34.799> way<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> jazz<00:01:35.700> up

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
is just a nice high-tech way to jazz up

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.060 
is just a nice high-tech way to jazz up
your<00:01:35.960> bring<00:01:36.960> room<00:01:37.200> now<00:01:37.409> there's<00:01:37.650> not<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
your bring room now there's not going to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.280 
your bring room now there's not going to
be<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.189> tutorial<00:01:38.579> because<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.360> think<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:40.110> could

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
be a tutorial because I think this could

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.749 
be a tutorial because I think this could
might<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.680> made<00:01:40.860> quite<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> lot<00:01:41.369> smaller<00:01:41.640> like

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
might be made quite a lot smaller like

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.730 
might be made quite a lot smaller like
as<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.090> actually<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.630> little<00:01:43.229> bit<00:01:43.409> bulkier

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
as it is actually a little bit bulkier

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.350 
as it is actually a little bit bulkier
than<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.979> had<00:01:44.100> hoped<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.909> would<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.180> at<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
than I had hoped it would be at the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.499 
than I had hoped it would be at the
start<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.549> also<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> timings<00:01:48.240> aren't

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
start and also the timings aren't

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.300 
start and also the timings aren't
perfected<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.290> see<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.100> just

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
perfected as you can see like if I just

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.380 
perfected as you can see like if I just
do<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:50.689> you'll<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
do this now you'll see that the the the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.789 
do this now you'll see that the the the
fresh<00:01:54.780> ones<00:01:54.990> actually<00:01:55.229> sitting<00:01:55.470> there<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
fresh ones actually sitting there for a

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.780 
fresh ones actually sitting there for a
little<00:01:55.890> bit<00:01:55.979> longer<00:01:56.189> than<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.430> would<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.670> it

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
little bit longer than I would like it
