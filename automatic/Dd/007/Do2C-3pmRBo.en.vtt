00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.480
 he is my friend 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.109
 with him 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.560
 these articles 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 Strauss-Kahn 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.210
 thomas zerbini tighazoui 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.400
 so obviously the sea version here is that compared to most 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.550
 the old version 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.239
 we had very very little praline and whose war on an imbalance we have 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.480
 the impression of being aware of the field because 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.710
 stubborn you were not the first but m 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.810
 at half-time away but it was the same here I think he's got us 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.089
 balanced this leukemia 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:44.280
 a third it took at least that 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.010
 to get to have a thing that is very balanced storing the report 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.410
 very freshly case for example of praline will not return to the case 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.070
 salted butter caramel 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.280
 and it is still the liquid caramel I find it quite interesting 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.340
 like a left calf here not so his side a stretcher 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.040
 who are these works 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.770
 see you soon 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.300
 and in addition to May 25 and then I had the saleh pressure discarded any withdrawal 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.369
 precipitate 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.369
 and we feel that he has a lot of lightness in 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.600
 for me the revisited ball of the house marcolini was what logo of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.630
 week this case a product that makes 7 grams a product for ammann at 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.410
 dropper my book the sugar on buckle side quarter the side a whole 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.550
 little sticky light cream 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.280
 and some notes of -7 the only thing that we even added is that 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.050
 when we think carefully we added chocolate because their true 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.650
 manon bernard paragraph 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.240
 here is the basic idea kim seduced as we wanted to revisit the masne 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.630
 how one can deposit at home the probability of thesis a gram 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.520
 I really liked to do this I think it's really a wink 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.219
 canton 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.900
 yet today 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.510
 we have a role to touch them all as citizens of the same for 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.479
 chocolatiers 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.909
 to touch them club by the fact that for today bailly has no 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.099
 government and all the time sometimes down 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.670
 and at the key of products or there is the history of some belgitude and 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.849
 germany formed a well done it's no worse and that's round 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.389
 the tone in relation to that is why we could say that we want I am for 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.149
 mark her 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:30.529
 like that people will call themselves will question themselves by putting in the bottom 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:34.459
 what is the Belgian flag and then when they will discover the variant of 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.709
 of manon that we realized there the belgitude the dance of a single 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:38.219
 small box
