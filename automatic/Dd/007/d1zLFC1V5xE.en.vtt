I'm gonna sand them and I'm gonna try
straighten<00:01:10.460> out<00:01:10.580> as<00:01:10.670> much<00:01:10.820> as<00:01:11.000> possible<00:01:12.759> the

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
straighten out as much as possible the

bottom<00:01:14.810> part<00:01:15.080> here<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:15.950> can<00:01:16.130> see<00:01:16.399> where<00:01:17.330> they

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
bottom part here you can see where they

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.169 
bottom part here you can see where they
started<00:01:17.810> here<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:18.770> braised<00:01:19.550> in<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:19.909> patch<00:01:22.179> up

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
started here and braised in a patch up

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.070 
started here and braised in a patch up
to<00:01:23.390> here<00:01:23.720> no<00:01:24.850> it's<00:01:25.850> relatively<00:01:26.330> rust<00:01:26.539> free<00:01:26.810> but

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
to here no it's relatively rust free but

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.600 
to here no it's relatively rust free but
I<00:01:27.350> don't<00:01:27.649> know<00:01:27.830> if<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:27.950> can<00:01:28.039> watch<00:01:28.190> my<00:01:28.369> finger

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
I don't know if you can watch my finger

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.309 
I don't know if you can watch my finger
there's<00:01:31.610> a<00:01:31.759> valley<00:01:32.030> here<00:01:32.390> there's<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.110> valley

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
there's a valley here there's a valley

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.389 
there's a valley here there's a valley
all<00:01:33.530> on<00:01:33.679> the<00:01:33.830> Braves<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:35.990> this<00:01:36.710> is<00:01:36.890> kind<00:01:37.340> of

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
all on the Braves and it this is kind of

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.850 
all on the Braves and it this is kind of
shallow<00:01:37.670> down<00:01:38.000> here<00:01:38.270> it's<00:01:38.869> just<00:01:39.200> kind<00:01:39.829> of

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
shallow down here it's just kind of

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.830 
shallow down here it's just kind of
shallow<00:01:40.130> down<00:01:40.430> here<00:01:43.270> so<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.329> don't<00:01:44.390> know<00:01:44.509> it's

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
shallow down here so I don't know it's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.800 
shallow down here so I don't know it's
rough<00:01:45.020> free<00:01:46.270> but<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:48.500> it's<00:01:48.680> braised<00:01:48.979> in<00:01:49.810> but

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
rough free but and it's braised in but

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:59.469 
rough free but and it's braised in but
it's<00:01:51.110> very<00:01:51.380> poorly<00:01:55.780> aligned<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:57.079> guess<00:01:57.939> so<00:01:58.969> do<00:01:59.390> I

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
it's very poorly aligned I guess so do I

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.209 
it's very poorly aligned I guess so do I
cut<00:01:59.689> that<00:01:59.840> out<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:00.140> put<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.350> new<00:02:00.409> piece<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:01.009> I

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
cut that out and put a new piece in I

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.630 
cut that out and put a new piece in I
can<00:02:01.789> get<00:02:01.909> a<00:02:01.939> lower<00:02:02.210> patch<00:02:02.539> I<00:02:03.460> think<00:02:04.460> that's

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
can get a lower patch I think that's

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.609 
can get a lower patch I think that's
probably<00:02:04.789> gonna<00:02:05.180> be<00:02:05.270> my<00:02:05.420> best<00:02:05.630> bet<00:02:05.899> just

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
probably gonna be my best bet just

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.280 
probably gonna be my best bet just
replace<00:02:06.829> down<00:02:07.159> below<00:02:07.780> just<00:02:08.780> above<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.140> breeze

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
replace down below just above the breeze

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.259 
replace down below just above the breeze
and<00:02:12.290> then<00:02:12.440> fix<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:12.829> rest<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.459> think<00:02:13.880> that's

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
and then fix the rest I think that's

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.910 
and then fix the rest I think that's
what<00:02:14.390> I'm<00:02:14.480> gonna<00:02:14.600> do<00:02:14.870> if<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.620> guys<00:02:15.709> think

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
what I'm gonna do if you guys think

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.979 
what I'm gonna do if you guys think
that's<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.489> stupid<00:02:16.820> idea<00:02:17.030> let<00:02:17.450> me<00:02:17.540> know<00:02:17.660> but<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
that's a stupid idea let me know but the

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.180 
that's a stupid idea let me know but the
rest<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.290> sheet<00:02:18.620> metal<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.070> good

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
rest of this sheet metal is in good

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.460 
rest of this sheet metal is in good
shape<00:02:22.359> again<00:02:23.359> over<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.780> wheel<00:02:23.930> arch<00:02:24.170> we've

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
shape again over the wheel arch we've

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.199 
shape again over the wheel arch we've
got<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> patch

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.819 

rust-free<00:02:29.209> again<00:02:30.280> poorly<00:02:31.280> executed<00:02:31.519> again

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
rust-free again poorly executed again

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.199 
rust-free again poorly executed again
this<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:36.110> original<00:02:36.530> arch<00:02:37.040> goes<00:02:37.610> here<00:02:38.090> and

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
this the original arch goes here and

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.050 
this the original arch goes here and
then<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.079> pops<00:02:39.290> out<00:02:39.500> here<00:02:40.010> where<00:02:40.670> it's<00:02:40.790> way<00:02:41.000> too

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
then it pops out here where it's way too

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.660 
then it pops out here where it's way too
high<00:02:41.799> through<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:42.890> whole<00:02:43.010> patch<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.489> then<00:02:43.549> it

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
high through the whole patch and then it

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.289 
high through the whole patch and then it
comes<00:02:43.849> back<00:02:43.909> to<00:02:44.180> normal<00:02:44.450> about<00:02:44.629> here<00:02:46.299> so

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
comes back to normal about here so

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.020 
comes back to normal about here so
should<00:02:47.599> cut<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:48.019> piece<00:02:48.260> out<00:02:48.790> cut<00:02:49.790> off<00:02:49.909> the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
should cut this piece out cut off the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.729 
should cut this piece out cut off the
patch<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.540> put<00:02:50.659> in<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.870> new<00:02:51.019> patch<00:02:51.319> that

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
patch and put in a new patch that

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.069 
patch and put in a new patch that
actually<00:02:52.220> lines<00:02:52.430> up<00:02:52.640> or<00:02:52.909> should<00:02:53.599> I<00:02:53.629> try<00:02:53.689> to<00:02:53.840> fix

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
actually lines up or should I try to fix

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.729 
actually lines up or should I try to fix
what's<00:02:54.290> there<00:02:55.420> I'm<00:02:56.420> guessing<00:02:56.870> I'm<00:02:57.379> right<00:02:57.620> now

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
what's there I'm guessing I'm right now

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:58.960 
what's there I'm guessing I'm right now
I'm<00:02:57.859> planning<00:02:58.040> on<00:02:58.310> cutting<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.640> out<00:02:58.700> and

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
I'm planning on cutting that out and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.759 
I'm planning on cutting that out and
replacing<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.599> let<00:02:59.750> me<00:02:59.780> know<00:02:59.870> if<00:03:00.079> I'm<00:03:00.230> that's<00:03:00.650> a

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
replacing it let me know if I'm that's a

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.819 
replacing it let me know if I'm that's a
dumb<00:03:00.950> idea<00:03:02.139> then<00:03:03.139> there's<00:03:03.319> one<00:03:03.470> more<00:03:03.500> patch

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
dumb idea then there's one more patch

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.410 
dumb idea then there's one more patch
here<00:03:05.349> which<00:03:06.349> isn't<00:03:06.920> too<00:03:07.400> bad<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:08.030> does<00:03:08.180> stick

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
here which isn't too bad it does stick

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:25.960 
here which isn't too bad it does stick
out<00:03:08.620> but<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:10.700> problem<00:03:11.239> is<00:03:24.639> there's<00:03:25.639> rust

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
out but the problem is there's rust

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.720 
out but the problem is there's rust
that's<00:03:26.540> where<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.959> patch<00:03:27.139> line<00:03:27.409> is<00:03:29.500> so<00:03:30.730> again

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
that's where the patch line is so again

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.460 
that's where the patch line is so again
looks<00:03:32.269> like<00:03:32.419> I'm<00:03:32.569> gonna<00:03:32.660> be<00:03:32.750> cutting<00:03:33.169> that<00:03:33.260> out

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
looks like I'm gonna be cutting that out

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.180 
looks like I'm gonna be cutting that out
the<00:03:34.010> rest<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.310> it's<00:03:34.459> in<00:03:34.579> good<00:03:34.669> shape

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.759 

that's<00:03:40.190> all<00:03:40.400> factory<00:03:41.000> primer<00:03:41.569> there<00:03:41.930> with

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
that's all factory primer there with

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.960 
that's all factory primer there with
some<00:03:42.949> rust<00:03:43.220> proofing<00:03:44.079> so<00:03:45.940> cut<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.090> patch<00:03:47.329> out

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
some rust proofing so cut that patch out

00:03:48.970 --> 00:04:01.229 
some rust proofing so cut that patch out
and<00:03:49.970> you<00:03:50.120> know<00:03:50.269> see<00:03:50.859> if<00:03:51.859> I<00:03:51.980> can<00:03:52.069> get<00:03:58.180> back<00:03:59.180> there

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
and you know see if I can get back there

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:09.219 
and you know see if I can get back there
but<00:04:02.239> I'm<00:04:02.780> thinking<00:04:07.389> cut<00:04:08.389> those<00:04:08.599> three<00:04:08.810> patches

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:09.229 
but I'm thinking cut those three patches

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:16.659 
but I'm thinking cut those three patches
out<00:04:09.379> one<00:04:10.180> two<00:04:11.470> three<00:04:12.470> are<00:04:12.769> you<00:04:12.919> doing<00:04:15.669> two

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
out one two three are you doing two

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.029 
out one two three are you doing two
