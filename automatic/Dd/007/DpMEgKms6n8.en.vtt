as a weapon which is very cool actually
and<00:00:58.519> this<00:00:59.059> makes<00:00:59.300> you<00:00:59.510> improvise<00:01:00.410> through<00:01:01.250> the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
and this makes you improvise through the

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.090 
and this makes you improvise through the
environment<00:01:02.449> whatever<00:01:02.870> is<00:01:02.960> around<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:03.410> there

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
environment whatever is around it there

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.940 
environment whatever is around it there
you<00:01:04.190> go<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.780> controls<00:01:06.200> are<00:01:06.350> very<00:01:06.380> simple

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
you go so the controls are very simple

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.889 
you go so the controls are very simple
it's<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.340> sort<00:01:07.880> of<00:01:07.940> a<00:01:08.090> sports<00:01:08.450> team<00:01:08.600> philosophy

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
it's a sort of a sports team philosophy

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.889 
it's a sort of a sports team philosophy
with<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.410> three-button<00:01:10.390> simple<00:01:11.390> controls<00:01:11.750> that

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
with a three-button simple controls that

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.830 
with a three-button simple controls that
you<00:01:12.050> can<00:01:12.200> improve<00:01:12.500> through<00:01:12.800> 3d<00:01:13.430> gameplay

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
you can improve through 3d gameplay

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.029 
you can improve through 3d gameplay
we're<00:01:14.840> going<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.080> move<00:01:15.259> to<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.530> next<00:01:15.770> scene

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
we're going to move to the next scene

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.240 
we're going to move to the next scene
where<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.330> introduced<00:01:17.869> Trent<00:01:18.619> reduces<00:01:18.979> our

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
where it introduced Trent reduces our

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.430 
where it introduced Trent reduces our
you<00:01:20.180> know<00:01:20.300> for<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:20.720> first<00:01:20.869> time<00:01:21.050> to<00:01:21.200> drought

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
you know for the first time to drought

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.610 
you know for the first time to drought
so<00:01:21.770> as<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.220> can<00:01:22.340> do<00:01:22.460> this<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:23.630> scintilla

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.580 

Sam<00:01:29.370> is<00:01:29.520> gonna<00:01:29.670> wear<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> hoodie<00:01:30.660> in<00:01:31.320> order<00:01:31.560> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
Sam is gonna wear a hoodie in order to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.470 
Sam is gonna wear a hoodie in order to
you<00:01:32.040> know<00:01:32.070> height<00:01:32.430> properly<00:01:32.910> in<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.240> crowd

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
you know height properly in a crowd

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.990 
you know height properly in a crowd
because<00:01:33.870> if<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.800> guards<00:01:35.160> are<00:01:35.280> recognizing<00:01:35.880> in

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
because if the guards are recognizing in

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.390 
because if the guards are recognizing in
space<00:01:36.240> then<00:01:36.600> there<00:01:37.200> goes<00:01:37.680> well<00:01:37.920> out<00:01:38.010> there<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
space then there goes well out there and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.110 
space then there goes well out there and
there<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.950> when<00:01:40.950> Daniel<00:01:41.370> is<00:01:41.640> trying<00:01:42.000> to
