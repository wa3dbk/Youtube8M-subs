00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.099
 ah 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.740
 I made the request so that all 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.330
 adults we dedicate bet on oblivion 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.080
 so it was like that we requested 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.420
 the threads supported us as well as 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.030
 we are happy because then every 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.230
 who in his house does not need to leave 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.470
 Any time we have free 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.960
 we dedicate to the warping and then to the term 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.270
 from the width of the mark because it no longer 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.400
 we can sell and so on go 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.150
 buying little by little and day by day because 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.280
 go increasing more 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.280
 and practicing more than noise 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.870
 because with that I can this to win a 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.030
 little bit 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.010
 It's so obvious because I'm a mother 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.810
 single with homes 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.790
 and by necessity it also makes us 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.480
 work in time not the days 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.360
 then I beat him again then 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.610
 that yes by warping up to the hammocks 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.800
 I order repair hammocks 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.620
 the truth because I think this time and we 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.740
 they are supporting and I am also very 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.240
 grateful to the teacher chari 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.390
 this time I am seeing a lot of support 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.720
 equally because it is an opportunity 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.720
 for 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.280
 in your house without you having to go out to the 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.810
 Street 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.420
 I think it is 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.150
 it's a way of between something 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.220
 a little more money in the house 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.100
 two 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.009
 and then thanks to the president who 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:17.220
 is supporting on this day in the group 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:20.220
 we met each other since we were little 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.340
 in my mom I do not owe you to teach us 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.890
 that formerly the woman did not have 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.070
 right to go to work and all 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.480
 in your house you have to see what to do then and 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.250
 we learned and I said that the one who knows 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.690
 of hammocks you can realize in the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.540
 kind of forgetting that we do 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.510
 because there can be many people science 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.580
 they earn hammocks but it is necessary account 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.640
 it's a well-dense brand, also good 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.520
 then the name of the group from the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.400
 friends here we want to thank 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.800
 the teacher chari for the support that we 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.720
 he offered hoping that he is not to be the 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.130
 first nor the last 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.900
 and as we were supported if 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.130
 we decided to put other 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.690
 united with the supports we continue to support 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.690
 and we thank you
