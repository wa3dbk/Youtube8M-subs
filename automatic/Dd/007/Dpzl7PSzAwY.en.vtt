00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.510
 8th

 a damn shit what's up with 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.900
 you people 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.970
 charisma of his price boost if so then 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.369
 but again what you have the chance 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.329
 she had become his living room 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.220
 had become a room since then shit 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.170
 people of this beetle strategy and 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.790
 Result has made us slow until he 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.670
 still for the old times 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.379
 two equally good 2004 at kieler fÃ¶rde 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.570
 left and author the nation 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.610
 speed because it had to because 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.339
 that will be very good to you too 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.870
 quickly the thought fingertip feeling 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.870
 is the show player 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.620
 Wow 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.800
 Yes 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.780
 this is like trackmania who is now with 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.250
 sue instead of just being quick 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.840
 The entry is easy, everything is running 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.950
 fluid and already in the peter 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.180
 rock thousands of people on 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.520
 penultimate self-made net 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.230
 in all popular shooter modes around ergo 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.880
 It 's the perfect habitat around you 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.250
 each other off for building land in quickly 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.010
 quickly predestined for the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.500
 Skiing almost 100,000 dollars tournament 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.300
 start is started chip amount 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.890
 just like trackmania on the platform 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.420
 maniaplanet comparable to the 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.890
 battle.net why are they doing that ? 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.900
 because they are all insane trackmania 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.430
 The tinkers do not just want to overtake 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.420
 own maps but also little head on 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.220
 own game modes 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.470
 what that means are fucking 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.300
 every bet media mediates after us 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.070
 her plate belongs to her 40 years 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:06.350
 we will not get better 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:11.470
 that is, that there are two important 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:14.980
 First, the action at school 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.960
 better you shit shit you will 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.040
 met 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.080
 Usually you only have two hits 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.700
 allow it depending on the opponent 's weapon 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.290
 there is basically only one of the shows 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.600
 Mode change, however, between rocket 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.310
 launcher carriers and niendorfer depending on 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.110
 Game modes fight areal easy 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.640
 it does not hold her any weapon 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.230
 your limited shot is limited and must 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.480
 I also partially charge before 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.600
 you can put a two funds nothing with 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.070
 pick up ammunition or arms 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.940
 but no matter what weapons are used 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.640
 without reaction skills times nothing for 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.790
 this fucking internet kitty's this 15 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.459
 14 12 year olds yes but says that 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:58.930
 good for 150 euros 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.700
 2 there are no data and none 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.200
 Shoot straits like in other stables 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.910
 and that barney was hopping 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.890
 here you do not use it here 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.020
 all the more that decisions on ramps 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.560
 can you suffer rocket wool jobs are 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.720
 at the beginning 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.400
 including fence through the maps and at the 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.319
 so-called anchor blog you can 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.349
 neat one jump 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.909
 Once again often oscillates so structured 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.129
 that the enemy can come from everywhere 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.090
 who adopted the trackmania consumption 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.739
 it will eventually become appropriate 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.989
 Billions of crazy maps give themselves up 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.439
 all differ from each other and that 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.780
 is grad 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:31.000
 it will only be rave all the time 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.689
 shoot left right right 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.310
 shoot 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.840
 We know the circus without one 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.730
 Smooth we had to move 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.230
 no longer because we then 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.230
 hackl again pull death 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.609
 be clear, it is not a call of duty 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:52.700
 but it is war our war is you 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.700
 ready 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.740
 m 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.150
 the ducks 4 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.469
 I have one
