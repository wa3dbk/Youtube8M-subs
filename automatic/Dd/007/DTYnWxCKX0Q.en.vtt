people<00:02:51.150> just<00:02:51.420> like<00:02:51.510> throwing<00:02:51.840> them<00:02:51.930> around<00:02:52.020> in

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
people just like throwing them around in

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.780 
people just like throwing them around in

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
the concrete which I will not do in this

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.250 
the concrete which I will not do in this
video<00:02:53.970> because<00:02:54.270> I'm<00:02:54.480> not<00:02:54.630> taking<00:02:54.960> that<00:02:55.020> risk

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
video because I'm not taking that risk

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.970 
video because I'm not taking that risk
OtterBox<00:02:55.890> or<00:02:56.010> not<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:57.260> that's<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.410> unboxing

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
OtterBox or not so that's the unboxing

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.370 
OtterBox or not so that's the unboxing
it<00:02:59.160> adds<00:02:59.370> a<00:03:00.090> little<00:03:00.180> bit<00:03:00.300> of<00:03:00.420> bulk<00:03:00.660> because<00:03:01.200> it

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
it adds a little bit of bulk because it

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.170 
it adds a little bit of bulk because it
is<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> case<00:03:01.860> but<00:03:02.130> this<00:03:02.280> phone<00:03:02.490> is<00:03:02.700> relatively

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
is a case but this phone is relatively

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.120 
is a case but this phone is relatively
thin<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:04.020> can't<00:03:04.800> really<00:03:04.860> tell<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:07.010> that's<00:03:08.010> it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
thin so can't really tell and that's it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.510 
thin so can't really tell and that's it
for<00:03:08.190> this<00:03:08.370> unboxing<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:10.320> otterbox<00:03:11.250> for
