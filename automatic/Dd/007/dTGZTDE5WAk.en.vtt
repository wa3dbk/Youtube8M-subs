00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
think that's a pretty fair deal and it's

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.910 
think that's a pretty fair deal and it's
pretty<00:00:55.120> easy<00:00:55.270> how<00:00:55.540> you<00:00:55.600> do<00:00:55.810> that<00:00:55.960> you<00:00:56.170> can<00:00:56.350> it's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
pretty easy how you do that you can it's

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.100 
pretty easy how you do that you can it's
a<00:00:56.980> few<00:00:57.190> easy<00:00:57.310> steps<00:00:57.430> here<00:00:57.940> you<00:00:58.690> should<00:00:58.899> try<00:00:58.989> to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
a few easy steps here you should try to

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.180 
a few easy steps here you should try to
my<00:00:59.260> channel<00:00:59.500> that's<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.710> first<00:00:59.890> step<00:00:59.980> is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
my channel that's the first step is

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.700 
my channel that's the first step is
going<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.370> get<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.550> one<00:01:00.670> ticket<00:01:00.970> into<00:01:01.149> the<00:01:01.239> Hat

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
going to get you one ticket into the Hat

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.439 
going to get you one ticket into the Hat
another<00:01:02.710> easy<00:01:02.890> step<00:01:03.220> is<00:01:03.399> to<00:01:03.730> comment<00:01:04.210> on<00:01:04.269> any

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
another easy step is to comment on any

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.709 
another easy step is to comment on any
video<00:01:04.689> but<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.470> means<00:01:06.430> you<00:01:06.549> have<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:06.759> be

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
video but that means you have to be

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.690 
video but that means you have to be
positive<00:01:07.929> and<00:01:08.469> you<00:01:08.859> have<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.039> be<00:01:09.069> relevant<00:01:09.399> so

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
positive and you have to be relevant so

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.919 
positive and you have to be relevant so
that<00:01:09.819> means<00:01:09.999> you<00:01:10.090> have<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.270> you<00:01:10.479> can't<00:01:10.659> just<00:01:10.810> be

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
that means you have to you can't just be

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:12.989 
that means you have to you can't just be
like<00:01:11.049> you<00:01:11.590> suck<00:01:11.920> like<00:01:12.429> you<00:01:12.549> have<00:01:12.639> to<00:01:12.729> be<00:01:12.850> like

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:12.999 
like you suck like you have to be like

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:15.090 
like you suck like you have to be like
well<00:01:13.719> I<00:01:13.749> think<00:01:13.869> that<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.499> could<00:01:14.829> have<00:01:14.950> been

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
well I think that you could have been

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.679 
well I think that you could have been
missing<00:01:15.460> this<00:01:15.490> part<00:01:15.850> of<00:01:15.939> the<00:01:15.999> video<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:16.569> done

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
missing this part of the video and done

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.149 
missing this part of the video and done
better<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:16.960> now<00:01:17.259> that's<00:01:17.590> constructive

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
better and now that's constructive

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.429 
better and now that's constructive
criticism<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:18.789> I'll<00:01:18.850> take<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:19.539> you'll

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
criticism and I'll take that and you'll

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.099 
criticism and I'll take that and you'll
have<00:01:20.560> to<00:01:20.679> be<00:01:20.770> relevant<00:01:21.039> you<00:01:21.310> can't<00:01:21.490> be<00:01:21.579> like
