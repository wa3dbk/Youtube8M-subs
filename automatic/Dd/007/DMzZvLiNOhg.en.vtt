00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.840
 Hello, how is the weather report? 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.820
 from the national meteorological service 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.080
 and the weather conditions for 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.540
 this weekend are the following 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.620
 we will have a front week number 47 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.450
 on the northern part of the territory 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.310
 national and was interned on the 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.090
 state of coahuila and chihuahua 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.070
 maintaining a potential for the fall 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.060
 of snow this / the interaction of 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.010
 moisture input from the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.080
 peaceful ocean in conjugation with this 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.460
 system also in interaction with a 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.500
 low pressure channel that is 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.149
 extended from the north to the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.620
 eastern country which 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.329
 allows the potential for falling 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.940
 hail and the presence of some 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.829
 tornadoes isolated mainly in 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.519
 states like new lion coahuila hidalgo 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.260
 puebla tlaxcala in the forecast of 24 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.570
 hours for Sunday system 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.190
 However, another 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.319
 new front system will be 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.059
 approaching the northern border of the country 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.739
 the low pressure channel is maintained 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.480
 along what is the east of 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.550
 national territory with the potential to 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.739
 important rains accompanied by 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.170
 electrical activity in addition to falling 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.000
 hail and the presence of tornadoes 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.740
 also the effect of surada is maintained 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.630
 over the gulf of mexico this keeps 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.890
 warm temperatures that in combination 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.690
 with the entry of moisture coming 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.190
 the Pacific Ocean as well 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.320
 they shoot the presence of rains 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.330
 mainly in northeastern entities 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.470
 of the national territory let's go with the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.200
 temperatures where we expect the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.329
 following conditions 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.979
 this weekend the minimum temperature 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.750
 in the northwest it will be oscillating from 7 to 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.060
 12 degrees is the maximum you can reach 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.159
 the 27 29 degrees celsius varying the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.810
 region conditions say it cleared with 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.640
 cloudiness increase towards 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.010
 late-night awaits us time 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.840
 meaningful for what this region is 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.950
 for the northeastern part of territory 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.870
 national conditions are the 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.760
 following the minimum goes from the nine 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.830
 reaching up to 22 degrees that is 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.170
 varying the region the maximum in coast 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.060
 could reach 34 degrees celsius 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.530
 There is increasing cloudiness in addition to the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.510
 potential for rainfall accompanied by 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.770
 electrical activity and tornadoes isolated 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.600
 about this region 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.770
 for the western central part the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.350
 conditions are the following the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.659
 minimum temperature from 11 degrees 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.660
 Celsius up to 13 and 18 degrees is the 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.060
 maximum could reach 31 degrees is 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.530
 mainly in regions that are 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.150
 attached to the coast increase of 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.590
 cloudiness and presence of rain 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.780
 isolated due to moisture entry 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.910
 from the Pacific Ocean to 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.590
 this region for the southern part of 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.959
 national territory the temperature 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.840
 minimum between 7 and 19 degrees is the maximum 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.030
 could reach 27 to 34 degrees those 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.280
 clear sky conditions in large 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.349
 part of this region except for 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.700
 jungle areas where it will be 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.620
 exploring the cloudiness increase of 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.670
 the presence of some isolated rain 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.770
 due to moisture entry 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.450
 from the Pacific Ocean 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.310
 for the southeast part of territory 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.410
 national the minimum is oscillating from 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.300
 22 up to 26 degrees they march for 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.460
 be able to reach even on the coast until 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.830
 the 38 degrees celsius so 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.180
 widespread there is low potential for 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.590
 rains on this region something very 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.450
 Similar for the Yucatan Peninsula 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.610
 where the minimum temperature will be 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.890
 oscillating from 24 25 degrees celsius 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.840
 the maximum could reach up to 39 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.000
 degrees that's cloudiness increase 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.340
 due to the incoming moisture coming 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.290
 of what is the Caribbean Sea however 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.990
 because they are the temperatures wait very 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.430
 warm by the effect of surada for that 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.570
 region for the federal district- 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.460
 we will have the minimum temperature 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.050
 will be recording the 13 degrees is the 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.460
 maximum will be reaching 26 degrees 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.990
 celsius sky conditions 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.850
 Partly cloudy with an increase of 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.620
 cloudiness towards late afternoon 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.480
 effect will allow the presence of some 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.730
 rain to the south of the federal district 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.110
 for this day Saturday the temperature 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.940
 minimum for Sunday of 14 degrees 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.710
 celsius the maximum 27 degrees celsius 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.570
 partially sky conditions 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.920
 cloudy and cloudiness increase towards 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.170
 late-night on monday 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.000
 a very similar condition the minimum of 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.250
 13 degrees is the maximum will reach the 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.720
 28 degrees celsius in terms of 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.160
 Clear sky sky conditions 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.460
 during the morning but wait in 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.740
 cream 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.270
 of cloudiness towards late afternoon-night 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.070
 to moisture input from the 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.640
 Pacific ocean for what the city is 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.380
 from Mexico 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.450
 this was a weather report from the 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.920
 national meteorological service reported 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.470
 pamela garcÃ­a remember to follow us 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.340
