00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
let's talk about the wheels for a second

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.990 
let's talk about the wheels for a second
these<00:01:55.619> are<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.250> same<00:01:56.430> type<00:01:56.609> of<00:01:56.670> wheels

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
these are like the same type of wheels

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.580 
these are like the same type of wheels
that<00:01:57.119> they<00:01:57.240> use<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.570> rollerblades<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.439> they're

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
that they use on rollerblades so they're

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.160 
that they use on rollerblades so they're
really<00:01:59.070> smooth<00:01:59.429> really<00:01:59.909> easy<00:02:00.179> to<00:02:00.539> pull<00:02:00.810> this

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
really smooth really easy to pull this

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.050 
really smooth really easy to pull this
convertible<00:02:01.560> car<00:02:01.859> seat<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:02.909> how

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
convertible car seat and we know how

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.459 
convertible car seat and we know how
heavy<00:02:03.299> convertible<00:02:03.899> car<00:02:04.049> seats<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.409> be

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
heavy convertible car seats can be

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.639 
heavy convertible car seats can be
especially<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.789> 30<00:02:06.270> or<00:02:06.390> 40<00:02:06.810> piled<00:02:07.289> in<00:02:07.500> them

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
especially with a 30 or 40 piled in them

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.800 
especially with a 30 or 40 piled in them
so<00:02:08.220> these<00:02:08.369> wheels<00:02:08.610> are<00:02:08.729> great<00:02:09.000> for<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.539> so

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
so these wheels are great for that so

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.150 
so these wheels are great for that so
it's<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.080> give<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:10.470> smooth<00:02:10.830> ride

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
it's going to give a really smooth ride

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.530 
it's going to give a really smooth ride
while<00:02:11.400> they're<00:02:11.580> riding<00:02:11.880> through<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.060> airport

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
threaded through and then you just lock

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.310 
threaded through and then you just lock
it<00:02:58.660> on<00:02:58.990> this<00:02:59.140> side<00:02:59.380> pull<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.460> tight<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.050> even

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
it on this side pull it tight and I even

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.950 
it on this side pull it tight and I even
like<00:03:02.470> this<00:03:02.770> handle<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.760> actually<00:03:04.300> tightens<00:03:04.870> it

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
like this handle it actually tightens it

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.690 
like this handle it actually tightens it
even<00:03:05.200> more<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.560> pull<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:06.520> what

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
even more you pull it and that is what

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.790 
even more you pull it and that is what
tightens<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.930> get<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.230> as<00:03:08.320> tight<00:03:08.350> as<00:03:08.620> you

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
tightens it so get it as tight as you

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.250 
tightens it so get it as tight as you
can<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.400> there<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.090> go<00:03:10.240> then<00:03:10.840> you're<00:03:11.050> going
