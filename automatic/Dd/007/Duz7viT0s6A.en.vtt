 What is there aquarium people? Fishtanktv.com. Dustin's aquariums. Brings it to your New Years Edition. That's right. Happy 2013 everyone. I'm enthusiastic. Chilling out last night, guess what I did. The girls went to bed without their pacifiers. Not easy to do, I don't know if some of your parents ever did that before. We took the pacifiers away from both Mya and Nola. But I had some time to relax. Welcome to the new year, me and my tank. Did a little work, but didn't have much time because we are about to walk out to Toys'R'Us for the girls who no longer need to use pacifiers. But I want to talk about this tank because it's one of my goals. One of the most important things to me for 2013 is to make this tank beautiful again. It's used to dominate, it's not as much as dominating in the beginning. We are going in the right direction with it. So I don't want to talk about it. I want to talk about what makes this tank a success. In decorating the aquarium, I believe there is value in the open spaces in your tank. The space between the branches over here, the open space here. The surface, where the space comes between the lotus and the space between the surface. The height of the crenemateans verses the surface. Just the space. I think there is value in the distance from everything in your Aquascapes. I think that's one of the things that is successful in this tank. I also want to show off the Trident that I have slowly .. This is a good tip. As someone grows Java Fern, just keep divorcing, and divorce, and divorce. I'm using rubber bands on here. I'll cut them quickly, but it was just easier to do. I was in fashion, so I said, "Okay I'm going to do it." So I got these ugly two rubber bands here and I think you'll see one back there. Eventually, 'going for that whole tree effect' with the trident. NO the trident is not for sale through Aquatic Jungles, not even in a combo anymore. Don't ask SO, but I appreciate it anyway. So, open space is what to press. I want to talk about goals. I had a great year with Aquarium goals. I'm really excited. I am a real goal person. The greenhouse was not even on the targets list this year, but I went to Peru, I put the greenhouse together, had a lot of success on the YouTube channel. So I'm really excited about that. I want to share one of my goals is to make this tank beautiful this year. I also want more well-written content, a few guides, to turn things off like that. If you guys have some ideas about what you want me to be right about let me know. I'm still working on a book. I need to get my file from this old computer that is going to get a lot of content. So that's what I do. I'm enthusiastic. Look at the open spaces. What are your goals for 2013? I'd love to hear them. I think it's important. I write my downstairs too. I think that's very important. Write down your goals, what you are trying to achieve. I feel really good to go into this year. I had a monster 2012 on many fronts. So I want to share that, I want to share the tank and I'm just excited. I also want to share the open space to the maximum on this one. This tank is actually being demolished. I'm not sure if I'm going to break this down, I really think it's the way it's so full. Open spaces again work really well here. You will find that I do not scrape the algae. I added one, maybe two caps of ordinary old bloom and it threw the balance a bit and I immediately got algae so that's just something you want to see when you fertilize your tank. You have to get a feel for that, I had no sense for that tank as you can see through the stuff on the glass. But that's what I do. Having a lot of fun. Happy 2013. Now I have to run for Toys'R'Us. I have some kids spoiled rotten for their 'No more pacifier gone'. What are your goals for 2013? Talk about it and let me know.
