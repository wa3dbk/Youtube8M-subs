00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
doing inventory of the earth yes I've

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.720 
doing inventory of the earth yes I've
counted<00:02:46.810> six<00:02:47.140> boxes<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:47.650> far<00:02:47.860> how<00:02:48.070> about<00:02:48.220> you

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
counted six boxes so far how about you

counted six boxes so far how about you
I've<00:02:49.630> also<00:02:50.140> counted<00:02:50.560> six

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:55.840 

this<00:04:16.560> is<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.769> restricted<00:04:17.400> area<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:18.000> goon

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:20.969 

you'll<00:04:56.850> give<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.090> down<00:04:57.419> there<00:04:57.720> mate

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.830 

the<00:05:21.979> statistical<00:05:22.639> probability<00:05:22.909> of<00:05:23.449> the<00:05:23.569> state

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
the statistical probability of the state

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:31.719 
the statistical probability of the state
should<00:05:24.110> be<00:05:24.139> hit<00:05:24.499> by<00:05:24.680> a<00:05:24.710> meteor<00:05:25.099> showers<00:05:30.729> it

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
should be hit by a meteor showers it

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:47.070 
should be hit by a meteor showers it
sure<00:05:31.999> looks<00:05:32.210> like<00:05:32.300> a<00:05:32.419> collision<00:05:32.900> course<00:05:33.050> on

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.040 

meteor<00:05:48.080> shower<00:05:48.819> Roger<00:05:49.819> that<00:05:50.090> it<00:05:50.599> is<00:05:50.779> right

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
meteor shower Roger that it is right

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.469 
meteor shower Roger that it is right
this<00:05:51.259> way<00:05:51.669> you<00:05:52.669> should<00:05:52.849> probably<00:05:53.120> let

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
this way you should probably let

00:05:53.479 --> 00:06:01.570 
this way you should probably let
everyone<00:05:53.870> know<00:05:55.029> to<00:05:56.029> start<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:56.479> body<00:06:00.400> but<00:06:01.400> only

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
everyone know to start the body but only

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.229 
everyone know to start the body but only
enough<00:06:01.879> escape<00:06:02.300> pods<00:06:02.539> for<00:06:02.750> 20
