00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
inline six meaning six cylinders so I

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.060 
inline six meaning six cylinders so I
will<00:00:10.349> need<00:00:10.559> up<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.800> six<00:00:11.219> quarts<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.759> oil<00:00:12.000> and

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
will need up to six quarts of oil and

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.640 
will need up to six quarts of oil and
then<00:00:14.070> also<00:00:14.599> noil<00:00:15.599> filter<00:00:16.369> make<00:00:17.369> sure<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.650> we

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
then also noil filter make sure that we

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.759 
then also noil filter make sure that we
warm<00:00:20.100> up<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> vehicle<00:00:20.939> before<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.720> drain<00:00:22.500> oil

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
warm up the vehicle before you drain oil

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.130 
warm up the vehicle before you drain oil
because<00:00:23.340> when<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:23.939> warmer<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.600> seems<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
because when it's warmer it seems to

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410 
because when it's warmer it seems to
come<00:00:25.170> out<00:00:25.410> better<00:00:25.680> flow<00:00:26.430> better<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:27.000> well<00:00:27.210> as

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
come out better flow better as well as

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.210 
come out better flow better as well as
get<00:00:27.599> most<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> sludge<00:00:28.380> out<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> as<00:00:29.010> well

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
get most of the sludge out of it as well

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.080 
get most of the sludge out of it as well
and<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:31.009> loosen<00:00:32.009> up<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.340> cap<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and I like to loosen up the cap on the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.010 
and I like to loosen up the cap on the
valve<00:00:33.809> cover<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> oil<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:35.130> help<00:00:35.899> let<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
valve cover for the oil to help let it

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.080 
valve cover for the oil to help let it
drain<00:00:37.260> better<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.829> make<00:00:38.520> sure<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> put<00:00:38.940> all

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
drain better and make sure you put all

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.280 
drain better and make sure you put all
this<00:00:39.239> stuff<00:00:39.300> below<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> mat<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
this stuff below like a mat and the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.319 
this stuff below like a mat and the
container<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.500> catch<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> oil<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.520> then

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
container to catch all the oil and then

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.450 
container to catch all the oil and then
just<00:00:45.510> both<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.989> obviously<00:00:46.110> properly<00:00:47.100> which

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
just both of it obviously properly which

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.580 
just both of it obviously properly which
we<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.760> know<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.180> use<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> wrench<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
we all know and use a wrench and a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.180 
we all know and use a wrench and a
socket<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.219> fits<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.239> bolt<00:00:51.800> loosen<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
socket that fits the bolt loosen it and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.779 
socket that fits the bolt loosen it and
since<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.149> my<00:00:54.300> own<00:00:54.420> oil<00:00:54.840> changes<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:56.370> can

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
since I do my own oil changes is I can

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.360 
since I do my own oil changes is I can
actually<00:00:57.000> loosen<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.020> my<00:00:58.199> own<00:00:58.370> strength

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
actually loosen it with my own strength

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.880 
actually loosen it with my own strength
but<00:00:59.750> when<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.870> used<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.260> other<00:01:01.379> people<00:01:01.770> do

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
but when I used to have other people do

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.280 
but when I used to have other people do
it<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.280> was<00:01:02.789> nearly<00:01:03.210> impossible<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:04.019> off

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it it was nearly impossible to get off

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.950 
it it was nearly impossible to get off
and<00:01:04.970> then<00:01:05.970> let<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.659> drain<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:08.010> container

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
and then let it drain in the container

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.600 
and then let it drain in the container
get<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> bolt<00:01:10.350> clean<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> off<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:11.790> pretty<00:01:12.119> and

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
get the bolt clean it off all pretty and

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.280 
get the bolt clean it off all pretty and
then<00:01:14.610> go<00:01:15.030> ahead<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> try<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.540> take<00:01:15.810> off<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
then go ahead and try to take off the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
then go ahead and try to take off the
oil<00:01:16.320> filter<00:01:16.770> mines<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.549> religiously

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
oil filter mines in and religiously

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.080 
oil filter mines in and religiously
easily<00:01:18.540> pay<00:01:18.900> place<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.549> passenger

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
easily pay place it's on the passenger

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.850 
easily pay place it's on the passenger
side<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.840> engine<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.939> I<00:01:24.439> was<00:01:25.439> able<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> get

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
side of the engine and I was able to get

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.280 
side of the engine and I was able to get
it<00:01:25.979> off<00:01:26.100> by<00:01:26.369> myself<00:01:26.759> because<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.060> put<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.930> by

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
it off by myself because I put it on by

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.649 
it off by myself because I put it on by
myself<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.100> make<00:01:29.820> sure<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> oil

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
myself so and make sure like the oil

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.020 
myself so and make sure like the oil
container<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.979> actually<00:01:32.369> below<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.939> because

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
container is actually below that because

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
container is actually below that because
it<00:01:33.299> likes<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.600> drool<00:01:33.990> all<00:01:34.110> over<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.619> place<00:01:34.829> -

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
it likes to drool all over the place -

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.289 
it likes to drool all over the place -
and<00:01:35.420> then<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.799> emptied<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.100> oil<00:01:38.820> into<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and then I emptied the oil into the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.300 
and then I emptied the oil into the
container<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.439> then<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.650> looked<00:01:40.920> at<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
container but then I looked at it

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
container but then I looked at it
because<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.610> always<00:01:41.759> want<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> look<00:01:42.240> at<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.630> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
because you always want to look at it to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.280 
because you always want to look at it to
make<00:01:43.200> sure<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.500> gasket<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.750> filter<00:01:46.170> as

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
make sure the gasket is on the filter as

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.109 
make sure the gasket is on the filter as
well<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.920> definitely<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.549> not<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:48.030> was

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
well and it definitely was not it was

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.819 
well and it definitely was not it was
still<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.600> engine<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.530> want<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.740> make

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
still on the engine so you want to make

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.580 
still on the engine so you want to make
sure<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.220> get<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.610> off<00:01:50.970> or<00:01:51.689> I've<00:01:52.170> heard<00:01:52.470> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
sure you get that off or I've heard you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.560 
sure you get that off or I've heard you
can<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.890> lose<00:01:53.280> oil<00:01:53.640> pressure<00:01:53.970> because<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
can you lose oil pressure because of the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.920 
can you lose oil pressure because of the
two<00:01:54.930> gaskets<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.939> then<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.509> know<00:01:57.600> blow<00:01:57.810> up

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
two gaskets and then you know blow up

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.679 
two gaskets and then you know blow up
your<00:01:58.020> engine<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.729> go<00:02:00.119> ahead<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.360> clean
