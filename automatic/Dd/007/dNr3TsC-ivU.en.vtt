00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.209
 hello i am looking at rhine with this review 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.639
 we went to a very nice condenser dryer 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:17.129
 also affordable once again it is the 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.129
 zanussi zte 285 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.090
 well if we zanussi this 285 from the 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.560
 packaging 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.870
 so very easy with a tumble dryer 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.980
 then you have the tumble dryer and 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.430
 then of course your 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.430
 instructions 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.489
 well if we then the zte 285 7 of 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.719
 closer view 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.090
 of course you see a very beautiful wash 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.219
 dryer and condenser dryer 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.949
 mean that a reservoir hit here 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.019
 5 liters of condensed water 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.519
 that condensation water from entering therein 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.190
 but you can also find a drain there 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.780
 at we get the are separate option and 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.889
 then you have that condensation change of 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.559
 hair and you never have to 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:54.999
 empty well well here is a car one 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.739
 car sans 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.569
 well that means watching it yourself 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.569
 exactly how dry your washing is 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:03.309
 auto sans plus extra accurate so goes 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:05.409
 7 kilos of laundry 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.630
 and the tumble dryer has a reducing 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.979
 drum he brings both left and right 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.689
 can turn clockwise 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.640
 well that has all kinds of advantages with 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.490
 regards to you was good and the way 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.469
 on which your laundry moves in the drum 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.780
 just look here for this button that is one 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.490
 rotary knob and with that rotary knob 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.619
 can make the different choices 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.320
 for different programs here 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.530
 your course choices for the euro 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.350
 degree of dryness and therefore extra dry and 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.439
 feels especially for cotton iron dry 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.729
 extra strong drying cabinet dry and below 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.350
 then also for specially for 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.700
 synthetic fabrics 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.979
 and here you have some special ones 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.500
 air programs before you wash 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.969
 is not that much and you actually want it 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.070
 just use air and earth 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.880
 you that baby program for nose not so 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.729
 warm 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.560
 anti-crease says name says it all comes 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.450
 not so wrinkled out and so on 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.340
 and so on the diana with this round button 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.689
 then there are still some buttons here 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.909
 well there we can do something 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.219
 set specific things you can 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.899
 a program shortener what you say 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.149
 well i don't have much time either 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.160
 must be a little faster, it must be a little shorter than 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.810
 press this button you have a buzzer 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.450
 that you can turn on and off 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.850
 You have a delayed start time that 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.230
 that is here that button and here you can 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.950
 still if you want to set time 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.659
 have an extra low temperature and one 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.580
 anti-crease phase that is extra long and that 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.010
 is nice because here with this button 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.019
 he just spent an hour in the anti-crease phase 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.370
 added no who you of course the 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.739
 start pause button 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.590
 and here another indicator lights one like 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.239
 the capacitor is full so could the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.530
 capacitor needs to be cleaned the 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.480
 prices are falling 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.849
 here you have the filter to the fire 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.970
 actually after every drying and here 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.519
 then another one 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.739
 an indicator button for when the condensation 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.480
 container is full of water but alike 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.610
 just to a drum well one 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.220
 handy push button opens the drum 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.200
 beautiful spacious drum that stands out is the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.989
 band that you are in again well that keeps 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.609
 keep an eye on how dry you were 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.290
 exactly in between and actually 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.170
 type of sensor 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.700
 then we have a fluff filter here 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.049
 and that is also in this 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.629
 well these filters we make of course 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.750
 always clean immediately after 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.970
 every dry well well it looks 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.500
 actually good from nice screws in it 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.130
 make sure the laundry is on one 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.169
 is properly distributed in your drum 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.669
 to look here at the bottom 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.549
 That is not unimportant because here is 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.500
 namely the capacitor and that 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.599
 capacitor there is also a filter 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.030
 then turn this red button soap 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.340
 and you pull it out and 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.209
 this generator, yes, you actually need that 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.459
 once a month 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.200
 cool off in the shower and that 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.299
 is very important because yes 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.579
 With that you keep your energy consumption 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.620
 very low 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.889
 he surrenders that is so on to it 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.690
 display when it should be done so 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.410
 I would keep an eye on that light 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.480
 say 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.799
 well we close the door again 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.940
 actually in short 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:10.160
 just summarized how this zte 285 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.180
 looks like when we use the ZTE 285 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.730
 can take 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.820
 very simple we choose with the rotary knob 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.820
 a program and we press start 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.500
 we of course also advance 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.110
 still able to set that is a short one 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.640
 program which is shorter than the 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.590
 we can still switch buzzer on and off 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.490
 in short, those are all things but that 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.410
 of course you pretend to turn it on 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.960
 and drain hose through which you get the 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.790
 Condenser dryer never need empty 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.100
 is not included as standard 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.250
 happy once as if the swords too 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.250
 buy 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.520
 thanks to the changes left and right 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.080
 rotating drum called wavers 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.390
 in the drum 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.730
 this tumble dryer is very careful with 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.230
 you were good at it and also very delicate 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:01.290
 substances can thanks to the low 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.290
 temperature function just in the dryer 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.620
 are you looking for an affordable one 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.420
 condenser dryer with a drum capacity of 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.130
 no less than seven kilograms that too 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.210
 once very carefully with you 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.490
 was good handling then the zanussi zte 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.960
 285 a very nice option for you and then 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.520
 you buy it then you go of course 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.730
 to wasdroger store.nl or dryer 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.890
 story.be 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.340
 thanks for looking happy to the 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.340
 next review
