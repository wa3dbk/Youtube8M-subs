 the system warns before hand 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.090
 German Cup Battle a nice place in Limburg 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.079
 not yet to take a trace of sluices in America 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.959
 children can build on large than theorem 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:22.640
 Hello all 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.970
 it must be the province of limburg has ten more inhabitants before you know 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.069
 thinks well and it's about a verse for me 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.949
 and there aren't that many in that province that need to change 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.800
 conservationists that is why they today thought ten German beavers to one 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.800
 nature reserve in limburg 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 a beaver family and two couples moved today 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.560
 from Germany to Limburg to make sense of the beavers was already one 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.320
 castle that is the role where the weaver are living for are built with a couple 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.770
 tasty apples trim 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.820
 the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 but not all would be in the same mood 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.310
 weavers they are good for nature make sure the streams and rivers 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.840
 to stay in good condition by expanding but in the Netherlands there are such 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.370
 150 years ago extinct and therefore beavers are becoming abroad 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.140
 imprisoned and released again in the Netherlands is called 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.450
 The weavers that have been released today come from Germany but it is not one 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.450
 bit in common to just move them to another country 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.640
 martine van os and germany that told me 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.190
 what less good places on a trail of industrial park that get anyway 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.350
 celebrate that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.970
 we still have six pieces better 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.970
 Beavers have been released more often in the Netherlands 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 first in the biesbosch and then in gelderland and flevoland 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.310
 a few of them went to northern Sleeden by themselves 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.570
 today it has been added in South Limburg 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.280
 Jan van der Veen has caught the beavers 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.630
 but how do you replace a no 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.340
 by turn 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.500
 you know what 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.500
 the winner 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.290
 at dark 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.590
 on a stool that turns out to be waiting for you until that letter was over 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.190
 We dragged them along and we called them. We have the beavers for the time being 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.870
 no longer be afraid of dropping down you see Friday in luxembourg with the 8 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.039
 by the water 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.779
 where the beavers are plotted exactly where the b replacements do not reveal 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.709
 we are afraid that people will bother sanders 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.180
 the idea is that there will be around ten pairs in the coming years 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.579
 turned off
