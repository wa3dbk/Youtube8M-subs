00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 Good people, I'll show you here. 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.560
 how to install a repository 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.250
 automatic water 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.349
 those ego when the aquarium water 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.320
 evaporate automatically will see a 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.520
 pump will complete aquarium water 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.570
 that evaporated 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.980
 the pump of the anp filters does not 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.010
 works without water 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.519
 sure I will not show you what the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.030
 equipment told using here I did 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.260
 an installation of a sensor 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.100
 level of a float when the buoy 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.960
 download 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.379
 it will automatically turn on a pump 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.620
 this pump is a 150 liter pump 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.050
 that's enough time to fill this 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.300
 hose and fill the filter water 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 forgetting to supply this 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.340
 reservoir because if it works 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.570
 if the water runs out if the pump works in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.500
 base it will burn 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.689
 I installed it an alarm sensor 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.830
 so when the water gets below that 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.420
 Extremely annoying alarm sensor will 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.680
 activate and I'll have to remember 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.950
 complete the water of this report show 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.049
 It's up to you guys that it works here. 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.439
 I made a plug to connect right there 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.360
 on top it will fit into the glass and will 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.890
 stay in the saints I have already put the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.729
 Height I think is ideal 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.799
 okay so when the sensor has this 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.509
 position means that the reservoir 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.970
 is full of water, it means the filter 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.079
 holy is filled with water as 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.200
 he fell as he stayed 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.280
 falling and the ball is leaning down here and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.320
 will automatically turn on the pump that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.780
 is there and will complete the water level 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.950
 when the level reaches the bomb for the goal 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.829
 empty 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.170
 A cool league, right? 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:14.670
 meanwhile the pump is on 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.970
 the water level down are downloading 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.330
 and when it reaches and when the water 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.440
 below the alarm sensor 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.890
 He's going to activate it, so it 's a good system. 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.739
 simple it is practical to do and 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.970
 very efficient in preventing your pump from 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.640
 burn 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:47.319
 for this the aquarium is without the pump to 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:54.130
 a level will drop so you can turn the 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:56.760
 alarm called there very sick and 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.760
 I'm going to turn it off 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.739
 This is it, everybody, there's my project. 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.959
 will install soon and linen in the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.959
 Filter a hug to everyone and even more.
