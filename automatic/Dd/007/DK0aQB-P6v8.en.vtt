00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.250
 welcome to a new video of batman 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.230
 arkham city 'in this case another secret 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.200
 Easter egg and then as you want 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.400
 call to access this that 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.700
 comes to open the sequential 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.120
 cryptographic to see them 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:31.450
 interpreted radios and go first to this 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:33.490
 at these frequencies of 500 and 700 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.280
 and they are listening to those numbers that are going 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.200
 to go repeating there is a sound at the end 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.430
 so you can see it from the beginning 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.200
 then when all these are over 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.050
 numbers what they have to do is 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.980
 change those numbers by letters 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.320
 starting from being the number one 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.570
 then give us air france batman that 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.130
 translated now I'm going to put it means 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.910
 return the batman that is the first 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.460
 message 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.260
 the second is in another frequency is in 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.570
 the frequency 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.570
 700 but on the frequency 500 900 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.780
 in this case instead of replacing the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.640
 for one to do the other way they go to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.719
 replace the one with the one and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.640
 decreasing the duties the letters 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:25.880
 then the jota will be 1 the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.880
 integration on 2 la x el 3 2 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.549
 but 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.920
 and this gives us as a result google pay 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.600
 for what you want me what it means 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.370
 you will pay for what you have done to me and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.490
 we have been thinking who can be 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.900
 have left without thinking and the third that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.610
 is in the frequency 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:14.050
 200 500 is the most complex of all 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.120
 It took the most awakened people in the world 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.270
 several months to be able to solve it 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.030
 because because we're going to have one and the other 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.860
 times some numbers and if we change them in 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.450
 any one of the ways 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.209
 what do you do earlier 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.629
 letters that do not form any phrase nor 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.209
 there are even vowels then someone 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.120
 it occurred to him to change what we are going to change 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.690
 to all those numbers by letters with the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.900
 making one's book like the message 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.569
 and then we're going to use the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.150
 decoder called waters what can 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:54.380
 see a description of my video can 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.910
 see where to use that encoder there 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.910
 a web page where you can put the 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.769
 sentence and they will decode what it does 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.780
 is to alter certain letters you change 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.670
 by other letters but makes it automatic 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.760
 this page look if we change the 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.890
 more letters to that phrase and with waters we 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.569
 give this other phrase and then we have to 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.819
 use another decoder that is called 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.920
 bean genre and use the key 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.599
 scarecrow and will give us what is in 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.720
 good screen I hope you have them 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.970
 liked please subscribe I like it 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.569
 and I wait for your comments in the video 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.569
 see you soon
