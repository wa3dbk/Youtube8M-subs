uphill struggle what I look for are

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.709 
uphill struggle what I look for are
games<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.430> look<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.670> even<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.239> possible

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
games that look as even as possible

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
games that look as even as possible
where<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> ticket<00:00:55.739> difference<00:00:56.100> between<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
where the ticket difference between the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.310 
where the ticket difference between the
two<00:00:56.760> teams<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.329> small<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:57.899> find

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
two teams is as small as you can find

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.160 
two teams is as small as you can find
and<00:00:58.620> go<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.550> this<00:01:00.480> way<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.750> should<00:01:01.050> end

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and go for that this way you should end

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.959 
and go for that this way you should end
up<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.350> game<00:01:01.559> with<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> fairly<00:01:02.160> balanced<00:01:02.640> teams

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
up a game with a fairly balanced teams
