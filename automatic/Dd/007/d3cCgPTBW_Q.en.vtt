these<00:01:16.200> trolls<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.770> two<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:18.000> good<00:01:18.180> ones

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
these trolls is on two really good ones

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.200 
these trolls is on two really good ones
and<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.020> thrall<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.740> Phil<00:01:20.009> ascetic<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
and that is thrall and Phil ascetic the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.359 
and that is thrall and Phil ascetic the
reason<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.509> say<00:01:21.689> trove<00:01:21.960> shroud<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.439> new<00:01:22.799> is

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
reason I say trove shroud is new is

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.370 
reason I say trove shroud is new is
because<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.850> not<00:01:23.909> something<00:01:24.180> wizards<00:01:24.810> does

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
because it's not something wizards does

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.330 
because it's not something wizards does
very<00:01:25.770> often<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:27.479> very<00:01:28.229> cautiously<00:01:28.860> put<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
very often they very cautiously put on a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
very often they very cautiously put on a
card<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.820> every<00:01:30.060> time<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> comes<00:01:30.780> out<00:01:31.020> again

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
card so every time it comes out again

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.149 
card so every time it comes out again
it's<00:01:31.860> gonna<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.250> new<00:01:32.460> because

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
it's gonna be new because

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.179 
it's gonna be new because
a<00:01:33.310> really<00:01:33.850> good<00:01:34.030> effect<00:01:34.359> and<00:01:34.920> every<00:01:35.920> time<00:01:36.069> it

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
a really good effect and every time it

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.649 
a really good effect and every time it
comes<00:01:36.310> around<00:01:36.700> it<00:01:37.030> kind<00:01:37.509> of<00:01:38.189> defines<00:01:39.189> an

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
comes around it kind of defines an

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.080 
comes around it kind of defines an
archetype<00:01:40.659> in<00:01:41.079> standard<00:01:41.710> at<00:01:42.640> least<00:01:42.850> for<00:01:43.060> a

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
archetype in standard at least for a

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.740

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
little while so throw is a forecast and

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.410 
little while so throw is a forecast and

I think he's going to do alright and
legacy<00:02:23.019> but<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.410> don't<00:02:23.709> think<00:02:23.920> this<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.129> a<00:02:24.160> Tier

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
legacy but I don't think this is a Tier

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.300 
legacy but I don't think this is a Tier
one<00:02:24.489> card<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.150> think<00:02:25.450> his<00:02:25.720> best<00:02:26.650> uses<00:02:27.160> when

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
one card I think his best uses when

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.680 
one card I think his best uses when
being<00:02:27.489> standard<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.060> extended<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.599> I'm

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
being standard and extended and I'm

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.410 
being standard and extended and I'm
pushing<00:02:29.500> more<00:02:29.620> for<00:02:29.859> extended<00:02:30.340> he<00:02:31.030> falls<00:02:31.239> into

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
pushing more for extended he falls into

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.170 
pushing more for extended he falls into
that<00:02:31.680> four<00:02:32.680> spot<00:02:33.010> for<00:02:33.370> your<00:02:33.519> planeswalker

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
that four spot for your planeswalker

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.610 
that four spot for your planeswalker
that<00:02:34.629> you<00:02:34.720> want<00:02:34.840> running<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.140> deck<00:02:35.319> number<00:02:35.560> is

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
that you want running the deck number is

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.080 
that you want running the deck number is
not<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:35.769> lot<00:02:35.859> of<00:02:35.890> good<00:02:36.099> green<00:02:36.430> planeswalkers

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
not a lot of good green planeswalkers

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.440 
not a lot of good green planeswalkers
but<00:02:37.900> i<00:02:38.400> keep<00:02:39.400> he<00:02:39.790> kind<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.030> sucks<00:02:40.209> out<00:02:40.329> that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
but i keep he kind of sucks out that

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.170 
but i keep he kind of sucks out that
forest<00:02:40.720> but<00:02:40.870> i<00:02:40.900> really<00:02:41.410> don't<00:02:41.500> like<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:42.180> but

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
forest but i really don't like that but

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.569 
forest but i really don't like that but
to<00:02:43.269> each<00:02:43.389> his<00:02:43.420> own<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.900> definitely<00:02:44.889> think<00:02:45.370> he's

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
to each his own I definitely think he's

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:46.949 
to each his own I definitely think he's
worth<00:02:45.730> picking<00:02:45.970> up<00:02:46.209> for<00:02:46.359> standard<00:02:46.750> though

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
worth picking up for standard though

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:47.640 
worth picking up for standard though

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
definitely just to compare to troll

I<00:03:27.069> think<00:03:27.549> this<00:03:27.670> guy<00:03:27.819> would<00:03:28.000> have<00:03:28.030> been<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.450> lot

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
I think this guy would have been a lot

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.059 
I think this guy would have been a lot

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
better at a three converted mana cost

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.280 
better at a three converted mana cost
for<00:03:30.370> three<00:03:30.579> one<00:03:30.730> on<00:03:30.760> three<00:03:30.879> two<00:03:31.209> three<00:03:32.079> three

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290

whatever<00:03:32.739> but<00:03:33.700> time<00:03:33.970> will<00:03:34.120> tell<00:03:34.239> if<00:03:34.299> it's<00:03:34.599> even

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
whatever but time will tell if it's even

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.160 
whatever but time will tell if it's even
worth<00:03:34.870> playing<00:03:35.159> in<00:03:36.159> your<00:03:36.340> four<00:03:36.609> spot<00:03:37.239> curve<00:03:37.870> of

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
worth playing in your four spot curve of

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.009 
worth playing in your four spot curve of
the<00:03:38.290> deck<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:39.090> definitely<00:03:40.090> think<00:03:40.569> he's<00:03:40.810> going

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
the deck I definitely think he's going

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.759 
the deck I definitely think he's going
to<00:03:41.139> see<00:03:41.260> play<00:03:41.530> but<00:03:42.159> I<00:03:42.220> think<00:03:42.549> he's<00:03:43.709> he's<00:03:44.709> just

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
to see play but I think he's he's just

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.500 
to see play but I think he's he's just
gonna<00:03:45.069> fall<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.670> sidelines<00:03:46.120> that's<00:03:46.329> what

gonna fall to the sidelines that's what

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.059 
gonna fall to the sidelines that's what
I<00:03:46.569> think<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:46.989> think<00:03:47.349> his<00:03:47.439> price<00:03:47.650> is<00:03:47.680> gonna<00:03:47.889> stay

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
I think I think his price is gonna stay

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.670 
I think I think his price is gonna stay
up<00:03:48.189> there<00:03:48.220> because<00:03:48.579> he<00:03:48.849> has<00:03:49.689> a<00:03:49.720> time<00:03:50.049> hey-ya
