00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:36.650
 to clear the hock by doing a 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:40.930
 straight cut lifted the surplus of 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:46.489
 rind found on the ham 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:49.670
 we get the lean and we know by the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.030
 you start a sorting process 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.220
 that we will put the pieces of sea of a 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:08.450
 side and death will have to sell which are 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:11.899
 intended for other fabrications 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.830
 releases the spider that the meat that is 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:19.399
 found on the quasi one also clears 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:23.240
 the internal shutter to have access to 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.430
 the koksal femur junction that connected 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.430
 in the berthe ask section ligament 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:34.729
 the technician right now I take this opportunity 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.470
 to thank philippe our technician 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.050
 who is doing the boning 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.530
 and who will do the salting by 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.480
 injection as well as herb that allowed me 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.330
 to realise 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.870
 video like a lot of videos on this 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.410
 site 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.480
 hervÃ© core version of helped so the 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:58.600
 young people for training in our 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:01.450
 business so we go 1.6 and between two months 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.090
 of meat so as to avoid beating 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.120
 of knife and sever the muscle on 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:13.060
 therefore clears the rights to reach the 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:16.150
 femur he does not notice for our friends 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.610
 butcher who will definitely wear the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.090
 criticisms about the quality of the deboning 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.590
 but let's not forget that in charcuterie 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.270
 all the bones are then cooked in 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.160
 applications like and rillettes his 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.620
 sheets and that we recover the meat 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:40.750
 so we will not waste time doing 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:43.720
 deboning to white so we benefit 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.720
 now to remove make a dam 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.830
 to last and remove all issues 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.060
 aponeuritis cartilage or nerve that would 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.060
 stayed at the center of the genre 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.319
 if this work is not done on 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.159
 will find at the slice pieces of 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.620
 fat or hard pieces because it does not take 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.650
 do not forget that ham is not a 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.049
 very cooked product it is only fair to 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.150
 the temperature it takes for good 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.150
 release his opener his mellow 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.380
 as you can see we 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.250
 attaches great importance to this 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.250
 working phase 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.310
 you have to worry about the technique 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.040
 on cured meat is very important 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.380
 find on the site the pig and the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.200
 beef in the technological heading of 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.600
 cured all the techniques that make 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.740
 brines densities quantities 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.740
 purchased by products 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.740
 we feel better by being ready we go 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.530
 able to proceed with the season by 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.169
 injection in this we will weigh the ham 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.720
 to determine the amount of a saumur 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.289
 injected in this example for a ham 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.069
 who is receptive to 506 we pump it to 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.650
 10% 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.740
 we will put 700 will extend sow but 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.860
 then it will be enough to do 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.050
 addition 7 kg 500 plus 750 grams 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.520
 of saumur to know what should be the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.530
 ham weight 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.530
 once salty 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.819
 as you can see in the 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.800
 big black the technician has a lot 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:28.690
 less quickly so as to put the 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.690
 amount of salmon needed 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.510
 Oh 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.980
 during bridging in two and for 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.860
 determine if the amount of his wall is 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.860
 sufficient if it is not 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:48.810
 will give some small conflicts for 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:51.410
 perfect this season the ham 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.120
 and and immersion in brine 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.000
 provisional we will move to the 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.700
 demonstration of the molding will want to make 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.970
 demonstration in a ham mill 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:07.410
 the other singer author we will put 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:10.830
 so movies it will allow me a 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:14.070
 demolding easier then as the 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.200
 technician does it after sinking f 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.710
 gelatin to favor the 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.170
 suppression 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.490
 he reconstitutes this ham and come 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:26.100
 slip into the mold and then the year 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.550
 so that you will not find yourself 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.570
 in pole position 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:37.190
 this operation is delicate because it 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.190
 will determine and the mother-in-law 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:49.690
 this is to put the cold in 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:57.520
 So now it was in before the 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:59.590
 others we wanted to make a 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.200
 cooking simulation but you 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.510
 understand well we occupy a ham 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:09.400
 not a day is so cooking to 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:12.480
 room temperature will be 85 degrees to 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:16.690
 steam for a hearty cooking 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:20.260
 programmed in this case at 66 degrees this is 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:22.900
 why do we put a probe in the 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:26.670
 jargon that will stop the oven as soon as 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.670
 it's temperature will be reached 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:49.360
 be careful the probe be well placed at 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:50.410
 ham heart after about two 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.960
 cooking hours 

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:56.290
 the hams are out and left 

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:59.830
 rest between 15 and 20 minutes then they 

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:03.150
 are then pressed large park rank in 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.150
 respecting a rest period
