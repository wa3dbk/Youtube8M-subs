Dante Exum and Andrew Wiggins and I

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.270 
Dante Exum and Andrew Wiggins and I
didn't<00:01:34.020> want<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.979> series

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
didn't want to do that in this series

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.649 
didn't want to do that in this series
because<00:01:35.759> I've<00:01:35.909> been<00:01:36.119> seeing<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.450> lot<00:01:36.630> of

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
because I've been seeing a lot of

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.749 
because I've been seeing a lot of
comments<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.920> been<00:01:37.950> saying<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.579> this

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
comments that have been saying that this

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.940 
comments that have been saying that this
team<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.000> already<00:01:39.540> pretty<00:01:39.900> strong<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.619> I

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
team is already pretty strong and I

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.889 
team is already pretty strong and I
didn't<00:01:41.310> want<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.090> straight-up<00:01:42.509> deal

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
didn't want to do that straight-up deal

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.780 
didn't want to do that straight-up deal
because<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> felt<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.340> would<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.670> been

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
because I felt like it would have been

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.090 
because I felt like it would have been
unfair<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.140> point<00:01:46.439> off<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.619> series

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
unfair and at this point off the series

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.399 
unfair and at this point off the series

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
guards on this team and the one position

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.080 
guards on this team and the one position
where<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.320> feel<00:03:14.739> we<00:03:15.070> were<00:03:15.250> lacking<00:03:15.489> is<00:03:16.060> the

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
where I feel we were lacking is the

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.660 
where I feel we were lacking is the
small<00:03:16.660> forward<00:03:16.989> position<00:03:17.410> so<00:03:18.010> now<00:03:18.040> we<00:03:18.280> got

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
small forward position so now we got

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.490 
small forward position so now we got
Kawhi<00:03:18.970> Leonard<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.540> Andrew<00:03:20.260> Wiggins

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
Kawhi Leonard and Andrew Wiggins

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.770 
Kawhi Leonard and Andrew Wiggins
occupying<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:22.269> should<00:03:22.540> make<00:03:22.720> for

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
occupying that and that should make for

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.720 
occupying that and that should make for
an<00:03:23.080> interesting<00:03:23.620> dynamic<00:03:23.830> between<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.580> two

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
an interesting dynamic between the two

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.090 
an interesting dynamic between the two
fighting<00:03:25.480> for<00:03:25.690> minutes<00:03:26.019> out<00:03:26.200> there<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.920> of

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
fighting for minutes out there and of

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.819 
fighting for minutes out there and of
course<00:03:27.209> raising<00:03:28.209> each<00:03:28.390> other's<00:03:28.780> game<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.680> is

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
course raising each other's game that is

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.039 
course raising each other's game that is
to<00:03:29.980> game<00:03:30.160> plan<00:03:30.400> out<00:03:30.610> this<00:03:30.850> trade<00:03:31.209> hopefully

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
to game plan out this trade hopefully

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.539 
to game plan out this trade hopefully
it's<00:03:32.170> going<00:03:32.380> to<00:03:32.470> work<00:03:32.680> out<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.250> hopefully

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
it's going to work out and hopefully

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.880 
it's going to work out and hopefully
we're<00:03:34.150> not<00:03:34.180> going<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.690> have<00:03:34.840> players<00:03:35.140> unhappy

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
we're not going to have players unhappy

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.069 
we're not going to have players unhappy
with<00:03:36.070> their<00:03:36.250> playing<00:03:36.489> time<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:37.000> this<00:03:37.209> team<00:03:37.510> but

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
with their playing time on this team but

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.840 
with their playing time on this team but
as<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.350> can<00:03:38.470> see<00:03:38.530> Kawhi<00:03:39.070> Leonard<00:03:39.489> has

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
as you can see Kawhi Leonard has

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.330 
as you can see Kawhi Leonard has
certainly<00:03:40.360> stepped<00:03:40.720> up<00:03:40.900> his<00:03:41.079> game<00:03:41.140> ever<00:03:41.890> since

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
certainly stepped up his game ever since

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.520 
certainly stepped up his game ever since
