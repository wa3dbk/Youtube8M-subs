00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.260 
my name is Ben Noble I'm coming here

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.260 
my name is Ben Noble I'm coming here
from<00:00:12.440> Phoenix<00:00:12.710> Arizona<00:00:13.070> I<00:00:13.670> was<00:00:14.000> in<00:00:14.180> a

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.270 
from Phoenix Arizona I was in a

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.369 
from Phoenix Arizona I was in a
motorcycle<00:00:14.570> accident

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
motorcycle accident

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.290 
motorcycle accident
the<00:00:15.500> damage<00:00:15.889> was<00:00:16.070> just<00:00:16.340> too<00:00:16.520> extensive<00:00:16.820> and

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
the damage was just too extensive and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.960 
the damage was just too extensive and
ultimately<00:00:18.170> they<00:00:18.439> had<00:00:18.680> to<00:00:18.950> remove<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:19.790> leg

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
ultimately they had to remove the leg

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.179 
ultimately they had to remove the leg
the<00:00:20.360> doctor<00:00:20.720> said<00:00:20.990> that<00:00:21.020> when<00:00:21.619> you<00:00:21.650> lose<00:00:22.040> your

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
the doctor said that when you lose your

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.510 
the doctor said that when you lose your
leg<00:00:22.430> and<00:00:22.790> it's<00:00:22.970> kind<00:00:23.390> of<00:00:23.650> planned<00:00:24.650> like<00:00:25.340> you

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
leg and it's kind of planned like you

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.130 
leg and it's kind of planned like you
know<00:00:25.640> whether<00:00:25.880> you're<00:00:26.150> a<00:00:26.180> diabetic<00:00:26.570> patient

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
know whether you're a diabetic patient

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.640 
know whether you're a diabetic patient
and<00:00:27.320> you<00:00:27.410> they<00:00:27.949> take<00:00:28.220> it<00:00:28.400> off<00:00:28.520> your<00:00:29.300> body

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
and you they take it off your body

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.170 
and you they take it off your body
understands<00:00:30.650> what's<00:00:31.039> going<00:00:31.340> on<00:00:31.490> but<00:00:31.880> because

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
understands what's going on but because

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.100 
understands what's going on but because
mine<00:00:32.419> I<00:00:32.449> just<00:00:32.870> lost<00:00:33.199> my<00:00:33.530> leg<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:35.420> bone<00:00:35.629> kept

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
mine I just lost my leg the bone kept

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.500 
mine I just lost my leg the bone kept
trying<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.500> grow<00:00:36.769> to<00:00:37.190> fix<00:00:37.460> a<00:00:37.580> broken<00:00:37.730> leg<00:00:38.180> and

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
trying to grow to fix a broken leg and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.140 
trying to grow to fix a broken leg and
there<00:00:39.019> was<00:00:39.110> no<00:00:39.230> leg<00:00:39.470> to<00:00:39.650> fix<00:00:39.920> so<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:40.940> whole

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
there was no leg to fix so the whole

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.139 
there was no leg to fix so the whole
bottom<00:00:41.690> of<00:00:41.930> my<00:00:42.140> stump<00:00:42.590> turned<00:00:43.010> into<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.820> big

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
bottom of my stump turned into a big

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.060 
bottom of my stump turned into a big
massive<00:00:44.390> bone<00:00:44.660> I've<00:00:45.170> had<00:00:45.500> about<00:00:45.680> four

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
massive bone I've had about four

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.610 
massive bone I've had about four
revision<00:00:46.640> surgery<00:00:47.059> since<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:47.750> each<00:00:48.290> time

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
revision surgery since and each time

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.470 
revision surgery since and each time
they<00:00:48.890> they<00:00:49.219> take<00:00:49.399> it<00:00:49.579> a<00:00:49.670> little<00:00:49.879> bit<00:00:50.180> further

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
they they take it a little bit further

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.750 
they they take it a little bit further
up<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.020> every<00:00:51.320> time<00:00:51.500> I<00:00:51.559> have<00:00:51.920> one<00:00:52.160> I've<00:00:52.520> got<00:00:52.670> to

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
up so every time I have one I've got to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.459 
up so every time I have one I've got to
get<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.879> new<00:00:53.059> socket<00:00:53.390> because<00:00:53.930> it<00:00:54.079> doesn't<00:00:54.320> fit

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
get a new socket because it doesn't fit

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.310 
get a new socket because it doesn't fit
anymore<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.149> it's<00:00:56.329> been<00:00:56.809> about<00:00:56.899> five

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
anymore and so it's been about five

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.770 
anymore and so it's been about five
years<00:00:57.350> now<00:00:57.950> but<00:00:58.340> I<00:00:58.489> really<00:00:58.940> haven't<00:00:59.239> used<00:00:59.539> my

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
years now but I really haven't used my

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.660 
years now but I really haven't used my
leg<00:00:59.989> much<00:01:00.260> at<00:01:00.410> all<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:00.800> this<00:01:01.460> is<00:01:01.640> a

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
leg much at all so this is a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.430 
leg much at all so this is a
high-fidelity<00:01:02.030> imager<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:02.930> this<00:01:03.140> allows<00:01:03.410> us

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
high-fidelity imager and this allows us

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.950 
high-fidelity imager and this allows us
to<00:01:03.949> adjust<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.580> amount<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:04.940> pressure<00:01:05.210> we<00:01:05.930> can

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
to adjust the amount of pressure we can

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.859 
to adjust the amount of pressure we can
measure<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.560> pressure<00:01:06.710> with<00:01:07.070> sensors<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.869> we

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
measure the pressure with sensors and we

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.139 
measure the pressure with sensors and we
allow<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.800> tissue<00:01:10.039> to<00:01:10.460> come<00:01:10.789> through<00:01:11.030> the

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
allow the tissue to come through the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.180 
allow the tissue to come through the
windows<00:01:11.509> the<00:01:11.539> spaces<00:01:12.289> in<00:01:12.500> between<00:01:12.530> these

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
windows the spaces in between these

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.420 
windows the spaces in between these
paddles<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.020> we<00:01:15.020> can<00:01:15.140> either<00:01:15.260> scan<00:01:15.680> or<00:01:16.010> cast

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
paddles and we can either scan or cast

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.210 
paddles and we can either scan or cast
the<00:01:17.390> limb<00:01:17.570> utilizing<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:18.409> device<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.070> then

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
the limb utilizing this device and then

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.880 
the limb utilizing this device and then
once<00:01:19.520> we<00:01:20.240> have<00:01:20.420> everything<00:01:20.659> in<00:01:20.900> place<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:21.740> can

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
once we have everything in place you can

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.649 
once we have everything in place you can
see<00:01:22.070> this<00:01:22.220> is<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.460> shape<00:01:22.729> of<00:01:22.880> an<00:01:23.000> actual<00:01:23.299> limb

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
see this is the shape of an actual limb

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.050 
see this is the shape of an actual limb
that<00:01:23.840> was<00:01:24.020> measured<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:25.310> then<00:01:25.549> from<00:01:25.759> there<00:01:25.880> we

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
that was measured and then from there we

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.789 
that was measured and then from there we
can<00:01:26.180> go<00:01:26.299> ahead<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.540> create<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.530> actual

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
can go ahead and create the actual

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.310 
can go ahead and create the actual
interface<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:29.390> you've<00:01:29.540> been<00:01:29.720> working<00:01:30.080> on<00:01:30.200> you

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
interface and you've been working on you

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.530 
interface and you've been working on you
now<00:01:30.439> getting<00:01:30.770> me<00:01:30.890> fitted<00:01:31.310> with<00:01:31.520> his<00:01:32.030> new<00:01:32.270> high

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
now getting me fitted with his new high

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.300 
now getting me fitted with his new high
fidelity<00:01:32.750> socket<00:01:33.530> hoping<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.070> it's<00:01:34.189> gonna

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
fidelity socket hoping that it's gonna

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.340 
fidelity socket hoping that it's gonna
make<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.549> big<00:01:34.790> difference<00:01:34.970> for<00:01:35.270> me<00:01:35.600> in<00:01:35.720> terms<00:01:35.990> of

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
make a big difference for me in terms of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.560 
make a big difference for me in terms of
my<00:01:36.920> walking<00:01:37.220> or<00:01:37.610> getting<00:01:37.909> me<00:01:38.090> up<00:01:38.180> out<00:01:38.360> of<00:01:38.390> this

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
my walking or getting me up out of this

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.630 
my walking or getting me up out of this
chair<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.290> getting<00:01:39.530> me<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.770> little<00:01:40.340> bit<00:01:40.460> more

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
chair and getting me a little bit more

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.760 
chair and getting me a little bit more
active<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.840> end<00:01:41.960> of<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.049> femur<00:01:42.259> is<00:01:42.530> right

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
active so the end of the femur is right

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.289 
active so the end of the femur is right
there<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:43.400> what<00:01:43.549> we're<00:01:43.700> really<00:01:43.729> trying<00:01:44.210> to

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
there and so what we're really trying to

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.450 
there and so what we're really trying to
do<00:01:44.420> is<00:01:44.450> control<00:01:44.930> this<00:01:45.079> femur<00:01:45.320> as<00:01:45.530> best<00:01:45.770> we<00:01:45.860> can

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
do is control this femur as best we can

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.980 
do is control this femur as best we can
and<00:01:46.549> just<00:01:47.150> trying<00:01:47.329> to<00:01:47.450> just<00:01:47.780> trying<00:01:47.930> to

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
and just trying to just trying to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.679 
and just trying to just trying to
contain<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.560> soft<00:01:48.770> tissue<00:01:49.329> and<00:01:50.329> that's<00:01:50.479> a

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
contain the soft tissue and that's a

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.789 
contain the soft tissue and that's a
that's<00:01:50.900> a<00:01:51.079> you<00:01:51.350> know<00:01:51.439> it's<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.619> pretty

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
that same bucket type socket where your

that same bucket type socket where your

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
your legs just in the bucket so this is

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.490 
your legs just in the bucket so this is
the<00:02:13.549> first<00:02:13.850> time<00:02:14.090> I've<00:02:14.570> really<00:02:14.900> seen

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
the first time I've really seen

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.830 
the first time I've really seen
something<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.310> was<00:02:16.519> different<00:02:17.480> from<00:02:17.750> that

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
something that was different from that

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.020 
something that was different from that
you<00:02:18.260> can<00:02:18.410> see<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> tissue<00:02:18.860> bulging<00:02:19.489> out<00:02:19.670> of

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
you can see the tissue bulging out of

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.990 
you can see the tissue bulging out of
the<00:02:20.450> interface<00:02:21.020> from<00:02:21.800> various<00:02:22.190> angles

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
the interface from various angles

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.330 
the interface from various angles
and<00:02:23.120> what<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.510> allows<00:02:23.810> us<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.140> do<00:02:24.320> is<00:02:24.740> allows

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
and what this allows us to do is allows

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.010 
and what this allows us to do is allows
us<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.670> get<00:02:25.820> in<00:02:25.940> closer<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.510> where<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.750> bone<00:02:26.990> is

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
us to get in closer to where the bone is

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.590 
us to get in closer to where the bone is
inside<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.040> lock<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:28.850> place<00:02:29.000> as<00:02:29.330> opposed

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
inside and lock it in place as opposed

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600 
inside and lock it in place as opposed
to<00:02:29.660> allowing<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.200> move<00:02:30.440> back<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.710> forth<00:02:31.100> so

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
to allowing it to move back and forth so

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.430 
to allowing it to move back and forth so
if<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.850> hold<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.300> leg<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:32.660> place<00:02:32.870> go<00:02:33.170> ahead<00:02:33.200> and

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
if I hold the leg in place go ahead and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.430 
if I hold the leg in place go ahead and
move<00:02:33.530> around<00:02:33.680> then<00:02:34.180> if<00:02:35.180> we<00:02:35.960> put<00:02:36.140> on<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.410> old

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
move around then if we put on the old

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.260 
move around then if we put on the old
prosthesis<00:02:37.070> I'd<00:02:37.430> be<00:02:37.550> able<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.850> hold<00:02:38.030> this

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
prosthesis I'd be able to hold this

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.240 
prosthesis I'd be able to hold this
motionless<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.260> he'd<00:02:39.680> be<00:02:39.800> moving<00:02:40.070> all<00:02:40.220> around

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
motionless and he'd be moving all around

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.670 
motionless and he'd be moving all around
inside<00:02:40.970> there<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.720> socket<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.230> moving<00:02:42.500> with

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
inside there the socket is moving with

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.650 
inside there the socket is moving with
him<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.220> makes<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:43.670> feel<00:02:43.790> more<00:02:43.970> connected<00:02:44.300> to

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
him that makes it feel more connected to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.010 
him that makes it feel more connected to
him

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
him

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.520 
him
it<00:02:45.320> gives<00:02:45.680> him<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.160> lot<00:02:46.460> more<00:02:47.210> stability<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:48.080> it

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
it gives him a lot more stability and it

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.380 
it gives him a lot more stability and it
also<00:02:48.710> allows<00:02:49.100> him<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.340> use<00:02:49.520> less<00:02:49.790> energy<00:02:49.820> when

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
also allows him to use less energy when

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.360 
also allows him to use less energy when
he<00:02:50.510> walks<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.500> I'm<00:02:51.590> really<00:02:51.770> pleased<00:02:52.130> with

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
great I felt real stable when walking I

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.540 
great I felt real stable when walking I
didn't<00:03:00.140> really<00:03:00.380> have<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.680> look<00:03:00.860> so<00:03:01.160> much<00:03:01.220> at<00:03:01.520> my

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
didn't really have to look so much at my
foot<00:03:02.230> because<00:03:03.230> it's<00:03:03.770> it's<00:03:04.100> tight<00:03:04.400> up<00:03:04.670> here<00:03:05.090> it
