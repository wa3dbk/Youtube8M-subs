00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
here this is nice look at all this sign

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.760 
here this is nice look at all this sign
at<00:07:17.120> all<00:07:17.330> by<00:07:17.660> all<00:07:18.320> the<00:07:18.920> time<00:07:19.310> I<00:07:20.620> think<00:07:21.620> there's

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.770 
at all by all the time I think there's

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:22.750 
at all by all the time I think there's
still<00:07:21.980> some<00:07:22.160> over<00:07:22.580> here

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:22.760 
still some over here

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.370 
still some over here

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:26.660 
just turned on which is terrible because

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.090 
just turned on which is terrible because
you<00:07:26.930> guys<00:07:27.080> probably<00:07:27.410> want<00:07:27.620> to<00:07:27.740> hear<00:07:27.830> that<00:07:28.010> in

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.100 
you guys probably want to hear that in

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.590 
you guys probably want to hear that in
the<00:07:28.160> background<00:07:28.190> that's<00:07:28.760> just<00:07:29.030> absolutely

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:29.600 
the background that's just absolutely

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.000 
the background that's just absolutely
fantastic<00:07:31.840> and<00:07:32.840> I<00:07:33.020> think<00:07:33.050> that<00:07:33.470> might<00:07:33.650> be<00:07:33.830> it

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.010 
fantastic and I think that might be it

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.940 
fantastic and I think that might be it
for<00:07:34.040> the<00:07:34.400> iron<00:07:34.550> I<00:07:35.030> guess<00:07:35.330> so

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:35.950 
for the iron I guess so

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.440 
for the iron I guess so
there's<00:07:36.950> a<00:07:37.070> whole<00:07:37.460> other<00:07:37.490> path<00:07:38.030> over<00:07:38.300> there

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:38.450 
there's a whole other path over there

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:43.180 
there's a whole other path over there
I'm<00:07:38.600> gonna<00:07:38.780> get<00:07:38.960> desired<00:07:39.380> as<00:07:39.620> well<00:07:42.190> now

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.190 
I'm gonna get desired as well now

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.800 
I'm gonna get desired as well now
there's<00:07:43.400> so<00:07:43.670> much<00:07:43.850> of<00:07:44.030> the<00:07:44.150> sign<00:07:44.360> and<00:07:44.510> I'm<00:07:44.630> not

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:44.810 
there's so much of the sign and I'm not

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.080 
there's so much of the sign and I'm not
even<00:07:44.930> lying<00:07:45.230> right<00:07:45.500> now<00:07:45.730> probably<00:07:46.730> makes<00:07:46.940> a

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.090 
even lying right now probably makes a

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.430 
even lying right now probably makes a
good<00:07:47.450> old-fashioned<00:07:48.490> armor<00:07:49.490> with<00:07:49.940> this<00:07:50.440> then
