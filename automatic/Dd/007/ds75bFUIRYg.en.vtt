00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.859
 you played basketball then minecraft one 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.710
 electronic game that allows you to 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.630
 make constructions using block blocks that 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.059
 You take care of the world itself. It's the same. 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.220
 world square valley daycare was created 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.170
 by Markos alexi persson and thomas 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.730
 rochamar lot of that is far more to 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.189
 to pronounce and everyone already knows 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.470
 it's a lot easier then write down one 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.210
 programmer who founded the strawberry and 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.710
 also the famous minecraft for whom 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.210
 still does not know that today's 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.380
 community in the day-care center but in another 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.510
 finally maine game 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.640
 teach magner so building game and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.800
 block excavation in which player is a 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.260
 miner looking for ores digging 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.890
 tunnels by the sea and making 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.559
 for me it's the same and it's coming back there 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.450
 minecraft then the note started to 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.270
 develop the manifesto around the day 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.809
 May 10, 2009 and the first version 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.590
 beta came out in 2009 fast not much 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.149
 fast 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.570
 however the full version of the game was 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.550
 released after two years there on 11 and 18 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.359
 November 2011 then as you already 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.610
 said 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.979
 minecraft a game basically made of 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.990
 box with the landscapes also made of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.090
 blocks can be removed and placed 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.770
 in other places the most amazing of all 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.320
 that these blocks you can do 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.600
 combinations that I walk so it matters almost 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.369
 swords in which hundreds of other things 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.750
 for decoration also to help 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.360
 survive on imip 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.210
 Then you saw the game so be careful and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.040
 without a visible goal just imagine 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.290
 This game will not prepare, it will not do. 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.460
 success in September 2010 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.540
 minecraft manages to sell another 20 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.250
 copies this in just 24 hours and five 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.440
 thousand copies and nation said 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.810
 Of course you have not only this, but minecraft 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.150
 11 million users registered in the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.970
 official site of the games of beijing by 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.280
 hundred of them bought the game then more 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.430
 of 2.9 billion lives 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.560
 plus 40 million dollars and 1 million 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.780
 Fuck true, I believe I just 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.090
 I was locked in the bbb's house by LÃ­dia 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.729
 I looked at a $ 40 million yet 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.560
 who gave birth so seeing champions has already given 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.170
 to realize that the game is a success 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.360
 even without the investment of a 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.000
 major producer of games now a 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.680
 the millionaire marketing campaign 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.989
 minecraft has become one of the largest 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.860
 games phenomena independent of the 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.380
 last years 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.390
 in fact that certain game stay that 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.290
 many fans become known to the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.600
 Internet 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.010
 by posting videos giving tips and 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.880
 telling their experiences in the world 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.100
 virtual 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.980
 many of them still work as 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.870
 youtube and some became so known 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.550
 that today they can live through it 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.890
 example in brazil are the gamers 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.750
 even if you can not reach 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.970
 up to almost 12 million chips 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.010
 function exactly the two if 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.670
 have made great icons of youtube games 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.010
 from brazil 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.079
 imagine you then worked cava 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.370
 making videos we play is a dream come true 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.459
 do not even tell me 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.830
 and it was not only the two not and several others 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.260
 which also became known 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.460
 but we're going to another club 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.250
 This is still a success, as it says good. 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:13.460
 Do not wake me up, it was not as sure as 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.950
 before but he still does much more 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.710
 very successful and tourism 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.630
 and for those who are floating, do not know 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.480
 nowadays you can play more investe 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:29.000
 in xbox 360 is a good your droid ice 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:33.260
 has rolled goers all over 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.830
 Evil face tells me my free everything 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.570
 this month of playing all this success 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.120
 how do you explain the success that the 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.630
 minecraft made this look so 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.750
 old-fashioned congra so bad a good key 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.300
 very important in order to succeed is 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.590
 society in the game because as you said 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.690
 need to explore a new world 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.360
 practically mixed but a goal 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.180
 right on the play explore the world as he 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.130
 you want it to be necessary to place 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.220
 the survival and the first place but 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.200
 still rather agree 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.130
 this key piece also reminds 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.290
 gta 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.239
 the player has the freedom to explore the 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.550
 world the way you want and let's go 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.239
 agree that most of the players in the 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.000
 gta 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.130
 even I did not do missions to stay 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.140
 walking the same retarded stealing cars 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.850
 and destroying things 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.260
 That's it, but I'm going to make a 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.630
 question for you who is watching 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.210
 I know you can stay hours. 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.730
 playing minecraft but you could 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.560
 to spend all this time studying 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.419
 stockholm in sweden 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.360
 minecraft is already part of the curriculum 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.850
 students aged 13 and 14 years and 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.190
 despite the protests of some parents 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.930
 the game ended up being chosen as a way 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.450
 in school 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.760
 a college heck teacher says 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.040
 that minecraft is not so different from 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.250
 art and craft class 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.100
 then the organization of nations 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.050
 the minecraft is already inserted as 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.130
 a subject in several other schools in the 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.660
 All the world 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.700
 it's true let's hope they do 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.800
 That Brazil is also in the face is more 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.220
 easy to learn to fly from what happened 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.120
 but we will return somebody then seeing the 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.090
 need 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.310
 of new objectives, the players were 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.370
 creating modes for minecraft like 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.070
 capture the flag hunger games and 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.440
 sabotage that enables play a 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.169
 Most fun way with your friends 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.300
 in a way of seeing is this is true 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.169
 we can not forget the way we 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.389
 add target animal monsters 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.889
 textures some textures estimates have 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.210
 lost by neymar closed the game with a 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.590
 more real appearance 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.290
 but I will not talk about it because 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.660
 Are you already bald of knowing? 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.539
 so the video is coming to the 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.449
 end, but by playing in the universe by 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:53.060
 first time you may wonder which 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.820
 The purpose of this in your answer is 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.590
 to explore a new world and the 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.960
 same time survive 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.550
 otherwise the game has several 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.070
 goals that goes beyond your 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.710
 creativity thus making it possible to 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.199
 game with many goals but seeing the 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.520
 far and made a difficult game but let's 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.530
 play you realize that it is very 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.150
 interesting at the same time said before 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.190
 so if you are thinking of playing the 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.880
 time since it can be a single passage 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.160
 one way 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.110
 That's it, so if you liked the video 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.270
 be sure to evaluate by clicking 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.770
 liked it and add your favorites 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.419
 if you think we missed something 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.760
 exists in the comments 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:30.760
 the cup still the leaving brother was
