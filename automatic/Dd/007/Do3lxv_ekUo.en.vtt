graduate<00:00:19.410> student<00:00:19.910> how<00:00:20.910> did<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.180> start<00:00:21.449> like

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
graduate student how did it start like

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.820 
graduate student how did it start like
there<00:00:21.960> must<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.199> been<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.410> beginning

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
there must have been a beginning

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.130 
there must have been a beginning
founding<00:00:23.430> idea<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.300> day<00:00:24.449> before<00:00:24.660> which<00:00:24.930> there

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
founding idea the day before which there

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.720 
founding idea the day before which there
was<00:00:25.260> no<00:00:25.289> bike<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:25.949> something<00:00:26.369> happened

was no bike and then something happened
so<00:00:27.240> let's<00:00:27.449> think<00:00:27.660> about<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.080> know<00:00:28.230> that

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
so let's think about it we know that

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.349 
so let's think about it we know that
fifty<00:00:29.189> percent<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.490> people<00:00:29.609> commute<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.240> work

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
by bicycle and how do we get even more

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.760 
by bicycle and how do we get even more
people<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.360> bikes<00:00:33.540> well<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.230> might<00:00:34.350> make<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
people on bikes well we might make the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.950 
people on bikes well we might make the
bike<00:00:34.920> smarter<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.760> make<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> bike<00:00:36.239> something

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
bike smarter we make the bike something

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.840 
bike smarter we make the bike something
that<00:00:37.110> can<00:00:37.290> become<00:00:37.410> your<00:00:37.620> personal<00:00:37.739> trainer<00:00:38.250> we

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
make the bike something that it will

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.840 
make the bike something that it will
increase<00:00:40.620> your<00:00:40.860> range<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> elderly

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
increase your range so the elderly

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
talk to me a little bit about why

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.210 
talk to me a little bit about why
there's<00:01:34.350> such<00:01:34.530> interest<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.009> all<00:01:35.100> these

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
there's such interest in all these

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.160 
there's such interest in all these
cities<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:36.509> that's<00:01:36.659> interest<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
cities I think that's interest at the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.870 
cities I think that's interest at the
moment<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.590> we're<00:01:37.979> moving<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.610> an<00:01:38.700> area

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
moment because we're moving to an area

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.780 
moment because we're moving to an area
where<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.180> need<00:01:39.390> more<00:01:40.049> green<00:01:40.259> transportation

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
where we need more green transportation

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.760 
where we need more green transportation
technologies<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.630> excites<00:01:43.049> people<00:01:43.170> because

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
technologies this excites people because

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.550 
technologies this excites people because
it's<00:01:43.920> easily<00:01:44.369> retrofitted<00:01:44.610> into<00:01:45.149> any<00:01:45.420> bike<00:01:45.659> so

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
it's easily retrofitted into any bike so

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.139 
it's easily retrofitted into any bike so
it's<00:01:46.649> something<00:01:46.950> which<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.700> see<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> hub

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
it's something which if we see the hub

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.580 
it's something which if we see the hub
here<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:48.960> all<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> components

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
here we have all of the components

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.380 
here we have all of the components
packed<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.159> people<00:01:50.880> don't<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.270> buy<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
packed in people don't have to buy a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.030 
packed in people don't have to buy a
whole<00:01:51.630> bike<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.320> buy<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.470> wheels<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
whole bike I can just buy the wheels and

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.800 
whole bike I can just buy the wheels and
this<00:01:53.340> excites<00:01:53.729> mares<00:01:54.000> because<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.509> means<00:01:54.659> that

that it sits on a network have you found
the<00:02:43.300> communications<00:02:43.959> challenge<00:02:44.410> interesting

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
the communications challenge interesting

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.710 
the communications challenge interesting
at<00:02:45.430> times<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.790> explain<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.180> people<00:02:46.209> what's<00:02:46.570> so

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
different or do they have to try it to

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.740 
different or do they have to try it to
believe<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:49.000> suddenly<00:02:49.330> have<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.540> try<00:02:49.720> it

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
to believe it but the communication here

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.090 
to believe it but the communication here
I<00:02:51.700> think<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.410> allowing<00:02:53.410> people<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.680> understand

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
I think is allowing people to understand

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.120 
I think is allowing people to understand
how<00:02:54.220> easy<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.610> is<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.880> use<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.890> know<00:02:57.010> how

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
how easy it is to use and you know how

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.710 
how easy it is to use and you know how
it<00:02:57.250> becomes<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.610> seamless<00:02:57.970> integration<00:02:58.330> into

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
it becomes a seamless integration into

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.000 
it becomes a seamless integration into
your<00:02:58.840> life<00:02:59.020> through<00:02:59.410> just<00:02:59.650> controlling

back of the bike giving you a boost when

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.330 
back of the bike giving you a boost when
you<00:03:04.180> need<00:03:04.360> it<00:03:04.560> using<00:03:05.560> simple<00:03:05.860> metaphors<00:03:06.250> like
