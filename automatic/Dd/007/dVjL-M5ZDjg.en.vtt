scary blank paper and it already has

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.000 
scary blank paper and it already has
this<00:01:08.070> energy<00:01:08.490> about<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.920> have

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
this energy about it and I have

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.410 
this energy about it and I have
different<00:01:11.430> hardnesses<00:01:11.970> different

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
different hardnesses different

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.660 
different hardnesses different
thicknesses<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.290> already<00:01:13.470> has<00:01:13.920> depth<00:01:14.340> things

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
thicknesses it already has depth things

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.280 
thicknesses it already has depth things
are<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:15.030> forward<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.720> back<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.140> there's

are going forward and back and there's
all<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.590> energy<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> I've<00:01:18.210> gotten<00:01:18.659> rid<00:01:18.750> of

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
all this energy so I've gotten rid of

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.350 
all this energy so I've gotten rid of
scary<00:01:19.229> blank<00:01:19.560> paper<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.310> now<00:01:20.700> I'll<00:01:20.909> start<00:01:21.060> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
scary blank paper and now I'll start to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.060 
scary blank paper and now I'll start to
deal<00:01:21.570> with<00:01:21.720> my<00:01:21.900> subject<00:01:22.350> matter<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.740> little<00:01:22.920> bit

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
deal with my subject matter a little bit

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:44.550 
deal with my subject matter a little bit
more

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.640 

so<00:01:45.100> beautiful

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.660 

I<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:53.040> wanted<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.550> float<00:01:55.370> pretend<00:01:56.370> there's<00:01:56.610> a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
I just wanted to float pretend there's a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:24.089 
I just wanted to float pretend there's a
cast<00:01:56.940> shadow<00:01:57.090> here

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.020 

you're<00:02:24.609> not<00:02:24.760> dawdling<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.540> any<00:02:25.689> one<00:02:25.930> place

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
you're not dawdling in any one place

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.559 
you're not dawdling in any one place
ended<00:02:28.030> up<00:02:28.150> from<00:02:28.480> line<00:02:28.930> week<00:02:30.209> there's<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.329> little

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
ended up from line week there's a little

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:41.309 
ended up from line week there's a little
volume<00:02:36.749> cleaner<00:02:37.749> a<00:02:39.359> little<00:02:40.359> flap<00:02:40.659> so<00:02:41.139> there's

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
volume cleaner a little flap so there's

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:55.080 
volume cleaner a little flap so there's
some<00:02:41.500> structure<00:02:41.980> with<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.310> white<00:02:42.639> stuff<00:02:54.090> that

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
some structure with the white stuff that

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:09.839 
some structure with the white stuff that
was<00:02:55.299> black<00:03:07.859> said<00:03:08.859> I<00:03:08.919> got<00:03:09.069> a<00:03:09.099> lot<00:03:09.340> on<00:03:09.370> there<00:03:09.699> now

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
was black said I got a lot on there now

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.330 
was black said I got a lot on there now
use<00:03:10.000> soft<00:03:10.359> ones<00:03:10.599> so<00:03:11.079> soft<00:03:11.379> ones<00:03:11.620> really<00:03:12.040> move

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
use soft ones so soft ones really move

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.750 
use soft ones so soft ones really move
along<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:14.620> use<00:03:14.829> them<00:03:14.980> with<00:03:15.159> stumps

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
along that I can use them with stumps

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.520 
along that I can use them with stumps
that's<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.879> different<00:03:19.209> kind<00:03:19.329> of<00:03:19.540> line<00:03:19.719> or<00:03:20.260> mark

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
that's a different kind of line or mark

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.339 
that's a different kind of line or mark
in<00:03:20.680> there

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
in there

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.589 
in there
more<00:03:23.349> structure<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:25.120> if<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.269> want<00:03:25.449> to<00:03:25.510> get

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
more structure like if I want to get

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.229 
more structure like if I want to get
that<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.930> separate<00:03:26.349> from<00:03:26.530> that<00:03:26.769> there's

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
that to separate from that there's

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.099 
that to separate from that there's
stumps<00:03:28.239> like<00:03:28.389> you<00:03:28.540> were<00:03:28.689> doing<00:03:30.840> see<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.870> can

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
stumps like you were doing see I can

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.929 
stumps like you were doing see I can
still<00:03:32.290> see<00:03:32.439> the<00:03:32.590> activity<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.519> my<00:03:33.729> original

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:33.939 
still see the activity of my original

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.539 
still see the activity of my original
scribbling<00:03:34.780> that's<00:03:35.530> helping<00:03:35.889> separate<00:03:36.370> this

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
scribbling that's helping separate this

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.830 
scribbling that's helping separate this
from<00:03:36.819> this<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:39.340> still<00:03:39.549> feels<00:03:39.790> unified<00:03:40.419> to<00:03:40.689> it

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
from this but still feels unified to it

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.390 
from this but still feels unified to it
because<00:03:41.109> I<00:03:41.229> scribble<00:03:41.650> all<00:03:41.769> over<00:03:41.829> at<00:03:42.310> the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
because I scribble all over at the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.210 
because I scribble all over at the
beginning<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.840> now<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.019> erasers<00:03:44.739> are<00:03:45.069> not

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
beginning so now the erasers are not

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.289 
beginning so now the erasers are not
just<00:03:45.430> gonna<00:03:45.549> erase

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
just gonna erase

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.439 
just gonna erase
they're<00:03:46.479> gonna<00:03:46.599> also<00:03:46.840> make<00:03:47.259> marks<00:03:48.449> you're

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:49.449 
they're gonna also make marks you're

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.789 
they're gonna also make marks you're
gonna<00:03:49.569> kind<00:03:49.810> of<00:03:50.019> smear<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:52.379> but<00:03:53.379> if<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.590> don't

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
gonna kind of smear it but if you don't

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.559 
gonna kind of smear it but if you don't
get<00:03:53.979> much<00:03:54.220> on<00:03:54.459> there<00:03:54.729> at<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:54.970> start

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
get much on there at the start

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.229 
get much on there at the start
there'll<00:03:55.989> be<00:03:56.019> nothing<00:03:56.319> for<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:56.859> move<00:04:00.239> so

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
there'll be nothing for it to move so

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.879 
there'll be nothing for it to move so
this<00:04:01.449> really<00:04:01.659> loaded<00:04:02.290> now<00:04:02.470> see<00:04:02.680> it's<00:04:02.799> all

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
this really loaded now see it's all

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.849 
this really loaded now see it's all
shiny<00:04:03.159> so<00:04:04.030> this<00:04:04.419> is<00:04:04.659> actually<00:04:05.500> I'm<00:04:05.590> drawing

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
shiny so this is actually I'm drawing

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.339 
shiny so this is actually I'm drawing
with<00:04:05.979> it<00:04:06.310> now<00:04:06.759> if<00:04:06.849> I<00:04:06.969> want<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.329> pull<00:04:07.540> out<00:04:07.900> if<00:04:08.229> I

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
with it now if I want to pull out if I

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.409 
with it now if I want to pull out if I
