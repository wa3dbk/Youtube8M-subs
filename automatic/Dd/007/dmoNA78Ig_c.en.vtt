sorry<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.560> about<00:00:19.830> 700<00:00:20.580> right<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.289> if<00:00:22.890> we're

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
sorry is about 700 right so and if we're

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.320 
sorry is about 700 right so and if we're
doing<00:00:23.130> 40<00:00:23.609> 40<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.570> protein<00:00:25.050> carbs<00:00:25.680> fats

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
doing 40 40 this is protein carbs fats

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.370 
doing 40 40 this is protein carbs fats
40<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.420> 40<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.990> twenty<00:00:28.740> percent<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.429> 350<00:00:30.380> okay

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
40 and 40 and twenty percent is 350 okay

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.389 
40 and 40 and twenty percent is 350 okay
so<00:00:32.250> um<00:00:33.030> all<00:00:33.989> right<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> divide<00:00:34.770> proteins

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
so um all right so you divide proteins

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.720 
so um all right so you divide proteins
by<00:00:35.760> four<00:00:36.059> he<00:00:36.270> divided<00:00:36.570> carbs<00:00:37.140> by<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.829> you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
by four he divided carbs by for you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.380 
by four he divided carbs by for you
divide<00:00:38.969> fats<00:00:39.300> by<00:00:39.660> nine<00:00:40.309> and<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.210> get

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
divide fats by nine and that will get

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.290 
divide fats by nine and that will get
you<00:00:42.629> about<00:00:43.010> 175<00:00:44.010> grams<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.090> protein<00:00:46.399> 175<00:00:47.399> grams

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
you about 175 grams of protein 175 grams

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.810 
you about 175 grams of protein 175 grams
of<00:00:48.600> carbs<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:50.210> like<00:00:51.210> 38<00:00:51.660> grams<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.649> fat<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.309> guess

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
of carbs in like 38 grams of fat I guess

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.850 
of carbs in like 38 grams of fat I guess
if<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.059> were<00:00:54.149> rounding<00:00:54.629> here's<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> deal

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
if you were rounding here's the deal

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.260 
if you were rounding here's the deal
with<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.340> don't<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.579> if<00:00:56.699> y'all<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.090> see

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
with that I don't know if y'all can see

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.779 
with that I don't know if y'all can see
the<00:00:57.420> difference<00:00:57.949> once<00:00:58.949> again<00:00:59.100> these<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.460> both

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the difference once again these are both

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.560 
the difference once again these are both
very<00:01:00.329> general<00:01:00.989> ways<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.670> people<00:01:02.670> calculating

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
very general ways of people calculating

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.789 
very general ways of people calculating
macros<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:04.530> you're<00:01:04.680> just

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
macros like and like if you're just

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.340 
macros like and like if you're just
starting<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.369> bodybuilding<00:01:06.150> diet<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:07.020> look<00:01:07.229> at

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
starting a bodybuilding diet but look at

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.480 
starting a bodybuilding diet but look at
how<00:01:07.439> different<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.700> 40<00:01:09.659> 40<00:01:09.930> 20

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
how different they are like the 40 40 20

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.080 
how different they are like the 40 40 20
175<00:01:11.490> grams<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.939> protein<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:13.159> like<00:01:14.159> super<00:01:14.939> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
175 grams of protein is like super and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.649 
175 grams of protein is like super and
that's<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.930> right<00:01:16.200> now<00:01:16.549> in<00:01:17.549> prep<00:01:18.330> like

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
that's like like right now in prep like

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.620 
that's like like right now in prep like
I<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:19.080> go<00:01:19.200> I've<00:01:19.470> been<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.400> before<00:01:20.939> some<00:01:21.270> time<00:01:21.479> I

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
I can go I've been as before some time I

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.910 
I can go I've been as before some time I
know<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> play<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.740> things

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
know and you have to play with things

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.190 
know and you have to play with things
that's<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> thing<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.990> this<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that's the thing is like this is a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.570 
that's the thing is like this is a
really<00:01:25.500> good<00:01:25.619> starting<00:01:25.890> point<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.159> all<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.460> if

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
really good starting point is all but if

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.960 
really good starting point is all but if
you<00:01:26.900> if<00:01:27.900> you've<00:01:28.350> never<00:01:28.650> dieted<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.820> going

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you if you've never dieted this is going

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.969 
you if you've never dieted this is going
to<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> lot<00:01:30.390> more<00:01:30.420> difficult<00:01:31.170> than<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.710> one

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
to be a lot more difficult than this one

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.469 
to be a lot more difficult than this one
um<00:01:33.380> because<00:01:34.380> you'll<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.430> all<00:01:35.670> hungry<00:01:35.909> or<00:01:36.180> carbs

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
um because you'll be all hungry or carbs

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.090 
um because you'll be all hungry or carbs
will<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.689> lower<00:01:36.900> if<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.799> said<00:01:37.979> most

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
will be lower if you like I said most

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.429 
will be lower if you like I said most
people<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:39.180> way<00:01:39.450> higher<00:01:39.720> carbs<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.200> even

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
people have way higher carbs and even

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.550 
people have way higher carbs and even
that<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.040> down<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.490> 175<00:01:42.229> would<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.350> crazy

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
that so going down to 175 would be crazy

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.130 
that so going down to 175 would be crazy
for<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.950> lot<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.220> people<00:01:44.390> however<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.750> right
