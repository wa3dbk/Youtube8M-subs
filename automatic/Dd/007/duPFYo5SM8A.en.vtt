00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.860
 enter once again here in my 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.810
 desk and we enter 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.700

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.230
 ready for the third season towards the 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.300
 question and we can also notice that 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.690
 they have several options in the first 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.270
 we have judge multiplayer we have 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.790
 also to assign on sheet what 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.229
 it would be the facebook also to see in 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.210
 our record also what would be 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.040
 meet the max and we have the option to 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.320
 interesting example action we go there to 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.729
 options or settings 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.150
 wrong game let's see let's go 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.970
 to options in options because in 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.670
 configurations we have then for 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.550
 us configuring the questions to the 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.190
 number of questions that we have to 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.229
 we want that then I do go 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.009
 to leave it at 50 we also have the 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.800
 time for as soon as we want that 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:45.060
 we late that question let's go 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.400
 we can even leave it up to 60 30 and 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.990
 up to 30 nothing else we can only 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.640
 upload more than 30 seconds 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.010
 we also have the option to practice 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.300
 music and cheap place it again 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.630
 we have the option to start in 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.880
 facebook and we can see also 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.460
 that we can publish our record 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.350
 on facebook we have a multiplayer mode 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.049
 which I will not be teaching because 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.580
 internet is required and I do not have internet 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.250
 in these moments one will have what 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.860
 it would be the city we see that we have a 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.160
 nice interface and we have several options 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.870
 that would be the options of levels but 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.660
 we can notice that I have nothing else 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.550
 only the beginner option 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.849
 unlocked although we have the mode 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.250
 Knowing the way who said Robert saw 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.709
 who was saved in his room there master 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.530
 so well we have a single 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.780
 unlocked level that to unlock 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.709
 the other is required as to be read 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.920
 you must have 45 correct answers for 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.290
 to be able to unlock a knowledgeable mode for 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.469
 let's enter the beginner mode 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.909
 interface and how can we observe then 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:57.000
 you have an interface we have a little doll 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:00.329
 there and moving around reading the bible and 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.859
 says new beginner in questions I 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.109
 in zero wonder we carry in this 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.239
 At the moment we have a happy face 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.489
 we have a sad face we are going to see 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.379
 What about the faces because we will 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.079
 try to respond quickly because 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.370
 he understands we have many seconds left and I know 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.019
 with what elements of their encounters 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.019
 let's see let's stop 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.750
 but we see that the Christian caress was 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.790
 go ahead because then we have failed that 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.970
 says I mentioned the third son of adam and 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.970
 eva and we will choose it then 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.990
 and as we can see then we have 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.920
 accepted we have answered correctly 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.380
 says the biblical quote in 64 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.390
 26 in case you do not see any doubt of how good which one 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.760
 we would go to see it then we are going to 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.010
 look for it directly from the script and 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.160
 can modify and confirm as this one does 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.160
 do not 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.560
 it lives in snow because it was called that way 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.080
 to see another question 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.310
 because it is not shameful because we 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.349
 embarrassed in Paul the gospel 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.790
 because it's God's power says the first 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:14.270
 option because they are because it saves us the 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:18.350
 seduction that is the blessing for 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.750
 world let's choose the first one and it gives us 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.430
 the biblical quote Romans 116 is the 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:28.090
 answer because it is correct 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.090
 let's see another question let's see 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.300
 says father was 100 years old when he 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.550
 the yearned son was born let's go and 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.130
 let's say the third one and it gives us the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.699
 biblical quote let's answer now a 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.069
 but incorrectly we are going to read 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.500
 first because sometimes I am and makes 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:51.050
 certain sites without knowing let's read 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.349
 that he sent to a city descending from 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.030
 sky let's place that was jesus for 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.800
 to see that also the sad face is 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.610
 move along 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.069
 flaws that tells how we can take the 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.440
 sad face goodbye surprised gave the 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:09.050
 step ahead as you can see then 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.849
 in a new very very entertaining game 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.559
 really 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.889
 to know more about the infrastructure 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:19.679
 because this when we fail all the appointment 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.379
 biblical and we can investigate more and that 

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:23.879
 It would help us grow as 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:27.449
 in the knowledge of the word of God 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:29.849
 and what a good game because I also 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.919
 he was very surprised and every 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.289
 update brings better things just 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:38.719
 we go for the second season we have 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:41.280
 here they tell us and we hope more 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:44.669
 updates so good comfort 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.620
