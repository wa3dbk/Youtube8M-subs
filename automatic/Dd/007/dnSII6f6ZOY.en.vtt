a<00:00:47.640> little<00:00:47.789> closer<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.660> took<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:49.020> more

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
a little closer we took a little more

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.479 
a little closer we took a little more
time<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.899> next<00:00:51.899> record<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.739> know<00:00:52.890> think

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
time and next record just you know think

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.130 
time and next record just you know think
even<00:00:53.789> more<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.239> try<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.570> be<00:00:54.750> even<00:00:54.989> more

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
even more and try to be even more

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.310 
even more and try to be even more
creative<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.660> because<00:00:57.660> sometimes<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.170> get

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
creative and because sometimes you get

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.149 
creative and because sometimes you get
stuck<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.510> idea<00:01:02.270> but<00:01:03.860> when<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.979> look<00:01:05.100> back

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
stuck on one idea but when you look back

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.770 
stuck on one idea but when you look back
on<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.880> think<00:01:06.090> oh<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.299> could<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.659> done

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
on it you think oh I could have done

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.230 
on it you think oh I could have done
this<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.110> could<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.380> done<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.060> more

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
this I could have done that so the more

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.149 
this I could have done that so the more
you<00:01:09.270> think<00:01:09.420> about<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.590> while<00:01:10.979> you're

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you think about it while you're

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.770 
you think about it while you're
recording<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.820> before<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> record<00:01:12.390> it's

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
recording or before you record it's

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.710 
recording or before you record it's
better<00:01:13.280> sophie<00:01:14.280> was<00:01:14.310> better<00:01:14.580> even<00:01:14.909> will<00:01:15.150> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
better sophie was better even will to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.469 
better sophie was better even will to
recall<00:01:16.049> some<00:01:16.259> things<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:17.340> we'll<00:01:17.670> take<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
recall some things and then we'll take a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.590 
recall some things and then we'll take a
big<00:01:19.290> step<00:01:19.470> back<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:21.290> re-evaluate<00:01:22.400> yeah

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
big step back and then re-evaluate yeah

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.760 
big step back and then re-evaluate yeah
but<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> best<00:01:24.900> thing<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> could<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.619> if

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
but the best thing if you could do if

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.300 
but the best thing if you could do if
you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.430> without<00:01:26.580> recording<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
you can do that without recording it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.109 
you can do that without recording it
because<00:01:29.310> then<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.490> save<00:01:29.729> money<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:31.409> time<00:01:32.119> so

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
because then you save money and time so

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.490 
because then you save money and time so
that's<00:01:33.329> what<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> think<00:01:33.810> we're<00:01:33.960> getting<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
that's what I think we're getting a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.260 
that's what I think we're getting a
little<00:01:34.530> bit<00:01:34.950> better<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:37.130> thinking<00:01:38.130> more

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.410 

do<00:01:41.899> you<00:01:42.020> need<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:43.070> feel<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:44.179> pressure

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
do you need to to feel the pressure

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.910 
do you need to to feel the pressure
maybe<00:01:44.840> I<00:01:45.079> don't<00:01:45.140> know<00:01:45.259> because<00:01:45.439> a<00:01:45.590> record

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
maybe I don't know because a record

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.740 
maybe I don't know because a record

maybe writing is nice but recording

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.510 
maybe writing is nice but recording
under<00:02:05.270> pressure<00:02:05.509> it's<00:02:05.780> not<00:02:05.959> very<00:02:06.170> fun<00:02:06.520> so

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520
