00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.840
 or not 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.850
 how about friends and welcome to this 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.800
 new emblem this time I bring you 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.960
 a version number 2 of an emblem of 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.850
 zombies that came up two weeks ago 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.010
 obviously it's totally different and 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.779
 everything is nothing similar but what 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.640
 I go to that zombie emblem them 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.100
 he liked it too much so I said why 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.020
 I do not do anything similar, so here 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.020
 is this time what I bring 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.810
 is the island or rather the prison of 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.430
 alcatraz the san francisco you know 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.470
 those who made a somersault 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.540
 based on that position so I said 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.219
 why do not I do anything else before 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.690
 continue with the tutorial something that I 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.570
 I would like to tell you and it is obviously 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.000
 is not a portrait that is based as well as 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.949
 that 100% just there was just one 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.530
 image on google I based on that image 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.179
 of a cover of I do not know what it was I think that 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.219
 it was a movie or a documentary not 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.379
 I'm pretty sure that's what it was but 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.390
 based on that was that I did this for 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.730
 which I want to clarify so that 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.740
 do not expect something identical identical by 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.480
 still I think it looks pretty good is 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.220
 an emblem that I must also tell you and 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.530
 looks a little more on what is the card 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.030
 of player not so much in the weapon already see 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.220
 that there are comments in which I say 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.830
 Friends this emblem looks great 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.810
 your weapon with your player card or 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.820
 you know that kids this emblem luce 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.220
 more on your weapon not so much on your card 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.050
 player in this case looks more in the 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.640
 card not so much in the gun for even so 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.260
 I think it 's pretty good and it's worth 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.870
 very much worth it especially if they are fans of 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.610
 zombies for you to do and another 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.870
 very father thing is that it is not so 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.900
 difficult to do which is very good 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.000
 So, good now, what happens 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.530
 was the middle column the countless of the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.870
 half column so I'm going to start 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.880
 from this moment they are going to take the 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.300
 soldier and they're going to crush him they're going to be 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.300
 of black color and 100% then take that 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.570
 Soldier will stretch it like this and they will 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.220
 be 100% black again this part 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.140
 nothing else is going to be like to give the 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.520
 effect that are mountains in the distance 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.860
 really no no this is not so let's say 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.840
 that are not mountains but they look very good 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.780
 if they put it that way now they are going to 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.270
 take either square rectangle what 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.959
 be it but they put it like this this is going to be the 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.330
 part of the water now they are going to take the 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.980
 rpg they are going to flip it they will crush it and 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.959
 they are going to put it more or less at that height 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.299
 remember that to play with the figures 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.700
 like every commentary on emblems and 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.620
 memories is with his raid stick stick 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.319
 right they press can play with the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.940
 figure as soon as they finish playing with 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.349
 the figure is to say make bigger 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.720
 small etcetera 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.180
 press the right stick again and 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.680
 already with that then again play with the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.980
 figure but no longer deformed 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.620
 so then now they take that symbol and 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.650
 they're going to make it almost black in fact it's the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.200
 darker gray color found in 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.560
 is from the right side to the top 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.440
 and they're going to put it just like that and 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.300
 after that we're going to take that symbol 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.400
 that is there they are going to do it too 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.620
 again of the same color nothing more 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.510
 let's put one on the right side that 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.010
 is to give it the effect that it is water 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.440
 obviously because if you do not put 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.540
 this is how it is so good and that 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.280
 which is no but if you put it and 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.670
 now the effect that it is effectively 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.319
 water now they take another one and they are going to do it 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.269
 of black color this time right now 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.910
 they will see how the color actually changed 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.390
 are going to be two more this and another one in the layer 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.250
 18 and 19 and this is going to be on the side 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.470
 left just as they are 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.270
 watching on their screens 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.940
 and now it's taking a little bit more 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.310
 form what the emblem is but more 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.080
 go ahead we will add more details 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.750
 I must also tell you that you have been 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.730
 I have been working on this 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.530
 emblem for several days 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.080
 really from here the emblem that I climbed 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.000
 of the zombies had something in mind but 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.910
 It did not work out very well for me to say what I left 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.490
 aside the project yesterday I took it back and 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.340
 let's say it ends with a design with 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.140
 a m that's like I do not know how 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.570
 explain them in fact it was again taken 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.550
 photo before removing it but believe me 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.350
 that when I finish this emblem I said 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.239
 I do not think it looks much better 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.880
 well so the other discards it by 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.220
 complete I stayed with this design and if 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.860
 I definitely liked it more, I think 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.810
 it looks much better so that's why 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.060
 was that it eliminates the other and good now 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.880
 are going to take that symbol this part is going to 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.760
 be where they are located that there is a picture of 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.310
 alcatraz where you see a lighthouse and that is 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.440
 illuminating not good as this part is 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.419
 that lighthouse then they will take then 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.320
 let me tell you that it is a symbol there 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.440
 I lost by the way 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.380
 find him sara find him there is 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.060
 this part is going to be let's say the tower 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.260
 control between start of control no 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.510
 I'm very sure if he calls you from this 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.000
 way but if it's not called like that but 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:02.800
 I already put that name then then 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.900
 they take the house obviously this is not a 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.790
 campaign house but if they are fixed if what 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.190
 come in the distance you see the effect as 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.430
 that's really where all of them are 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.310
 the prisoners then is very father now 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.870
 as it is obviously very voice of no 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.850
 both the prison that was long ago 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.470
 time then you know that already 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.480
 Now it 's more than anything for tours 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.550
 and everything but what I want to give to 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.710
 to understand is that it is the prison but 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.660
 new style to you for which they are going to 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.180
 take that skull and these soldiers are going 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.220
 to be obviously very small zombies 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.770
 nothing else so that they give the effect that 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.570
 they are zombies they put them very small 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.970
 that way 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.640
 and now to give you still a better 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:47.060
 effect that the control tower or 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.980
 vigilance if it was the word of the tower 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.870
 na construction monitoring plan 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.560
 take that symbol they are going to do 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.000
 yellow 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.590
 it can really be any yellow 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.120
 that you want but do it with 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.820
 opacity such that it looks like this 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.800
 and now let me see what I did 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.110
 then I think it's going to be the 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.850
 letters and now let's put gannet on 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.520
 all the part above 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.919
 obviously friends I'm not going to put everything 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.290
 because it would take a lot of time but every 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.720
 letter will go white of 9% opacity 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:21.550
 and what they are going to do is put it 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:25.710
 around this way so the a are 4 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.710
 and 4 here is now they will see how 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.760
 One side is high and the other side is 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.170
 behind 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:39.849
 then do not expose is there back here 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:42.399
 so then they have to give that way 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:45.069
 and also to finish any of 

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:47.080
 the three skulls that are there with a 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:49.300
 3% opacity me because it will be very 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.860
 well they put it as well as I tell them how it is 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.559
 of zombies then nothing more for the 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.809
 scary effect in quotation marks and 

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:59.259
 happy and friends as you can see is something 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:07:01.209
 much like that is not something like 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.279
 which is exactly the same as the photo of 

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:05.619
 reference but I still hope there will be 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:07.360
 I like to say goodbye to friends and then if 

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:11.069
 They liked to give me a like that helps me 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.069
 too much and see you the next video
