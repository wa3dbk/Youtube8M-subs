00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.620
 good I asked then that which them 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.720
 I would like it to be recreated especially not 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.579
 either trace it or make it identical but 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.130

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.170
 they did it at the gala and after that 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.969

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.600
 dressed and others called attention were 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.590
 the lips men so good then I've 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 tried to recreate 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.460
 makeup and good then that if you 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.320
 you want to stay to see how I did it 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.780
 and you want to put it into practice 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.579
 we're going to start first 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.380
 what we are going to do is moisturize the skin and 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.210
 you know that I love the face skin glow 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.250
 does not leave any fat but a 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.810
 luminous finish on the skin and for that 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.909
 I'm going to use a flat skewer in 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.039
 this case the below sees 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.140
 scatter all over the face us 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.909
 we leave no drops and take advantage 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.829
 to go well for the nostrils 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.780
 then I will take an eye contour 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.789
 moisturizing in this case the rituals 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.369
 which is very very moisturizing and with a 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.520
 massage in the area of ​​the eyes we are going to 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.349
 leave everything well hydrated after I continue 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.679
 with the foundation in this case 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:49.390
 if the blog in punjab tone of nars and 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.130
 to apply it I will use the brush 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.159
 sigma style 10 and 80 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.270
 we follow with the concealer the ryan cream 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.820
 and concealer that has me totally 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.500
 in love in the tone like and for 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.950
 apply it I use the skewer of 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.950
 corrector 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.910
 then for the base of the eyelid 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.550
 I will use the comb 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.730
 natural white and burlesque brochette 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.170
 pro 57 first we put a little bit in 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.480
 all the eyelid mobile and then 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.240
 massified with the finger unifying well 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.160
 well with all the skin I continue with the naked 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.590
 2 in this case the boutique shadow or 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.290
 let's apply it all over the eyelid 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.090
 mobile with a brush to apply 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.980
 and then for the basin we're going to 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.849
 use the shadow chopper also from the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.439
 naked 2 and with a brush to blur 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.540
 We are going to work in the basin to give 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.720
 a little more intensity I'm going to take the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.950
 snake bite 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.950
 and we do the same 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.120
 then my beloved black track eyeliner 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.430
 let's use it to do the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.140
 eyeliner in both eyes and a brush 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.480
 beveled in this case also below 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.909
 beige we always depositing flush with 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.439
 tabs as a small line first 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.930
 finite and then we will have time to 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:04.209
 to thicken it in everything that is flush with 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.920
 eyelashes to make the eyeliner that is 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.480
 the most complicated thing is this point of 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.010
 end we always have to have the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.889
 brush bevelled horizontally with the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.780
 I draw a small line and join it 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.909
 with the line that we already had flush with 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.250
 tabs once we already have the 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.230
 eyeliner we continue to mark the eyebrows 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.239
 I will use the same paint pot with 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.579
 natural with a bevelled brush in this 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.310
 case of make a forever and let's go 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.579
 covering them well so that they remain 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.090
 quite framed aspect in this in 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.250
 this look 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.590
 to finish the eyes we will work 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.450
 with the mask falls the effects other 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.580
 You already know that I really like the 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.010
 Applicator that has applied well well 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.720
 following tabs and then to continue 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.420
 a little bit around the face 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.760
 mack matte browns with a brush 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.099
 side cut in this case also 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.379
 below we mark a little below the 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.799
 cheekbone to outline well there the 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.799
 face 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.100
 to give a little color to the 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.100
 cheek I used this blusher in 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.720
 tis cream in the chic tone and red is in 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.940
 cream the first we deposit it a 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.040
 little finger 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.870
 and then we are modifying it and 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.910
 extending well so that it looks like a 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.340
 rosy tone if we need then 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.320
 we use a rouge skewer in 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.700
 this case style already screamed to finish 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.730
 to blur it in the face 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.350
 I will give a touch of light on the temple and 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.290
 where the illuminator will you know that I 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.240
 I really like Kiko's radio and touch and 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.240
 we help to apply it with your fingers 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.770
 as I see that I still have a little bit of 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.650
 Oh, and I'm going to give you a little more 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.110
 of intensity to the concealer like and what 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.479
 I keep applying with my fingers and we're going 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.400
 already with the lips that is the touch more 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.660
 characteristic of this look first thing 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.460
 what I'm going to do is outline what in a 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.550
 pretty dark tone in this case is the 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.280
 12 ce of the a quality make a forever and 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.900
 I'm going to outline it very well so that 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.090
 take that dark tone once you're 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.430
 I profiled the watch salon mac 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.610
 from the collection girl a mix and filling 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:09.039
 all the lip it is important to use a 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.039
 brush or brush, better said lip 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.070
 as you see stuffed all the lip so much 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.710
 up and down and I try to melt the 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.680
 profiler and this red tone to give 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.259
 a touch more clearly I will use a 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.720
 Beta russia network as rams both of 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:28.600
 mack and with the same brush I'm going to take 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.240
 a little bit of each and I'm going to apply it 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.370
 starting at the center of the lip 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.169
 we give a little tap and that's when 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.639
 we have to merge well with the 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.190
 profiler and the bus saló 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.139
 we had put before then nothing girls 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.479
 so far today's video I hope that 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.130
 it has been very difficult for me, I think 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.870
 that what has one more point of 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.650
 difficulty because surely they are the 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.210
 lips 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.210
 The most important thing is to integrate the 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.400
 colors outline the well and frame the 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.470
 well and especially the transition between 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.479
 between the colors for it as you have 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.940
 seen you are going to need a brush yes or yes 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.889
 of lips and otherwise I think not 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.700
 have too much difficulty that the two 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.190
 Eyes leave the eyeliner the same 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.020
 a little more so good then I hope 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.580
 that you put it into practice that if 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.070
