00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.410

 books more than the daily and stefan 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.780

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.070
 on the cover and staff all combined 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.489
 This is the first time you've read a book. 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.530
 that has nothing to do with with serial 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:10.030
 that I do not know how to say so we do not 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.810
 There's nothing more serious like the names. 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.340
 of the characters are the same and such 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.570
 completely changes 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.940
 It's so we go there without more poor ones. 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.520
 Watch it, it 's actually I can talk right. 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.770
 Because I can not talk because there are people. 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.700
 wanting to watch the show so I 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.320
 I will not talk 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:38.470
 so come on it's the first book of 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:43.659
 series is man is the awakening the awakening 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:49.150
 The first book tells the story of 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:53.820
 with helena met stefan and blah blah 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:57.610

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.040

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.070

 another feature is blonde she 's kind 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.530
 so when I went the book I had to 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.630
 change character type to load 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.300

 secadinha online Chaer of ciro 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:41.450
 the pretty brunette with such a 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.790
 witch and such is red at that level and the demo 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.720
 stefan is the opposite kind of world that 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.720

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.450

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.410
 is totally different then the 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.780
 books will say I consulted will 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.850
 begin their battle to the first 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.000
 Battle I do not go back saying everything 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.970
 because if not spoiler is the fury when 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.160
 Helena is already starting to record the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.709
 A spoiler wakes up I'm going to cut your 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.989
 not vote any more can not be not only 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.329
 It's killing the girl so I will not tell. 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.380
 everything that is I know I'm going to give you 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:30.680
 I sent for the people and the book is the following 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.890
 Even the third book is legal. 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.739
 when the fifth one arrives in the room 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.040
 a part they are like hell 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:43.489
 You say so, you do not have it. 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.489
 on the show starts getting tense boring 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:49.880
 tiring of law but books are 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:53.630
 cool kind I finished reading by 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.940
 I'm so curious because I got tired of 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.590
 part of the deficit I spoke to but the 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.170
 The last book is great, it leaves you in the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.060
 third cup the other two I go 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.860
 buy have not bought yet 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:10.020
 But the sister first the serial 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.960
 It's a cool story I like 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.030
 a twilight only here with more action and a 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:21.209
 vampire does not shine in the dark or the sun 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:25.320
 psycho the joking pilot is just there and out 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:29.700
 of the Lula government, not only that it 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.830
 drunk and there 's another little girl 68 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.010
 But genin is a lot of people who like 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.680
 adults and even older people like 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.780
 the show then okay so the first 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.530
 series if you like 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.720
 Series you will like the books is 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.290
 so they took a little bit of 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.820
 each thing in each book and did the series 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:55.200
 but I think they changed according to 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.570
 what the population likes and what 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.080
 characters are fancy putting the boy 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:04.380
 cute to draw attention and how it 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.590
 like the brother of elena and such a child and 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:11.310
 that you decided to call attention will not 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:14.640
 then that's it my recent today 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.140
 indication is that you like serials and 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.690
 accompany and books because I am like this 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.030
 left the series if you leave the book the body 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.170
 book also so you can read to win 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.040
 decon saying is not the reality of what 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.910
 is passing 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.700
 so this is it vampire diary 5 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:37.950
 book all or only the last is 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:40.920
 more goal, only then, what do you want? 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.750
 skin is cheap in submarine completed 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.130
 my books occupy the majority in the 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.190
 submarine that I think is more and 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:51.150
 compute and they should get super fast 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.100
 So that 's the daily vampire medication. 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.640
 and good reading 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.640
 bye
