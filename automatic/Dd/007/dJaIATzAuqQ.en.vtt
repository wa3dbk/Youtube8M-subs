00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello everybody knows last and for 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.870
 the very first video on my channel 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.840
 I decided to make a little tutorial 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.710
 minecraft on this system 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.330
 so what is this is a 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.750
 harvesting system completely 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.470
 automatic melon and pumpkins 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.119
 so it works like this 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.789
 unfortunately a little apart from a few 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.640
 pearls as if then I know this 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.010
 trick when you can see both 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.119
 blocks here servat that the melon is the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.480
 pumpkin does not grow these two 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.040
 places declines to push just here 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.309
 and now I'm going to show you 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.450
 how to make this system and you 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.500
 explain in detail how that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.520
 then works first of all it us 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.860
 must obviously grow like 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.340
 this then you have to send a current 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.399
 in the watermelon like that as soon as the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.370
 watermelon will have pushed that var pulled 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.649
 a piston just above the ch'ti which 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.110
 piss not exactly like you 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.140
 can see it there is a close state 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.950
 when the when the name is not there and a 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.610
 open state as to post then he 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.080
 have to put a stone here this pair 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.290
 will be powered by the torch just in 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:26.369
 underneath and hand and this will serve to 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:32.630
 to be able to pass a stoner with 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:35.340
 camp on a normal piston that year places 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.369
 here if I get there 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.810
 so here is the system is 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.530
 operational 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.610
 finally to be able then why here we 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.100
 Delighted me to knighton demonstrate if we 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.060
 do this and system is way too much 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:58.399
 fast and the fight you will not deny 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.399
 in your nickname that you will place if 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.830
 so the water source that will allow you 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.350
 to bring the roads together 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.330
 final destination where you have all the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.890
 recover 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.740
 so I advise you to put in 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.420
 wall because from time to time there can 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.000
 have some doubts clip hangs here 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.520
 unfortunately but I will remove this 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.810
 wall to show two little tricks 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.050
 which will allow you to win 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.330
 a few blocks on several meulan so 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.230
 we can reuse this torch for 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.730
 redo exactly the same system 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:43.040
 so we'll say that the movement that the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.380
 moment will be there and so we redo 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.800
 exactly the same group system 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.580
 spotify is what I'm angry 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:57.290
 but a sticky piston above 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.720
 like a stone so that's exactly 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:07.400
 the same thing 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:09.470
 the dealer and the piston this normal 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.170
 so as you can see that 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.140
 works 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.370
 good if we use the same torch 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.260
 both will go at the same time but 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.080
 that's not too disturbing 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.320
 system will always work 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.570
 we can also use the shoot as 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.030
 this is exactly the same 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.970
 system that makes them very 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.320
 quickly 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:39.010
 there the rest of here to say here and a 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.010
 normal piston 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.230
 so that's what allowed you to win 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.850
 some places 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.299
 if you want to do for example a 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.010
 factory 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.790
 so I started a little idea of 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.810
 jezzine here so I just took the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.350
 same system here on two of width and 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.510
 height 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.940
 so when you can see it and I have 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.100
 a little tip show that allows for 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.500
 plunge the well water currents from 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.230
 gas 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.530
 it's putting a block of ice here 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.890
 with a panel it allows to extend 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.570
 the currents of water since two week as 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.300
 so when you can see the fight 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.240
 going on and will end up towards a 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.000
 final destination here so you can 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.070
 to make a melon plant and site heading 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.160
 if you want with melons in water and 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.050
 pumpkins down and you do not have to 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.550
 also forget to put small 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.270
 sources of water to those who are above 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.370
 with the most chances that it grows 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.419
 and so I finished this tutorial and I 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.440
 give an appointment to see my next 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:49.180
 video was highly ellipses because 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.220
 I forgot to tell you a little 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.820
 detail that can be important 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.580
 so that's to place a block at this 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.250
 place to prevent the fruit from 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.680
 start growing here and that 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.380
 rather do here and here right in front of the 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.030
 piston here it is here it is really the 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.300
 end of this video and I tell you 'I to 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.300
 toulon
