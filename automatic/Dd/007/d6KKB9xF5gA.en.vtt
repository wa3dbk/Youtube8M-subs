many<00:00:54.999> empty<00:00:55.659> husks<00:00:56.319> because<00:00:56.679> that<00:00:56.889> doesn't

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
many empty husks because that doesn't

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.259

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.649 
could break up some of the beans as it's
stirring<00:01:54.250> them<00:01:54.399> so<00:01:55.149> we're<00:01:55.270> just<00:01:55.299> going<00:01:55.539> to<00:01:55.569> use

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
stirring them so we're just going to use

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.319 
stirring them so we're just going to use
a<00:01:55.750> soft<00:01:56.140> spatula<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.340> can<00:01:58.119> actually

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
a soft spatula and can actually

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.289 
a soft spatula and can actually
manipulate<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:59.289> beans<00:01:59.679> around<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.939> that<00:02:00.969> the

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
manipulate the beans around so that the

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.349 
manipulate the beans around so that the
soup<00:02:01.630> can<00:02:02.500> get<00:02:02.679> down<00:02:02.950> through<00:02:03.280> all<00:02:03.609> of<00:02:03.670> the

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
soup can get down through all of the

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:09.559 
soup can get down through all of the
layers<00:02:06.509> there<00:02:07.509> that's<00:02:08.470> pretty<00:02:08.769> good

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
layers there that's pretty good

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.449
