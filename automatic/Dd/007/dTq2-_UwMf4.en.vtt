00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.740
 shows that here it is ludicrous further 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.000

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.420
 hope my calories come from that 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.649
 not good if it happens once 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.460

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.570

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.870
