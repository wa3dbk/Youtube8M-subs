00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
retail customer they like yep but I

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.720 
retail customer they like yep but I
would<00:00:15.750> take<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.049> off<00:00:16.260> right<00:00:16.410> here<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.250> right

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
would take this off right here and right

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.580 
would take this off right here and right
then<00:00:17.970> bring<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.630> bring<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.080> down<00:00:19.320> and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
then bring this up bring this down and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.609 
then bring this up bring this down and
just<00:00:19.650> let<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.100> grow<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.609> feel<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.410> but<00:00:22.410> I

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
just let that grow and feel this but I

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.859 
just let that grow and feel this but I
mean<00:00:22.769> all<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.039> these<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.760> think<00:00:23.970> that'd<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.420> much

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
mean all of these I think that'd be much

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.310 
mean all of these I think that'd be much
better

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
better

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.099 
better
smaller<00:00:25.830> definitely<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.720> know<00:00:27.840> just

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
smaller definitely and you know just

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.529 
smaller definitely and you know just
taking<00:00:28.349> these<00:00:28.650> guys<00:00:28.890> down<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.250> my<00:00:29.550> prior<00:00:29.910> build

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
taking these guys down to my prior build

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.680 
taking these guys down to my prior build
the<00:00:30.689> pad<00:00:30.900> they're<00:00:31.230> build<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.859> right<00:00:32.099> there

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
maybe want to buy a specimen tree but

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.500 
maybe want to buy a specimen tree but
they<00:00:41.700> don't<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.000> giant<00:00:45.200> I<00:00:47.120> didn't<00:00:48.120> even<00:00:48.239> see

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510

I've<00:00:52.649> been<00:00:52.890> pruning<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> entire

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
I've been pruning this so not the entire

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.459 
I've been pruning this so not the entire
season<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.660> want<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.960> take<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> down<00:00:55.410> to

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
season and I want to take it down to

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.330 
season and I want to take it down to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
this up as the apex but it's a hard one

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.110 
this up as the apex but it's a hard one
because<00:01:01.859> I've<00:01:02.160> been<00:01:02.250> looking<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.730> because

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
because I've been looking at it because

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.000 
because I've been looking at it because
it's<00:01:03.660> got<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.199> nice<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:04.830> then<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
it's got kind of nice there but then you

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.950 
it's got kind of nice there but then you
got<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.339> branch<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> front<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.930> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
got this branch in the front and what I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.770 
got this branch in the front and what I
would<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.619> Florida<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.659> for<00:01:09.659> your

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
would do in Florida because for your

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.310 
would do in Florida because for your
proportions

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
proportions

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.400 
proportions
it<00:01:12.130> ends<00:01:12.580> here<00:01:12.880> yeah<00:01:13.180> well<00:01:13.480> that<00:01:13.720> that<00:01:14.170> would

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
it ends here yeah well that that would

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.560 
it ends here yeah well that that would
leave<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.620> big<00:01:15.010> star<00:01:15.400> but<00:01:15.430> it<00:01:15.730> ends<00:01:16.030> right<00:01:16.210> here

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
leave a big star but it ends right here

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.320 
leave a big star but it ends right here
I<00:01:16.720> would<00:01:16.990> stub<00:01:17.470> it<00:01:17.650> straight<00:01:18.100> across<00:01:18.430> and<00:01:19.270> then

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
I would stub it straight across and then

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.720 
I would stub it straight across and then
hold<00:01:19.990> one<00:01:20.350> of<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.560> ones<00:01:20.770> were<00:01:21.100> like<00:01:21.340> right

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
hold one of the ones were like right

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.960 
hold one of the ones were like right
here<00:01:22.240> yep<00:01:22.480> up<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.080> then<00:01:23.530> taper<00:01:23.890> back<00:01:24.400> to<00:01:24.700> here

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
here yep up and then taper back to here

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.610 
here yep up and then taper back to here
on<00:01:25.180> up<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.860> that's<00:01:27.100> where<00:01:27.490> your<00:01:27.700> suit<00:01:28.030> and

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620

what would you do because of would you
keep<00:01:31.810> this<00:01:32.020> as<00:01:32.260> a<00:01:32.290> first<00:01:32.650> and<00:01:32.950> this<00:01:33.100> is<00:01:33.310> a

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
keep this as a first and this is a

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.980 
keep this as a first and this is a
second<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:33.940> get<00:01:34.090> rid<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.270> this<00:01:34.450> or<00:01:34.780> would<00:01:34.870> you

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
second and get rid of this or would you

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.320 
second and get rid of this or would you
keep<00:01:35.140> that<00:01:35.200> all<00:01:35.740> three<00:01:36.190> does<00:01:36.370> it's<00:01:36.610> a<00:01:36.729> sumo<00:01:37.150> and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
keep that all three does it's a sumo and
