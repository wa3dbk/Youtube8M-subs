 you have to find a solution they can 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.170
 Lieutenant same night out you have to do it 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.170
 a volume with the help of one 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.459
 lady of 72 years since ie 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.380
 umberto and then calculate the volume 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:25.380
 suitable for a 72-year-old lady 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.150

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.540
 races of about 50 meters 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.000
 calculating that the speed of 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.410
 sound propagation I lose a benetton 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.370
 please are you bringing me the 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.110
 headache 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.640
 there will be an easier way to understand a 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.620
 which volume should be played for non 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.540
 to disturb a 72-year-old lady no 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.880
 so why was this the problem 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.610
 I know how to make my grandmother 72 years old 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.170
 will help you right at that age 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.940
 I'm was the softest battery of you 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.770
 here has solved the problem of 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.510
 battery now we have to find all the 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.610
 grandparents for other tools really 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.140
 my grandmother is no longer the battery though 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.610
 while we play we can make ourselves say 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.560
 when the music is too high for the air 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.420
 it's true and if the volume is right for you 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.260
 it will mean that it suits a lady of 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.050
 72 years old people then all from my grandmother 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.550
 gonzo it is you who must come here then 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.260
 I'm going to get you to ride 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.260
 make the weight in these brushstrokes 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.550
 guys but we are sure that the method of 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.590
 bonzo will work so much we don't have 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.620
 chosen the only alternative and solar 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.420
 inside I think it can work as if 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.370
 the grandmother as a parameter to understand if 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.200
 isolating right students will not be there 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.680
 measure I am precise but a kiss of the 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.680
