00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
package let's look at Zed first he's

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.340 
package let's look at Zed first he's
kind<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.800> fun<00:00:32.009> Zed<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.730> obviously<00:00:33.239> number<00:00:33.540> 0<00:00:34.020> or

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
kind of fun Zed is obviously number 0 or

kind of fun Zed is obviously number 0 or
Z<00:00:34.710> depending<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.430> where<00:00:35.850> you're<00:00:36.059> from<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
Z depending on where you're from and

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.350 
Z depending on where you're from and
he's<00:00:37.500> got<00:00:37.649> some<00:00:37.829> white<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.309> green<00:00:38.550> little

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
he's got some white and green little

he's got some white and green little
flame<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.930> go<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> little<00:00:40.379> swirlies<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.340> on

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
flame that go a little swirlies going on

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.430 
flame that go a little swirlies going on
and<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.360> course<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.020> all<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> other

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and of course just like all the other

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.049 
and of course just like all the other
micro<00:00:43.739> drifters<00:00:44.040> how<00:00:44.190> these<00:00:44.309> things<00:00:44.489> work<00:00:44.789> are

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
micro drifters how these things work are

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.479 
micro drifters how these things work are
they're<00:00:45.600> plastic<00:00:46.140> they're<00:00:46.320> kind<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:47.039> little

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
they're plastic they're kind of a little

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.819 
they're plastic they're kind of a little
bit<00:00:47.610> longer<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.780> side<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.410> they<00:00:49.620> make

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
bit longer on this one side so they make

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.889 
bit longer on this one side so they make
you<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.100> they<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.340> some<00:00:50.520> spin-out<00:00:50.940> moves<00:00:51.239> cuz

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you know they do some spin-out moves cuz

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.330 
you know they do some spin-out moves cuz
they're<00:00:52.020> kind<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.350> unbalanced<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.129> believe

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
they're kind of unbalanced and I believe

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.189 
they're kind of unbalanced and I believe
designed<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.570> they<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:55.020> got<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
designed to do that and they just got a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.510 
designed to do that and they just got a
little<00:00:55.260> ball<00:00:55.590> bearing<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.070> there<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.399> they

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
little ball bearing in there so they

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.099 
little ball bearing in there so they
could<00:00:56.640> roll<00:00:56.820> around<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.300> desktop<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
could roll around your desktop or a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.709 
could roll around your desktop or a
little<00:00:58.350> playset<00:00:58.859> also<00:00:59.070> one<00:01:00.030> cool<00:01:00.329> thing<00:01:00.600> about

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
little playset also one cool thing about
the<00:01:00.930> plains<00:01:01.170> ones<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.710> their<00:01:01.859> propellers<00:01:02.309> do

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the plains ones is their propellers do

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.899 
the plains ones is their propellers do
work<00:01:03.290> here<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> Shani<00:01:05.129> now<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.580> thing<00:01:05.790> is
