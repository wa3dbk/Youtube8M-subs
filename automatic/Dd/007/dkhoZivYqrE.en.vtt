that<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.979> use<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.490> those<00:01:27.420> tactics<00:01:27.900> depend<00:01:28.200> on

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that I use but those tactics depend on

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.749 
that I use but those tactics depend on
the<00:01:28.409> team<00:01:28.650> or<00:01:28.680> what<00:01:28.979> type<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.189> players<00:01:29.490> they've

got so there's a lot of factors that

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.350 
got so there's a lot of factors that
contribute<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:32.579> formation<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.119> should

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
that anyway you get the point so I will

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.100 
that anyway you get the point so I will
be<00:02:11.190> using<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.550> snore<00:02:11.879> just<00:02:12.060> because<00:02:12.330> my

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
be using a snore just because my

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.560 
be using a snore just because my
teams<00:02:13.260> got<00:02:13.440> pretty<00:02:14.430> much<00:02:14.790> cover<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.330> every

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
teams got pretty much cover in every

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.720 
teams got pretty much cover in every
position<00:02:16.320> like<00:02:16.860> experiment<00:02:17.550> with<00:02:17.640> different

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
position like experiment with different

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.160 
position like experiment with different
type<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.060> players<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.570> stuff<00:02:18.720> like<00:02:18.870> that

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
type of players and stuff like that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.230 
type of players and stuff like that
and<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.590> very<00:02:19.800> key<00:02:20.010> example<00:02:20.790> straight<00:02:21.030> away

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
and a very key example straight away

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.670 
and a very key example straight away
he's<00:02:21.390> been<00:02:21.540> our<00:02:21.660> union<00:02:21.900> because<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.440> can't

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
he's been our union because you can't

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.590 
he's been our union because you can't
play<00:02:22.860> center<00:02:23.190> mid<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:23.910> he<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.180> play<00:02:24.330> all

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
play center mid but he can play all

play center mid but he can play all
across<00:02:24.960> there<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.410> he<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.010> play<00:02:26.100> wide<00:02:26.460> there

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
across there and he can play wide there

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.040 
across there and he can play wide there
there<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.680> can<00:02:28.860> play<00:02:29.010> there<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.900> play

wide as a winger inside forward wide

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.250 
wide as a winger inside forward wide
wide<00:02:44.490> or<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.820> can<00:02:44.970> play<00:02:45.120> there<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.959> type

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
wide or you can play there in this type

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.199 
wide or you can play there in this type
of<00:02:46.290> area<00:02:46.709> here<00:02:46.740> but<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.370> cannot<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:48.000> think<00:02:48.150> you

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
of area here but you cannot I think you

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.220 
of area here but you cannot I think you
can<00:02:48.330> play<00:02:48.420> there<00:02:48.660> as<00:02:48.780> well<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:48.990> think<00:02:49.050> that

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
can play there as well I think that

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.770 
can play there as well I think that
counters<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:50.310> same<00:02:50.550> as<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:50.850> position<00:02:51.300> but

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
counters the same as this position but

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.270 
counters the same as this position but
he<00:02:51.900> can't<00:02:52.170> play<00:02:52.290> here<00:02:52.590> which<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> very<00:02:53.220> good

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
he can't play here which is a very good

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.100 
he can't play here which is a very good
example<00:02:53.459> Ben<00:02:54.209> are<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.360> but<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.989> just

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
example Ben are you but this is just

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.360 
example Ben are you but this is just
going<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.380> be<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.070> just<00:02:56.100> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370
