00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.620
 important, and I'm going to use a 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.620
 method to show you what the 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.890
 Minecraft comparison 1.4 points with

 minecraft 1.4 point 4 and well you are going to see 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.240
 the changes how important are the 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.549
 changes and I will also use the map of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.340
 his rival 1.4 is worth so I'm going to do 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.490
 some little thing also a guys let's go 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.760
 to it very well I am here in minecraft 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.130
 1.4 point 2 in experience orange and 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.930
 as you see I have here a more or less 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.240
 about 50 zombies 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.630
 1.4 points when already killed this this 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.500
 my observing what was happening killed us and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.300
 As you can see, it was worth the things, but 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.400
 you have seen that there has been a second in 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.080
 the one that had dropped those shoes I do not know 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.690
 if you have been able to see or if not 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.880
 well you can give back I had 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.369
 released a lot of meat I had released 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.590
 the shoes , however, have been 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.450
 taken to the grave this happened to me too 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.550
 in normal and hardcore with a carrot 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.830
 that it came to the grave well now 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.780
 let's see the orange experience in the 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.780
 1.4 point 4 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.750
 as you see, they have given me absolutely everything 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.780
 let's pick it up 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.200
 my golden helmet here great as you see 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.570
 before they gave me only 17 worth more or 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.840
 least they would have given me a stack or 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.750
 fifty-odd and here I sent 64 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.540
 plus 7 plus the gold helmet and I do not know if 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.300
 even a carrot inah guys like 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.940
 You see, it's a pretty pretty change 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.280
 it seems very important to me because 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.190
 I had a lot done this 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.140
 time and I in lanaja experience but 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.090
 well now it works again and I'm 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.150
 very very happy let's go with the next 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.970
 change very well we are in the minecraft 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.130
 1.4 points as you see up there and it's very 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.350
 important that you observe the movements 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.230
 of the winners for example look and that 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.350
 he has not caught that sword we're going to go back 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.140
 sar for you to see that welcomes us well no 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.480
 I know if you have seen it I will go up there 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.500
 quickly before commenting more 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.349
 a concept here we're going to see out there 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.360
 great more here today and good as 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.670
 you have observed he has not caught it is very 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.770
 important that you have noticed in that 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.830
 well I'm going to pick up my sword 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.860
 to see out without out let me 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.060
 here and how are you seeing the steps is 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.190
 very important that you also see the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.780
 steps how are we going to load the a 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.280
 these widgets that all are worth so that they do not 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.250
 you stay there with the desire to know if 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.070
 they give me a head 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.440
 Get down here perfect, no, they did not 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.690
 very well then I'm going to put 1.4 point 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.760
 4 and these here - I'm going to load in the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.130
 1.4 point 4 although there is nothing I am going to 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.980
 do the first one very well we are in the 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.620
 1.4 point 4 and how are you observing 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.990
 these widder writings go very fast 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.250
 it's worth outside out without another wilder 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.170
 is that where I'm dead ends of 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.960
 I am dead as you can see they are very fast 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.210
 it now also have the property of 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.720
 that they can always catch or always 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.970
 they catch things are very very dangerous 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.840
 now they are very fast as you are 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.989
 observing always take things 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.660
 and beware of the widder skeletons of 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.570
 true guys are very very dangerous 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.669
 remember they have increased the speed 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.470
 very much as you have just observed now 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.570
 they always take your things when you 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.139
 you die that will be with you 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.240
 things and observe is that they are very fast 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.340
 dynamic 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.580
 it seems that I have something good behind 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.949
 outside mom that was this very well and 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.520
 I'm going to make a couple of little things more out 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:50.370
 more deaths 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.650
 we are in minecraft 1.4 points worth and 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.289
 let's export to a pigment zombie 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.139
 As you can see, it was just contributed, do not be 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.389
 we transport 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.159
 Okay, here I do not see any zombies 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.860
 pigment that means you have been 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:07.650
 here and it has been transported again 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.629
 to check it we come here and you have 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.180
 seen the zombie pigment well this is 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:14.129
 must to an egg is worth sometimes this 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.810
 it gets much worse and they stay here 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:18.180
 means of transport the strong 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.759
 powerful they transport you 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.009
 let's go to the fret 1.4 point of 4 and 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.490
 let's see what happens 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.289
 well we are in minecraft 1.4 point 4 and 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.080
 let's transport a zombie payment 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:34.229
 As you can see, it's just been transported 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.509
 to have to behave and here it is worth if 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.570
 still a little sharp, but it's 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.220
 here and nothing guys as you see I had already 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.410
 left his rival because teach this 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.090
 in his rival 1.4 was going to be quite 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.030
 quite complicated 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.789
 tell you okay this is something personal not 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.830
 I'm sure it's all right that I do not know if 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.750
 crash problems because to 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.120
 a lot of people what seems like me 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.280
 he gets stuck in minecraft in 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.729
 the duty I'm not very sure but I think 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.740
 that has been solved is probably worth 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.770
 yes that you know solved and this would be a 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.419
 great news and nothing you guys already know 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.110

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:15.030
 1.4 point 4 and 1.4 point 3 that are 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.199
 many seek fixes and that the 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.570
 truth is that if you have not seen them 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.770

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.510
 for this other 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.570
 the truth is that this sea tires 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.330

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.920
