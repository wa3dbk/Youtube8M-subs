00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
time CM Punk was in Chicago I believe I

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.170 
time CM Punk was in Chicago I believe I
might<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:20.070> wrong<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:20.700> I'm<00:01:21.000> pretty

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
might be wrong on that but I'm pretty

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.810 
might be wrong on that but I'm pretty
sure<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.479> wasn't<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.840> last<00:01:21.990> time<00:01:22.400> but<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
sure it wasn't the last time but the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.670 
sure it wasn't the last time but the
last<00:01:23.850> time<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.330> pay-per-view<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:25.020> think<00:01:25.320> was

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
last time on pay-per-view I think was

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.910 
last time on pay-per-view I think was
money<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> bank<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:28.619> was<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> big

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
speculating maybe Paul Heyman comes out

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.100 
speculating maybe Paul Heyman comes out
but<00:01:55.560> what<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> replacement

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
but what a replacement

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.550 
but what a replacement
it<00:01:58.110> could<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.409> Brock<00:01:58.680> Lesnar<00:01:59.280> Curtis<00:01:59.670> axel

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
it could be Brock Lesnar Curtis axel

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.080 
it could be Brock Lesnar Curtis axel
here's<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> problem<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.520> I'll

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
here's a problem I see with that I'll

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.490 
here's a problem I see with that I'll
start<00:02:03.329> off<00:02:03.479> with<00:02:03.719> Brock<00:02:03.960> Lesnar<00:02:03.990> when<00:02:04.409> it

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
start off with Brock Lesnar when it

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.740 
start off with Brock Lesnar when it
comes<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.770> Brock<00:02:04.979> Lesnar<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.610> don't<00:02:06.509> think<00:02:06.659> they

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
comes to Brock Lesnar I don't think they

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.020 
comes to Brock Lesnar I don't think they
would<00:02:06.990> advertise<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:08.099> mean<00:02:08.250> not<00:02:08.429> advertise

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
would advertise I mean not advertise

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.210 
would advertise I mean not advertise
Brock<00:02:09.360> Lesnar<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.530> him<00:02:10.649> show<00:02:11.009> up

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
Brock Lesnar and just have him show up

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.010 
Brock Lesnar and just have him show up
on<00:02:11.400> pay-per-view<00:02:11.610> by<00:02:12.090> surprise

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
on pay-per-view by surprise

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.630 
on pay-per-view by surprise
it'd<00:02:13.380> be<00:02:13.560> much<00:02:13.860> better<00:02:14.100> for<00:02:14.220> them<00:02:14.430> to

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
it'd be much better for them to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.720 
it'd be much better for them to
advertise<00:02:15.300> Brock<00:02:15.570> Lesnar<00:02:16.020> as<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:17.010> know<00:02:17.130> as<00:02:17.460> a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
advertise Brock Lesnar as you know as a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.370 
advertise Brock Lesnar as you know as a
competitor<00:02:18.510> or<00:02:18.660> somebody<00:02:18.960> that's<00:02:19.170> gonna<00:02:19.260> be

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
competitor or somebody that's gonna be

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.780 
competitor or somebody that's gonna be
competing<00:02:19.890> or<00:02:19.980> showing<00:02:20.280> up<00:02:20.490> at<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
competing or showing up at the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.550 
competing or showing up at the
pay-per-view<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:22.050> people<00:02:22.320> buy<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
pay-per-view so people buy the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.530 
pay-per-view so people buy the
pay-per-view<00:02:22.950> rather<00:02:23.310> than<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.910> have<00:02:24.390> him

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
pay-per-view rather than just have him

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.350 
pay-per-view rather than just have him
show<00:02:24.780> up<00:02:24.960> by<00:02:25.230> surprise<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:26.010> don't<00:02:27.000> think<00:02:27.240> they'd

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
show up by surprise I don't think they'd

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.070 
show up by surprise I don't think they'd
do<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:28.730> as<00:02:29.730> far<00:02:29.940> as<00:02:30.000> Curtis<00:02:30.510> axle<00:02:30.900> goes

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
do that and as far as Curtis axle goes

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.820 
do that and as far as Curtis axle goes

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830

wasn't that in that championship match

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.540 
wasn't that in that championship match
maybe<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.610> could<00:02:44.790> happen<00:02:45.030> but<00:02:45.450> um<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.550> don't

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
maybe that could happen but um I don't

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.420 
maybe that could happen but um I don't
know<00:02:47.640> I'm<00:02:48.510> not<00:02:48.810> sure<00:02:49.170> if<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.010> few<00:02:50.250> would

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430

pay-per-view<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:16.170> was<00:03:16.380> maybe<00:03:16.590> backlash<00:03:17.220> no<00:03:17.460> it

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
pay-per-view it was maybe backlash no it

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
pay-per-view it was but you know it's

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.930

happened<00:03:22.230> in<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.380> past<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:23.520> I<00:03:23.580> don't<00:03:23.820> think

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
happened in the past but I don't think

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.860 
happened in the past but I don't think
it's<00:03:24.030> gonna<00:03:24.150> happen<00:03:24.270> this<00:03:24.480> Sunday

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
it's gonna happen this Sunday

it's gonna happen this Sunday
I<00:03:25.050> do<00:03:26.010> believe<00:03:26.220> CM<00:03:26.550> Punk<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.970> going<00:03:27.240> to<00:03:27.360> show<00:03:27.570> up

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
I do believe CM Punk is going to show up

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.990 
I do believe CM Punk is going to show up
and<00:03:27.960> is<00:03:28.350> going<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.740> be<00:03:28.950> facing<00:03:29.160> off<00:03:29.490> against

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
and is going to be facing off against

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.180 
and is going to be facing off against
Chris<00:03:30.180> Jericho<00:03:30.290> what<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.320> am<00:03:31.500> wondering<00:03:31.770> though

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
Chris Jericho what I am wondering though

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.130 
Chris Jericho what I am wondering though
is<00:03:33.110> its<00:03:34.110> impact<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.740> be<00:03:34.770> a<00:03:34.890> heel<00:03:35.190> or<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.760> face

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
is its impact can be a heel or a face

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.080 
is its impact can be a heel or a face
I'm<00:03:37.140> thinking<00:03:37.740> right<00:03:38.280> now<00:03:38.340> he's<00:03:38.730> gonna<00:03:38.880> be

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
I'm thinking right now he's gonna be

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.780 
I'm thinking right now he's gonna be
he's<00:03:39.480> gonna<00:03:39.570> return<00:03:40.050> as<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.440> heel<00:03:40.830> but<00:03:41.580> maybe

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
he's gonna return as a heel but maybe

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.510 
he's gonna return as a heel but maybe
during<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.210> matchup<00:03:42.720> or<00:03:43.190> after<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.310> matchup

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
during the matchup or after the matchup

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.450 
during the matchup or after the matchup
he's<00:03:45.000> gonna<00:03:45.120> turn<00:03:45.390> face<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:46.310> don't<00:03:47.310> know

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
he's gonna turn face I don't know

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.860 
he's gonna turn face I don't know
there's<00:03:47.730> there's<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.000> lot<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.240> possibilities

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
there's there's a lot of possibilities

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.070 
there's there's a lot of possibilities
or<00:03:49.020> maybe<00:03:49.170> he<00:03:49.350> just<00:03:49.380> stays<00:03:49.830> heel<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.080> competes

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
or maybe he just stays heel and competes

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.980 
or maybe he just stays heel and competes
as<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.230> heel<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.790> continues<00:03:54.240> on<00:03:54.480> with<00:03:54.750> his

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
as a heel and it continues on with his

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.330 
as a heel and it continues on with his
heel<00:03:55.200> bump<00:03:55.440> but<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.680> thing<00:03:55.920> is<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.310> the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
heel bump but the thing is the the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.400 
heel bump but the thing is the the
reason<00:03:56.880> why<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.090> think<00:03:57.240> CM<00:03:57.720> Punk<00:03:57.930> will<00:03:58.200> turn

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
reason why I think CM Punk will turn

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.730 
reason why I think CM Punk will turn
face<00:03:58.880> pretty<00:03:59.880> soon<00:04:00.240> is<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:01.080> fact<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.380> Ryback

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
face pretty soon is the fact that Ryback

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.250 
face pretty soon is the fact that Ryback
is<00:04:02.160> now<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.400> heel<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:03.090> we're<00:04:03.240> Ryback<00:04:03.660> no<00:04:03.930> longer

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
is now a heel and we're Ryback no longer

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.940 
is now a heel and we're Ryback no longer
being<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.530> face<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:05.760> feel<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:07.050> feel<00:04:07.470> they<00:04:07.740> that

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.730 
being a face I feel I feel they that
they<00:04:08.100> lack<00:04:08.720> especially<00:04:09.720> I'm<00:04:09.810> wrong<00:04:10.080> although

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
I guess just because you know they were

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.120 
I guess just because you know they were
the<00:04:37.720> last<00:04:37.930> draft<00:04:38.260> they<00:04:38.440> were<00:04:38.590> drafted<00:04:39.010> to

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.240 
the last draft they were drafted to
SmackDown<00:04:39.760> but<00:04:40.420> yeah<00:04:41.050> as<00:04:41.170> far<00:04:41.320> as<00:04:41.380> rago's<00:04:41.980> or

SmackDown but yeah as far as rago's or

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.150 
SmackDown but yeah as far as rago's or
just<00:04:43.150> said<00:04:43.540> be<00:04:43.660> in<00:04:43.810> general<00:04:44.260> I<00:04:44.470> feel<00:04:44.980> they

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
just said be in general I feel they

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.410 
just said be in general I feel they
lacked<00:04:45.520> some<00:04:46.210> main<00:04:46.570> event<00:04:46.870> faces<00:04:47.380> right<00:04:47.560> now

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
lacked some main event faces right now

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.390 
lacked some main event faces right now
die<00:04:49.420> John<00:04:49.840> Cena<00:04:50.140> obviously<00:04:50.650> being<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.920> top

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
die John Cena obviously being the top

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.500 
die John Cena obviously being the top
made<00:04:51.670> a<00:04:51.700> buttface<00:04:52.410> so<00:04:53.410> I<00:04:53.800> thinking<00:04:54.520> CM<00:04:54.880> Punk<00:04:55.150> is

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
made a buttface so I thinking CM Punk is

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.200 
made a buttface so I thinking CM Punk is
going<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.080> be<00:04:56.230> returning<00:04:56.890> as<00:04:57.160> a<00:04:57.190> face<00:04:57.580> or<00:04:57.820> like

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
going to be returning as a face or like

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.780 
going to be returning as a face or like
I<00:04:58.330> said<00:04:58.570> my<00:04:58.990> returns<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.560> yield<00:04:59.800> but<00:05:00.220> if<00:05:00.430> he<00:05:00.550> does

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
I said my returns a yield but if he does

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.790 
I said my returns a yield but if he does
then<00:05:01.150> I<00:05:01.180> think<00:05:01.420> he's<00:05:01.510> gonna<00:05:01.660> turn<00:05:01.960> face<00:05:02.290> pretty

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
then I think he's gonna turn face pretty

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.020 
then I think he's gonna turn face pretty
soon<00:05:03.130> after<00:05:03.610> his<00:05:03.670> return<00:05:04.440> so<00:05:05.440> yeah<00:05:05.800> anyways<00:05:06.790> I

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
soon after his return so yeah anyways I

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.880 
soon after his return so yeah anyways I
didn't<00:05:07.210> eat<00:05:07.270> why<00:05:07.480> I<00:05:07.720> wasted<00:05:08.230> a<00:05:08.320> lot<00:05:08.440> of<00:05:08.500> time<00:05:08.590> in

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
didn't eat why I wasted a lot of time in

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.920 
didn't eat why I wasted a lot of time in
this<00:05:09.010> video<00:05:09.280> not<00:05:09.400> even<00:05:09.670> giving<00:05:10.030> my<00:05:10.390> reasoning

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
this video not even giving my reasoning

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.800 
this video not even giving my reasoning
behind<00:05:11.280> why<00:05:12.280> I<00:05:12.310> think<00:05:12.430> CM<00:05:12.880> Punk<00:05:13.120> is<00:05:13.300> going<00:05:13.600> to

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
behind why I think CM Punk is going to

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.010 
behind why I think CM Punk is going to
win<00:05:14.110> this<00:05:14.200> match<00:05:15.270> well<00:05:16.270> to<00:05:16.420> be<00:05:16.540> honest<00:05:16.810> it<00:05:16.990> is

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
win this match well to be honest it is

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.500 
win this match well to be honest it is
pretty<00:05:17.590> hard<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:18.040> find<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:18.610> reason<00:05:19.060> not

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
pretty hard to find a reason not

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.900 
pretty hard to find a reason not
actually<00:05:19.840> it<00:05:19.900> isn't<00:05:20.050> it<00:05:20.530> isn't<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:20.950> isn't

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
actually it isn't it isn't it isn't

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.360 
actually it isn't it isn't it isn't
Chicago<00:05:22.600> that's<00:05:22.960> one<00:05:23.290> reason<00:05:23.470> it's<00:05:23.740> in<00:05:23.980> CM

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
Chicago that's one reason it's in CM

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.050 
Chicago that's one reason it's in CM
Punk's<00:05:24.640> hometown<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:26.220> last<00:05:27.220> time<00:05:27.490> he<00:05:27.790> was<00:05:28.030> in

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
Punk's hometown and last time he was in

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.110 
Punk's hometown and last time he was in
his<00:05:28.450> own<00:05:28.540> town<00:05:28.840> on<00:05:29.110> pay-per-view<00:05:29.430> he<00:05:30.430> won<00:05:31.030> this

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
his own town on pay-per-view he won this

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.510 
his own town on pay-per-view he won this
championship<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.990> left<00:05:32.260> off<00:05:32.500> left<00:05:33.040> with<00:05:33.400> the

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
championship and left off left with the

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.930 
championship and left off left with the
championship<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:35.500> also<00:05:36.040> it's<00:05:36.430> his<00:05:36.610> return

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
championship and also it's his return

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.030 
championship and also it's his return
that<00:05:37.150> is<00:05:37.360> probably<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:37.900> biggest<00:05:38.110> reason<00:05:38.410> it's

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
that is probably the biggest reason it's

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.130 
that is probably the biggest reason it's
not<00:05:39.310> often<00:05:39.700> somebody<00:05:40.150> makes<00:05:40.420> her<00:05:40.540> big<00:05:40.750> return

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
not often somebody makes her big return

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.340 
not often somebody makes her big return
and<00:05:41.470> loses<00:05:42.070> their<00:05:42.340> first<00:05:42.670> match<00:05:42.880> back<00:05:43.350> it's

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
and loses their first match back it's

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.500 
and loses their first match back it's
not<00:05:44.830> something<00:05:45.370> that<00:05:45.400> usually<00:05:45.940> happens<00:05:46.330> and

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
not something that usually happens and

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.820 
not something that usually happens and
it's<00:05:46.630> not<00:05:46.750> something<00:05:47.140> I<00:05:47.230> can<00:05:47.290> really<00:05:47.530> see

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
it's not something I can really see

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.490 
it's not something I can really see
happening<00:05:48.190> but<00:05:48.400> in<00:05:48.520> this<00:05:48.640> case<00:05:48.880> I<00:05:49.500> could

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
happening but in this case I could

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.350 
happening but in this case I could
actually<00:05:50.710> see<00:05:51.130> it<00:05:51.220> happening<00:05:51.580> give<00:05:51.880> just

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
actually see it happening give just

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.100 
actually see it happening give just
because<00:05:52.690> of<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.200> situation<00:05:53.440> CM<00:05:54.130> Punk<00:05:55.110> left

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
because of the situation CM Punk left

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.820 
because of the situation CM Punk left
and<00:05:57.040> the<00:05:57.160> way<00:05:57.310> CM<00:05:57.640> Punk<00:05:57.820> left<00:05:58.090> were<00:05:58.710> you<00:05:59.710> know

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
face soon and I feel that something

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.420 
face soon and I feel that something
needs<00:06:28.690> to<00:06:28.780> happen<00:06:28.840> for<00:06:29.350> him<00:06:29.440> to<00:06:29.590> turn<00:06:29.740> face<00:06:30.040> and

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
needs to happen for him to turn face and

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.730 
needs to happen for him to turn face and
that's<00:06:31.120> something<00:06:31.450> could<00:06:31.810> be<00:06:31.990> Paul<00:06:32.320> Heyman

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
that's something could be Paul Heyman

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.860 
that's something could be Paul Heyman
costing<00:06:33.190> him<00:06:33.310> this<00:06:33.490> match<00:06:33.670> up<00:06:33.700> at<00:06:34.270> payback

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
costing him this match up at payback

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.750 
costing him this match up at payback
and<00:06:36.990> if<00:06:37.530> he<00:06:37.740> cost<00:06:37.980> him<00:06:38.160> the<00:06:38.250> match<00:06:38.280> up<00:06:38.610> then

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
and if he cost him the match up then

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.190 
and if he cost him the match up then
that<00:06:39.000> would<00:06:39.150> mean<00:06:39.240> Chris<00:06:39.450> Jericho<00:06:39.750> wins<00:06:39.960> but

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
that would mean Chris Jericho wins but

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.600 
that would mean Chris Jericho wins but
