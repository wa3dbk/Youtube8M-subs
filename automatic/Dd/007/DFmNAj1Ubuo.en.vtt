00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.589
 more 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.989
 Welcome to the experiment of the week 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.199
 if you connect speakers to an amplifier then you have to pay attention 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.839
 that all speakers have the same prologue 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.759
 If you do not take that into account then it can happen that especially the bars 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.999
 but weak and lousy Habel sounds so important to the Poles 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.740
 Schalke's expression is caused by variations in the air, for example 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.540
 such a speaker membranes 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.450
 If the diaphragm moves forward then it compresses the air in front of it and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.060
 thus increases the air pressure 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.850
 the membrane moves back 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.400
 then the civil aviation each other and thus lowers the air pressure 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 and these pressure fluctuations spread in the air and can, for example 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.890
 reach our clock 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.550
 with the same polarized speakers, all membranes move in the 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.460
 Steady step, that is, all move simultaneously from the speaker 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.970
 out 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.750
 into the speaker 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.420
 and because now several membranes simultaneously an air bridge Noder 10 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 the pressure differences become bigger so it gets louder 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.810
 with not the same polarized speakers, the membrane move 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.930
 So they would be opposite a membrane from the speaker 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.950
 moved, the other moves straight into it 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.450
 The increased pressure of a Bronner is thus due to the reduced pressure 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.670
 the other diaphragm just picked up 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.780
 this causes the pressure fluctuations to become smaller 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.050
 so quieter 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.950
 and it is precisely this effect that one can cultivate and, for example, learn 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.810
 fight 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.450
 and how it works, let's take a look at it in a lab 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.600
 I just stand here in a Reflections on me room, everything always one 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.760
 A good idea is to get a cell phone for example by reflecting off the walls 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.040
 to minimize in acoustic experiments 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.230
 an important partner in the experiment that wants to make sure 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.079
 Peter first 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.340
 who will tell us right away whether it really will be with his choirmaster 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.190
 according to produce counter-noise or not 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.590
 He also lets himself be explained before the experiment is also quite easy 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.440
 once this yellow marked loud speaker who produces the noise 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.749
 we have labeled this blue according to spokesman of the left suit 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:18.849
 Noise produced 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.890
 and to get the goal 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.020
 Let's take this little microphone here 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.799
 the actual noise on the will then 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.799
 this regulation was almost led and builds from the noise 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.579
 suitable against noise then as I said through the blue speaker 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.079
 If we have done everything right it will be Peter at the Valais 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.089
 if we turn it on against noise you can unfortunately not see it 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.249
 you can not see the volume 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.289
 Let's take a look at the measurement results on this oscilloscope and Dillingen the 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:50.359
 you can see here are exactly the color matching the speaker 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.359
 blue speaker and the Mur of Peter this is not just red line 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.269
 and if he turns on noise then you can see on the 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.419
 yellow line 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.509
 hear it out there line he has roped rash and we see too 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:07.859
 drilling League still arrives because the red line for a correspondingly large 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:08.949
 Auschlag 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:12.559
 still the counter sound is not switched on that I do now per 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.929
 Push of a button and now you can see 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:18.629
 the one against sound is sent and the perpetrator suddenly sees it quietly 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.929
 one of the fact that the group is quite flat 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:23.579
 I hold out the counter-sound again 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.399
 gets loud again with Peter 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:28.269
 turn the counter sound on again 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.409
 then it gets quiet with Peter immediately 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.549
 Here in my position, unfortunately, you will not benefit from the effect because the whole thing 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.269
 System is designed 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.029
 to silence by Peter on more and not the ones in my position 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.430
 That's why it would be nice if we can turn off the sound now 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.489
 because it is already quite uncomfortable 8 Thank you 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.040
 This technology is now standard on headphones 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.520
 used so that, for example, on the train 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.560
 quite comfortable to put on headphones can produce the appropriate 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.390
 But no one could say anything about the chatter of the others 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.200
 Passengers still hear something of the noise of the train 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.190
 so that you can enjoy your music completely relaxed and beautiful 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.259
 Una that you have to especially loud Rehn 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.600
 yes that was it again for this episode 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.520
 stay curious until next time
