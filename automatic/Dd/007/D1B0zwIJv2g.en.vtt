Korra was learning to master her bending
abilities<00:01:07.759> so<00:01:08.090> that<00:01:08.210> she<00:01:08.330> could<00:01:08.450> achieve<00:01:08.570> the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
abilities so that she could achieve the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.680 
abilities so that she could achieve the
Avatar<00:01:09.350> state<00:01:09.619> now<00:01:10.340> in<00:01:10.550> this<00:01:10.789> season<00:01:11.090> she's

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
Avatar state now in this season she's

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.510

already<00:01:12.050> achieved<00:01:12.410> that<00:01:12.500> state<00:01:12.920> but<00:01:13.369> she's

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
already achieved that state but she's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.859 
already achieved that state but she's
got<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.760> learn<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.909> deepen<00:01:14.330> her<00:01:14.450> connection

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
got to learn to deepen her connection

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.690 
got to learn to deepen her connection
with<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.140> spiritual<00:01:15.590> world<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:16.130> her<00:01:16.490> avatar

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
with the spiritual world and her avatar

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.520 
with the spiritual world and her avatar
abilities<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:17.750> think<00:01:17.960> of<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.110> as<00:01:18.170> Korra

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
abilities so think of it as Korra

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.770 
abilities so think of it as Korra
getting<00:01:18.830> much<00:01:18.979> more<00:01:19.130> Zen<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:19.909> thematically<00:01:20.570> it

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
getting much more Zen so thematically it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.179 
getting much more Zen so thematically it
makes<00:01:20.960> sense<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.320> they<00:01:21.500> would<00:01:21.530> move<00:01:21.860> things

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
makes sense that they would move things

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.490 
makes sense that they would move things
into<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.610> spirit<00:01:23.000> realm<00:01:23.200> obviously<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.229> lot<00:01:24.470> of

obviously<00:01:40.520> transcending<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:41.390> higher

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
obviously transcending to this higher

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.960 
obviously transcending to this higher
state<00:01:41.930> means<00:01:42.229> that<00:01:42.560> her<00:01:43.100> enemies<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:43.880> her

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
state means that her enemies and her

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.520 
state means that her enemies and her
challenges<00:01:44.479> also<00:01:44.689> have<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:44.990> transcend<00:01:45.409> to

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
challenges also have to transcend to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.319 
challenges also have to transcend to
that<00:01:45.650> higher<00:01:45.829> state<00:01:46.100> with<00:01:46.280> her<00:01:46.400> think<00:01:47.150> about

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
that higher state with her think about

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.999 
that higher state with her think about
it<00:01:47.450> as<00:01:47.570> Korra<00:01:47.869> learning<00:01:48.229> more<00:01:48.380> about<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.740> why

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
it as Korra learning more about the why

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.100 
it as Korra learning more about the why
of<00:01:49.040> her<00:01:49.579> powers<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.119> not<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:50.479> much<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.689> how

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
of her powers and not so much the how

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.359 
of her powers and not so much the how
but<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.710> doesn't<00:01:52.009> mean<00:01:52.100> that<00:01:52.130> we're<00:01:52.310> not

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369

show like korra using our Avatar State

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.399 
show like korra using our Avatar State
for<00:02:27.940> comedy<00:02:28.269> I<00:02:28.480> don't<00:02:28.810> think<00:02:28.959> she's<00:02:29.079> gonna<00:02:29.170> do

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
for comedy I don't think she's gonna do

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.080 
for comedy I don't think she's gonna do
that<00:02:29.530> too<00:02:29.709> much<00:02:29.860> but<00:02:30.159> remember<00:02:30.459> she<00:02:30.640> has<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:30.849> lot

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
that too much but remember she has a lot

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.850 
that too much but remember she has a lot
of<00:02:31.120> firebending<00:02:31.900> blood<00:02:32.230> in<00:02:32.379> her<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:32.680> she's

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
of firebending blood in her so she's

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.559 
of firebending blood in her so she's
very<00:02:32.920> impulsive<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:33.879> I<00:02:34.060> think<00:02:34.239> they're<00:02:34.480> gonna

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
very impulsive so I think they're gonna

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:35.940 
very impulsive so I think they're gonna
use<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:34.930> for<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.170> lot<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.319> good<00:02:35.500> comedy

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
use that for a lot of good comedy

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.740 
use that for a lot of good comedy
moments<00:02:36.340> remember<00:02:37.030> how<00:02:37.150> they<00:02:37.269> actually<00:02:37.420> said

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
moments remember how they actually said

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.539 
moments remember how they actually said
that<00:02:37.780> they<00:02:37.989> modeled<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:38.560> Korra<00:02:39.010> character

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
that they modeled the Korra character

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.089 
that they modeled the Korra character
after<00:02:39.760> gina<00:02:40.540> carano<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:41.049> MMA<00:02:41.409> fighter<00:02:41.680> she

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
after gina carano the MMA fighter she

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.039 
after gina carano the MMA fighter she

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.220 
meet Cora's family and it's really funny
