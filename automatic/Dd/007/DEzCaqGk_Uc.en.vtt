00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.030
 what everyone his recent champions 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.759
 are at the shut breaking news today 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.980
 so we'll talk about gta 5 and 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.870
 of this future dlc that will arrive in my opinion 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.070
 in a very short time since 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.500
 by the way the people in 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.500
 speak a lot and to this famous 24 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.490
 February is next Tuesday normally 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.600
 if I say no nonsense I will 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.730
 look anyway in case we know 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.029
 never but normally it's the 24th 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.090
 this is it Tuesday, February 24 and here we go 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.559
 so we think to see this dlc happened today 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.480
 knowing that we had nothing for the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.579
 valentine's so down there we'll get 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.059
 to locate within seventy days without 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.070
 dlc 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.680
 so it's true that we can expect 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.450
 at any time a dlc certainly this 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.059
 Tuesday there because rockstar tends to 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.010
 get out of the dlc on Tuesday today I 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.489
 will show you some pictures so 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.520
 all 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.230
 all these pictures there will be leaked they 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.670
 will finally be the links will be in the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.609
 description it's just this 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.980
 famous twitter mw2 fans that I have 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.449
 well speak before I hope that 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.949
 nobody else has talked about it 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.990
 I do not know at all I did not look at 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.150
 within the community so here I am you 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.220
 share what I saw and who 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.780
 seem lease is rather we will say 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.040
 vehicles because that's because 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.470
 vehicles by cons here there are five 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.210
 vehicles he linked and I found that 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.670
 quite interesting some of which we 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.110
 knew it was seen also in some 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.509
 trailer like this first image that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.009
 I showed immediately on the screen that we 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.450
 also could see now this famous 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.030
 trailer with a kind of small 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.860
 turret and all and air 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.360
 we'll see if there are people who you 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.470
 follow or if you leave with the money and 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.630
 stuff like that it's true it's 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.860
 rather simple to arrive to sow them 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.470
 because it is still due to these big 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.119
 calibres and especially also a good 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.250
 small maneuverability at the vehicle level 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.509
 a little off-road and who can really 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.240
 allow us to move a little 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.369
 everywhere and that's to easily sow 6 to 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.740
 the police or if we end up with 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.479
 other enemies so it's true that 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.979
 this image there necessarily I think 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.960
 that you already know it already we already 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.210
 well spoken but in any case she was 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.880
 clicked so I passed to the second one 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.770
 second image that will be low they 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.800
 call it brakes mw2 was doing it new 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.630
 karine kourouma that looks really 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.920
 a Mitsubishi elsewhere as was 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.230
 also indicated by people in the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.580
 comments bar by the way quite 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.290
 pretty good I think who if she has a 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.400
 color I think it's not it 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.510
 not at all my only fulham to be 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.819
 completely black it's a shame 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.050
 but I think that if we put others on 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.190
 the custom is all with others 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.390
 colors and where I think it can be 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.120
 pretty interesting there I look at you 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.610
 frankly she is super pretty with a 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.239
 few particularities at the level 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.090
 windows 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.200
 I do not really know how that can 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.579
 also look like inside the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.079
 first person vehicle 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.480
 it can be quite interesting to see 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.280
 all of this sort of stop at her 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.850
 pretty flexible she pretty special I 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.510
 find it 's not what you 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.489
 think but I find it 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.630
 especially at the level of 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.250
 windows and where I feel like they 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.570
 have added a little layer to 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.380
 the imposing is moving towards the front of the 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.450
 vehicle 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.470
 well we can not see just in 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.760
 makes small squares so that the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.350
 people can see when he drives 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.200
 his seasons actually it can leave 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.540
 to think I do not know that it's still to be seen 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.490
 after in the future but it's true that 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.230
 I find this 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.480
 it's intriguing I do not have what you 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.130
 do you think me would me me that and 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.660
 dublin of additions is not at all 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.750
 perhaps to make it a pretty 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.350
 other shape our layer of vehicles 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.770
 pretty strange enough with news 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.130
 motorcycles that particularly mom a 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.450
 again finally more a motorcycle that we go 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.010
 find because I say news 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.930
 motorcycles but I think the season a little 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.450
 near all the same forms and all so 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.100
 it's the same series good here it's not 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.140
 something here that can be found 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.390
 but in any case good I have not seen yet 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.530
 before that kind of bike there so that 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.830
 may perhaps please some 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.390
 people we'll say motorcycles can be 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.610
 quite heavy and turn so that it stays at 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.500
 see in time but it's true that at 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.930
 level of shapes and where I find rather 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.270
 pretty and it makes me think of this famous 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.470
 also this famous pictures that was 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.810
 educated with for example this famous gang 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.340
 is all with also we could see the 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.690
 casino behind I do not know doing this 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.240
 peace like I 'm going to avoid that that's me 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.590
 makes you think a little about gangs and or who 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.990
 can get on this kind of bike 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.400
 is all with that it's pretty cool we're going 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.880
 move on with a new vehicle too 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.950
 come by bike or so volume 2 which has 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.090
 been to the cynics and since it's a 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.040
 aircraft currently found in 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.770
 gta 5 is also very slow very 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.489
 bitch honestly expected to ride 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.720
 earlier and 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.930
 we're going to maybe that and she 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.880
 looks really like 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.039
 the first version so I do not know 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.419
 at all but I think it's a 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.850
 second version that will go out mom 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.310
 she will have to be much faster is 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.750
 really handy which I hope this 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.580
 would be that there will be no big 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.110
 interest in using it with also a 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.110
 new helicopter we finish this 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.090
 video with is said there by the way very 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.979
 pretty frankly I do not have much 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.240
 to say good it's a pity that we find 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.400
 a little all these vehicles under the same 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.300
 the same color because I think we 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.479
 can find them under other 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.910
 colors that are even more attractive 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.440
 but in any case it's true that I 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.630
 found I find this helicopter quite 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.160
 pretty had rather descriptions rather 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.509
 positive those who have retweeted and everything 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.889
 after good it remains to see we can see 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.570
 also passing behind where there is the 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.800
 opportunity to welcome people well 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.270
 obviously where they can for example 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.680
 shoot all have small 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.340
 possible interactions with a small 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.720
 cannon I have the impression below 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.970
 the helicopter so that lets us think 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.949
 to several small things that will 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.300
 I hope in any case available from here 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.710
 very little time here it is pretty much 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.699
 while at the this video thank you 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.710
 put a little I like the video that makes 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.729
 great pleasure of the eyes on my page 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.050
 personal 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.190
 and then I tell you to the next cat 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.190
 show bizz art 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.039
 I
