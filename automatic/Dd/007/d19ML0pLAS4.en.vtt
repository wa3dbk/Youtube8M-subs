00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.440 
where you just kind of bounce it on your
face<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.460> gives<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:45.210> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
face and I think it gives just a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.950 
face and I think it gives just a
beautiful<00:01:46.250> finish<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.700> coverage<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
beautiful finish and coverage to the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.170 
beautiful finish and coverage to the
skin<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.439> looks<00:01:49.470> really<00:01:50.009> natural<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:50.970> and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
skin it looks really natural I think and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.090 
skin it looks really natural I think and
if<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.780> don't<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> Beauty<00:01:52.649> Blender<00:01:52.680> you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
if you don't have a Beauty Blender you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.920 
if you don't have a Beauty Blender you
should<00:01:53.280> totally<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.299> these<00:01:54.390> this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
should totally get one of these this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.499 
should totally get one of these this
will<00:01:55.200> make<00:01:55.229> even<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> ugly<00:01:56.820> foundation

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
will make even like the ugly foundation

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.709 
will make even like the ugly foundation
apply<00:01:58.079> nice<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.619> think<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.189> what<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.729> you

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
apply nice I think so what you do is you

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.139 
apply nice I think so what you do is you
it<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.799> actually<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:02.310> wet<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
it this is actually it's wet and it's a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.490 
it this is actually it's wet and it's a
little<00:02:03.390> bit<00:02:03.479> dirty<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:03.869> I've<00:02:04.110> used<00:02:04.290> it

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
little bit dirty because I've used it

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.679 
little bit dirty because I've used it
but<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.860> soak<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.579> into<00:02:05.790> water<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.479> kind

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
but you soak it into water and it kind

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.199 
but you soak it into water and it kind
of<00:02:06.750> blows<00:02:06.899> up<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.770> use<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.250> you

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
of blows up and then you use it to you

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.990 
of blows up and then you use it to you
know<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:09.629> either<00:02:09.720> bounce<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.470> way

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
know you can either bounce it this way

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.990 
know you can either bounce it this way
or<00:02:11.090> kind<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.450> roll<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.720> on<00:02:12.280> but<00:02:13.280> this<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:13.940> a

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
or kind of roll it on but this is a

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.580 
or kind of roll it on but this is a
great<00:02:14.330> item<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.750> half<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.350> if<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.500> don't
