00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
as he hits B to back out and not switch

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.580

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you think this is good just wait until I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.380 
you think this is good just wait until I
get<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.310> with<00:01:11.460> them<00:01:11.670> then<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.150> just

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
get on it with them then it is just

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
is the result and it's pretty easy to do

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.950 
is the result and it's pretty easy to do
if<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:56.969> don't<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.509> your<00:01:57.600> first<00:01:57.780> try

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
if you don't get it on your first try

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.480 
if you don't get it on your first try
like<00:01:58.409> let's<00:01:58.619> say<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.799> accidentally<00:01:59.280> kill

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
like let's say you accidentally kill

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.399 
like let's say you accidentally kill
your<00:01:59.700> friend<00:01:59.939> instead<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:01.110> make<00:02:01.290> your

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
your friend instead just make your

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.690 
your friend instead just make your
timing<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.799> little<00:02:01.829> bit<00:02:02.130> different<00:02:02.460> maybe

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
timing a little bit different maybe

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.789 
timing a little bit different maybe
shoot<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.240> little<00:02:03.600> bit<00:02:03.719> after<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.020> say<00:02:04.290> go<00:02:04.500> so

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
shoot a little bit after you say go so

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.709 
shoot a little bit after you say go so
that<00:02:04.950> he<00:02:05.159> backs<00:02:05.399> out<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.240> character

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
that he backs out of the character

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.479 
that he backs out of the character
switch<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.710> fire<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.310> like<00:02:08.459> a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
switch and then you fire just like a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.859 
switch and then you fire just like a
half<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.910> second<00:02:09.209> after<00:02:09.330> he<00:02:09.509> does<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.810> you

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
half a second after he does that you

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.540 
half a second after he does that you
might<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.319> tweak<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.679> little<00:02:10.709> bit<00:02:10.979> so

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
might have to tweak it a little bit so

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.740 
might have to tweak it a little bit so
with<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.819> that's<00:02:12.060> all<00:02:12.180> there<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.660> I
