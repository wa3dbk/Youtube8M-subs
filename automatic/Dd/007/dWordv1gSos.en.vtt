to<00:02:21.420> do<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.599> good<00:02:21.810> fight<00:02:22.049> and<00:02:22.700> my<00:02:23.700> corner<00:02:24.060> man<00:02:24.209> was

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
to do a good fight and my corner man was

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.820

were<00:03:15.750> very<00:03:16.410> effective<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.099> Machida<00:03:17.670> had<00:03:17.849> been

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000

were very effective and Machida had been
so<00:03:18.209> elusive<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:18.989> were<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.230> first<00:03:19.380> guy

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
so elusive and you were the first guy

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.559 
so elusive and you were the first guy
really<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.040> hit<00:03:20.160> him<00:03:20.280> consistently<00:03:20.670> can<00:03:21.480> you

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
really to hit him consistently can you

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.599 
really to hit him consistently can you
talk<00:03:21.810> about<00:03:21.840> what<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.410> saw<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.620> maybe<00:03:23.069> made

talk about what you saw that maybe made

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.580 
talk about what you saw that maybe made
him<00:03:23.849> available<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.780> be<00:03:24.930> hit<00:03:25.109> more<00:03:25.319> than<00:03:25.349> he'd

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
him available to be hit more than he'd

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.390 
him available to be hit more than he'd
been<00:03:25.739> in<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:25.889> past

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
months and uh we have been a my team and

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.110 
months and uh we have been a my team and
I<00:03:36.690> watched<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.650> lot<00:03:37.769> of<00:03:37.829> his<00:03:37.919> tapes<00:03:38.280> talked<00:03:38.970> a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
I watched a lot of his tapes talked a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.729 
I watched a lot of his tapes talked a
lot<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.450> we<00:03:39.510> came<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.139> conclusion<00:03:40.260> and

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
lot and we came to the conclusion and

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.319 
lot and we came to the conclusion and
agreed<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.310> strategy<00:03:41.579> that<00:03:41.970> we<00:03:42.120> thought

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
agreed on a strategy that we thought

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.809 
agreed on a strategy that we thought
would<00:03:42.540> work<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.859> think<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.430> was<00:03:44.549> able<00:03:44.730> to

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
would work and I think it was able to

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.879 
would work and I think it was able to
implement<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.389> strategy<00:03:45.900> well<00:03:46.049> enough<00:03:46.410> and

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
implement the strategy well enough and

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.890 
implement the strategy well enough and
I'm<00:03:47.099> very<00:03:47.280> happy<00:03:47.579> with<00:03:47.880> my<00:03:47.940> performance<00:03:48.269> but

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
before this I think we'll see the the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.150 
before this I think we'll see the the
Shogun<00:04:39.840> from<00:04:40.080> Pride<00:04:40.380> that'll<00:04:40.770> be<00:04:40.860> fighting

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
Shogun from Pride that'll be fighting

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.930 
Shogun from Pride that'll be fighting
the<00:04:41.220> cheetah<00:04:41.430> tonight<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.450> it<00:04:42.570> was<00:04:43.700> you<00:04:44.700> did

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
the cheetah tonight and it was you did

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.790 
the cheetah tonight and it was you did
press<00:04:45.480> the<00:04:45.660> action<00:04:45.870> toward<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.470> end<00:04:46.590> of<00:04:46.710> the

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
press the action toward the end of the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.900 
press the action toward the end of the
third<00:04:47.010> round<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.490> thought<00:04:47.640> it<00:04:47.760> was<00:04:47.850> a

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
third round and I thought it was a

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.420 
third round and I thought it was a
pretty<00:04:48.120> festive<00:04:48.450> a<00:04:49.020> few<00:04:49.470> moments<00:04:49.890> for<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.190> why

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
pretty festive a few moments for you why

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.190 
pretty festive a few moments for you why
why<00:04:50.910> didn't<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:51.330> keep<00:04:51.480> that<00:04:51.690> going<00:04:51.870> for<00:04:51.990> the

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
why didn't you keep that going for the

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.460 
why didn't you keep that going for the
last<00:04:52.380> two<00:04:53.070> rounds<00:04:53.900> it's<00:04:54.900> just<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.170> matter<00:04:55.350> of

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
last two rounds it's just a matter of
