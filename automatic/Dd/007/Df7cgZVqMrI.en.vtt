00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 toulon clermont do not have to mayol but 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.899
 annie in a football stadium the alliance 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.849
 brand new riviera 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.440
 now for brand new rugby and 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.929
 who had obviously refueled for 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.210
 the revenge you know of the final 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.920
 europe cup Toulon four clermont 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.150
 month later jérôme pineau clearly 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.189
 has taken a step back since this final 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.689
 lost face toulon the atmosphere between 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.230
 the two captains at the toast is 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.900
 very good 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.439
 aurelian blush and chris masoe at the same 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.439
 the tac spirit 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:44.110
 frankly 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.610
 it's hot this game it's mostly the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.270
 reunion between john armitage and 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.400
 james brock 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.720
 since this gesture in the final the 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.149
 Toulon is whistling on all 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.739
 top 14 pitches before the match 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.610
 two players did not cross each other 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.610
 so did not have them sing 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.510
 on the other hand the public Toulon did not 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.070
 rendered service to his player by whistling 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.489
 copiously james on every attempt 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.489
 of penalty 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.310
 I did not hear too much it was just 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.130
 voted on purpose I do not like that I 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.770
 think it's me other players 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.909
 in our team and I find his 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.340
 unfortunate because for rugby 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.049
 the guys they come they want to play 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.390
 good for teams that do not deserve 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.920
 to be whistled at the Michelin we have people 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.470
 who applauded and each time to the shots 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.170
 to the goal so the noise it may have me 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.759
 not too jane does not disturbed by the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.350
 noise but probably by this new 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.460
 carbo james stadium in first half time 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.229
 missed three penalties 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.119
 other quacks the stadium's lawn that does not 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.380
 do not resist tilling the forwards the 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.659
 stadium gardener with a touch of humor 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.549
 were expecting worse catastrophic that 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.959
 it's better to present than expected because 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.090
 that was good some areas that have been 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.860
 damaged I also thank the teams who 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.429
 have played well the game by replaquering I 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.020
 think definitively the gardener of 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.409
 register to make hair 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.880
 whites 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.049
 the gentleman said that I made myself 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.280
 white hair during half time but 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.110
 good in fact hair I can not in 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.299
 have developed under the eyes of 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.500
 frédéric michalak clermont transparent 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.269
 during his last trip to 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.899
 Montpellier decided to show another 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.940
 face 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.060
 away from home transfer is back 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.860
 and not just the arts 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.720
 his return to the game with the Clermont 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.270
 holidays in mailboxes 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.040
 pieces of the gluttony chessboard there 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.570
 had support his left he kept 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.400
 and we are still in the lead with 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.760
 thierry lacrampe and all the others 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.079
 in you and it's a damien test 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.510
 chouly with initially a fault of 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.140
 defense in the middle of the field 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.019
 misunderstanding when matt giteau and 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.319
 maxim mermoz that allows regan king of 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.319
 escape 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.790
 then stanley the purpose of serving 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.799
 blush on his left but fortunately 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.409
 for him the action ends in the end 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.409
 clearly after 24 minutes leads 10 to 6 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.140
 pierre mignoni is reframing his team and 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.390
 especially mermoz toulouse returns in 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.200
 the match thanks to palisson of a small 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.900
 kick over they 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.420
 recover the international winger 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.060
 show the way on the outsides the 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.280
 number exists but the all black ali 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.230
 williams is slow to give up his ball 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.430
 Clermont is not far from giving way 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.430
 just that the Toulon applies 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.150
 he makes sequences day 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.970
 with 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.800
 who sees himself 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.060
 question of the South African giant we're going 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.970
 play the same sense with who ask us 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.170
 These persons 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.170
 however for palissier 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.930
 an essay given to video arbitrage 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.239
 mermoz suffered before setting foot 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.340
 in layers the test is therefore valid 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.549
 maxim mermoz relieved in more ways than one 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.420
 by this effect and it is that we take it ago 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.480
 maybe a little misunderstanding 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.959
 between me and me so I was a little 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.569
 angry and I count in range that 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.549
 mark even if to say it was not 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.790
 done but his request was able to find some 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.379
 patience and poutine the land of 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.329
 toulouse takes over 13 to 10 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.950
 morgan parra rest is thierry 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.840
 lacrampe numbered 9 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.000
 and they do pretty well carry a framing 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.500
 overflow on guito please to 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.629
 his kits not seals and armitage 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.229
 Lacrampe is about to score 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:19.109
 the weekend try like a little bit of 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.630
 speed for victims overtaken abs 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.400
 the other of their age almost happy with 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.800
 coach and a patroller touched 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.260
 almost there the care of oneself I will pass 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.539
 they are the heroes go quickly to the 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.440
 half time toulon leads 16 to 13 wilkinson 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.610
 substitute 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.650
 it is matt giteau who is looking for 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.280
 shots on goal with 7 shots on goal succeeded 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.990
 out of 8 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.430
 he scored 20 of the 25 points of his 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.760
 team and allows toulouse to 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.760
 carry the day 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.849
 we had at heart durban i for after 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.460
 our service 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:51.500
 timorous as of last saturday we 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.759
 needed to be reassured to regain 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.220
 facing a team that we know well 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.240
 we were expecting this kind of match and I 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.949
 think that autonomy come to me 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.879
 look for merit in view of the 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.889
 delivery they realized 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.750
 today a defensive bonus point 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.889
 got at the last second with this 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.250
 james brock penalty 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.720
 final score 25 to 19 clermont brings back 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.580
 nice more than a bonus point 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.770
 there is a handshake between armitage 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.060
 and James a gesture that I hope will 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.060
 cut the whistle for a long time
