00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
know like what I'm talking about

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.920 
know like what I'm talking about
accuracy<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.270> leaderboards<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.810> know

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
accuracy on the leaderboards you know

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.990 
accuracy on the leaderboards you know
some<00:02:04.140> people<00:02:04.350> would<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> 30<00:02:05.130> accuracy<00:02:05.880> and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
some people would have a 30 accuracy and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.059 
some people would have a 30 accuracy and
all<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.240> stuff<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:06.540> now<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.590> not<00:02:07.770> even<00:02:07.979> on

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
all that stuff but now it's not even on

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.290 
all that stuff but now it's not even on
the<00:02:08.099> leaderboards<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.759> he<00:02:08.879> said<00:02:09.060> he<00:02:09.149> doesn't

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the leaderboards and he said he doesn't

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.050 
the leaderboards and he said he doesn't
give<00:02:09.660> two<00:02:09.810> fucks<00:02:10.020> about<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.550> think<00:02:11.610> that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
give two fucks about it and I think that

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.820 
give two fucks about it and I think that
if<00:02:12.239> they<00:02:12.360> took<00:02:12.629> Katie<00:02:12.930> out

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
if they took Katie out

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.970 
if they took Katie out
that<00:02:14.130> would<00:02:14.400> completely<00:02:14.970> change<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.900> lot<00:02:16.800> of

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
that would completely change a lot of

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.140 
that would completely change a lot of
the<00:02:17.070> shit<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.310> goes<00:02:17.430> down<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:17.940> game

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
the shit that goes down on the game

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.060 
the shit that goes down on the game
because<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.720> know<00:02:18.840> black<00:02:19.050> ops<00:02:19.320> or<00:02:19.650> any<00:02:19.830> call

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
because you know black ops or any call

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.410 
because you know black ops or any call
of<00:02:20.190> duty<00:02:20.400> if<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.640> dashboard<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.270> game

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
of duty if you dashboard the game

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.870 
of duty if you dashboard the game
automatically<00:02:21.960> ends<00:02:22.260> if<00:02:22.440> your<00:02:22.590> host<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
automatically ends if your host and that

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.520 
automatically ends if your host and that
sucks<00:02:24.210> especially<00:02:24.450> when<00:02:25.020> you're<00:02:25.140> having<00:02:25.470> a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
sucks especially when you're having a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.230 
sucks especially when you're having a
really<00:02:25.770> good<00:02:25.950> game<00:02:26.160> in<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> host<00:02:26.580> dashboards

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
really good game in the host dashboards

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.740 
really good game in the host dashboards
because<00:02:28.080> he<00:02:28.500> doesn't<00:02:28.740> give<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> fuck<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.750> it's

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
because he doesn't give a fuck and it's

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.020 
because he doesn't give a fuck and it's
just<00:02:30.990> all<00:02:31.110> about<00:02:31.200> him<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.500> his<00:02:31.650> Katie<00:02:31.920> if<00:02:32.370> they

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
just all about him and his Katie if they

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.520 
just all about him and his Katie if they
completely<00:02:33.420> took<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.780> off<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.930> leaderboards

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
completely took it off the leaderboards

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.750 
completely took it off the leaderboards
I<00:02:34.650> don't<00:02:34.800> think<00:02:34.980> you'd<00:02:35.130> have<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.430> deal<00:02:35.610> with

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
I don't think you'd have to deal with

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.360 
I don't think you'd have to deal with
that<00:02:35.940> because<00:02:36.600> people<00:02:37.290> wouldn't<00:02:37.890> give<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> fuck

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
that because people wouldn't give a fuck

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.950 
that because people wouldn't give a fuck
they<00:02:38.490> would<00:02:38.640> have<00:02:38.760> no<00:02:38.940> reason<00:02:38.970> dashboard

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
they would have no reason dashboard

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.150 
they would have no reason dashboard
unless<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.320> know<00:02:40.410> their<00:02:40.530> power<00:02:40.710> goes<00:02:40.950> out<00:02:41.100> or

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
unless you know their power goes out or

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.530 
unless you know their power goes out or
they<00:02:41.340> get<00:02:41.430> bored<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.730> turn<00:02:41.880> off<00:02:42.000> their<00:02:42.120> xbox

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
they get bored and turn off their xbox

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.330 
they get bored and turn off their xbox
but<00:02:42.810> other<00:02:43.440> than<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.740> you're<00:02:44.010> not<00:02:44.130> going<00:02:44.280> to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
but other than that you're not going to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.010 
but other than that you're not going to
run<00:02:44.490> into<00:02:44.610> those<00:02:44.790> Katie<00:02:45.120> whores<00:02:45.480> even<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:45.930> they

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
run into those Katie whores even if they

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.050 
run into those Katie whores even if they
took<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.320> off<00:02:46.410> call<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.770> duty<00:02:46.980> elite<00:02:47.190> now<00:02:48.030> i

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
took it off call of duty elite now i

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.220 
took it off call of duty elite now i
know<00:02:48.240> i'll<00:02:48.450> probably<00:02:48.600> get<00:02:48.750> some<00:02:48.900> hate<00:02:49.050> for

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
know i'll probably get some hate for

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.560 
know i'll probably get some hate for
this<00:02:49.350> but<00:02:50.220> i<00:02:50.250> think<00:02:50.640> that's<00:02:50.910> what<00:02:51.300> would<00:02:51.420> be

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
this but i think that's what would be

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.240 
this but i think that's what would be
best<00:02:51.780> i<00:02:52.020> mean<00:02:52.170> i<00:02:52.200> don't<00:02:52.470> see<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> point<00:02:52.890> in<00:02:53.010> katy

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
best i mean i don't see a point in katy

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.430 
best i mean i don't see a point in katy
and<00:02:53.550> that's<00:02:54.240> looking<00:02:54.570> back<00:02:54.690> at<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.990> now<00:02:55.020> I

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and that's looking back at it now I

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.290 
and that's looking back at it now I
don't<00:02:55.620> till<00:02:55.890> this<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.520> day<00:02:56.580> wonder<00:02:57.120> why

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
don't till this I to this day wonder why

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.030 
don't till this I to this day wonder why
I<00:02:57.330> got<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:57.750> obsessed<00:02:58.080> with<00:02:58.500> Katie<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.830> all

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
I got so obsessed with Katie and all

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.490 
I got so obsessed with Katie and all
that<00:02:59.190> stuff<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.580> mean<00:02:59.760> who<00:03:00.540> gives<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.900> fuck<00:03:01.080> it

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
that stuff I mean who gives a fuck it

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.290 
that stuff I mean who gives a fuck it
doesn't<00:03:01.830> mean<00:03:01.920> anything<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.640> not<00:03:02.970> going<00:03:03.150> to

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
doesn't mean anything it's not going to

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.540 
doesn't mean anything it's not going to
affect<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.780> whatsoever<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:05.070> know<00:03:05.190> later<00:03:05.430> on

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
affect you whatsoever you know later on

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.920 
affect you whatsoever you know later on
in<00:03:05.790> life<00:03:05.820> it's<00:03:06.209> just<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.510> number<00:03:06.660> on<00:03:06.900> a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
in life it's just a number on a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.900 
in life it's just a number on a
leaderboard<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:08.340> think<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:08.730> just

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
leaderboard and I think it's just

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.150 
leaderboard and I think it's just
totally<00:03:09.300> irrelevant<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.590> would<00:03:10.770> get<00:03:10.980> rid

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
totally irrelevant and it would get rid

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.560 
totally irrelevant and it would get rid
of<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.340> lot<00:03:11.490> of<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.700> dashboarding<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.390> stuff

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
of a lot of the dashboarding and stuff

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.360 
of a lot of the dashboarding and stuff
that<00:03:12.600> goes<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:12.990> in<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.200> game<00:03:13.320> but<00:03:13.590> those<00:03:14.220> are

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
that goes on in the game but those are

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.680 
that goes on in the game but those are
just<00:03:14.459> my<00:03:14.550> thoughts<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:15.120> could<00:03:15.270> go<00:03:15.390> on<00:03:15.420> forever
