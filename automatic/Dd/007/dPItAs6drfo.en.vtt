00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.630
 hello everyone i 'm david muñoz teacher 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.480
 of the music conservatory tube 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.950
 Gijón we continue with the sixth video 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.529
 explanatory that this time it will be a bit 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.180
 different since we will focus on the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.550
 benefits that it has for the musicians of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.289
 wind-metal work with the mouthpiece 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.660
 the work with the mouthpiece has 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.120
 multiple benefits which we can 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.550
 summarize in five points first 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.260
 substantial improvement of our sound and 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.840
 that you work with much more air than 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.350
 play the instrument 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.160
 second an improvement of our 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.780
 ear 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.550
 since we first put all our 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.800
 attention on listening to the tuning 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.640
 correct to later reproduce it with 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.290
 our mouthpiece 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.820
 but there is a direct connection 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.399
 between the sound that we imagine in 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.079
 our mind with which we produce in 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.699
 the mouthpiece therefore we will be 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.899
 working the fourth sound concept 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.690
 provides the correct formation of the 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.750
 embouchure as well as avoid the appearance 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.280
 of bad habits and fifth if what 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.470
 we practice regularly 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.570
 will provide a much warmer 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.320
 efficient on those occasions in the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.570
 that we can not use the instruments 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.810
 how do we do the exercises with the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.790
 nozzle 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.430
 the first step would be to always perform 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.990
 great inhalations to be able to work 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.000
 with the mouthpiece we must always perform 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.009
 great breaths being aware 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.330
 that our throat is 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:37.120
 open to the maximum to feel this 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.010
 we can use a tube of about two 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.330
 centimeters and a half of diameter for 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.840
 perform exercise 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.350
 or with the back of the mouthpiece 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.350
 we introduce in the mouth 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.940
 and that will help us to have a throat 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.760
 open 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.730
 second work with large flows of 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.310
 air for it we are going to use the part 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.740
 external hand and we should feel that 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.550
 we blow a lot of air to 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.550
 through the mouthpiece 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.300
 third we have to feel that we blow 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.670
 between the notes if we look for this idea 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.950
 mental will help us connect much more 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.650
 the bound ones and locate them 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.019
 and fourth course of always using a 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.190
 tuner or a piano to have a good 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:35.770
 reference in terms of tuning 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.100
 below as you can see about the 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.030
 blackboard I have five exercises that 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.730
 I consider that they are the most 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.430
 representative now of the work with 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.730
 nozzle 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.989
 we start with the first 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.989
 referring to fill them 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.350
 Hello 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.080
 As you can see, this can be done by the 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.540
 different degrees of scale and in all 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.319
 the tonalities second exercise 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.319
 is to see us 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.630
 reference great innovation 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.629
 and 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.790
 or 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.790
 Hello 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.609
 what 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.720
 we would not continue 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.700
 until all the triples of the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.700
 scale and by all grades 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.470
 arriving thus using the intervals 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.470
 two 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.690
 etcetera until you reach the eighth east 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.560
 it can also be done from top to bottom 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.940
 quarter 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.940
 doing it was 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.950
 or 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.860
 Y 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:43.919
 etcetera and also from acute to severe and the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.330
 fifth would be to play small songs 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.720
 to enhance music with our 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.240
 nozzle 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.750
 Needless to say, all the exercises 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.289
 you have to do it always looking 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.240
 the music 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.240
 and this would be the anthem of joy 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.230
 I want 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.349
 single 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.520
 and this would be a fantastic exercise 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.620
 perform it in all shades 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.940
 finally and to finish I would like 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.919
 recommend two things the first is a 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.599
 book specially designed for 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.000
 work by the mouthpiece is called brass 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.529
 wood is designed for each of the 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.060
 metal foundation instruments 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:36.760
 and it comes with a cd 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.040
 that supports the work that is done in 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.400
 the interior I consider a book very 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.980
 entertaining very valid very progressive and 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.169
 funny 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.490
 and then I want to recommend this 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.310
 small gadget for those moments 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.660
 where we can not touch we do not have 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.090
 the instrument we do not have our 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.860
 mouthpiece but that with this is a 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.949
 nozzle that líber that we can carry 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.860
 in our backpack and with a small tube 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:05.229
 to which we have made a small 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.410
 insertion at the end to be heard 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:11.080
 we can work in a crowd 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:14.260
 these exercises even if we put the 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.490
 cde the feature on our mobile or a 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.970
 tablet we can perform the exercises 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.129
 In any moment, in any place 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.949
 very useful 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.300
 this is all if you want to find more 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.599
