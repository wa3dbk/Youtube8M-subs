00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.140
 and 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.240
 hello and welcome to guide of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.279
 Proteins for a new test product 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.189
 so in this video I'm going to make a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.169
 thesis of the terrible then orwell of mx3 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.640
 so as his name indicates it is 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.859
 of a law and proteins here we are on 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.540
 a concentrated protein so a way the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.140
 more classic we will say in terms of 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.099
 composition 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.500
 we are on 72 lucas% protein 7.6 of 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.210
 carbohydrates and 9.1 lipids so we are 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.469
 a little bit high for lipids and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.120
 for proteins is quite in 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.280
 the average for this type of products 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.960
 note that this is a protein obtained 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.610
 by more squat ultrafiltration taf 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.680
 while it is a protein of 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.000
 third not sawed finally pretty positive 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.610
 since it is less to denature a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.380
 hour cheese protein then in term 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.670
 of composition so we're on some 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.710
 something quite classic with a 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.140
 little interesting point to emphasize 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.540
 is that we have an age where in vitamins and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.460
 minerals with a content that is going to be from to 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.960
 about 18% to act therefore for those who 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.000
 have an unbalanced diet and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.520
 40th it may be a little more no 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.310
 negligible then we will do 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.490
 directly the test of the mixture and the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.049
 taste so with two doses is perfume 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.639
 chocolate in 150 me liters of water two 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.789
 others are about thirty or so 

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:22.789
 grams 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.869
 so the balloon I'm going from this not it's 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.189
 rather not bad 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.570
 the fear of entering the word we have a 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.600
 little fly here but that looks pretty 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.830
 fine so that's going to be pretty good at 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.420
 note also that we are here on a brand 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.890
 with a product made in 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.149
 the european union which is always 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.659
 interesting from a point of view 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.659
 traceability 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.840
 know and this something pretty 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.530
 creamy which is relatively logical 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.120
 given the reassuring proteins and liquids 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.890
 with a chocolate taste that is pretty 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.260
 a little bit of cocoa that comes 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.550
 behind not very sweet I like 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.140
 it's rather positive in terms of taste I 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.580
 did not feel clement lamouche 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.170
 was playing there was very fine but 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.970
 finally she has already fallen back so 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.310
 rather positive about the mix 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.840
 to conclude on this product we are on 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.730
 a very classic protein 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.650
 has the heart conventional protein dosage 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.330
 the site in the average with an addition in 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.560
 vitamins and minerals for a brand 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.690
 French and then something that 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.580
 say well without my sense of the word with a 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.050
 chocolate taste not very sweet so 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.040
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.150
 this is the case do not hesitate to make a 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.690
 little chick mars youtube it's done 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.160
 always happy 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.510
 do not hesitate to subscribe to 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.770
 our channel which we did not miss anything of the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.770
 future video same time
