compartment but also it just doesn't
look<00:01:57.630> clean<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.079> know<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.469> always<00:01:58.680> good<00:01:58.860> to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
look clean you know it's always good to

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.280 
look clean you know it's always good to
be<00:01:59.040> clean<00:01:59.750> basically<00:02:00.750> what<00:02:00.869> i'm<00:02:00.930> going<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.110> do

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
be clean basically what i'm going to do

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.230 
be clean basically what i'm going to do
is<00:02:01.560> these<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.280> things<00:02:02.460> are<00:02:02.670> pretty<00:02:02.909> hard<00:02:03.149> to

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
is these are things are pretty hard to

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.209 
is these are things are pretty hard to
get<00:02:03.390> off<00:02:03.509> using<00:02:04.170> any<00:02:04.290> conventional<00:02:04.829> tools<00:02:05.040> or

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
get off using any conventional tools or

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.700 
get off using any conventional tools or
even<00:02:05.250> your<00:02:05.460> hand

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
even your hand

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.850 
even your hand
so<00:02:06.310> they<00:02:06.400> have<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.549> specially<00:02:07.000> made<00:02:07.210> oil<00:02:07.860> wrench

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
so they have a specially made oil wrench

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.680 
so they have a specially made oil wrench
and<00:02:09.250> what<00:02:09.399> that's<00:02:09.550> going<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.729> do<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.660> it's

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
and what that's going to do is it's

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.980 
and what that's going to do is it's
going<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:10.990> latch<00:02:11.170> down<00:02:11.470> on<00:02:11.620> my<00:02:11.740> oil<00:02:12.040> filter<00:02:12.340> and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
going to latch down on my oil filter and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.110 
going to latch down on my oil filter and
it's<00:02:13.990> going<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.170> be<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> nice<00:02:14.470> tight<00:02:14.770> grip<00:02:15.120> that

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
it's going to be a nice tight grip that

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.320 
it's going to be a nice tight grip that
way<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.300> can<00:02:16.390> take<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.720> off<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.290> put<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.830> on<00:02:17.980> and

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
way I can take it off and put it on and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.850 
way I can take it off and put it on and
