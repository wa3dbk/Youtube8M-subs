00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
the stroke in After Effects okay so this

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.450 
the stroke in After Effects okay so this
is<00:00:10.170> really<00:00:10.380> easy<00:00:10.620> all<00:00:10.950> you're<00:00:11.160> going<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.340> need

is really easy all you're going to need
is<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.880> actual<00:00:12.179> program<00:00:12.509> itself<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.559> if<00:00:13.980> head

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
is the actual program itself so if head

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.810 
is the actual program itself so if head
on<00:00:14.580> into<00:00:14.759> After<00:00:15.059> Effects<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:16.400> you<00:00:17.400> can't<00:00:17.640> do

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
on into After Effects and you can't do

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.910 
on into After Effects and you can't do
this<00:00:17.970> with<00:00:18.150> shapes<00:00:18.420> text<00:00:19.080> masks<00:00:19.529> anything

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
this with shapes text masks anything

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.330 
this with shapes text masks anything
okay

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
okay

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.259 
okay
so<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.250> simple<00:00:23.250> circle<00:00:23.640> being

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
so this is just a simple circle being

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.480 
so this is just a simple circle being
drawn<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.710> so<00:00:25.710> I'll<00:00:25.949> show<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.160> how<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.430> that

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
drawn on so I'll show you how to do that

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.650 
drawn on so I'll show you how to do that
first<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.060> then<00:00:27.150> secondly<00:00:28.080> there's<00:00:28.830> text

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
first and then secondly there's text

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.930 
first and then secondly there's text
okay<00:00:31.669> like<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:34.219> starting<00:00:35.219> off<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
okay like that so starting off with the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.280 
okay like that so starting off with the
shapes<00:00:36.180> make<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> new<00:00:37.170> comp<00:00:38.480> alright<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.750> you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
shapes make a new comp alright so you

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.029 
shapes make a new comp alright so you
know<00:00:40.410> layer<00:00:40.680> new<00:00:41.309> solid<00:00:44.120> okay<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.710> then<00:00:46.710> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
know layer new solid okay and then you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.720 
know layer new solid okay and then you
want<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:48.140> draw<00:00:49.140> your<00:00:49.260> shape<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:49.730> obviously

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
want to draw your shape out obviously

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.310 
want to draw your shape out obviously
this<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.940> really<00:00:51.300> simple<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.780> always<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.140> more

you were to 0 and say I wanted to start
at<00:01:29.520> 1<00:01:29.700> second<00:01:30.350> click<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.530> stopwatch<00:01:31.770> which

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
at 1 second click on the stopwatch which

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.870 
at 1 second click on the stopwatch which
I'll<00:01:32.220> set<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> keyframe<00:01:33.380> drag<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.829> timeline<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
I'll set a keyframe drag the timeline to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.590 
I'll set a keyframe drag the timeline to
a<00:01:35.909> want<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> end

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
a want it to end

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.490 
a want it to end
so<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.590> second<00:01:37.950> dish<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:39.049> finish<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.170> 100%

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
so I one second dish and finish at 100%

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.649 
so I one second dish and finish at 100%
if<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.340> click<00:01:41.579> off<00:01:41.729> should<00:01:42.270> create<00:01:42.450> another

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
if you click off should create another

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.020 
if you click off should create another
keyframe<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:44.070> go<00:01:44.159> back<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.670> I'll<00:01:44.820> run

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
keyframe and you go back and I'll run

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.999 
keyframe and you go back and I'll run
preview<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:48.290> just<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.590> okay<00:01:49.829> that's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
preview it just like that okay that's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.690 
preview it just like that okay that's
really<00:01:50.340> simple<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.240> text<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:52.100> not<00:01:53.100> very<00:01:53.460> hard

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
really simple the text one not very hard

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.690 
really simple the text one not very hard
to<00:01:53.880> slightly<00:01:54.119> more<00:01:54.420> complex<00:01:54.720> okay<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.490> want

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
to slightly more complex okay you want

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.550 
to slightly more complex okay you want
to<00:01:56.850> make<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> new<00:01:57.840> comp<00:01:58.110> again<00:02:00.409> then<00:02:01.409> you'll

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
to make a new comp again then you'll

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.240 
to make a new comp again then you'll
want<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.890> draw<00:02:02.250> your<00:02:02.399> text<00:02:02.670> layer<00:02:04.070> I'll<00:02:05.070> write

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
want to draw your text layer I'll write

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.330 
want to draw your text layer I'll write
tutorial

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340

click create masks from text and that'll

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.520 
click create masks from text and that'll
turn<00:02:15.300> off<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.570> original<00:02:15.990> text<00:02:16.230> layer<00:02:16.380> and
