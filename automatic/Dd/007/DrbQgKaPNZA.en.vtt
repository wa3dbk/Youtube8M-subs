00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hi nice that you watch this video 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.569
 today i have a christmas for you 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.160
 do yourself where i give you tips how you 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.710
 some fun group accessories 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.840
 pimp for Christmas and are really super 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.259
 easy trick is these things for this 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.440
 required 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.460
 two preserving jars or jars and there is the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.449
 pebbles 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.539
 you need loose glitter and two 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.800
 of these correction pins or the backs 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.599
 and then we are going to use these correction pins 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.039
 get started right away 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.320
 this collection of pens gives a whole 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.450
 nice matte white effect and with that you can 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.760
 difficult this road bones 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.260
 asterisks or snow plow fish at 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.550
 news of foot squeeze the pump 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.739
 products from 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.540
 I can experience all kinds of characters and 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.360
 no matter how sweet completely tidy 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.120
 is because this is hand is like it 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.289
 then a bit messy is that yes 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.629
 that also has something again 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.969
 and as a notion of environment we slipped 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.550
 leave your voice and pumps and then you get 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.800
 this nice Christmas behind the on wintry 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.570
 result 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.670
 we continue with the main road I come 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.680
 start with the tape and make it 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.200
 Find offer some sort of separation 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.330
 from god and we go the bottom of the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.530
 until recently cover with a lot 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.080
 glitter 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.340
 to get into the Christmas spirit 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.590
 who can of course also the whole pot then 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.210
 but i need the hero being fun 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.580
 then I take the glue and I apply the glue 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.600
 at the bottom of the pot so under the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.250
 adhesive tape 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.320
 I use small animal a lot but good 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 it is important that it is well covered 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.090
 with line I have an old brush and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.940
 with that I cross the line 4 times 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.390
 bottom god and then i go with the 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.759
 separate flash strokes I yes this this 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.030
 just about the over the bottom where the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.710
 line is and the well will then have a waste 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.880
 and so whether you have a newspaper underneath 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.500
 have 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.440
 bring enough on all pieces 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.030
 is completely covered and yes 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.100
 divide it a bit 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.750
 sometimes you go ceiling to pick up it's the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.610
 meaning you can have a nice tight 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.289
 line and avoid getting into the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.300
 slip so maybe I can tip 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.759
 to some sort of it 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.050
 because fair trade to use as yet 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.050
 when i see the result we live too 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.300
 then the candle there I am actually 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.130
 the same 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.110
 I apply the line at the bottom 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.880
 but now I'm just going to break up 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.200
 also because I like it pretty much 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.709
 overflows 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.450
 we split the opera and then have 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.400
 you just pound a whole atmosphere 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.739
 card just a bit better at the cache 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.330
 by the idea that if you also have other 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.459
 color to use again but I was whole 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.830
 many very small remain inferior to 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.290
 oil on you this way we eat I have 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.599
 a glitter stones on it 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.500
 look or first smell and then the 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.600
 been there 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.880
 yes very nice to you then collection 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.739
 direction and to light it 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.140
 in order to just whole 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.299
 nowadays parties is well this one 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.410
 I am going to use the large preservation jar first 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.239
 to keep in booklets 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.190
 it is of course tasty but so is the one 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.180
 really nice out of the bus with this one 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.640
 gingerbread cookies and close feel 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.319
 then they stand for the super mess 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.319
 yes on the table 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.019

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.909
