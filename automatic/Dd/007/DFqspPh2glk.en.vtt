00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
that and here it is let's take a small

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:54.040 
that and here it is let's take a small
alright<00:01:46.690> so<00:01:48.760> here<00:01:49.760> we<00:01:49.970> go<00:01:50.080> this<00:01:51.080> is<00:01:51.140> it<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:53.780> this

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
alright so here we go this is it so this

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.700 
alright so here we go this is it so this
one<00:01:54.350> believe<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.430> has<00:01:55.640> either<00:01:56.060> 16<00:01:56.720> or<00:01:56.840> 32<00:01:57.380> gigs

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
one believe it has either 16 or 32 gigs

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.430 
one believe it has either 16 or 32 gigs
of<00:01:57.950> internal<00:01:58.040> memory<00:01:58.550> which<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.000> not<00:01:59.180> much<00:01:59.440> the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
of internal memory which is not much the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.130 
of internal memory which is not much the
acer<00:02:00.920> model<00:02:01.340> has<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.060> lot<00:02:02.420> more<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.780> actually

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
acer model has a lot more it actually

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.340 
acer model has a lot more it actually
comes<00:02:03.350> but<00:02:03.620> like<00:02:04.000> 500<00:02:05.000> gig<00:02:05.180> hard<00:02:05.210> drive<00:02:05.479> inside

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
comes but like 500 gig hard drive inside

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.230 
comes but like 500 gig hard drive inside
five<00:02:06.590> hundred<00:02:06.920> or<00:02:07.010> two<00:02:07.160> hundred<00:02:07.190> which<00:02:08.060> is

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
five hundred or two hundred which is

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.639 
five hundred or two hundred which is
surprising<00:02:08.750> because<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:09.020> one<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.350> more<00:02:09.530> than

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
surprising because this one is more than

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.650 
surprising because this one is more than
supposed<00:02:09.860> actually<00:02:10.160> 249<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:10.940> one<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.209> 199

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
supposed actually 249 that one is 199

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.900 
supposed actually 249 that one is 199
that<00:02:12.470> goes<00:02:12.650> up<00:02:12.800> more<00:02:12.920> storage<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.490> really<00:02:13.760> try

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
that goes up more storage so really try

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.000 
that goes up more storage so really try
to<00:02:14.030> see<00:02:14.330> what<00:02:15.050> makes<00:02:15.200> us<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.470> more<00:02:15.770> expensive

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
to see what makes us the more expensive

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.440 
to see what makes us the more expensive
it<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.459> this<00:02:16.730> one<00:02:16.880> more<00:02:17.030> than<00:02:17.180> or<00:02:17.270> as<00:02:17.360> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
it is this one more than or as the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.640 
it is this one more than or as the
barrier<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.720> get<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.930> one<00:02:18.050> with<00:02:18.080> more<00:02:18.320> storage

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
barrier to get the one with more storage

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.630 
barrier to get the one with more storage
just<00:02:19.430> want<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.670> show<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:20.060> have<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.360> pin<00:02:20.840> here

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
just want to show you a have a pin here

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.840 
just want to show you a have a pin here
kind<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.730> get<00:02:22.880> an<00:02:22.970> idea<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.480> how<00:02:24.110> thin<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.590> is

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
kind of get an idea of how thin it is

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.290 
kind of get an idea of how thin it is
okay<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:27.230> it's<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.250> little<00:02:28.580> bit<00:02:28.760> thicker<00:02:29.120> than

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
okay so it's a little bit thicker than

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.340 
okay so it's a little bit thicker than
my<00:02:29.480> pin<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:30.080> thing<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:31.370> nice<00:02:31.959> let's<00:02:32.959> go<00:02:33.140> over

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:32.819 

let's<00:03:25.120> open<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.540> up<00:03:28.140> okay<00:03:30.420> nice<00:03:31.799> chiclet<00:03:32.799> style

let's open it up okay nice chiclet style
keyboard<00:03:33.430> this<00:03:33.879> is<00:03:34.030> very<00:03:34.329> similar<00:03:34.659> to<00:03:34.870> what

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
keyboard this is very similar to what

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.530 
keyboard this is very similar to what
you'll<00:03:35.290> see<00:03:35.439> on<00:03:35.469> a<00:03:35.680> Mac<00:03:35.920> which<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:36.969> love<00:03:37.329> because

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
you'll see on a Mac which I love because

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.959 
you'll see on a Mac which I love because
that<00:03:37.840> means<00:03:38.019> that<00:03:38.200> for<00:03:38.590> typing<00:03:39.099> this<00:03:39.640> is<00:03:39.790> going

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:39.969 
that means that for typing this is going

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.059 
that means that for typing this is going
to<00:03:40.030> be<00:03:40.180> great<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.750> can<00:03:41.290> already<00:03:41.469> see<00:03:41.829> why<00:03:42.010> off

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
to be great I can already see why off

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.879 
to be great I can already see why off
the<00:03:42.280> bat<00:03:42.430> without<00:03:42.579> even<00:03:42.939> using<00:03:42.969> it<00:03:43.739> let's<00:03:44.739> go

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
the bat without even using it let's go

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.050 
the bat without even using it let's go
ahead<00:03:45.069> and<00:03:46.139> power<00:03:47.139> it<00:03:47.500> on<00:03:47.680> here<00:03:48.250> usually<00:03:48.909> they

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
ahead and power it on here usually they

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.179 
ahead and power it on here usually they
come<00:03:49.090> with<00:03:49.389> a<00:03:49.480> little<00:03:49.659> bit<00:03:49.780> of<00:03:49.840> power<00:03:50.189> so

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:51.189 
come with a little bit of power so

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:58.860 
come with a little bit of power so
hopefully<00:03:54.569> get<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:55.780> whole<00:03:55.989> dim<00:03:57.419> or<00:03:58.419> maybe<00:03:58.689> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
hopefully get the whole dim or maybe the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.069 
hopefully get the whole dim or maybe the
battery<00:03:59.319> is<00:03:59.379> dead<00:04:00.419> virtually<00:04:01.419> all<00:04:01.510> computers

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
battery is dead virtually all computers

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.670 
battery is dead virtually all computers
don't<00:04:02.200> come<00:04:02.500> power<00:04:02.889> out<00:04:03.129> of<00:04:03.159> the<00:04:03.280> box<00:04:03.540> so<00:04:04.680> will

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
don't come power out of the box so will

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.539 
don't come power out of the box so will
actually<00:04:05.980> leave<00:04:06.159> it<00:04:06.310> right<00:04:06.459> there<00:04:07.889> but<00:04:08.889> you

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
actually leave it right there but you

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.729 
actually leave it right there but you
see<00:04:09.969> a<00:04:10.000> lot<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.269> videos<00:04:10.659> on<00:04:10.810> this<00:04:11.019> on<00:04:11.379> this<00:04:11.439> guy
