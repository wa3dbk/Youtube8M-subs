here<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.190> shouldn't<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.340> doing<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.850> that's

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
here I shouldn't be doing that that's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.300 
here I shouldn't be doing that that's
why<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.660> measure<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.470> should<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:47.100> like

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
why you measure it up it should be like

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.090 
why you measure it up it should be like
this<00:00:47.579> around<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.690> edges<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.380> back<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
this around the edges and back up and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.150 
this around the edges and back up and
around<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:51.170> my<00:00:52.170> mom<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.739> drawing<00:00:53.010> a
