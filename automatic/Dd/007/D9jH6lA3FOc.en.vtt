Sylvania<00:00:34.379> which<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.739> every<00:00:35.190> best<00:00:35.460> Panasonic

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
Sylvania which is every best Panasonic

Sylvania which is every best Panasonic
this<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.769> the<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.780> three<00:00:40.170> head

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.560 

however<00:00:44.180> that<00:00:45.180> said<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.720> kind<00:00:46.019> of<00:00:46.080> lost<00:00:47.570> about

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
however that said I'm kind of lost about

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.060 
however that said I'm kind of lost about
the<00:00:48.720> three<00:00:48.989> head<00:00:49.199> part<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.949> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the three head part this is the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.229 
the three head part this is the
internals<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:53.010> I've<00:00:53.309> been<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> flight<00:00:53.700> near<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
internals so I've been a flight near a

said<00:00:54.540> nope<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:56.070> Ray<00:00:56.219> said<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.790> stationary

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
said nope you Ray said is stationary

said nope you Ray said is stationary
there's<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.760> drum<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> moment<00:01:04.500> I'm

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
there's the drum so at the moment I'm

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.029 
there's the drum so at the moment I'm
not<00:01:04.800> sure<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.759> three<00:01:06.030> head<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:07.039> it's

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
not sure what the three head is for it's

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:09.710 
not sure what the three head is for it's
either<00:01:08.220> I've<00:01:08.580> seen<00:01:08.910> you<00:01:09.119> know<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.420> makes<00:01:09.600> sense

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
either I've seen you know it makes sense

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.020 
either I've seen you know it makes sense
either<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.350> them<00:01:10.500> three<00:01:11.280> head<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.759> a<00:01:11.789> race

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
either have them three head for a race

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.749 
either have them three head for a race
in<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> five<00:01:12.750> head<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:15.350> it<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.649> a<00:01:17.220> four

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
in a five head for it would be a four

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
two high five money race which doesn't

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.779 
two high five money race which doesn't
make<00:01:26.310> sense

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
make sense

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.059 
make sense
but<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.140> tell<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> same

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
but as you can tell this is the same

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.490 
but as you can tell this is the same
mechanism<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.880> an<00:01:30.420> early<00:01:30.720> eighties<00:01:31.110> pan<00:01:31.349> of

mechanism as an early eighties pan of
sorry

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
sorry

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.100 
sorry
you<00:01:32.190> know<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:32.910> reliable<00:01:33.569> mechanism

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
you know the very reliable mechanism

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.499 
you know the very reliable mechanism
they<00:01:34.200> always<00:01:34.530> had<00:01:34.849> except<00:01:35.849> it<00:01:36.119> goes<00:01:36.300> a<00:01:36.420> step

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
they always had except it goes a step

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.080 
they always had except it goes a step
further<00:01:36.950> right<00:01:37.950> hard<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:38.190> see<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:38.940> is<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
further right hard to see but there is a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.589 
further right hard to see but there is a
geared<00:01:39.569> idler<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:43.970> it's<00:01:44.970> still<00:01:45.209> completely

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:45.599 
geared idler and it's still completely

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:50.229 
geared idler and it's still completely
unwind<00:01:46.319> as<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.679> tape<00:01:46.860> from<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.160> heads<00:01:48.890> okay

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:50.239 
unwind as a tape from the heads okay

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:52.339 
unwind as a tape from the heads okay
however<00:01:51.239> this<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.959> started<00:01:52.229> when

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
however this is one that started when

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.469 
however this is one that started when
they<00:01:52.410> started<00:01:52.800> on<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> compact<00:01:53.429> chassis

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.210 

however<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.660> pieces<00:01:58.020> are<00:01:58.140> needs<00:01:58.410> repaired<00:01:58.920> I

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
however this pieces are needs repaired I

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.010 
however this pieces are needs repaired I
don't<00:01:59.610> know<00:01:59.700> what<00:01:59.849> the<00:01:59.970> issue<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:00.720> but

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
don't know what the issue is now but

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
don't know what the issue is now but
you'll<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.410> what<00:02:01.560> happens<00:02:01.950> when<00:02:02.069> I<00:02:02.099> go<00:02:02.310> play

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
you'll see what happens when I go play

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.660 
you'll see what happens when I go play
oh<00:02:03.200> yeah<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.560> did<00:02:04.770> make<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.979> mistake<00:02:05.190> about

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
oh yeah and I did make a mistake about

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.589 
oh yeah and I did make a mistake about
my<00:02:06.170> Sears<00:02:07.170> gold<00:02:07.590> star<00:02:08.149> about<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.330> loading

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
my Sears gold star about the loading

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.710 
my Sears gold star about the loading
mechanism<00:02:11.030> Panasonic's<00:02:12.030> also<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.690> a

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
mechanism Panasonic's also have a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.070 
mechanism Panasonic's also have a
separate<00:02:13.260> loading<00:02:13.470> motor<00:02:14.420> like<00:02:15.420> right<00:02:15.660> here

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
separate loading motor like right here

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.900 
separate loading motor like right here
it's<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.920> there's<00:02:17.129> it's<00:02:17.310> more<00:02:17.489> concealed

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
it's just there's it's more concealed

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.699 
it's just there's it's more concealed
for<00:02:18.120> some<00:02:18.330> stupid<00:02:18.629> reason<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.319> forgot<00:02:19.680> all

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
for some stupid reason I just forgot all

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.449 
for some stupid reason I just forgot all
about<00:02:19.890> it

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
about it

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.520 
about it
and<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.450> makes<00:02:21.690> sense<00:02:21.930> because<00:02:22.050> this

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
and that makes sense because this

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.869 
and that makes sense because this
mechanism<00:02:23.280> was<00:02:23.400> originally<00:02:23.879> designed<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:25.879> have

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
mechanism was originally designed I have

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.960 
mechanism was originally designed I have
a<00:02:26.910> 1984<00:02:27.810> Sylvania<00:02:28.500> top<00:02:28.800> loader<00:02:29.070> by<00:02:29.310> Panasonic

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
a 1984 Sylvania top loader by Panasonic

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.260 
a 1984 Sylvania top loader by Panasonic
a<00:02:31.000> familiar<00:02:31.300> display<00:02:32.490> now<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.670> doesn't<00:02:34.150> have

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
a familiar display now that doesn't have

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.910 
a familiar display now that doesn't have
a<00:02:34.300> loading<00:02:34.720> mode<00:02:34.900> there<00:02:35.140> but<00:02:35.350> everything<00:02:35.620> else

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
a loading mode there but everything else

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.410 
a loading mode there but everything else
is<00:02:36.130> identical<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:39.010> yeah<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.370> mrs.<00:02:39.760> thesis<00:02:40.240> is

swamp them down on a second but see and
let<00:03:15.760> me<00:03:15.880> see<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.120> having<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.570> try<00:03:16.840> some<00:03:17.080> of<00:03:17.140> these

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
let me see I having to try some of these

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.780 
let me see I having to try some of these
functions<00:03:17.530> okay<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.160> don't<00:03:18.400> have<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.640> remote

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
functions okay I don't have the remote

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.850 
functions okay I don't have the remote
so<00:03:19.270> I<00:03:19.660> can't<00:03:19.900> really<00:03:20.050> do<00:03:20.170> too<00:03:20.380> many<00:03:20.530> special

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
so I can't really do too many special

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.220 
so I can't really do too many special
effects<00:03:21.490> maybe<00:03:22.450> how<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:22.930> what's<00:03:23.080> wrong

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
effects maybe how this is what's wrong

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.500 
effects maybe how this is what's wrong
with<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.440> picture<00:03:23.760> it's<00:03:24.760> black<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.270> white

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
and picked it's all wavy however the

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.840 
and picked it's all wavy however the
heads<00:03:32.440> are<00:03:32.650> clean<00:03:33.010> because<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.400> cleaned<00:03:33.700> them

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
heads are clean because I cleaned them

00:03:33.850 --> 00:04:17.289 
heads are clean because I cleaned them
when<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.570> first<00:03:34.840> got<00:03:35.019> this<00:03:35.260> three<00:03:35.590> years<00:03:35.830> ago

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.000 

see<00:04:18.299> how<00:04:18.359> this<00:04:18.450> VCRs<00:04:18.930> one<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.290> many<00:04:19.440> projects

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
see how this VCRs one of many projects

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.860 
see how this VCRs one of many projects
happening<00:04:20.579> eventually<00:04:21.480> it<00:04:21.570> will<00:04:21.690> get

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
happening eventually it will get

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.409 
happening eventually it will get
repaired<00:04:22.520> but<00:04:23.520> I<00:04:23.550> mean<00:04:23.730> everything<00:04:24.060> else<00:04:24.180> is

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
repaired but I mean everything else is

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:32.960 
repaired but I mean everything else is
fine<00:04:24.720> but<00:04:25.200> anyhow<00:04:25.590> quick<00:04:26.550> demo

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.880 

so<00:04:33.510> now<00:04:33.630> I<00:04:33.660> question<00:04:34.320> that<00:04:34.350> that's<00:04:34.650> not<00:04:34.830> that

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
so now I question that that's not that

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
so now I question that that's not that
bad<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.670> fast-forward

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.110 

see<00:04:41.540> I<00:04:41.570> just<00:04:41.690> want<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.080> know

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.620 

yeah

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
yeah

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.980 
yeah

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
play okay just like that there's the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:05:12.340 
play okay just like that there's the
place<00:04:52.350> Cymbeline

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.150 

that's<00:05:13.350> one<00:05:13.500> of<00:05:13.590> my<00:05:13.680> test<00:05:13.950> tapes<00:05:15.530> but<00:05:16.530> I<00:05:16.800> have

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
that's one of my test tapes but I have

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.970 
that's one of my test tapes but I have
said<00:05:17.490> press<00:05:17.850> stop<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:24.080> then<00:05:25.080> that's<00:05:25.470> it<00:05:25.860> we'll

said press stop and then that's it we'll
just<00:05:26.010> fast<00:05:26.430> forward<00:05:31.010> sounds<00:05:32.010> just<00:05:32.160> like<00:05:32.370> an

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
just fast forward sounds just like an

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.190 
just fast forward sounds just like an
early<00:05:32.850> eighties<00:05:33.150> Panasonic<00:05:33.780> but<00:05:33.960> a<00:05:33.990> little

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
early eighties Panasonic but a little

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.629 
early eighties Panasonic but a little
bit<00:05:34.350> noisier<00:05:34.980> is<00:05:35.280> that

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
bit noisier is that

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.119 
bit noisier is that
looking<00:05:36.969> here<00:05:37.210> versus<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.650> early<00:05:38.919> ones

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:39.129 
looking here versus the early ones
