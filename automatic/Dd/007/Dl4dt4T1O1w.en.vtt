00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.230
 It was reflected, but have fullness 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.889
 It is ik which the country specified 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.000
 Yue company 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.849
 I want to check 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.630
 9 people 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.160
 Once used for the engine nas festival, it is equipped with 1.5 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.829
 The economy is also modest 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.189
 It is quite popular performance that I run a liter 23km 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.319
 It is a high model 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.319
 Well then 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.370
 27 minutes temporarily when Mr. Omo is strong when stepping on the accelerator 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.530
 There is also a thing that will be managed by 23 bogey 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.580
 The same 37,771,000 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.850
 If Mook was sitting in the driver's seat this year was spacious 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.410
 The living space and the former have strength in 2007. 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.560
 A well-known driver gains comfort because it is not protected 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.000
 It feels very good, too 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.270
 The minimum turning radius is actually 3.9 meters in the third place decision match 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.060
 In that 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.939
 It is a light car that will be a bit political, but for this time 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.550
 Because the meter has not been able to marry 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.890
 I would like to try the ability of the car of summer man from now on 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.310
 Let's head to a slightly narrower place 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.980
 surely 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.660
 Handle is 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.540
 There is an image that cuts well, so I arranged Fukuoka 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.280
 sometimes 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.090
 I still have 8 days with Matsu Takako 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.270
 It is an impression that the direction changes greatly while being included 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.190
 I just used to look at it from a female perspective but I haven't 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.040
 In that 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.000
 I can not make a single stand 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.900
 A bit high for this 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.730
 I hoped to follow you, but yes 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.160
 Then there is also this car I wonder if it is an open game 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.950
 I think 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.139
 I would like to go a little faster at home 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.370
 Twenty-two compact cars have been rebuilt both prices coaches 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.370
 Quiet 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.109
 I would like to see you and your wife 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.790
 Handling condition is more than I thought and business condition 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.439
 There is 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.579
 Matsuya Fukuoka is not to be regarded as Daisuke. 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.139
 It is a part that makes me feel the quality after the observation deck league separation 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.659
 maybe 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:52.400
 The car that this background is indeed strikeout is various ideas 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.579
 As a compact car that is studded with 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.419
 I'm putting a bit of fine equipment but 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.429
 Medical loss so as not to do this a little more 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:04.929
 Still 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.589
 Try to use more pop colors and such users 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:10.589
 I think whether it is OK if there is an examination 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.809
 later 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:18.109
 Well, a mistress comes to mind as a rival to this car 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.209
 It is a joining compact, for example Fiat 500 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.189
 And other unique characters are also strong 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.049
 I think it will be a rival 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.879
 Well in that sense 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.849
 Well in the sense of the world thought wheel base car 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.719
 Oh, there is also a ride that I did a little as much as possible 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:40.159
 There are still many things that I care about 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.219
 If you look at that point now, the indoor decision behavior ride is also stable 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.629
 Premium that is quite comfortable 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.889
 I had a compact car 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:50.329
 it's here
