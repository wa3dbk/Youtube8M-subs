00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:05.850
 hey people of course allows us too 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.650
 the galaxy note because of the possibility 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.019
 to create screenshots directly 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.880
 in three different ways and also here 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.860
 Of course, the factory setting 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.420
 establishes first show you the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.949
 screenshots then the next setting 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.800
 and then the news about one 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.869
 art reboot apps left means which 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.400
 device hangs on, for example, creates 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.560
 now with just a touch of the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.480
 get up to boot 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.009
 scenes, so to speak, we start with that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.019
 screenshot for one, there are the 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.430
 typical possibility we press the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.469
 power button and the home button 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.129
 simultaneously hold it for one and a half 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.590
 seconds 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.000
 the screenshot will be saved 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.129
 you can get him here right in one 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.289
 view preview edit or 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.019
 Send or when you clicks on the 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:50.149
 still favor full in full format 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.440
 continue to turn or delete again 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.510
 a second option is the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.890
 possibility with the straight hand edge 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.890
 to paint over the display 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.409
 the whole with nachgefahren 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.500
 the screenshot will be here too 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.480
 saved and then who next 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.630
 to be sent as it was just seen 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.770
 have another option offers 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.990
 push yourself out through the fcb 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.220
 Now she sees the key and press 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.200
 somewhere in the display 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.820
 important is that if you the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.340
 display comes close and the turned on 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.890
 that one sees the point the switzerland 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.780
 not with this on the screenshot 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.600
 So if you have activated it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.190
 is best somewhere in the corner old 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.840
 the real one with pressed key on 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.440
 display of second and the screenshot 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.060
 is created 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.970
 here you still have the possibility that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.640
 to paint to small 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.620
 but it could cut or something 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.780
 of course also cancel and discard 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.460
 or just save 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.590
 I have three different options 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.850
 to create a screenshot that should 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.570
 actually not enough 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.100
 Of course, that too can 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.020
 device back last sentence you have to me 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.300
 the attitude to either you have 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.650
 on the homescreen otherwise 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.810
 goes over the menu settings 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.920
 or via the status bar here too 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.860
 have the same access to the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:14.350
 attitudes and at the top right 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.800
 in the corner actually collin 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.960
 go down to personal and have the 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.290
 we will be the point of you and reset 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.610
 really sure you can on here 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.590
 factory settings we reset 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.900
 are still in demand or on it 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.000
 pointed out that really the music 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.220
 data setting and all complete 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.110
 We need to be cleared once 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.890
 confirm and a second time 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.940
 the downloaded apps will be 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.380
 completely deleted and could not 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.110
 be restored we click 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.030
 delete everything here too 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.610
 that goes down so I like to take it 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.850
 times back for you can still see the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.670
 Nice big notification LED that 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.530
 device will now be a little yes it will 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.850
 Everything bad what we are looking for 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.980
 wait that people may know you 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.890
 an update to long look sometimes 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.320
 the sides of the device but that 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.810
 she works around the beautiful back 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.760
 the bottom is the left side 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.980
 it should already be ready 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.959
 we have it completely new 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.130
 Do it for us the way it is when it's up 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.989
 remove the packaging 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.250
 you can set it up completely 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.860
 right now on this 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.709
 Traces in these facilities again 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:32.590
 So enter data such as 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:35.310
 the wlan network and so on that is 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.310
 the touchscreen 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.550
 So we have a completely new one now 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.200
 if I do it for example 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.950
 was allowed to be headed is now again 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.280
 to be normal 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.450
 if it's because I'm not if you 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.580
 just wanted to delete everything for 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.190
 resell or still 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.540
 now i have this complete people 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.220
 go now briefly the establishment steps 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.500
 with you through so you know what's up 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.299
 Me when I buy the device 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.549
 and then maps wmi after the reboot 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.549
 now it works so now we come to 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:11.829
 setup mode as always jump 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:13.390
 but sometimes the wlan for example this 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:18.220
 service 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:23.330
 the time input of the samsung account 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:30.140
 google account google use location 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:33.530
 use because of salary is because that 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:36.080
 let's jump and dropbox skip 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.370
 we now the device is set up and 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.740
 ready and we can go back 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.990
 so it looks like if that 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.210
 completely new again before us and 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.370
 now it was already 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.300
 Let us now look very briefly what 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.390
 We will do the device 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.740
 for example, got stuck and 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.620
 maybe a replacement of the battery 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.980
 enough to turn off the device 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:09.160
 we have the power button we have for 1 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:11.750
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 seconds 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.010
 you see the device goes off and it will 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.290
 rebooted 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.090
 that in case it just is not 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.750
 more want that was already of 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.370
 you know the important things 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.010
 create screenshot factory settings 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.130
 restore and hard-hearted thanks to his 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.130
 Time
