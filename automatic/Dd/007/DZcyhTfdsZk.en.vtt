 put the registration of this same 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.100
 painting voucher is worth the classic and the 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.770
 I want to put purple purple I do not have 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.630
 no purple car and I've seen enough 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.460
 cars like this purple style is not 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.670
 I know why 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.600
 purple vale where is the purple uncle 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.590
 why 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.180
 purple 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.370
 this mural is purple is very ugly 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.110
 I'm not I thought something brighter 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.410
 or something like that 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.150
 let's put it like that 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.069
 it has set me 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.540
 to have to put metallic 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.500
 let's put it metallic to see if it's 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.500
 the purple metallic 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.400
 to see if nap 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:48.490
 blue not so much did not take off the blues 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.180
 I've fallen in love, it's so cool, so much more 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:57.090
 so metallic is now pearly and 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.090
 let's put it to the best yellow 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.500
 a blue 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.909
 ultra blue so I think it gives me a lot 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.560
 it's better because it's not so purple anymore but 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.209
 good that cool a lot more 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.250
 worth painting you can only put one 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.080
 color ceiling without ceiling or say disc 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.560
 potable 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.470
 said personalized but this the roof 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.280
 Personalized then this may make it 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.280
 you can save 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.060
 I think it is not 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.519
 well let's put it on and if not what to 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.860
 remove the roof because because but to 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.380
 I like more convertibles 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.930
 to see luxury let's see luxury salt 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.670
 series and ones that remain towards game 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.670
 I love these these 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.340
 the color of water rims without 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.850
 moraditos of that style to see where is 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.810
 low low discomfort last addition purple 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.620
 dark this is safe 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.069
 accessories but they are bulletproof and 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.359
 same blue we are going to put 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.829
 pure black windows add well I 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.239
 it looks pretty good to see if I can 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.989
 keep in the hood and if I'm not going to 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.470
 put convertible 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.270
 very much 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.690
 the price seems like shit but now 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.690
 I'm cool 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.830
 no you can not already I knew it I say good 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.330
 for trying, my name is nothing much more 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.330
 more the serial than this that gives money 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.449
 let's take it off for a little while 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.189
 I love at first I say this is going to 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:48.370
 be the typical car that nobody uses 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:51.560
 I like to look was in the ceiling and without a roof 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.720
 convertible cool a lot more 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.720
 to see to see I want to see what runs 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.850
 or lolo the stabilizer and that's for 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.850
 that we google what 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.119
 go dead 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.480
 if you run and run once it costs a 

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:14.310
 little bit 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.950
 in acceleration but then if it runs 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.530
 I hope you liked the tuned if 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.640

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.510

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.720
