00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
because Bram keeps coming back so I kind

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.219 
because Bram keeps coming back so I kind
of<00:05:30.120> have<00:05:30.240> something<00:05:30.419> floating<00:05:30.780> that<00:05:30.990> I<00:05:31.080> can

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
of have something floating that I can

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.080 
of have something floating that I can
use<00:05:31.320> this<00:05:31.440> with<00:05:31.620> and<00:05:31.889> this<00:05:32.160> also<00:05:32.400> turns<00:05:32.820> off

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
use this with and this also turns off

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.879 
use this with and this also turns off
grim<00:05:33.389> so<00:05:33.750> I<00:05:33.780> can<00:05:34.020> use<00:05:34.110> a<00:05:34.139> dare<00:05:34.349> creator<00:05:34.650> because

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
grim so I can use a dare creator because

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.490 
grim so I can use a dare creator because
I<00:05:35.009> have<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.220> have<00:05:35.250> no<00:05:35.490> monsters<00:05:35.699> to<00:05:36.259> impale<00:05:37.259> arm

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
I have to have no monsters to impale arm

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.439

wall because it hurts sniffing ruler and

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.260 
wall because it hurts sniffing ruler and
this<00:05:39.979> in<00:05:40.979> my<00:05:41.159> opinion<00:05:41.430> hurts

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
this in my opinion hurts

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.300 
this in my opinion hurts
Eugen<00:05:42.630> a<00:05:42.840> lot<00:05:42.990> more<00:05:43.169> now<00:05:43.320> because<00:05:43.830> it<00:05:44.099> shuts

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
Eugen a lot more now because it shuts

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.029 
Eugen a lot more now because it shuts
down<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.520> hair<00:05:45.110> do<00:05:46.110> you<00:05:46.169> mind<00:05:46.560> playing<00:05:46.860> this

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
down the hair do you mind playing this

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.600

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
sometime stops their creator place no

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.580 
sometime stops their creator place no
because<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:50.970> side<00:05:51.539> the<00:05:51.659> sin<00:05:51.840> against<00:05:52.050> region

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
because I side the sin against region

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.550

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
me so it makes a lot of their stuff dead

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.129 
me so it makes a lot of their stuff dead
and<00:05:59.039> my<00:05:59.520> guys<00:05:59.760> just<00:05:59.789> become<00:06:00.419> big<00:06:00.599> beaters<00:06:00.930> and

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
and my guys just become big beaters and

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.240 
and my guys just become big beaters and
I<00:06:02.130> can<00:06:02.430> also<00:06:02.580> turn<00:06:02.789> this<00:06:02.940> off<00:06:03.120> with<00:06:03.300> trap<00:06:03.479> stone

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
I can also turn this off with trap stone
