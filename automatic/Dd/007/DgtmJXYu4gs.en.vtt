 I make you quickly the calculation no 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.630

 of a key will you bring back how much xp 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.240
 I would say it explains I know more I 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.799
 would not want to go ahead but basically 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.360
 allow you to xp very very 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.369
 quickly shoemaker you know 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.869
 only with kraft four boxes or xp 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.579
 up to the level the sense besides these 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.810
 do- it- yourselfers not coordinated but brief 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.979
 you understood me so you can 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.930
 to make carafa crises up to the level 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.360
 100 you just have to ask all 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.909
 days and you go very quickly in 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.130
 a week it goes easily when 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.229
 you will store the keys 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.270
 in your bank it is enough to 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.799
 sell it looks like it does not but it goes 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.319
 very very much those little things 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.170
 people who want the farm for 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.090
 for example, to put together what we call that 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.140
 lescar to neutral dorine must know that 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.099
 to ride this quarter to drink a water 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.380
 very well we have to do some danjons 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.090
 scara leaves for for fighting 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.890
 black pumps that are present 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.380
 only in emergency because with leaves 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.280
 there are also babies l1 who who do this 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.769
 dungeon he renders a judgment quite 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.060
 profitable at kid rock level also from 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.010
 the xp is not a dungeon 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.269
 disgusting one also the people who are going 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.160
 to do it eventually for disappointed it's 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.440
 what end in any case the keys parts 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.799
 relatively well you sell them at 9000 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.830
 units 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.030
 good there the average price is totally wrong 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.799
 I went I went to see 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.620
 thaler in hd i can show you they 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.510
 are there they are at 9000 is still there 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.170
 they dropped a little bit before 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.880
 it was more expensive 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.459
 I will show you anyway because 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.610
 that it would be that the average price was 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.769
 tepa very revealing then handyman 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.920
 not a jeweler, by the way 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.920
 restart 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.640
 so so i said if hdv price color 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.640
 here we go 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.600
 and so we want to get them back 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.310
 classes because to a little wasp that 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.010
 wander on the floor of my room 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.260
 it is not so short lescar leaf 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.420
 here we tell and see his anatomy 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.830
 virtually 10 billion on Thursday the 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.630
 crates caja fayat but you can very 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.860
 do it well with something other than 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.350
 classes because in Feuilla is getting closer 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.420
 dangerously two months of the blow I'm going 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.850
 to go away because I'm very scared 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.200
 so lets clear that burst clicks 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.120
 and damn I can not talk anymore 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.470
 and what has failed too but he 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.600
 there are also other things like 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.850
 the royal keys look that works very well 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.960
 that they are selling quite expensive keys 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.910
 also blocks at the time it was expensive 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.590
 so here it is always expensive than 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.120
 you can always put perco in 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.890
 other areas and kraft keys that's 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.780
 something that works very very well 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.730
 you can see the price of the keys 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.400
 dragons can for example drag oif 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.340
 of pig dragon who is going the very very 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.460
 dear look at his watch just ya 7000 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.450
 plus + 15 min I think it was 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.750
 the other end brief you understood the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.090
 thing 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.790
 so you sell the keys scaraffia 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:20.209
 so as I said 300 key crafter in 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:23.660
 5:03 a hundred times 9500 or a name is 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.240
 not that sometimes 9500 you do two 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.770
 million two million eight years five 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.450
 hours actually it'll take a 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.160
 some time to sell but that 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.750
 will leave everything in me I had 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.640
 a small stock of 300 kg and I have more 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.080
 37 a hat explain a little 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.280
 after you can very well like I 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.440
 says to vary the pleasures by doing 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.330
 other keys to try to get it 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.530
 sell more quickly and it's something 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.210
 something that works very very well here 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.980
 wedding was captain at magna lee 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.050

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.100
