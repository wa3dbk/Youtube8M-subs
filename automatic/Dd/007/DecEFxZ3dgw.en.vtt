00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.649
 part of a team of six 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.559
 Students at the academy kooning 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.120
 all from different cyprinus 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.920
 under our eyes we saw how much 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.660
 fruit works is thrown away 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.039
 here on the market and there we want 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.750
 today dc 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.750
 do something about it so go on the market now 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.370
 philo suggest 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.580
 cherry traffic the students of the 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.320
 Willem de Kooning Academy received the 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.790
 assignment from their studies come up with one 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.170
 solution for the giant 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.940
 food wastage 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.160
 every market day there is more than 3 and a half 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.840
 a thousand kilos of unsaleable vegetables 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.580
 and fruit market vendors must 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.590
 to dispose of the waste 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.420
 so the students thought we were processing 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.580
 it to fruit leather we want 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.260
 actually kind of seed plants and kind 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.820
 carry out a message and then 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.280
 we want it to be picked up by 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.960
 others so it said the companies serving us 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.119
 are going to help make it go mechanically 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.040
 make produce and meet the other 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.810
 we also want the designers 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.580
 inspire by getting started 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.530
 so we want to say the best 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.180
 make freelander rags and with that to 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.770
 the designers go out of their way 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.110
 want to participate and we want to 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.759
 generating suggestions for this it can 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.399
 done to interest people 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.930
 yes this is all possible with out 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.640
 freedom will soon be your shopping bag 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.680
 have mangos where your mango is again 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.240
 in she does heavy shopping bag with a 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.479
 message and that he is really super cool 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.479
 to be 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.189
 you do not necessarily see the processing process 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.899
 tasty but it is important 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.750
 the bacteria become and namely 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:47.229
 so cooked out by the process so 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.390
 can develop far the bacteria 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.750
 from and fruit 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.250
 Holes mold is also no problem with that 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.829
 and it is especially so once it is 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.530
 dried up then yes we have so far 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.780
 we have nothing of odor problems or 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.369
 mold problems and we have it now 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.539
 there are already folders that are 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.549
 for this already 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:12.519
 thick crema di more so indeed there 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.840
 we personally do not worry 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.700
 about 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.560
 in the lost and found pop-up store at the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.269
