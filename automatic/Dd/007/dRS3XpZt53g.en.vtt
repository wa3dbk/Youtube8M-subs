around but he has been a bit shaky these
past<00:00:27.210> couple<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.720> seasons<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.349> last<00:00:28.650> season

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
past couple of seasons and last season

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.800 
past couple of seasons and last season
he<00:00:29.070> made<00:00:29.609> quite<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> lot<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.119> mistakes<00:00:30.300> which

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
he made quite a lot of mistakes which

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.229 
he made quite a lot of mistakes which
arguably<00:00:31.619> cost<00:00:32.099> money<00:00:32.460> now<00:00:32.640> quite<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> lot<00:00:33.210> of

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
arguably cost money now quite a lot of

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.900 
arguably cost money now quite a lot of
results<00:00:33.710> he<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.829> going<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.219> quite<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> bit<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
results he is going on quite a bit and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.510 
results he is going on quite a bit and
as<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.329> result<00:00:36.870> he's<00:00:37.350> quite<00:00:37.710> injury<00:00:38.040> prone<00:00:38.340> and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
as a result he's quite injury prone and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.240 
as a result he's quite injury prone and
in<00:00:39.480> my<00:00:39.809> opinion<00:00:39.930> guys<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.440> think<00:00:40.649> his<00:00:40.800> rating

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
in my opinion guys I think his rating

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.049 
in my opinion guys I think his rating
should<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.610> lowered<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.120> around<00:00:42.329> 85<00:00:43.489> okay<00:00:44.489> so

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
should be lowered to around 85 okay so

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.400 
should be lowered to around 85 okay so
next<00:00:45.239> we're<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.660> talk<00:00:45.840> about<00:00:45.960> Patrice

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
next we're going to talk about Patrice

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.500 
next we're going to talk about Patrice
Evra<00:00:46.739> again<00:00:47.160> Patrice<00:00:47.520> Evra<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.000> getting<00:00:48.360> on

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
Evra again Patrice Evra is getting on

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.959 
Evra again Patrice Evra is getting on
quite<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> bit<00:00:49.079> he's<00:00:49.289> 31<00:00:50.129> years<00:00:50.160> old<00:00:50.460> he's

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
quite a bit he's 31 years old he's

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.819 
quite a bit he's 31 years old he's
similar<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.510> Ferdinand<00:00:51.960> because<00:00:52.289> he<00:00:52.620> made<00:00:52.800> a

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
similar to Ferdinand because he made a

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.770 
similar to Ferdinand because he made a
lot<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> mistakes<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> past<00:00:54.300> few<00:00:54.510> seasons

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
lot of mistakes for the past few seasons

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.979 
lot of mistakes for the past few seasons
and<00:00:55.520> because<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.820> Alex<00:00:57.239> Ferguson<00:00:57.780> has

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
and because of this Alex Ferguson has

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.849 
and because of this Alex Ferguson has
bought<00:00:58.289> Alexander<00:00:58.949> Buttner<00:00:59.359> for<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> long-term

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
bought Alexander Buttner for a long-term

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.759 
bought Alexander Buttner for a long-term
prospect<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.100> Patrice<00:01:02.879> Evra<00:01:03.409> he<00:01:04.409> will

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
prospect and Patrice Evra he will

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.800 
prospect and Patrice Evra he will
probably<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.519> moving<00:01:05.909> away<00:01:06.000> from<00:01:06.180> Manchester

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
probably be moving away from Manchester

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.880 
probably be moving away from Manchester
United<00:01:07.080> soon<00:01:07.320> I'm<00:01:07.650> guessing<00:01:09.799> depending<00:01:10.799> on

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
United soon I'm guessing depending on

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.250 
United soon I'm guessing depending on
how<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.189> season<00:01:11.580> goes<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:11.970> him<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.570> think

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
how this season goes for him but I think

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.310 
how this season goes for him but I think
his<00:01:13.380> rating<00:01:13.740> should<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.189> 82<00:01:14.990> okay<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.049> next

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
his rating should be 82 okay so next

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320 
his rating should be 82 okay so next
we're<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.799> talk<00:01:16.979> about<00:01:17.130> Wayne<00:01:17.850> Rooney

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
we're going to talk about Wayne Rooney

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.289 
we're going to talk about Wayne Rooney
Wayne<00:01:19.110> Rooney<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> great<00:01:20.280> player<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.970> my

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
Wayne Rooney is a great player but in my

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.350 
Wayne Rooney is a great player but in my
opinion<00:01:21.450> he<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.080> vastly<00:01:22.890> overrated<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:24.240> I

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
opinion he is vastly overrated and I

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.899 
opinion he is vastly overrated and I
think<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:24.780> because<00:01:24.900> he<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.920> English<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.700> he

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
think that's because he is English if he

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.100 
think that's because he is English if he
wasn't<00:01:27.210> English<00:01:27.479> she<00:01:27.689> wouldn't<00:01:27.990> be<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:30.110> you

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
wasn't English she wouldn't be as you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.660 
wasn't English she wouldn't be as you
know<00:01:31.259> rated<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.710> highly<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.100> he<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.430> now<00:01:32.640> but

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
know rated as highly as he is now but

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.940 
know rated as highly as he is now but
not<00:01:33.420> taking<00:01:33.840> anything<00:01:34.140> away<00:01:34.320> from<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.799> guy

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
not taking anything away from the guy

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.580 
not taking anything away from the guy
you<00:01:35.009> know<00:01:35.280> he<00:01:35.460> has<00:01:36.420> scored<00:01:36.750> some<00:01:36.960> amazing

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
you know he has scored some amazing

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.950 
you know he has scored some amazing
goals<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.850> those<00:01:38.970> amazing<00:01:39.150> goals<00:01:39.689> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
goals and one of those amazing goals is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.499 
goals and one of those amazing goals is
against<00:01:40.710> Man<00:01:40.890> City<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.400> think<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.210> was<00:01:42.240> last

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
against Man City I think it was last

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.749 
against Man City I think it was last
season<00:01:42.780> not<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.649> year<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.070> mean<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> season

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
season not the year I mean the season

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.460 
season not the year I mean the season
before<00:01:44.880> last<00:01:45.030> season<00:01:45.270> guys<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:47.070> bicycle<00:01:47.520> kick

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
before last season guys the bicycle kick

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.910 
before last season guys the bicycle kick
absolutely<00:01:49.470> fantastic<00:01:50.189> go<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:52.710> he<00:01:52.799> had<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
absolutely fantastic go but he had a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.800

Fulham and hope he has a speedy recovery
but<00:01:57.540> Tony's<00:01:58.320> guys<00:01:58.500> seeing<00:01:58.890> herself<00:01:58.979> Sergio

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
but Tony's guys seeing herself Sergio

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.639 
but Tony's guys seeing herself Sergio
Aguero<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.030> right<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:00.390> 88<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.380> my<00:02:01.560> opinion

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
Aguero is right at 88 and in my opinion

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.800 
Aguero is right at 88 and in my opinion
Sergio<00:02:02.250> Aguero<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> lot<00:02:03.270> better<00:02:03.479> than<00:02:03.659> Wayne

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
Sergio Aguero is a lot better than Wayne

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.920 
Sergio Aguero is a lot better than Wayne
Rooney<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.280> think<00:02:05.579> Wayne<00:02:06.240> Rooney<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.659> fifa

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
Rooney and I think Wayne Rooney in fifa

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.249 
Rooney and I think Wayne Rooney in fifa
