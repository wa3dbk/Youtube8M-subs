00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.200
 just like today we dropped our left hand and we saw that the thumb 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.520
 naturally faced the first and second 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.419
 let's try to do it with the right hand 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.669
 logically it helps the same 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.519
 when we make any movement without thinking it nature are aware 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.960
 that it was Ottoman, it is just the easiest way 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.819
 and demanded to follow for example when we stretch our arm to point something out 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.539
 they share a bell 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.989
 the insects if in height in mind the line of the forearm 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.700
 being in a straight line 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.710
 have seen someone who points out otherwise than this because 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.489
 touch the buzzer of a gauge with the co na is more logical so 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.710
 i this is easy i if we can do something similar 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.559
 use something easy when doing the ipc 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.559
 also the dt like this will be easier 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.040
 for this we take the bow only at the tip and only against 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.690
 the thumb the first and the second day 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.050
 blige more than the third and fourth siancas a path and if it has to come and 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.820
 that remains in the air 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.160
 we are simply going to practice the one of almost on ropes to the air 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.120
 but for now without doing any pressure although the sound is a bit 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.120
 blower 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.130
 we let the weight of the bow itself be enough to get the sound 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.330
 and we want that over time little by little 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.190
 the sound is growing 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.640
 later we will return to the normal position supporting all the fingers 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 but already at hand you will be accustomed to this natural position 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.200
 for now we will do it then and with total freedom leaning on which 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.100
 on the vaquita only the first the second finger in this way
