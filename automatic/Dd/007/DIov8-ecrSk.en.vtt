00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 we are in pasadena california we are at 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.029
 pub si the advanced design of the group 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.040
 piaggio 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.580
 we are here with miguel galluzzi and us 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.679
 explains why the advanced design is 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.619
 established here in this small town but 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.320
 this place in pasadena los angeles 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.199
 in all they are together there are almost 150 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.890
 different ethnic groups living together 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.930
 daily allowance and at the end of the day 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.070
 they create these trends that we sometimes do 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.000
 for many many decades 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.829
 we took it as a novelty and it happens 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.230
 even today more than ever in this 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.040
 moment where we have to reinvent the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.430
 our mobility in the cities what 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.680
 what is the stimulus you see the stimulus here 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.570
 be it in everyday things or even 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.280
 not even in mobility in the media but me 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.109
 I surprised them because it is a lot 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 common today to see the kids go into 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.370
 bicycle los angeles and that's if i do you 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.570
 I said it twenty years ago mitchell and no 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.129
 impossible 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.860
 today like today the kids here in los 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.280
 angeles go cycling but why 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.610
 because it is not just a means of mobility 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.100
 practical but the most effective of all e 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.900
 what's cooking 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.840
 but this makes us think this gives us the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.400
 possibility of saying we have certain 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.979
 vehicle but because we cannot do 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.750
 other types of vehicles and this luck 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.820
 to be able to be in this place a 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.100
 pass nacci from this to the group 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.439
 piaggio to be able to look at 360 degrees 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.750
 what we will have to do in the next 10 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.280
 15 years with the advantage of the new ones 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.640
 technologies that allow you to 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.470
 interact in real time with 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.259
 absolutely today I was telling you today 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.960
 first if we did in my story 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.869
 professional the first bike via skype 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.210
 now he said so it seems but us 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.060
 we work with 3d files 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.150
 we send them to the computer here 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.550
 automatically in Italy and ours 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.100
 modelleria leaf resamont to the prototype e 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.030
 later with the room with skype why 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.590
 this is the means that we are in line and mo 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.209
 we straighten and do all the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.660
 changes I'll be there to have the map is 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.520
 ready 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.440
 this not only allows us to shorten the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.720
 times but we also have a chance 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.489
 to make more variants not only possible 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.720
 one but what was done in the past 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.120
 here you are treating the whole wolf for which 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.130
 moto guzzi we take care of 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.250
 piaggio group mobility of this is 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.320
 the word is now even if it becomes 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.690
 a bit trivial but that's what there is 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.220
 will still be ten valleys 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.700
 years now 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.760
 and you like how you see it we share motorbikes 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.470
 guzzi aprilia but I believe they are there 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.390
 always two aspects in this speech 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.700
 that we have been doing for a long time in the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.220
 my case is the romantic aspect it has 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.850
 Practical off this practicality 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.370
 this is a worldwide stuff where people 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.860
 he will always need to be able to move 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.930
 more effectively we have more 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.570
 pollution to be controlled ecology 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.360
 all these things that actually and the 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.680
 past generations have never had 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.150
 for that all these variables there 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.489
 they must make even gemolo think of today 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.370
 on the contrary for that and it is a force 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.030
 which allows us to create stuff like that before 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.650
 we did not have 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.040
 and then there is the whole romantic aspect 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.769
 of motorcycles of the brands of the del giro in 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.750
 motion of the noise that this will not go away 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.130
 for many years safe but there is struggle 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.190
 with engineers who then lead to 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.079
 make these products more than the 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.090
 fight with engineers and they are all 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.709
 approvals that we should do from here to 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.930
 next years there is only one 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.970
 the regulations are not even an engineer 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.630
 now there are the regulations that he loses 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.250
 really cc challenge let's say why in 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.220
 this case is always found after the end 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.600
 the form but my only concern 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.810
 that 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.690
 what we call the bike is 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.840
 becoming more and more complicated is 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.360
 heavy and this also means a little 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.920
 to distort what is always me 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:17.760
 liked it is of a simplicity that you 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:20.489
 lets you have fun with little known in the 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.010
 market globalization first 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.450
 we said there are bikes once 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.850
 there is the European market that had one 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.200
 very precise band a well displacement 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.040
 now there is the Asian market 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.810
 which has a displacement band 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.960
 lower 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.070
 and then there are the united states and we say 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.800
 america 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.870
 I think the only one will succeed 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.930
 unify this speech 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.510
 speech of the cylinder but in my opinion 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.060
 more than the displacement and the type of 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.680
 vehicle because what you are 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.950
 rightly saying this media 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.270
 displacement like in the past to another 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:03.030
 and 675 of 40 years ago was a displacement 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.430
 media that allowed us a lot 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.710
 millions and millions of people in the world of 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.480
 move not just to move to go 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.250
 to work but also to make gees la 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.930
 Sunday is the same whether we are 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.460
 arriving at this time the 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.890
 large displacements may be there 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.900
 may be may not be there according to me 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.570
 there will be a medium displacement that there 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.760
 will allow you to do so much and have fun for 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.290
 the right price we are also 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.880
 a little spoiled by the fact that now if 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.520
 is not the large displacement seems that 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.130
 nothing can be done and this is what you see 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.770
 bit was the tendency to me I am 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.380
 grown in the 60s of the 70s of the motorcycles 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.160
 for that and always wanting more the 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.020
 175 the 125 was too small 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.450
 since we arrived at 1000 in 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.120
 actually we always wanted 1200 this later 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.950
 at this moment in my opinion the great 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.650
 change and this if the boys that 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.570
 today we buy v7 this stuff here 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.430
 don't care anymore this is the stuff 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.970
 fundamental that from our point of 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.280
 view those a little older and we have 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.040
 certain parameters these new guys that 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.500
 they are buying us as mentioned v7 yes 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.880
 enjoy the ride in motion instead hear from 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.040
 design point of view 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.550
 here we have a very brand 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.530
 traditional with that moto guzzi and instead 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.030
 we have an aprilia for example that more 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:23.940
 devoted to innovation as it can 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.100
 manage these two things but it's two o'clock 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.620
 diamond tips that we have if from a 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.570
 side there is this pure Italian tradition 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.030
 which goes on the other travel 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.710
 we have the young Italian who is 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.620
 inventing things that never are 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:41.610
 these two worlds have been made for that 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.470
 as I said before the romance and the 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.570
 practicality carry it forward with much 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.610
 tranquility because then we have a 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.080
 example of how to make a 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.700
 right mix between the two 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.280
 did this for example as I told you 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.960
 first this is the bike that c track on 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.080
 control that in this part of the market 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.390
 there is no one but it is not that you do 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.610
 shouts that you have it when you need it 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.340
 enough is a technology that helps you there 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.080
 we have to wait for some news 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:10.010
 absolutely absolutely like us 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.870
 piaggio group right now I say e 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:15.120
 we are doing so much for that 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.340
 for the next one, as he said in November 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.140
 in Milan 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.750
 you will have so many beautiful things to see for i 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:26.300
 next 4 5 years 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:26.300
 we hope you know how I thank you please
