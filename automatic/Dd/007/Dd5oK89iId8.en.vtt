it's<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.370> unit<00:00:54.700> turn<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:55.470> I'm<00:00:56.470> gonna<00:00:56.649> step<00:00:56.980> it's

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
it's a unit turn and I'm gonna step it's

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.630 
it's a unit turn and I'm gonna step it's
a<00:00:57.460> Ford<00:00:58.239> source<00:00:58.780> of<00:00:58.989> momentum<00:00:59.710> this<00:01:00.070> way<00:01:00.309> in

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
a Ford source of momentum this way in

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.049 
a Ford source of momentum this way in
that<00:01:01.540> position<00:01:01.780> now<00:01:02.260> footwork<00:01:03.160> is<00:01:03.489> equally<00:01:03.970> as

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
that position now footwork is equally as

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.340 
that position now footwork is equally as
important<00:01:04.390> in<00:01:04.479> track<00:01:04.629> work<00:01:04.839> many<00:01:05.079> times<00:01:05.109> I

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
important in track work many times I

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.919 
important in track work many times I
think<00:01:05.409> small<00:01:05.889> little<00:01:06.130> steps<00:01:06.369> copy<00:01:07.329> me<00:01:07.569> mark

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:07.929 
think small little steps copy me mark

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:11.239 
think small little steps copy me mark
sometimes<00:01:08.200> I<00:01:08.530> turn<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:09.189> I<00:01:09.369> have<00:01:09.579> to<00:01:09.759> sidestep

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:11.249 
sometimes I turn and I have to sidestep

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:13.440 
sometimes I turn and I have to sidestep
sometimes<00:01:12.249> I<00:01:12.399> turn<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.909> I<00:01:12.999> have<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.210> step

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
sometimes I turn and I have to step

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.919 
sometimes I turn and I have to step
underneath<00:01:15.270> ideally<00:01:16.270> what<00:01:16.420> I<00:01:16.450> want<00:01:16.659> to<00:01:16.749> do<00:01:16.810> is

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
underneath ideally what I want to do is

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.109 
underneath ideally what I want to do is
get<00:01:17.049> a<00:01:17.289> multiple<00:01:17.950> number<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.310> steps<00:01:18.579> be<00:01:18.850> very

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
get a multiple number of steps be very

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.179 
get a multiple number of steps be very
explosive<00:01:19.509> and<00:01:19.959> then<00:01:20.409> finally<00:01:20.740> take<00:01:20.859> one

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
explosive and then finally take one

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.120 
explosive and then finally take one
