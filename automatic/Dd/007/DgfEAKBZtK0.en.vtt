 candied tomato beef with onions 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.929
 red tropea italy flat parsley 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.170
 breaks down in two years a little oil 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.600
 salt flora olive pepper 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.700
 so to have a good tartare you have to 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.989
 absolutely have a quality of life in 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.680
 extreme so we today I you 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.980
 presents black angel beef fillet 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.739
 the son of black angus is a son is 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.559
 extremely dark very marble and for 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.219
 this recipe so priority is going 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.219
 to cut the meat then we will do it 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.780
 with a knife we ​​have two styles of tartas on 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.390
 the knife tartares we have the tartars 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.019
 machine the textures of course are 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.170
 different 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.680
 when a texture to the labor courts so 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.680
 we cut the meat into muffled threads 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.020
 a small cube immediately 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.650
 here is the meat is very tender I do not 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.650
 not force on the knife 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.270
 not too big the cubes because that at 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.159
 boot level the texture we would have 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.130
 not all the animals in the mouth so he 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:50.180
 still need relatively cubes 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.500
 small so it seems 120 g of meat is 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.280
 maximum for a tartare for a 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.720
 nobody so I'll have 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:04.610
 the tartar in the small bowl for 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:09.890
 season it later I will 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:12.970
 flaw and the onion so that's a 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:18.860
 very crunchy red onion 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.150
 so here I 'm going to carve it a year the 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.920
 technique when we sign onion 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:30.319
 it's always in three parts a one 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:36.440
 two and three and then small 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.590
 pions here I had largely known did 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.590
 1 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.329
 so if you think he's too big 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.239
 for you but we give a little bit of 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:49.250
 knife on it and it's perfect 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:52.750
 so here I would put a little bit then 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.329
 of a spoon a spoon and a half 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.600
 in I'm going to season life 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:02.739
 is coming back now because I have not 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.410
 need the week after why 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.920
 because the fact of the season from the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.299
 threshold will give a helping bar 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.680
 have brought out a little red the 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.630
 meat and to excite a little bit the 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.250
 how to call it the meaning of the 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.350
 meat so in something a lot 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.980
 more mellow in my game towards 6 gold 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.920
 the flower of salt 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.920
 pepper salt flower gardens 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.750
 then I need this recipe for 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.030
 the confit tomato is found everywhere 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.110
 in all the stores in the occurrence 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.680
 that's a small confit tomato 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.100
 has homemade so I'm going to take 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:47.780
 two three still small 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.130
 golden cubes the tomato that allows me to see 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.870
 acidity for the dish because in a 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.900
 dish we always have acidity on 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:59.230
 vinegar the lemon or the automaton 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:03.530
 confit as it is 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.390
 then I need parsley parsley 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.530
 dish in this case it's much better 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.750
 as parsley curly parsley dish 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.820
 I'm going to the sides just I 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.840
 not need to see either a 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.880
 big quantity you have to have a 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.040
 imbalance the balances of each 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:24.460
 food that helps to have a balance 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.460
 perfect for flat so there I quests 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:35.190
 here is me title to 7 we avoid that the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:44.600
 that it is not good it will have all its taste 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:47.450
 in the dish here I add the parsley 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.810
 this is it 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:57.030
 then I need parmesan parmesan 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:01.350
 reggiano because of quality here I 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:05.760
 make chips that's what you give it 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:09.080
 the peps or full here I'll keep 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.080
 a little bit for the decor over 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.960
 have combined a little big I want 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.410
 keep 2 3 for the decor here and I 'm going 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:25.950
 carve me a little bit roughly 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:28.530
 like this cycle for the plan so here is 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.340
 there from there we mix 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.000
 delicately here is today leather 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.700
 it's good to do it with a 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.260
 fork 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.080
 because we can egrain a little bit 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:45.840
 meat that is just for it to take 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.250
 all the taste of the ingredients then there 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.140
 on top I would only put oil 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.530
 of olive because it is already put salt of the 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.600
 pepper 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.100
 I have the city of tomato a little bit 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.890
 olive oil here delicately because 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.240
 I already have candied tomatoes 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.240
 so it's useless to dread a ton 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:10.440
 then I mix well like this for 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:14.840
 coat the meat of all 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:17.610
 ingredients then I'm going to train him 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.830
 in fact in one more all the tartars 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.820
 we do here I like 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.530
 drawn up in 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.270
 in all that is a bit iced because 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.850
 that a pavement tartare not good it's 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.980
 not good for the health and its property of 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.720
 eat it fresh all the time during 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.170
 know with people we are discussing so 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.570
 we have molds a glass that 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.850
 keeps the tartar fresh 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:42.840
 all along we eat it so I put 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.220
 delicately in the tartare so 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.060
 after following the likes you know 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.470
 ring a little more salt or pepper 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.240
 there is no need for too much salt too 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.670
 porous and do not forget that the tomato 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:59.450
 already dried these areas and so we did not 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:07:02.730
 need to have a surplus seasoning 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:11.310
 above all simple I put a little 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:13.770
 few parmesan chips over and 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:17.130
 some rickett leaves of italy 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.540
 because africa is there is the 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.560
 racket and arugula rocket 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.250
 it's something a lot more 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:26.450
 wide less delicate so some 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.450
 small sheets of brick is over 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:34.500
 I put a tip of flora of these 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:37.230
 slightly over for the city 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:45.680
 forgiveness for snowshoeing and a tip of the 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:45.680
 dooly's that's the finished playa tells you
