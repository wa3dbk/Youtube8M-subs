00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
1080p at 30 frames per second you can

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.780 
1080p at 30 frames per second you can
also<00:02:16.230> do<00:02:16.410> slow-motion<00:02:16.740> video<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.580> the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
also do slow-motion video and the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.280 
also do slow-motion video and the
slow-motion<00:02:18.090> video<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.450> also<00:02:18.630> done<00:02:18.750> at<00:02:18.870> 480p

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
slow-motion video is also done at 480p

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.470 
slow-motion video is also done at 480p
so<00:02:19.530> that's<00:02:19.710> definitely<00:02:20.520> good<00:02:20.910> for<00:02:20.940> rotational

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
so that's definitely good for rotational

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.840 
so that's definitely good for rotational
