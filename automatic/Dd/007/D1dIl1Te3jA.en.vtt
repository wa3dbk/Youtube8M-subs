00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
although I have to have to admit I've

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.790 
although I have to have to admit I've
changed<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.900> song<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.140> bit<00:01:57.380> since<00:01:57.530> I<00:01:57.650> recorded

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
changed the song a bit since I recorded

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.969 
changed the song a bit since I recorded
on<00:01:58.159> YouTube<00:01:58.729> when<00:01:59.450> I<00:01:59.479> get<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.870> the<00:01:59.990> second<00:02:00.800> bit

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
on YouTube when I get to the second bit

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.770 
on YouTube when I get to the second bit
when<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.340> left<00:02:01.550> hand<00:02:01.729> joins<00:02:01.910> in<00:02:02.210> instead<00:02:02.750> of

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
when the left hand joins in instead of

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.040 
when the left hand joins in instead of
going<00:02:02.930> up<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.380> e<00:02:03.410> I<00:02:03.860> go<00:02:04.520> up<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.940> G<00:02:05.270> since

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
going up to the e I go up to the G since

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.350 
going up to the e I go up to the G since
it<00:02:06.200> more<00:02:06.350> closely<00:02:06.560> matches<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.190> song<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:07.940> i

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
it more closely matches the song and i

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.150 
it more closely matches the song and i
like<00:02:08.539> that<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.810> changes<00:02:09.080> things<00:02:09.229> up<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.560> bit<00:02:09.590> so

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
like that it changes things up a bit so

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:19.650 
like that it changes things up a bit so
instead<00:02:10.610> it'll<00:02:10.820> go<00:02:10.970> like<00:02:11.090> this

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.610
