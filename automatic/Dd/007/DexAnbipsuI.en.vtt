but still what I'm going to do is the

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.620 
but still what I'm going to do is the
movement<00:01:57.469> right<00:01:57.920> you<00:01:58.490> see<00:01:58.729> most<00:01:59.119> people<00:01:59.359> in

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
movement right you see most people in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.849 
movement right you see most people in
first-person<00:01:59.929> shooters<00:02:00.469> when<00:02:00.619> they<00:02:00.740> don't

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
first-person shooters when they don't

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.349 
first-person shooters when they don't
know<00:02:01.039> what<00:02:01.189> they're<00:02:01.340> doing<00:02:01.579> or<00:02:01.820> they're

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
know what they're doing or they're

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.120 
know what they're doing or they're
crossing<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.810> street<00:02:03.079> in<00:02:03.320> real<00:02:03.619> life<00:02:03.799> they<00:02:04.070> do

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
crossing the street in real life they do

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.219 
crossing the street in real life they do
this<00:02:06.130> seems<00:02:07.130> logical<00:02:07.429> no<00:02:08.090> it's<00:02:08.660> very<00:02:08.780> bad

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
this seems logical no it's very bad

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.160 
this seems logical no it's very bad
because<00:02:09.679> there's<00:02:10.310> either<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.850> bus<00:02:11.210> or<00:02:11.540> an<00:02:12.020> enemy

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
because there's either a bus or an enemy

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.280 
because there's either a bus or an enemy
with<00:02:12.560> dual<00:02:13.190> chain<00:02:13.970> guns<00:02:14.270> or<00:02:14.540> rocket<00:02:14.900> launchers

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
with dual chain guns or rocket launchers

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.930 
with dual chain guns or rocket launchers
