not<00:01:44.520> jumping<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> qhd<00:01:45.510> bandwagon<00:01:45.960> they're

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
sticking to a 1080p display I think this

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.900 
sticking to a 1080p display I think this
is<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.200> great<00:01:49.530> idea<00:01:49.770> because<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.760> don't

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
is a great idea because you really don't

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.610

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the difference especially a 5 inch

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.470 
the difference especially a 5 inch
display<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:55.170> 400<00:01:55.740> or<00:01:55.830> 400<00:01:56.250> ppm<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.910> on<00:01:57.270> top

faster<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:01.140> third<00:02:01.380> point<00:02:01.620> is<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.980> HTC<00:02:02.670> is

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730
