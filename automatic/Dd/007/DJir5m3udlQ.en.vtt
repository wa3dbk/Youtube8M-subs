 record I wanted to know since when tv 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.480

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.910
 children the children understood their 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.500

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:40.920
 Children, I think it best, do not turn it off. 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:47.150
 But this is very good 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.150

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.689
 start a family 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.480

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:03.870
 to decide in this century 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.760
 This couple rents the house next door at 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.579
 What was I thought you were? 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.379
 screaming at the kids, right? I thought. 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.109
 that they were watching tv 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:21.780
 Let's go to this place today, not if you 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:24.780
 like today in that we are in front 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.849
 That at the amusement park is 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.849
 that couple of lovers remember the defendant and 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:40.940
 I could take a picture of our gouaches 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.940
 My sweetie was in the bathroom. I know. 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:55.020
 you are the music of my life 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.210

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.570
 take another picture our time our 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.300
 memory side is clear that the 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.979
 purchase of fact I think so 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:11.010
 if I do it may be that they will 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:13.020
 although it x my sweetie to this the 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.820
 It is obvious that we have to 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.510
 live near these people 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.000
 So we'll keep the house alone. 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.099
 we decided we'll stay with a house 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.169
 That's good, this is great. 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:29.979
 I would not stay anything 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.860
 but why is not it good because I think 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:37.449
 You better not say no, please do not tell me. 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:39.879
 for us it is haunted and god 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.909
 it was on a dark storm night 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.930
 old man who lived there asked to wash the 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.969
 his money 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.909
 but then when he put it in the dryer 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:50.909
 a thief broke into the house with released 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.479
 say that if you are alone in the 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.819
 laundry room you can still hear the noise from the 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.819
 ax and money voting in the dryer 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.199
 Calm we're just making it up. 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:25.389

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:28.599

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:30.699

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:32.969
