wing<00:03:00.250> out<00:03:00.400> when<00:03:00.700> he's<00:03:00.819> jabbing<00:03:01.299> so<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.709> want

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
wing out when he's jabbing so you want

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.720 
wing out when he's jabbing so you want
to<00:03:02.980> watch<00:03:03.129> that<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.639> see<00:03:03.879> if<00:03:04.079> more<00:03:05.730> Martinez

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
to watch that and see if more Martinez

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.399 
to watch that and see if more Martinez
is<00:03:06.909> going<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.120> be<00:03:07.209> able<00:03:07.329> to<00:03:07.389> counter<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:07.900> you

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
is going to be able to counter that you

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:09.599 
is going to be able to counter that you
know<00:03:08.500> second<00:03:08.799> he<00:03:08.859> starts<00:03:09.010> pumping<00:03:09.430> out<00:03:09.489> the

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
know second he starts pumping out the

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.160 
know second he starts pumping out the
jab<00:03:09.819> that<00:03:10.150> right<00:03:10.359> arm<00:03:10.510> starts<00:03:10.870> chicken

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
jab that right arm starts chicken

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.690 
jab that right arm starts chicken
leaning<00:03:11.439> out<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.159> we'll<00:03:12.280> see<00:03:12.430> if<00:03:12.459> he<00:03:12.609> takes

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
leaning out so we'll see if he takes

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.149 
leaning out so we'll see if he takes
advantage<00:03:13.359> of<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.629> he<00:03:14.470> does<00:03:14.650> keep<00:03:14.829> his<00:03:14.980> cool

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
advantage of that he does keep his cool

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.069 
advantage of that he does keep his cool
he<00:03:15.760> is<00:03:15.790> giving<00:03:16.209> up<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.420> reach<00:03:16.599> in<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:16.900> fight

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
he is giving up the reach in this fight

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.000 
he is giving up the reach in this fight
I<00:03:17.109> think<00:03:17.379> it's<00:03:17.500> going<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.680> have<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.829> lot<00:03:17.950> of

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
I think it's going to have a lot of

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.280 
I think it's going to have a lot of
trouble<00:03:18.430> with<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.700> even<00:03:19.689> with<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.049> the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
trouble with that even with the the

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.050 
trouble with that even with the the
combos<00:03:20.680> behind<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.160> jab<00:03:21.370> he's<00:03:21.639> still<00:03:21.940> going

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
combos behind the jab he's still going

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.970 
combos behind the jab he's still going
to<00:03:22.120> have<00:03:22.209> trouble<00:03:22.449> with<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.440> because<00:03:23.739> he

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
to have trouble with that because he

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.830 
to have trouble with that because he
does<00:03:24.160> drop<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.639> right<00:03:24.819> hand<00:03:25.090> after<00:03:25.480> he<00:03:25.569> throws

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
does drop the right hand after he throws

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.539 
does drop the right hand after he throws
it<00:03:26.049> so<00:03:26.260> that's<00:03:26.440> going<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.650> look<00:03:26.829> pretty<00:03:27.129> rough

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
it so that's going to look pretty rough

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.770 
it so that's going to look pretty rough
in<00:03:27.760> there<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.720> think<00:03:29.379> this<00:03:29.500> is<00:03:29.560> going<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:29.889> be<00:03:30.040> a

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
in there I think this is going to be a

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.899 
in there I think this is going to be a
actually<00:03:31.780> knock<00:03:32.260> out<00:03:32.500> for<00:03:32.949> Martinez<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.699> think

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
actually knock out for Martinez I think

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.339 
actually knock out for Martinez I think
he<00:03:34.030> redeems<00:03:34.359> himself<00:03:34.569> and<00:03:34.959> it's<00:03:35.049> about<00:03:35.230> the

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
he redeems himself and it's about the

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.259 
he redeems himself and it's about the
10th<00:03:35.590> round<00:03:35.799> is<00:03:36.489> what<00:03:36.730> I<00:03:36.760> think<00:03:37.000> it'll<00:03:37.120> happen

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
10th round is what I think it'll happen

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.839 
10th round is what I think it'll happen
initially<00:03:37.659> i<00:03:37.870> was<00:03:37.959> looking<00:03:38.349> at<00:03:38.470> going<00:03:39.159> vud

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
initially i was looking at going vud

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.509 
initially i was looking at going vud
route<00:03:40.230> but<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.440> just<00:03:41.470> didn't<00:03:42.010> seem<00:03:42.159> like<00:03:42.220> the

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
route but that just didn't seem like the

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.610 
route but that just didn't seem like the
right<00:03:42.549> way<00:03:42.819> to<00:03:42.879> go<00:03:42.970> with<00:03:43.269> this<00:03:43.389> fight<00:03:43.659> it<00:03:44.409> seems

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620

than<00:03:56.229> stern<00:03:56.620> is<00:03:56.829> I<00:03:57.040> think<00:03:57.549> he<00:03:57.699> hits<00:03:57.909> harder

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
than stern is I think he hits harder
