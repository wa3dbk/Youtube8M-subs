hi<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.370> video<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.000> going<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.179> help<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.600> to

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
hi this video is going to help you to

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.960 
hi this video is going to help you to
order<00:00:04.259> fractions<00:00:04.950> decimals<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.460> percentages

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
order fractions decimals and percentages

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.059 
order fractions decimals and percentages
this<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.390> quite<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.660> common<00:00:07.109> question<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:08.040> your

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
this is quite a common question in your

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.259 
this is quite a common question in your
GCSE<00:00:08.700> exams<00:00:09.230> and<00:00:10.230> basically<00:00:11.040> what<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.150> need

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
GCSE exams and basically what you need

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.200 
GCSE exams and basically what you need
to<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:12.570> for<00:00:13.019> every<00:00:13.320> question<00:00:13.679> like<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:14.009> is

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 
to do for every question like this is

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.750 
to do for every question like this is
try<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.410> put<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.710> numbers<00:00:17.070> into<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> same

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
try to put the numbers into the same

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.790 
try to put the numbers into the same
format<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.510> could<00:00:18.750> choose<00:00:19.109> either<00:00:19.439> a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
format so you could choose either a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.090 
format so you could choose either a
decimal<00:00:20.400> or<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.670> fraction<00:00:21.240> or<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> percentage

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
decimal or a fraction or a percentage

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.920 
decimal or a fraction or a percentage
and<00:00:23.279> what<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.580> want<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> do<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.600> make<00:00:24.779> them

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
and what we want to do is just make them

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.109 
and what we want to do is just make them
all<00:00:25.080> into<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> same<00:00:25.439> format<00:00:26.189> now<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.029> think

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
all into the same format now I think

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.839 
all into the same format now I think
that<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> easiest<00:00:28.769> one<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.250> compare<00:00:29.699> them

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
that the easiest one to compare them

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.759 
that the easiest one to compare them
with<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.570> percentages<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.679> will

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
with is the percentages because it will

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.560 
with is the percentages because it will
be<00:00:31.859> obvious<00:00:32.399> which<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> biggest<00:00:33.120> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
be obvious which is the biggest and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.290 
be obvious which is the biggest and
which<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> smallest<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.790> basically

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
which is the smallest and so basically

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.600 
which is the smallest and so basically
what<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.660> need<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.050> know<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.559> how<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.219> convert

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
what you need to know is how to convert

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.270 
what you need to know is how to convert
a<00:00:39.149> decimal<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.140> fraction<00:00:40.620> into<00:00:40.980> a

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
a decimal and a fraction into a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.000 
a decimal and a fraction into a
percentage<00:00:42.000> okay

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
percentage okay

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.819 
percentage okay
for<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.100> example<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.390> 25%<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.410> already

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
for this example here the 25% is already

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.500 
for this example here the 25% is already
a<00:00:46.950> percentage<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.700> we'll<00:00:47.850> leave<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.270> it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
a percentage so we'll leave that as it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.799 
a percentage so we'll leave that as it
is<00:00:48.860> what<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:49.980> need<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.280> know<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.670> how<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> turn<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
is what we need to know is how to turn a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.459 
is what we need to know is how to turn a
decimal<00:00:52.800> into<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.610> percentage<00:00:54.289> and<00:00:55.289> that's

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
decimal into a percentage and that's

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.959 
decimal into a percentage and that's
fairly<00:00:55.800> straightforward<00:00:55.949> you're<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.820> going

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
fairly straightforward you're just going

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.299 
fairly straightforward you're just going
to<00:00:57.000> times<00:00:57.300> by<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> hundred<00:00:58.109> now<00:00:58.289> with<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
to times by a hundred now with a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.560 
to times by a hundred now with a
calculator<00:00:59.579> that's<00:00:59.969> no<00:01:00.149> problem<00:01:00.329> without

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
calculator that's no problem without

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.479 
calculator that's no problem without
calculator<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.410> need<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> remember<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
calculator you need to remember that

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.490 
calculator you need to remember that
you're<00:01:02.640> moving<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> digits<00:01:03.539> really<00:01:03.899> two

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you're moving the digits really two

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500 
you're moving the digits really two
places<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.280> left<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.939> number<00:01:06.299> here

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
places to the left so this number here

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.899 
places to the left so this number here
which<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.020> three<00:01:07.350> goes<00:01:08.220> into<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.549> unit's

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
which is the three goes into the unit's

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.480 
which is the three goes into the unit's
column<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.420> then<00:01:09.900> into<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> tens<00:01:10.530> column<00:01:10.830> so

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
column and then into the tens column so

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.030 
column and then into the tens column so
that<00:01:11.670> becomes<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.150> 30<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.290> nine<00:01:13.560> it's

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
that becomes a 30 and the nine it's

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.499 
that becomes a 30 and the nine it's
going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> move<00:01:14.369> from<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:15.060> which<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
going to move from here which is the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.300 
going to move from here which is the
hundredths<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> tenth<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
hundredths to the tenth and then the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.520 
hundredths to the tenth and then the
unit<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:17.970> end<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.210> 39<00:01:19.100> percent<00:01:21.530> in

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
unit so we end up with 39 percent in

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.730 
unit so we end up with 39 percent in
order<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> percentage<00:01:24.570> from<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
order to get the percentage from a

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.460 
order to get the percentage from a
fraction<00:01:26.610> there<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.330> two<00:01:27.570> sort<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> ways<00:01:28.259> that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
fraction there are two sort of ways that

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.700 
fraction there are two sort of ways that
you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.770> think<00:01:28.799> about<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.790> try<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
you can think about it you can try to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.149 
you can think about it you can try to
build<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:32.030> fraction<00:01:33.030> by<00:01:34.100> doubling<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
build up your fraction by doubling the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.530 
build up your fraction by doubling the
numbers<00:01:35.549> may<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.150> then<00:01:36.329> timesing<00:01:36.960> by<00:01:36.990> ten

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
numbers may be and then timesing by ten

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.490 
numbers may be and then timesing by ten
once<00:01:39.540> you've<00:01:39.689> got<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.200> hundred

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
once you've got it out of a hundred

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.990 
once you've got it out of a hundred
that's<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:42.540> key<00:01:42.780> because<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.829> percentage<00:01:44.729> is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that's the key because a percentage is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.170 
that's the key because a percentage is
just<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.420> number<00:01:45.689> out<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.899> 100<00:01:47.000> another<00:01:48.000> way<00:01:48.119> you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
just a number out of 100 another way you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.920 
just a number out of 100 another way you
can<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:49.520> simply<00:01:50.520> by<00:01:50.729> dividing<00:01:51.270> two

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
can do it is simply by dividing two

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.389 
can do it is simply by dividing two
divided<00:01:52.530> by<00:01:52.560> five<00:01:53.009> will<00:01:53.670> give<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.939> 0.4<00:01:55.399> let's

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
divided by five will give you 0.4 let's

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.039 
divided by five will give you 0.4 let's
write<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.610> down<00:01:56.759> here<00:01:57.090> two<00:01:57.299> divided<00:01:57.630> by<00:01:57.750> five

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
write that down here two divided by five

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.530 
write that down here two divided by five
is<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.409> 0.4<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.640> times<00:01:59.939> your<00:02:00.119> answer<00:02:00.420> by

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
is not 0.4 and then times your answer by

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.179 
is not 0.4 and then times your answer by
a<00:02:00.570> hundred<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:02.040> give<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.750> 40<00:02:03.750> percents<00:02:04.320> okay

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
a hundred to give you 40 percents okay

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.980 
a hundred to give you 40 percents okay
so<00:02:05.729> there<00:02:05.909> are<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.060> couple<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.570> ways<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.869> you

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
so there are a couple of ways that you

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.109 
so there are a couple of ways that you
can<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.619> now<00:02:08.399> what<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.700> need<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.000> do

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
can do that one now what you need to do

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.699 
can do that one now what you need to do
is<00:02:09.360> decide<00:02:09.720> which<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.140> smallest<00:02:10.530> and

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
is decide which is the smallest and

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.199 
is decide which is the smallest and
which<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> biggest<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.550> smallest<00:02:12.000> here

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
which is the biggest the smallest here

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.890 
which is the biggest the smallest here
is<00:02:12.360> obviously<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.840> 25%

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
is obviously the 25%

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.179 
is obviously the 25%
we're<00:02:14.019> going<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.200> write<00:02:14.349> that<00:02:14.530> one<00:02:14.680> down<00:02:14.739> and

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
we're going to write that one down and

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.280 
we're going to write that one down and
let's<00:02:16.060> imagine<00:02:16.269> that<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.629> question<00:02:16.959> asked<00:02:17.230> us

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
let's imagine that the question asked us

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.270 
let's imagine that the question asked us
to<00:02:17.319> get<00:02:17.560> smallest<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.930> biggest<00:02:22.950> okay<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:23.980> will

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
to get smallest to biggest okay I will

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.500 
to get smallest to biggest okay I will
seen<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.579> each<00:02:24.700> time<00:02:24.939> but<00:02:25.120> obviously<00:02:25.390> have

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
seen that each time but obviously have

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.119 
seen that each time but obviously have
to<00:02:25.599> read<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.930> question<00:02:26.349> very<00:02:26.500> carefully<00:02:27.040> as

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
to read the question very carefully as

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.649 
to read the question very carefully as
you<00:02:27.250> set<00:02:27.459> it<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:28.180> smallest<00:02:28.510> here<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.019> 25%<00:02:30.659> the

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
you set it the smallest here is 25% the

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.710 
you set it the smallest here is 25% the
next<00:02:32.019> one<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.439> the<00:02:32.950> 39%<00:02:33.909> which<00:02:34.120> I'm<00:02:34.510> going<00:02:34.659> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
next one is the 39% which I'm going to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.160 
next one is the 39% which I'm going to
write<00:02:34.870> back<00:02:35.109> in<00:02:35.319> its<00:02:35.439> original<00:02:35.680> format<00:02:36.370> and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
write back in its original format and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.380 
write back in its original format and
the<00:02:38.170> biggest<00:02:38.560> one<00:02:38.739> was<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.129> 40%<00:02:39.909> which<00:02:40.090> again

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
the biggest one was this 40% which again

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.890 
the biggest one was this 40% which again
in<00:02:40.540> its<00:02:40.659> original<00:02:40.900> format<00:02:41.439> is<00:02:41.620> two-fifths<00:02:42.900> so

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
in its original format is two-fifths so

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.319 
in its original format is two-fifths so
there<00:02:44.079> we<00:02:44.170> go<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:44.470> have<00:02:44.590> ordered<00:02:45.129> those<00:02:45.819> three

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
there we go we have ordered those three

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.690 
there we go we have ordered those three
fractions<00:02:47.230> decimals<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.799> percentages<00:02:48.190> it's

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
fractions decimals and percentages it's

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.069 
fractions decimals and percentages it's
important<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.150> show<00:02:49.359> you're<00:02:49.510> working<00:02:49.959> it's

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
important to show you're working it's

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.569 
important to show you're working it's
important<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.530> show<00:02:50.739> you<00:02:50.799> how<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.099> convert

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
important to show you how you convert

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.550 
important to show you how you convert
them<00:02:51.760> all<00:02:51.909> into<00:02:52.060> percentages<00:02:52.720> just<00:02:52.900> so<00:02:53.440> that

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
them all into percentages just so that

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.610 
them all into percentages just so that
you<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:53.829> really<00:02:54.010> get<00:02:54.159> those<00:02:54.310> method<00:02:54.730> marks

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
you can really get those method marks

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.740 
you can really get those method marks
here's<00:02:56.620> another<00:02:56.799> example<00:02:57.329> this<00:02:58.329> one<00:02:58.510> might<00:02:58.720> be

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
here's another example this one might be

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.449 
here's another example this one might be
a<00:02:58.930> little<00:02:59.019> bit<00:02:59.170> more<00:02:59.319> tricky<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.859> some<00:03:00.099> people

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
a little bit more tricky of some people

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.910 
a little bit more tricky of some people
because<00:03:00.819> of<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.959> eight<00:03:02.200> ninths<00:03:02.709> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
because of the eight ninths the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.789 
because of the eight ninths the
percentage<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.579> already<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.650> right

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
percentage is already in the right

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.729 
percentage is already in the right
format<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:07.269> naught<00:03:07.450> point<00:03:07.689> seven<00:03:08.170> again<00:03:08.590> you

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
format the naught point seven again you

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.399 
format the naught point seven again you
ties<00:03:08.980> by<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.250> hundred<00:03:10.019> some<00:03:11.019> people<00:03:11.290> would<00:03:11.379> be

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
ties by a hundred some people would be

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.319 
ties by a hundred some people would be
tempted<00:03:11.889> to<00:03:11.920> put<00:03:12.010> seven<00:03:12.579> percent<00:03:12.909> here<00:03:13.180> but

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
tempted to put seven percent here but

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.000 
tempted to put seven percent here but
just<00:03:13.540> track<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.079> seven<00:03:14.500> where<00:03:14.680> does<00:03:14.799> it<00:03:14.889> go

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
just track that seven where does it go

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.860 
just track that seven where does it go
two<00:03:15.069> places<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.000> left<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:16.329> it<00:03:16.450> goes<00:03:16.599> into

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
two places to the left so it goes into

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.140 
two places to the left so it goes into
the<00:03:16.959> units<00:03:17.319> and<00:03:17.409> then<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:17.919> tens<00:03:18.069> so<00:03:19.000> that

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
the units and then the tens so that

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.470 
the units and then the tens so that
seven<00:03:19.599> should<00:03:20.169> now<00:03:20.319> be<00:03:20.470> in<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.650> tens<00:03:20.919> column

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
seven should now be in the tens column

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.059 
seven should now be in the tens column
indicating<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.720> is<00:03:22.829> 70%<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:25.919> last<00:03:26.919> of

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
indicating that it is 70% and last of

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.159 
indicating that it is 70% and last of
all<00:03:27.129> we've<00:03:27.280> got<00:03:27.400> eight<00:03:27.579> ninths<00:03:28.120> now<00:03:28.299> this<00:03:28.959> one

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
all we've got eight ninths now this one

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.229 
all we've got eight ninths now this one
is<00:03:29.290> tricky<00:03:29.680> people<00:03:29.889> don't<00:03:30.549> tend<00:03:30.819> to<00:03:30.909> remember

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
is tricky people don't tend to remember

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.210 
is tricky people don't tend to remember
the<00:03:31.329> ninth<00:03:31.540> but<00:03:31.870> actually<00:03:32.769> Knights<00:03:32.980> are

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
the ninth but actually Knights are

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.000 
the ninth but actually Knights are
really<00:03:33.489> fairly<00:03:34.359> straightforward<00:03:35.169> okay

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.399 

if<00:03:39.849> you<00:03:39.970> remember<00:03:40.299> them<00:03:40.599> it<00:03:40.720> becomes<00:03:41.109> quite

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
if you remember them it becomes quite

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.750 
if you remember them it becomes quite
easy<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:42.269> 1/9<00:03:43.269> if<00:03:44.049> you<00:03:44.139> do<00:03:44.260> on<00:03:44.349> the<00:03:44.440> calculator

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
easy and 1/9 if you do on the calculator

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.430 
easy and 1/9 if you do on the calculator
1/9<00:03:45.760> will<00:03:46.299> give<00:03:46.419> you<00:03:46.510> zero<00:03:46.750> point<00:03:46.989> one<00:03:47.139> one<00:03:47.290> one

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
1/9 will give you zero point one one one

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.430 
1/9 will give you zero point one one one
one<00:03:47.620> one<00:03:47.650> recurring<00:03:49.019> which<00:03:50.019> I'm<00:03:50.199> going<00:03:50.379> to

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
one one recurring which I'm going to

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.319 
one one recurring which I'm going to
call<00:03:50.879> 11.1<00:03:53.519> recurring<00:03:54.519> I<00:03:54.609> put<00:03:54.849> the<00:03:54.940> dot<00:03:55.090> above

call 11.1 recurring I put the dot above

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.020 
call 11.1 recurring I put the dot above

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
the one to indicate that it's recurring

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.849 
the one to indicate that it's recurring
so<00:03:58.030> all<00:03:58.299> I'm<00:03:58.780> doing<00:03:59.169> now<00:03:59.199> is<00:03:59.470> I'm<00:03:59.590> thinking

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
so all I'm doing now is I'm thinking

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.000 
so all I'm doing now is I'm thinking
right<00:03:59.949> if<00:04:00.099> I've<00:04:00.220> got<00:04:00.400> eight<00:04:00.579> of<00:04:00.639> those<00:04:02.010> that's

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
right if I've got eight of those that's

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.479 
right if I've got eight of those that's
going<00:04:03.159> to<00:04:03.220> be<00:04:03.370> noir<00:04:03.819> point<00:04:04.150> eight<00:04:04.329> eight<00:04:04.810> eight

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
going to be noir point eight eight eight

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.000 
going to be noir point eight eight eight
etc<00:04:06.489> which<00:04:07.209> is<00:04:07.389> eighty<00:04:07.659> eight<00:04:08.019> point<00:04:08.769> eight

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
etc which is eighty eight point eight

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.379 
etc which is eighty eight point eight
percent<00:04:11.099> okay<00:04:12.099> and<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:12.459> eight<00:04:12.669> is<00:04:12.849> recurring

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
percent okay and that eight is recurring

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.259 
percent okay and that eight is recurring
as<00:04:13.540> well<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:15.280> what<00:04:15.459> we<00:04:15.549> have<00:04:15.729> here<00:04:15.940> is<00:04:16.030> eighty

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
as well so what we have here is eighty

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.379 
as well so what we have here is eighty
eight<00:04:16.479> point<00:04:16.659> eight<00:04:17.010> recurring<00:04:18.010> percent<00:04:18.459> and

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
eight point eight recurring percent and

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.469 
eight point eight recurring percent and
that's<00:04:20.880> going<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.940> be<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.240> one<00:04:23.219> okay

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
that's going to be that one okay

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.700 
that's going to be that one okay
alternatively<00:04:25.479> if<00:04:25.810> you've<00:04:26.229> got<00:04:26.409> this<00:04:26.529> on<00:04:26.680> a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
alternatively if you've got this on a

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.930 
alternatively if you've got this on a
calculator<00:04:27.219> paper<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:27.729> can

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
calculator paper you can

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.290 
calculator paper you can
simply<00:04:28.240> do<00:04:28.560> 8/9<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:30.400> get<00:04:30.520> your<00:04:30.640> decimal<00:04:31.120> and

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
simply do 8/9 to get your decimal and

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.280 
simply do 8/9 to get your decimal and
then<00:04:32.170> times<00:04:32.470> by<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:32.710> hundred<00:04:33.600> okay<00:04:34.600> so<00:04:35.080> let's

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
then times by a hundred okay so let's

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.970 
then times by a hundred okay so let's
have<00:04:35.380> a<00:04:35.470> look<00:04:35.620> again<00:04:35.800> smallest<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.610> biggest

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
have a look again smallest to biggest

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.480 
have a look again smallest to biggest
the<00:04:38.980> smallest<00:04:39.370> number<00:04:39.850> here<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:42.010> 70%

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
the smallest number here is the 70%

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.580 
the smallest number here is the 70%
which<00:04:43.090> if<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.510> write<00:04:43.690> in<00:04:43.810> its<00:04:43.930> original<00:04:44.350> format

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
which if I write in its original format

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.680 
which if I write in its original format
with<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.770> naught<00:04:44.980> point<00:04:45.190> seven<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:46.510> next

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
with a naught point seven the next

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.790 
with a naught point seven the next
biggest<00:04:47.110> number<00:04:47.320> is<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.500> 85%<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:49.680> then<00:04:50.680> the

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
biggest number is the 85% and then the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.590 
biggest number is the 85% and then the
largest<00:04:51.280> number<00:04:51.610> was<00:04:52.090> this<00:04:52.210> eight<00:04:52.450> ninths

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
largest number was this eight ninths

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.130 
largest number was this eight ninths
okay<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:55.990> it<00:04:56.620> really<00:04:56.770> is<00:04:56.920> that<00:04:57.100> easy
