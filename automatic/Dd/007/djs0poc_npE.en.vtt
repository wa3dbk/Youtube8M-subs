00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.460

 well now let me take such a short course 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:10.950
 Now what will make 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:14.580
 everything is really very very 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:19.220
 great wonderful i'm very glad that on 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:22.110
 the fact that I acquired cf these 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.830
 trite simple thing anyone 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:29.910
 ever talk to you 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:34.200
 from dealers there rice fields bopi you fuck 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:36.180
 nobody needs and here in the shop with you 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.350
 communicate trying to find a common language 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.110
 try to listen to you i don't know i 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.000
 of course I don’t say anything 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.480
 do mad advertising yes there for cf 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.880
 moto but i'm just honest 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.180
 your impressions 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.690
 I think that the service price and quality 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.570
 at a very good level concrete gave 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.220
 that with regards to goal the main thing for me as 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.790
 for the consumer to ensure that this technique does not 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.040
 broke down and there were normal parts 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:12.050
 here 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:16.860
 everything is adequate so make a decision 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:19.770
 see for yourself I chose my opinion and 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.800
 tomorrow you will see another video in 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.640

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.550
 or owns baby moved to cf moto 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.380
 no matter how funny it sounds but it’s so 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.190
 and there is 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:38.790
 goodbye times she cuts to songs 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:41.040
 change policy forever of course 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:44.540
 let's get back to you pricing policy 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:48.420
 That's probably what my opinion is 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.200
 all guys all thank you very much thank you 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.550
