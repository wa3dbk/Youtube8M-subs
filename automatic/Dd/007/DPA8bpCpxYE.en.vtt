00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
to do it in Minecraft I could think

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.609 
to do it in Minecraft I could think
about<00:01:24.060> maybe<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.689> few<00:01:24.900> ways<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.380> wouldn't

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
about maybe a few ways but it wouldn't

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.260 
about maybe a few ways but it wouldn't
really<00:01:25.680> work<00:01:25.830> very<00:01:26.009> well<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.700> he<00:01:27.000> doesn't

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
really work very well but he doesn't

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.840 
really work very well but he doesn't
look<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.420> sorry<00:01:28.140> obviously<00:01:28.979> he<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.610> looks

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
