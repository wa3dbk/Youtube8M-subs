00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.259
 in this new day we are accompanied by a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.880
 hunter nobel in the hunting of the partridge 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.460
 we want you to see how in it 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.380
 preserve with the same dogs 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.380
 results are not always the same 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.350
 It is a reality that most 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.330
 hunters who visit the preserve for the first time 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.820
 time does not get to the quota of 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.740
 established partridges is also a 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.230
 reality the fact that even between 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.390
 the veteran hunters of the preserve more than 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.340
 some day not only does not reach the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.860
 they fit but they do not capture 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.989
 no partridge this gives an idea that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.000
 hunting with the group servÃ¡n is not so 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.420
 easy as it could appear in these 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.420
 videos 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.939
 as we see in the image the two bitches 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.420
 they are showing the hot one 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.490
 new partridge on the other hand the hunter is 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.950
 Knowing the potential of partridges 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.869
 repopulated from the rowan group understands that 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.509
 the dam is near where the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.399
 bitches are performing the sample a 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.810
 normal assumption and very common between 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.810
 the visiting hunters 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.899
 about 50 meters after the first 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.719
 shows the bitches keep unraveling 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.700
 the trail that this partridge is leaving and 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.549
 in this regard, he believes that two 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.409
 attitudes that will surely pass from 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.159
 Sad poured for most of those who 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.960
 view this video 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.990
 while one of them follows the pawn 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.359
 I give the hunter the second bitch outside 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.429
 of recording plane is making a 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.039
 wider loop and above the hunter 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.319
 in order to cut the partridge that with 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.690
 all security is combing fast 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.860
 trying to reach the top of the slope 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.500
 for once in it to break in flight 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.810
 more than 200 meters after the first 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.480
 shows the partridge repopulated in the same 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.490
 group hunting day whistle in flight 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.490
 far from the reach of the weapon 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.870
 but even when they seem lost 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.060
 when the haul seems to be won 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.040
 you are partridges are removed from the sleeve a 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.770
 behavior that surprises oneself and 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.980
 strangers as we will see in the following 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.980
 images 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.090
 the sample of the wait indicates that the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.160
 partridge is in this thicket our 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.560
 dog friends cut the withdrawal of the 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.390
 Partridge by one of the ends while 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.060
 that the hunter does the same for another 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.920
 to escape this spear unscathed the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.050
 partridge has only one option as a flight 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.130
 vertical or that thinks to our 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.130
 Hunter companion 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.069
 but our loss of quality with 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.989
 intelligence away from any 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.970
 comparative with the partridges of 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.829
 intensive knows how to move around 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.079
 scrub with dexterity and get out by 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.239
 behind the hunter breaking the waist 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.040
 and making a flight hard to believe 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.560
 in a lost repopulated 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.890
 and so concludes another day in the 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.409
 bounded a day where the 5 hours of 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.019
 hunting we made three partridge giants 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.480
 and we continue to beat a day 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.950
 where once again we have been able to check 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.989
 the extraordinary quality of 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.200
 partridges offered by the rowan group 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.450
 if we were not clear we are sure 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.790
 that the last two partridges had 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.439
 been labeled as savages by the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.310
 Most hunters who have visualized 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.310
