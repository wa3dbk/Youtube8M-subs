I<00:03:54.280> use<00:03:54.489> it<00:03:54.640> every<00:03:54.730> day<00:03:54.989> today<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.019> used<00:03:56.290> it<00:03:56.470> twice

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
I use it every day today I used it twice

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.400 
I use it every day today I used it twice
because<00:03:56.859> I<00:03:57.040> touched<00:03:57.280> up<00:03:57.489> a<00:03:57.609> little<00:03:57.819> bit<00:03:57.970> and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
because I touched up a little bit and

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.410 
because I touched up a little bit and
it's<00:03:59.410> still<00:03:59.920> pointy<00:04:00.730> I<00:04:00.880> mean<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.120> can<00:04:01.239> see

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
it's still pointy I mean you can see

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.370 
it's still pointy I mean you can see
that<00:04:01.450> it's<00:04:01.720> still<00:04:01.900> pointy<00:04:02.170> I've<00:04:02.230> never

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
that it's still pointy I've never

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.740 
that it's still pointy I've never
sharpened<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:03.010> since<00:04:03.220> I<00:04:03.340> got<00:04:03.519> it<00:04:03.700> so<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.239> think

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
sharpened it since I got it so I think

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.750 
sharpened it since I got it so I think
it's<00:04:04.900> going<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.079> last<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.500> long<00:04:05.709> time<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.519> is

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
it's going to last a long time and it is

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.750 
it's going to last a long time and it is
fantastic<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:08.440> really<00:04:08.829> is<00:04:09.040> good<00:04:09.160> it's<00:04:09.489> worth

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
fantastic it really is good it's worth

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.930 
fantastic it really is good it's worth
the<00:04:10.030> price

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
the price

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.870 
the price
I<00:04:12.000> think<00:04:12.210> it<00:04:12.300> was<00:04:13.250> 20-something<00:04:14.250> in<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.760> low

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
I think it was 20-something in the low

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.590 
I think it was 20-something in the low
20s<00:04:15.390> not<00:04:15.720> bad<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.610> it's<00:04:17.610> extra<00:04:18.090> long<00:04:18.269> I<00:04:18.450> mean

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
20s not bad and it's extra long I mean

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.110 
20s not bad and it's extra long I mean

you color your brows you do not have to
be<00:04:51.360> precise<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:51.930> literally<00:04:52.440> scribble<00:04:53.250> so<00:04:53.820> if

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
be precise I literally scribble so if

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.540

you can scribble and I know you can then

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.550 
you can scribble and I know you can then
you<00:04:56.670> can<00:04:56.790> put<00:04:56.910> this<00:04:57.030> on<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.480> and<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:57.990> doesn't<00:04:58.380> I

you can put this on it and it doesn't I

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.710 
you can put this on it and it doesn't I
think<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.130> problem<00:04:59.580> with<00:04:59.730> other<00:04:59.940> eye<00:05:00.210> pencils

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
think the problem with other eye pencils

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.040 
think the problem with other eye pencils
that<00:05:00.780> I've<00:05:01.020> used<00:05:01.320> is<00:05:02.330> they're<00:05:03.330> too<00:05:03.510> soft<00:05:03.750> and

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
that I've used is they're too soft and

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.250 
that I've used is they're too soft and
too<00:05:04.110> much<00:05:04.590> product<00:05:05.010> comes<00:05:05.550> off<00:05:05.820> as<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.810> color

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
too much product comes off as you color

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.230 
too much product comes off as you color
in<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.770> you<00:05:07.860> end<00:05:08.010> up<00:05:08.160> with<00:05:08.280> really<00:05:08.520> dark<00:05:08.910> spots

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
in and you end up with really dark spots

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.040 
in and you end up with really dark spots
I've<00:05:09.960> even<00:05:10.320> had<00:05:10.470> a<00:05:11.330> deposit<00:05:12.330> so<00:05:12.600> much<00:05:12.810> of<00:05:12.960> the

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
I've even had a deposit so much of the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.570 
I've even had a deposit so much of the
product<00:05:13.410> that<00:05:13.530> my<00:05:13.650> brows<00:05:13.890> kind<00:05:14.250> of<00:05:14.310> stick

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
product that my brows kind of stick

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.840 
product that my brows kind of stick
together<00:05:14.760> almost<00:05:15.180> like<00:05:15.500> waxy<00:05:16.500> waxy<00:05:17.250> pneus<00:05:17.669> in

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
together almost like waxy waxy pneus in

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.110 
together almost like waxy waxy pneus in
your<00:05:18.000> brows<00:05:19.190> anyway<00:05:20.190> so<00:05:20.250> I<00:05:20.340> think<00:05:20.400> that's<00:05:20.850> what

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
your brows anyway so I think that's what

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.850 
your brows anyway so I think that's what
they<00:05:21.240> were<00:05:21.330> trying<00:05:21.540> to<00:05:21.720> avoid<00:05:21.840> in<00:05:22.290> making<00:05:22.680> this

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
they were trying to avoid in making this

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.610 
they were trying to avoid in making this
a<00:05:23.100> hard<00:05:23.460> formula<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:24.510> it's<00:05:24.870> brilliant<00:05:25.350> it

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
a hard formula and it's brilliant it

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.070 
a hard formula and it's brilliant it
works<00:05:25.890> really<00:05:26.490> really<00:05:26.669> well<00:05:26.940> when<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:27.780> bought

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
works really really well when I bought

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.900 
works really really well when I bought
mine<00:05:28.350> there<00:05:28.740> were<00:05:28.860> only<00:05:29.010> three<00:05:29.430> colors<00:05:29.730> i

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
mine there were only three colors i

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.710

bought<00:05:30.210> mine<00:05:30.360> from<00:05:30.390> QVC<00:05:31.970> but<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.150> also<00:05:33.390> looked

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
bought mine from QVC but I also looked

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.840 
bought mine from QVC but I also looked
at<00:05:33.780> the<00:05:33.900> shoe<00:05:34.080> room<00:05:34.290> or<00:05:34.470> a<00:05:34.500> website<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:35.340> they

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
at the shoe room or a website and they

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.820 
at the shoe room or a website and they
had<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.210> exact<00:05:36.540> same<00:05:36.630> colors<00:05:37.140> available<00:05:37.440> only

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
had the exact same colors available only

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.550 
had the exact same colors available only
three<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.460> they<00:05:39.150> were<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.540> seal<00:05:39.780> brown<00:05:40.080> there

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
three and they were the seal brown there

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.140 
three and they were the seal brown there
was<00:05:40.710> a<00:05:40.760> color<00:05:41.760> for<00:05:43.310> auburn<00:05:44.310> hair<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:44.790> one<00:05:44.970> for

was a color for auburn hair and one for
gray<00:05:45.330> hair<00:05:45.570> and<00:05:45.750> i<00:05:46.590> probably<00:05:47.310> could<00:05:47.730> use<00:05:47.760> the

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
gray hair and i probably could use the

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.430 
gray hair and i probably could use the
auburn<00:05:48.330> but<00:05:48.510> I'd<00:05:48.630> rather<00:05:48.750> not<00:05:49.050> because<00:05:49.350> I

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
auburn but I'd rather not because I

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.320 
auburn but I'd rather not because I
don't<00:05:49.500> I<00:05:50.010> don't<00:05:50.130> want<00:05:50.460> my<00:05:50.550> brows<00:05:50.760> to<00:05:51.000> look<00:05:51.150> red
