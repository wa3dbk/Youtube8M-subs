simply just the fireworks I mean sure it

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.449 
simply just the fireworks I mean sure it
could<00:02:50.489> be<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:51.380> popular<00:02:52.380> roosting<00:02:52.860> spot<00:02:53.160> for

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
could be a popular roosting spot for

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.000 
could be a popular roosting spot for
these<00:02:53.640> birds<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.360> one<00:02:54.569> area<00:02:54.840> but<00:02:55.260> I'm

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
these birds in that one area but I'm

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.400 
these birds in that one area but I'm
sorry<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:56.850> find<00:02:57.299> that<00:02:57.360> really<00:02:57.450> strange<00:02:58.140> I

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
sorry I just find that really strange I

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.630 
sorry I just find that really strange I
think<00:02:58.470> we<00:02:58.709> would<00:02:58.799> be<00:02:58.980> hearing<00:02:59.250> about<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.610> in

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
think we would be hearing about it in

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.970 
think we would be hearing about it in
more<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.209> like<00:03:00.810> different<00:03:00.930> areas<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.680> stuff

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
more in like different areas and stuff

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.949 
more in like different areas and stuff

deal<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.410> did<00:03:05.010> some<00:03:05.190> research<00:03:05.580> into<00:03:05.959> birds<00:03:06.959> but

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
deal I did some research into birds but

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.860 
deal I did some research into birds but
particularly<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.269> black<00:03:09.269> bird<00:03:09.570> that's

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
particularly this black bird that's

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.470 
particularly this black bird that's
predominant<00:03:10.829> in<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:10.980> Arkansas<00:03:11.370> area<00:03:11.820> around

predominant in the Arkansas area around

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.990 
predominant in the Arkansas area around
this<00:03:12.570> time<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.930> year<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:14.010> looks<00:03:14.880> like

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
this time of the year and it looks like

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.080 
this time of the year and it looks like
that<00:03:15.450> birds<00:03:16.350> most<00:03:16.799> birds<00:03:17.100> especially<00:03:17.370> flying

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
that birds most birds especially flying

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.970 
that birds most birds especially flying
species<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.780> birds<00:03:19.019> have<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.350> naturally

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
species of birds have a naturally

occurring magnetic sphere ease in their
beaks<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:24.090> gives<00:03:24.450> them<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.690> sense<00:03:24.900> of

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
beaks that gives them a sense of

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.539 
beaks that gives them a sense of
direction<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:25.709> they<00:03:25.829> know<00:03:26.010> which<00:03:26.160> way<00:03:26.370> they're

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
direction so they know which way they're

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.849 
direction so they know which way they're
flying<00:03:26.760> north<00:03:27.090> or<00:03:27.299> south<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.840> guide<00:03:28.290> them<00:03:28.590> on

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
flying north or south to guide them on

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.819 
flying north or south to guide them on
when<00:03:29.310> their<00:03:29.430> migration<00:03:30.000> patterns<00:03:30.030> are<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:30.870> it

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
when their migration patterns are and it

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.199 
when their migration patterns are and it
could<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.070> be<00:03:32.190> something<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.700> do<00:03:32.820> with<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
could it be something to do with the

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.360 
could it be something to do with the
solar<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.750> solar<00:03:34.680> flares<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:35.160> we've<00:03:35.250> been

solar of solar flares that we've been

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
the map right here and see it's just a

this truly was the case then if

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.390 
this truly was the case then if
something<00:04:49.530> was<00:04:49.740> going<00:04:49.950> on<00:04:50.040> with<00:04:50.100> this

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
effect on the area that we just don't

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.090 
effect on the area that we just don't
know<00:04:55.500> about

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
know about

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.490 
know about
wouldn't<00:04:56.730> we<00:04:56.790> be<00:04:56.820> finding<00:04:57.360> other<00:04:57.570> animals<00:04:58.200> or

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
the area is just really strange but

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.170 
the area is just really strange but
that's<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.830> only<00:05:04.980> things<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.340> come<00:05:05.610> up<00:05:05.730> with<00:05:05.940> as

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
that's the only things I come up with as

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.660 
that's the only things I come up with as
a<00:05:06.210> possibility<00:05:07.080> of<00:05:07.410> what<00:05:07.680> may<00:05:07.920> be<00:05:07.950> happening

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
a possibility of what may be happening

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.730 
a possibility of what may be happening
to<00:05:09.150> these<00:05:09.270> birds<00:05:09.570> but<00:05:10.020> I<00:05:10.200> definitely<00:05:10.380> don't

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
to these birds but I definitely don't

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.870 
to these birds but I definitely don't
think<00:05:10.890> it's<00:05:11.130> fireworks<00:05:13.250> so<00:05:14.250> this<00:05:14.400> is<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.610> very

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
think it's fireworks so this is a very

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.330 
think it's fireworks so this is a very
weird<00:05:15.180> story<00:05:15.270> very<00:05:15.930> odd<00:05:16.140> indeed<00:05:16.470> happening

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
weird story very odd indeed happening

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.640 
weird story very odd indeed happening
for<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.580> second<00:05:17.970> year<00:05:18.090> in<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.390> row<00:05:18.470> could<00:05:19.470> it<00:05:19.560> be

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
for a second year in a row could it be

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.470 
for a second year in a row could it be
linked<00:05:19.890> to<00:05:19.980> something<00:05:20.190> in<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.490> area<00:05:20.670> I<00:05:21.120> don't

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
linked to something in the area I don't

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.700 
linked to something in the area I don't
know<00:05:21.570> is<00:05:21.810> it<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:21.990> fireworks

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
know is it the fireworks

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.940 
know is it the fireworks
maybe<00:05:23.700> I<00:05:24.150> highly<00:05:24.600> doubt<00:05:24.780> it<00:05:24.960> though<00:05:25.140> but<00:05:25.560> um<00:05:25.710> if

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
maybe I highly doubt it though but um if
