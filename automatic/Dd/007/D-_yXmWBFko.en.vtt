00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
believe the highest rank for each gun is

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.990 
believe the highest rank for each gun is
30<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.800> we<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.129> these<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.579> go<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
30 and we get these as we go up the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.970 
30 and we get these as we go up the
ranking<00:00:39.390> system<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.989> once<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.649> actually<00:00:40.890> hit

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
ranking system and once we actually hit

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.229 
ranking system and once we actually hit
the<00:00:41.040> highest<00:00:41.340> rank<00:00:41.700> we'll<00:00:41.910> be<00:00:42.000> able<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the highest rank we'll be able to

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.270 
the highest rank we'll be able to
require<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.870> golden<00:00:43.260> camo<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.070> gun

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
require the golden camo for that gun

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.160 
require the golden camo for that gun
which<00:00:44.760> doesn't<00:00:45.149> mean<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.750> press<00:00:45.960> deed

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
which doesn't mean we have to press deed

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.410 
which doesn't mean we have to press deed
so<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.250> want<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.520> stick<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.329> the

there's<00:01:05.369> been<00:01:05.489> nothing<00:01:05.610> confirmed<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.540> far

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
there's been nothing confirmed so far

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.240 
there's been nothing confirmed so far
however<00:01:07.290> I've<00:01:07.560> had<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> look<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.070> some

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
however I've had a look at some

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.370 
however I've had a look at some
screenshots<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.330> shown<00:01:09.540> at<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> RPG<00:01:10.229> or

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
screenshots and it's shown at the RPG or

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.289 
screenshots and it's shown at the RPG or
the<00:01:10.530> rocket<00:01:10.710> launcher<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.369> acquired<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.090> level

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the rocket launcher is acquired at level

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.910 
the rocket launcher is acquired at level
80<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.960> appears<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.470> highest<00:01:13.619> rank

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
80 so it appears that the highest rank

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.830 
80 so it appears that the highest rank
has<00:01:14.040> been<00:01:14.189> increased<00:01:14.549> from<00:01:15.060> 70<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.689> one

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
has been increased from 70 in one

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.200 
has been increased from 70 in one
warfare<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.530> until<00:01:16.619> 80<00:01:17.070> which<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.490> crazy<00:01:17.820> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
warfare to up until 80 which is crazy I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.149 
warfare to up until 80 which is crazy I
guess<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.990> want<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.229> try<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.530> prolong<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> life

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
guess I want to try and prolong the life

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.160 
guess I want to try and prolong the life
of<00:01:20.400> multiplayer<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.450> love<00:01:21.630> ranking<00:01:22.049> up

in<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.220> warfare<00:01:35.670> you'll<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.689> an<00:01:36.780> extra

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
in one warfare you'll get an extra

was<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> sort<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.150> bonus<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.540> got<00:01:39.689> for

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
was the sort of bonus you got for

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.469 
was the sort of bonus you got for

prestigious<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.869> personal<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.560> think<00:01:46.590> 15<00:01:47.070> is

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
prestigious and personal I think 15 is

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.080 
prestigious and personal I think 15 is
quite<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> nice<00:01:47.579> number

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
quite a nice number

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120 
quite a nice number
I<00:01:48.210> only<00:01:48.390> ever<00:01:48.479> hit<00:01:48.840> around<00:01:48.990> four<00:01:49.500> or<00:01:49.680> five<00:01:49.920> on

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I only ever hit around four or five on

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.060 
I only ever hit around four or five on
black<00:01:50.310> ops<00:01:50.700> I'm<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.570> warfare<00:01:51.960> 2<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.560> those

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
black ops I'm on warfare 2 and those

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.920 
black ops I'm on warfare 2 and those
ability<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.610> hack<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> prestige<00:01:54.600> that's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
ability to hack to a prestige that's

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.959 
ability to hack to a prestige that's
kind<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.229> irrelevant<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.070> think<00:01:56.310> 15<00:01:56.729> ty

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
kind of irrelevant but I think 15 ty

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.819 
kind of irrelevant but I think 15 ty
enough<00:01:57.240> really<00:01:57.659> if<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.200> want<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.469> make<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.710> any

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
higher than that then fair enough fess

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.359 
higher than that then fair enough fess
up<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> guys<00:02:01.290> really<00:02:01.770> love<00:02:01.890> ranking<00:02:02.250> up
