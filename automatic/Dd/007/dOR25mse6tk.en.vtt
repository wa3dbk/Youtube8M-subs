that's a beautiful thing about body
weight<00:01:52.829> training<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:54.030> much<00:01:54.360> easier

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
weight training is that it's much easier

you<00:02:08.640> know<00:02:08.729> consistency<00:02:09.509> much<00:02:09.990> easier<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
you know consistency much easier to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.880 
you know consistency much easier to
handle<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:12.060> second<00:02:12.480> one<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.959> something<00:02:13.560> that

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
handle the second one is something that

handle the second one is something that
is<00:02:14.040> unique<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.400> bodyweight<00:02:14.910> training<00:02:15.120> which<00:02:15.420> I

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
is unique to bodyweight training which I

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.080 
is unique to bodyweight training which I
could<00:02:15.720> call<00:02:15.870> technical<00:02:16.260> convergence<00:02:17.090> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
could call technical convergence the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.150 
could call technical convergence the
muscle<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.690> build<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.650> in<00:02:20.010> direct

relation to how good your technique is
you<00:02:23.010> know<00:02:23.100> it's<00:02:23.280> not<00:02:23.400> about<00:02:23.730> heavy<00:02:24.180> weight<00:02:24.480> I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
you know it's not about heavy weight I

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
build muscle your technique is what

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.759 
build muscle your technique is what
builds<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.370> muscle<00:02:51.090> your<00:02:51.720> technique<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.440> what

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
builds the muscle your technique is what

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.370 
builds the muscle your technique is what
does<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:54.060> unfortunate<00:02:55.050> thing<00:02:55.230> is

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
does and the the unfortunate thing is

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.070 
does and the the unfortunate thing is
when<00:02:55.560> people<00:02:55.590> get<00:02:55.980> really<00:02:56.570> in<00:02:57.570> their<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:57.959> their

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
when people get really in their in their

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.710 
when people get really in their in their
heads<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.500> like<00:02:58.650> what<00:02:59.160> how<00:03:00.060> much<00:03:00.209> can<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.450> lift

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
heads of like what how much can you lift

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.449 
heads of like what how much can you lift
and<00:03:00.900> stuff<00:03:01.110> by<00:03:01.410> lifting<00:03:01.650> more<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.340> their

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
and stuff by lifting more of their

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.790 
and stuff by lifting more of their
technique<00:03:02.880> starts<00:03:03.269> or<00:03:03.450> roading<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.680> know

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
technique starts or roading you know

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.860 
technique starts or roading you know
shorter<00:03:05.370> range<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.790> motion<00:03:06.180> knees<00:03:06.420> are<00:03:06.600> caving

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
shorter range of motion knees are caving

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.229 
shorter range of motion knees are caving
in<00:03:07.170> your<00:03:07.500> technique<00:03:07.860> gets<00:03:08.100> worse<00:03:08.459> as<00:03:08.790> they

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
in your technique gets worse as they

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.990 
in your technique gets worse as they
lift<00:03:09.480> more<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.870> more<00:03:10.049> more<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.350> pretty<00:03:10.620> soon

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
lift more and more more and pretty soon

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.840 
lift more and more more and pretty soon
it's<00:03:12.000> like<00:03:12.209> how<00:03:12.890> much<00:03:13.890> kind<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.340> lift<00:03:14.579> that's

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
it's like how much kind of lift that's

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.819 
it's like how much kind of lift that's
as<00:03:15.120> much<00:03:15.570> as<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.840> can<00:03:15.900> because<00:03:16.470> you're<00:03:16.680> only

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
as much as I can because you're only

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.140 
as much as I can because you're only
going<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.100> be<00:03:17.220> able<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.400> lift<00:03:17.579> as<00:03:17.760> much<00:03:17.910> as<00:03:18.030> your

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
going to be able to lift as much as your

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.000 
going to be able to lift as much as your
techniques<00:03:18.540> gonna<00:03:18.750> allow<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.680> your<00:03:19.799> technique

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
techniques gonna allow so your technique

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.430 
techniques gonna allow so your technique
is<00:03:20.340> getting<00:03:20.670> worse<00:03:20.910> your<00:03:21.420> weight<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.840> going<00:03:21.959> up

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
is getting worse your weight is going up

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.680 
is getting worse your weight is going up
and<00:03:23.220> eventually<00:03:23.820> you're<00:03:24.150> it's<00:03:24.329> kind<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.570> like

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
and eventually you're it's kind of like

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.420 
and eventually you're it's kind of like
a<00:03:24.720> you're<00:03:25.230> stretching<00:03:25.650> yourself<00:03:25.920> too<00:03:26.400> thin

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
a you're stretching yourself too thin

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.090 
a you're stretching yourself too thin
it's<00:03:26.970> opposing<00:03:27.810> things<00:03:28.110> with<00:03:28.620> bodyweight

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
it's opposing things with bodyweight

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.210 
it's opposing things with bodyweight
training<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.970> opposite<00:03:30.750> ok<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.890> want

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
training it's the opposite ok you want

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.819 
training it's the opposite ok you want
better<00:03:32.519> more<00:03:33.180> resistance<00:03:33.780> on<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:33.989> muscle<00:03:34.380> you

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
better more resistance on a muscle you

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.740 
better more resistance on a muscle you
get<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.190> from<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.549> technical<00:03:35.820> standpoint<00:03:36.360> you

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
get it from a technical standpoint you

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.270 
get it from a technical standpoint you
don't<00:03:36.930> add<00:03:37.200> weight<00:03:37.590> course<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:37.950> can<00:03:38.130> add

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
don't add weight course you can add

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.660 
don't add weight course you can add
weight<00:03:38.459> if<00:03:38.579> you<00:03:38.670> like<00:03:38.959> but<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.980> know<00:03:41.010> it's<00:03:41.370> it

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
weight if you like but you know it's it

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.190 
weight if you like but you know it's it
goes<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:41.970> other<00:03:42.180> way<00:03:42.420> your<00:03:42.660> technique<00:03:43.049> is

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
goes the other way your technique is

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.110 
goes the other way your technique is
better<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.620> resistance<00:03:44.130> gets<00:03:44.340> harder<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
better the resistance gets harder the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.400 
better the resistance gets harder the
technique<00:03:45.510> gets<00:03:45.690> better<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.989> resistance

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
technique gets better the resistance

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.930 
technique gets better the resistance
gets<00:03:46.530> harder<00:03:46.829> so<00:03:47.010> they're<00:03:47.190> constantly

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
gets harder so they're constantly

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.030 
gets harder so they're constantly
pushing<00:03:48.209> against<00:03:48.989> each<00:03:49.079> other<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.470> if<00:03:49.739> you

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
pushing against each other so if you

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.680 
pushing against each other so if you
want<00:03:50.310> more<00:03:50.489> resistance<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.329> are<00:03:51.420> earned

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
want more resistance you that are earned

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.210 
want more resistance you that are earned
that<00:03:52.049> resistance<00:03:52.530> you've<00:03:52.680> got<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:52.860> be<00:03:52.920> worthy

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
that resistance you've got to be worthy

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.220 
that resistance you've got to be worthy
of<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.489> resistance<00:03:53.940> acquiring<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.840> balance

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
of that resistance acquiring the balance

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.080 
of that resistance acquiring the balance
in<00:03:55.350> this<00:03:55.440> coordination<00:03:56.220> in<00:03:56.340> order<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:56.730> handle

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
in this coordination in order to handle

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.030 
in this coordination in order to handle
that<00:03:57.209> kind<00:03:57.360> of<00:03:57.450> resistance<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.590> instead<00:03:58.980> of

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
that kind of resistance so instead of

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.190 
that kind of resistance so instead of
two<00:03:59.670> things<00:04:00.000> opposing<00:04:00.510> each<00:04:00.630> other<00:04:00.810> they're

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
two things opposing each other they're

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.479 
two things opposing each other they're
actually<00:04:01.620> coming<00:04:01.799> together<00:04:02.040> they're

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
actually coming together they're

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.060 
actually coming together they're
converging<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:03.900> can<00:04:04.079> constantly<00:04:04.560> be

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
converging so that you can constantly be

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.310 
converging so that you can constantly be
getting<00:04:05.280> better<00:04:05.519> technique<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.320> more

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
getting better technique and more

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.110 
getting better technique and more
resistance<00:04:07.859> and<00:04:08.040> then<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.430> last<00:04:08.579> thing<00:04:08.880> there

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
resistance and then the last thing there

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.559 
resistance and then the last thing there
is<00:04:09.359> I<00:04:09.540> can<00:04:09.900> ease

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
is I can ease

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.949 
is I can ease
bring<00:04:10.900> an<00:04:11.109> insane<00:04:11.859> amount<00:04:12.189> of<00:04:12.549> resistance<00:04:13.329> to

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
bring an insane amount of resistance to

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.039 
bring an insane amount of resistance to
any<00:04:14.200> major<00:04:14.650> muscle<00:04:15.280> group<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:15.999> I've<00:04:16.090> got<00:04:16.299> you

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
any major muscle group that I've got you

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.050 
any major muscle group that I've got you
know<00:04:17.169> it's<00:04:17.410> all<00:04:17.590> about<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.979> technique<00:04:18.459> so<00:04:19.030> I

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
know it's all about that technique so I

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.759 
know it's all about that technique so I
can<00:04:19.359> be<00:04:19.570> in<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.750> push-ups<00:04:20.109> or<00:04:20.259> doing<00:04:20.650> an

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
can be in a push-ups or doing an

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.529 
can be in a push-ups or doing an
exercise<00:04:21.160> and<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.430> can<00:04:21.579> just<00:04:21.759> shift<00:04:21.940> myself<00:04:22.449> a

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
exercise and I can just shift myself a

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.469 
exercise and I can just shift myself a
little<00:04:22.660> bit<00:04:22.840> Hey<00:04:23.440> as<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:24.310> can<00:04:24.460> insane<00:04:25.000> amount<00:04:25.389> of

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
little bit Hey as I can insane amount of

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.600 
little bit Hey as I can insane amount of
intention<00:04:26.080> going<00:04:26.350> through<00:04:26.500> that<00:04:26.590> muscle<00:04:26.800> way

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
intention going through that muscle way

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.300 
intention going through that muscle way
more<00:04:28.000> than<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.780> know<00:04:28.900> if<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.320> put<00:04:29.590> like<00:04:29.919> a<00:04:29.949> lot

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
more than you know if I put like a lot

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.159 
more than you know if I put like a lot
of<00:04:30.340> weight<00:04:30.580> on<00:04:30.789> a<00:04:30.910> bar<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.750> know<00:04:31.840> it's<00:04:31.930> like<00:04:32.020> I

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
of weight on a bar you know it's like I

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.810 
of weight on a bar you know it's like I
kind<00:04:32.440> of<00:04:32.530> warm<00:04:32.770> up<00:04:32.889> I<00:04:33.099> kind<00:04:33.220> of<00:04:33.340> really<00:04:33.610> think

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
kind of warm up I kind of really think

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.640 
kind of warm up I kind of really think
about<00:04:33.880> this<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.449> you<00:04:34.660> know<00:04:35.110> we<00:04:35.289> really<00:04:35.410> got<00:04:35.530> to

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
about this and you know we really got to

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.950 
about this and you know we really got to
get<00:04:35.860> pumped<00:04:36.130> up<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.550> saved<00:04:36.789> up<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.389> then<00:04:37.599> you

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
get pumped up and saved up and then you

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.810 
get pumped up and saved up and then you
know<00:04:38.110> it's<00:04:38.470> like<00:04:38.530> do<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.770> want<00:04:39.099> ten<00:04:39.370> more<00:04:39.580> paths

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
know it's like do I want ten more paths

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.420 
know it's like do I want ten more paths
you<00:04:40.810> know<00:04:40.840> it's<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.080> process<00:04:41.500> I'm<00:04:41.620> gonna<00:04:41.770> take

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
you know it's a process I'm gonna take

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.499 
you know it's a process I'm gonna take
the<00:04:42.520> collars<00:04:42.820> have<00:04:42.970> to<00:04:43.090> put<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.330> weight<00:04:43.479> on

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
the collars have to put the weight on

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.180 
the collars have to put the weight on
all<00:04:44.020> these<00:04:44.169> sorts<00:04:44.380> of<00:04:44.440> things<00:04:44.500> by<00:04:45.009> the<00:04:45.070> way

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
all these sorts of things by the way

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.370 
all these sorts of things by the way
it's<00:04:45.430> so<00:04:45.729> easy<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.300> push<00:04:46.630> yourself<00:04:46.750> to<00:04:47.349> a

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
it's so easy to push yourself to a

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.320 
it's so easy to push yourself to a
ridiculously<00:04:48.130> high<00:04:48.400> level<00:04:48.759> of<00:04:48.880> intensity

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
ridiculously high level of intensity

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.360 
ridiculously high level of intensity
that<00:04:49.960> is<00:04:50.139> shift<00:04:50.560> a<00:04:50.680> little<00:04:50.800> bit<00:04:50.949> and<00:04:51.099> all<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:51.340> a

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
that is shift a little bit and all of a

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.920 
that is shift a little bit and all of a
sudden<00:04:51.639> the<00:04:51.699> muscles<00:04:52.030> are<00:04:52.150> working<00:04:52.300> far

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
sudden the muscles are working far

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.230 
sudden the muscles are working far
harder<00:04:53.320> than<00:04:53.500> I<00:04:53.620> can<00:04:53.800> possibly<00:04:53.949> withstand<00:04:54.430> so

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
harder than I can possibly withstand so

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.540 
harder than I can possibly withstand so
it's<00:04:55.660> a<00:04:55.810> really<00:04:56.139> easy<00:04:56.289> way<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.800> work<00:04:57.130> out<00:04:57.280> in

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
it's a really easy way to work out in

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.460 
it's a really easy way to work out in
signaling<00:04:58.150> intensely<00:04:58.539> when<00:04:58.870> you<00:04:59.020> have<00:04:59.259> the

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
signaling intensely when you have the

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.159 
signaling intensely when you have the
skills<00:04:59.770> down<00:05:00.430> so<00:05:01.060> there's<00:05:01.419> three<00:05:01.690> advantages

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
skills down so there's three advantages

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.240 
skills down so there's three advantages
muscle<00:05:02.500> building<00:05:02.680> advantages<00:05:03.160> of

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
muscle building advantages of
