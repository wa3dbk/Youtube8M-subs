fourth snowing us a devil snow and it's

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.660 
fourth snowing us a devil snow and it's
also<00:04:05.800> from<00:04:06.100> 78<00:04:06.670> that's<00:04:07.450> minor<00:04:07.810> 7<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.470> 8<00:04:08.670> so

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
also from 78 that's minor 7 to 8 so

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.030 
also from 78 that's minor 7 to 8 so
that's<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.060> race<00:04:10.270> 7th<00:04:10.810> which<00:04:11.380> is<00:04:11.530> also<00:04:11.740> known

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
that's the race 7th which is also known

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.530 
that's the race 7th which is also known
in<00:04:12.070> classical<00:04:12.670> music<00:04:12.970> as<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.480> harmonic<00:04:14.440> minor

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
in classical music as the harmonic minor

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.479 
in classical music as the harmonic minor
so<00:04:16.540> it's<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.750> harmonic<00:04:17.200> minor<00:04:17.489> derivative

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
so it's the harmonic minor derivative

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.810 
so it's the harmonic minor derivative
verse<00:04:18.700> drawn<00:04:19.450> from<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:20.010> so<00:04:21.010> it's<00:04:21.310> like<00:04:21.580> we're

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
verse drawn from that so it's like we're

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.170 
verse drawn from that so it's like we're
