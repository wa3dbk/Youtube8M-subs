Punk<00:02:48.270> than<00:02:48.450> he<00:02:48.540> actually<00:02:48.690> had<00:02:49.080> at<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.410> time<00:02:49.440> of

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
Punk than he actually had at the time of

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.220 
Punk than he actually had at the time of
the<00:02:49.860> event<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.790> I'm<00:02:50.880> just<00:02:51.060> going<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.240> fix<00:02:52.050> up

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the event so I'm just going to fix up

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.390 
the event so I'm just going to fix up
the<00:02:52.350> eyebrows<00:02:52.770> because<00:02:52.980> they're<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> little

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
the eyebrows because they're a little

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.890 
the eyebrows because they're a little
stuff<00:02:53.700> then<00:02:53.970> I'm<00:02:54.030> going<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.209> add<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.390> goatee

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
stuff then I'm going to add a goatee

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.880 
stuff then I'm going to add a goatee
because<00:02:55.740> it<00:02:55.920> looks<00:02:56.070> like<00:02:57.380> his<00:02:58.380> goatees<00:02:58.860> a

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
because it looks like his goatees a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.060 
because it looks like his goatees a
little<00:02:59.400> darker<00:02:59.850> than<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.180> rest<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:01.070> hair

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
little darker than the rest of the hair

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.610 
little darker than the rest of the hair
on<00:03:02.130> his<00:03:02.340> face<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.870> think<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.290> might<00:03:04.470> be<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
on his face so I think that might be the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.960 
on his face so I think that might be the
best<00:03:04.739> route<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.190> go<00:03:05.220> even<00:03:05.610> though<00:03:05.790> it's<00:03:05.910> not

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
best route to go even though it's not

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.330 
best route to go even though it's not
that<00:03:06.239> dark<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.780> picture<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.440> think<00:03:08.190> it'll

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
that dark in this picture I think it'll

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.460 
that dark in this picture I think it'll
improve<00:03:08.550> things<00:03:09.120> over<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.630> way<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.230> punk

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
improve things over the way the punk

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.350 
improve things over the way the punk
figure<00:03:10.800> currently<00:03:11.340> looks

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.450 

I<00:03:16.420> already<00:03:17.380> put<00:03:17.620> some<00:03:17.800> seal<00:03:18.010> around<00:03:18.160> his

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
I already put some seal around his

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.700 
I already put some seal around his
eyebrows<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.000> goatee<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:19.990> we'll<00:03:20.200> see<00:03:20.530> how<00:03:20.680> it

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
eyebrows and goatee so we'll see how it

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:54.100 
eyebrows and goatee so we'll see how it
comes<00:03:21.400> out<00:03:21.790> with<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.060> little<00:03:22.300> paint<00:03:22.540> on<00:03:22.720> there

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:03.460 

wrong<00:03:55.110> people

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:54.630 

you

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.310 

all<00:04:55.640> right<00:04:55.820> guys<00:04:55.970> looks<00:04:56.720> like<00:04:56.870> this<00:04:57.020> is<00:04:57.080> about

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
all right guys looks like this is about

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:05.110 
all right guys looks like this is about
the<00:04:57.470> best<00:04:57.590> that<00:04:57.800> can<00:04:57.890> be<00:04:57.950> done

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.659 

I<00:05:05.380> painted<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.470> goatee<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:06.889> the<00:05:07.220> eyebrows

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
I painted the goatee and the eyebrows

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.420 
I painted the goatee and the eyebrows
and<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.090> lip<00:05:08.240> ring<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:09.260> it<00:05:09.500> brought<00:05:09.830> it<00:05:09.949> made

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
and the lip ring and it brought it made

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.670 
and the lip ring and it brought it made
to<00:05:10.550> look<00:05:10.669> a<00:05:10.729> little<00:05:10.820> bit<00:05:10.940> better<00:05:11.150> but<00:05:14.680> there's

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
to look a little bit better but there's

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.530 
to look a little bit better but there's
not<00:05:15.800> really<00:05:15.979> much<00:05:16.160> else<00:05:16.220> you<00:05:16.490> can<00:05:16.580> do<00:05:16.820> I<00:05:17.060> think

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
not really much else you can do I think

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.700 
not really much else you can do I think
the<00:05:17.630> only<00:05:17.720> other<00:05:17.930> thing<00:05:17.990> you<00:05:18.199> could<00:05:18.350> really<00:05:18.500> do

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
the only other thing you could really do

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.870 
the only other thing you could really do
that<00:05:18.740> fixes<00:05:19.460> scan<00:05:19.729> would<00:05:20.690> be<00:05:20.960> to<00:05:21.169> uh<00:05:21.880> actually

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
that fixes scan would be to uh actually

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.280 
that fixes scan would be to uh actually
shaved<00:05:23.449> down<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:23.960> beard<00:05:24.260> quite<00:05:24.500> a<00:05:24.530> bit<00:05:26.290> I'll

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
shaved down the beard quite a bit I'll

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.409 
shaved down the beard quite a bit I'll
go<00:05:27.590> back<00:05:27.800> to<00:05:27.949> the<00:05:28.040> screen<00:05:28.280> he<00:05:28.729> really<00:05:29.090> doesn't

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
go back to the screen he really doesn't

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:30.909 
go back to the screen he really doesn't
have<00:05:29.449> very<00:05:29.660> much<00:05:29.900> hair<00:05:30.139> on<00:05:30.169> his<00:05:30.380> head<00:05:30.410> at<00:05:30.710> all

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
have very much hair on his head at all

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.200 
have very much hair on his head at all
from<00:05:31.699> WrestleMania<00:05:32.330> so<00:05:33.760> overall<00:05:34.760> I<00:05:34.790> think<00:05:34.970> it

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
from WrestleMania so overall I think it

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.490 
from WrestleMania so overall I think it
came<00:05:35.330> out<00:05:35.449> good<00:05:35.630> I<00:05:35.810> think<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.080> looks<00:05:36.260> much

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
came out good I think it looks much

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.140 
came out good I think it looks much
better<00:05:36.680> than<00:05:36.919> it<00:05:37.070> did<00:05:37.220> but<00:05:37.789> I'm<00:05:37.940> probably

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
better than it did but I'm probably

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.779 
better than it did but I'm probably
still<00:05:38.360> gonna<00:05:38.600> throw<00:05:38.870> it<00:05:38.960> up<00:05:39.050> on<00:05:39.139> the<00:05:39.289> ebay<00:05:39.789> so

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
still gonna throw it up on the ebay so

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:47.170 
still gonna throw it up on the ebay so
what<00:05:43.000> there's<00:05:44.000> my<00:05:44.210> version<00:05:44.660> and<00:05:45.970> there's<00:05:46.970> how

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
what there's my version and there's how

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.689 
what there's my version and there's how
we<00:05:47.240> looked<00:05:47.539> at<00:05:47.690> WrestleMania<00:05:48.139> 29<00:05:48.470> I<00:05:49.039> think

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
we looked at WrestleMania 29 I think

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.180 
we looked at WrestleMania 29 I think
it's<00:05:49.820> not<00:05:49.940> too<00:05:50.090> bad<00:05:50.530> it's<00:05:51.530> really<00:05:51.680> only<00:05:51.949> so

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
it's not too bad it's really only so

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.250 
it's not too bad it's really only so
