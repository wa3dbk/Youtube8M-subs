I'm basically just going to show you the

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.820 
I'm basically just going to show you the
big<00:00:11.490> boy<00:00:11.700> scx<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.690> know<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.349> guys<00:00:13.469> have<00:00:13.530> seen<00:00:13.710> it

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
big boy scx I know you guys have seen it

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.160 
big boy scx I know you guys have seen it
in<00:00:13.889> pictures<00:00:14.040> but<00:00:14.839> figured<00:00:15.839> I'd<00:00:15.960> shoot<00:00:16.109> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
in pictures but figured I'd shoot a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.540 
in pictures but figured I'd shoot a
little<00:00:16.350> video<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:18.619> this<00:00:19.619> paint<00:00:19.890> actually

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
little video of it this paint actually

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.060 
little video of it this paint actually
was<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> complete<00:00:21.539> total<00:00:21.779> accident<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.769> went

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
was a complete total accident I went

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.560 
was a complete total accident I went
with<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:24.500> believe<00:00:25.500> those<00:00:26.449> duplicated<00:00:27.449> eyes

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
with a believe those duplicated eyes

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.589 
with a believe those duplicated eyes
paint<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.519> I<00:00:29.519> figured<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.300> would<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.480> been

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
paint and I figured it would have been

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.590 
paint and I figured it would have been
solid<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.949> see<00:00:32.329> you<00:00:33.329> can<00:00:33.450> look

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
solid but as you can see you can look

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.850 
solid but as you can see you can look
right<00:00:33.899> down<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.469> everything<00:00:34.649> which<00:00:34.829> is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
right down and see everything which is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.400 
right down and see everything which is
kind<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.280> cool<00:00:35.340> because<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.329> adds<00:00:36.540> looking<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
kind of cool because it adds looking to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.160 
kind of cool because it adds looking to
granite<00:00:37.770> heads<00:00:37.950> almost<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:39.140> like<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
granite heads almost like a like a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.869 
granite heads almost like a like a
ground<00:00:40.620> effect<00:00:40.980> look<00:00:41.190> when<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> Sun<00:00:41.730> would

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
ground effect look when the Sun would

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.130 
ground effect look when the Sun would
filter<00:00:42.090> through<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.480> when<00:00:42.600> you're<00:00:42.719> running<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
filter through it when you're running it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.420 
filter through it when you're running it
and<00:00:44.840> this<00:00:45.840> body<00:00:46.170> originally<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.309> going

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and this body originally was just going

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.130 
and this body originally was just going
to<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> throw<00:00:47.879> together<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.930> ended

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
to be a throw together one and I ended

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.819 
to be a throw together one and I ended
up<00:00:49.260> spending<00:00:49.590> about<00:00:50.629> got<00:00:51.629> five<00:00:51.989> six<00:00:52.289> hours<00:00:52.620> on

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
up spending about got five six hours on

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.400 
up spending about got five six hours on
it<00:00:52.860> working<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.870> between<00:00:54.870> cutting<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.289> out

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
it working on it between cutting it out

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.069 
it working on it between cutting it out
and<00:00:55.820> modified<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> rear<00:00:57.149> cage<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.750> don't<00:00:57.899> have

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and modified the rear cage I don't have

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.060 
and modified the rear cage I don't have
the<00:00:58.260> upper<00:00:58.649> assembly<00:00:58.890> I've<00:00:59.309> got<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:01.070> cut

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the upper assembly I've got it but I cut

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.920 
the upper assembly I've got it but I cut
it<00:01:02.190> off<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.579> back<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.570> took<00:01:03.750> my

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
it off on the back here and just took my

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.479 
it off on the back here and just took my
other<00:01:04.049> body<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.769> nicer<00:01:05.280> one

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
other body and have this nicer one

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.920 
other body and have this nicer one
because<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> other<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.360> need<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> holes

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
because the other one need a holes

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.289 
because the other one need a holes
drilled<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.530> everything<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.240> it

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
drilled and everything but I think it

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.060 
drilled and everything but I think it
looks<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.510> little<00:01:09.659> better<00:01:09.930> without<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
looks a little better without the the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.090 
looks a little better without the the
full<00:01:11.280> cage<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> back<00:01:12.119> plus<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> big<00:01:12.720> duels

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
full cage on the back plus the big duels

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.039 
full cage on the back plus the big duels
but<00:01:14.100> what<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.310> want<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> show<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.850> guys<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.180> look

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
but what I want to show you guys is look

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.140 
but what I want to show you guys is look
at<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.290> look<00:01:16.530> how<00:01:16.590> crazy<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.970> see

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
at that look how crazy that is you see

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.810 
at that look how crazy that is you see
in<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.390> look<00:01:18.720> at<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.610> that<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.790> just

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
in that look at that that is just

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.630 
in that look at that that is just
ridiculous<00:01:21.950> even<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> four-link<00:01:23.520> I

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
ridiculous even with the four-link I

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.920 
ridiculous even with the four-link I
might<00:01:23.880> actually<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.479> put<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> set<00:01:24.840> of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
might actually have to put a set of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.469 
might actually have to put a set of
Springs<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.549> but<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.729> does<00:01:26.970> compress

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
Springs on it but it does compress

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.170 
Springs on it but it does compress
really<00:01:27.930> well<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.409> back<00:01:28.729> allows<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:30.000> great

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
really well on the back allows for great

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.090 
really well on the back allows for great
articulation<00:01:30.479> where<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> front<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.470> rather<00:01:31.770> a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
articulation where the front is rather a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.149 
articulation where the front is rather a
little<00:01:33.000> bit<00:01:33.090> stiffer<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.720> still<00:01:34.200> flex<00:01:35.009> is

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
little bit stiffer but still flex is

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.200 
little bit stiffer but still flex is
pretty<00:01:35.430> good<00:01:36.350> now<00:01:37.729> this<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.119> be<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
pretty good now this is going to be a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.580 
pretty good now this is going to be a
quick<00:01:39.450> video<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> show

axle is going to be this piece of
threaded<00:04:17.580> rod<00:04:18.080> which<00:04:19.080> I<00:04:19.470> made<00:04:19.830> very<00:04:20.220> careful

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
threaded rod which I made very careful

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.840 
threaded rod which I made very careful
that<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:20.970> was<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.270> same<00:04:21.479> size<00:04:21.840> threaded<00:04:22.410> rod

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
that it was the same size threaded rod

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.970 
that it was the same size threaded rod
that<00:04:23.850> is<00:04:23.880> used<00:04:24.270> on<00:04:24.479> the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
that is used on the

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.640 
that is used on the
axles<00:04:26.450> so<00:04:27.450> I<00:04:27.480> should<00:04:27.690> have<00:04:27.810> no<00:04:28.020> issues<00:04:28.440> when<00:04:28.560> it

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
axles so I should have no issues when it
