want<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:03.959> talk<00:00:04.170> about<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.879> secondary<00:00:05.879> mesh

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
want to talk about is a secondary mesh

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.570 
want to talk about is a secondary mesh
pack<00:00:06.770> there<00:00:07.770> are<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.890> lot<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.040> different

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
kinds this is the one I see a lot in

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.349 
kinds this is the one I see a lot in
industry<00:00:24.630> where<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:26.029> manufacturer<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.180> see

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
industry where a manufacturer and I see

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.640 
industry where a manufacturer and I see
this<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> lot<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.140> cylindrical

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
this a lot in the cylindrical

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.120 
this a lot in the cylindrical
below-ground<00:00:29.550> market<00:00:30.119> where<00:00:31.130> low-cost

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
below-ground market where low-cost

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.830 
below-ground market where low-cost
market<00:00:32.700> where<00:00:32.850> they<00:00:32.969> put<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> primary

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
market where they put a primary

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.110 
market where they put a primary
coalescer<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> primary<00:00:35.250> coalescer<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
coalescer in the primary coalescer is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.639 
coalescer in the primary coalescer is
doing<00:00:36.450> not<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> whole<00:00:36.899> lot<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.230> work<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.500> they're

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
doing not a whole lot of work so they're

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.729 
doing not a whole lot of work so they're
counting<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:39.420> secondary<00:00:39.960> coalesce<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.620> do

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
counting on the secondary coalesce to do

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.910 
counting on the secondary coalesce to do
the<00:00:40.920> work<00:00:41.300> here's<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> here's<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.050> small

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the work here's a here's a small

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.819 
the work here's a here's a small
coalescer<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.640> brought<00:00:44.850> along<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.300> show<00:00:45.510> you

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
coalescer I brought along to show you

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.740 
coalescer I brought along to show you
this<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> small<00:00:47.489> coalescer<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.480> would<00:00:48.629> be

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
this is a small coalescer this would be

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.690 
this is a small coalescer this would be
the<00:00:48.899> entry<00:00:49.230> area<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.590> coalescer<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.460> so

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the entry area the coalescer here so

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.279 
the entry area the coalescer here so
your<00:00:50.879> waste<00:00:51.059> water<00:00:51.329> would<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:51.719> through<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
your waste water would go through and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.340 
your waste water would go through and
the<00:00:52.800> idea<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.250> very<00:00:53.699> similar<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.510> vtc<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the idea is very similar to the vtc the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.260 
the idea is very similar to the vtc the
vertical<00:00:55.770> tube<00:00:56.010> coalescer<00:00:56.640> we're<00:00:56.789> instead<00:00:57.090> of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
vertical tube coalescer we're instead of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.709 
vertical tube coalescer we're instead of
by<00:00:57.420> Stokes<00:00:57.899> law<00:00:58.230> removal<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.059> oil<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.449> one

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
by Stokes law removal of oil this one

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.460 
by Stokes law removal of oil this one
again<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.170> by<00:01:02.329> attraction<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.449> oil<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.140> these

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
again is by attraction of oil to these

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
again is by attraction of oil to these
polypropylene<00:01:05.460> fibers<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:08.060> you'll<00:01:09.060> note

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
polypropylene fibers now you'll note

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.030 
polypropylene fibers now you'll note
that<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.350> very<00:01:10.830> dense<00:01:12.049> it's<00:01:13.049> very<00:01:13.350> dense

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
that this is very dense it's very dense

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.670 
that this is very dense it's very dense
water<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.700> go<00:01:14.820> through<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.110> soon<00:01:16.380> as

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
water can go through it but as soon as

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.340 
water can go through it but as soon as
oil<00:01:17.340> scum<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.509> theory<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.170> that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
oil scum in here the theory is that

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.130 
oil scum in here the theory is that
they'll<00:01:19.950> coalesce<00:01:20.549> against<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.360> mesh<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
they'll coalesce against this mesh and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.649 
they'll coalesce against this mesh and
the<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.070> oil<00:01:23.100> will<00:01:23.610> slowly<00:01:23.909> work<00:01:24.119> its<00:01:24.479> way<00:01:24.630> up

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
the the oil will slowly work its way up

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.920 
the the oil will slowly work its way up
and<00:01:24.960> out<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> pack<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.369> see<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:27.540> if

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and out of the pack you can see that if

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.840 
and out of the pack you can see that if
this<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.470> case<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.189> any<00:01:29.310> solids

traditional pack out in industry is

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.120 
traditional pack out in industry is

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
about 14 inches thick that I've seen so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.429

to clean that deep into a pack like this
doesn't<00:01:52.920> work<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.430> fact<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.210> solids<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:54.869> hung

doesn't work in fact the solids get hung
up<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.409> here<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.799> badly<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.369> these<00:01:56.759> packs

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
up in here so badly that these packs

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.719 
up in here so badly that these packs
tend<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.110> sag<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> weight<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.460> solids

tend to sag with the weight of solids

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.920 
tend to sag with the weight of solids
and<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.290> removal<00:02:01.829> costs<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:03.090> lot<00:02:03.719> of

and it's just a removal costs a lot of

and it's just a removal costs a lot of
these<00:02:04.020> packs<00:02:04.320> especially<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> plastic<00:02:05.579> packs
