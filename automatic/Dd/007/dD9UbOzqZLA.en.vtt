hello<00:00:00.420> Matt<00:00:00.930> here<00:00:01.230> in<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.010> video<00:00:02.280> I'll<00:00:02.520> be

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hello Matt here in this video I'll be

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.910 
hello Matt here in this video I'll be
showing<00:00:02.909> you<00:00:03.210> how<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.540> supercharge<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.589> dead

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
showing you how to supercharge a dead

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.460 
showing you how to supercharge a dead
drill<00:00:05.339> battery<00:00:05.790> so<00:00:06.569> what<00:00:06.750> we'll<00:00:06.899> be<00:00:07.020> doing<00:00:07.170> is

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
drill battery so what we'll be doing is

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.370 
drill battery so what we'll be doing is
replacing<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.309> dead<00:00:08.790> like<00:00:09.120> ad<00:00:09.450> cells<00:00:09.809> in<00:00:10.170> this

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
replacing the dead like ad cells in this

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.640 
replacing the dead like ad cells in this
drill<00:00:10.650> battery<00:00:11.099> with<00:00:11.670> lithium-ion<00:00:12.660> cells<00:00:13.170> and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
drill battery with lithium-ion cells and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.580 
drill battery with lithium-ion cells and
we'll<00:00:14.040> be<00:00:14.190> adding<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:15.590> semi-automatic

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
we'll be adding a semi-automatic

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.700 
we'll be adding a semi-automatic
protection<00:00:17.460> circuit<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.840> cells

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
protection circuit so that the cells

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.460 
protection circuit so that the cells
don't<00:00:20.100> drop<00:00:20.760> below<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.390> certain<00:00:21.750> voltage<00:00:21.869> level

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
don't drop below a certain voltage level

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.759 
don't drop below a certain voltage level
so<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.340> system<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.699> basically<00:00:24.029> given<00:00:24.869> new

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
so this system is basically given new

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.429 
so this system is basically given new
life<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.340> old<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.449> otherwise<00:00:27.840> decent

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
life to this old but otherwise decent

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.209 
life to this old but otherwise decent
drill<00:00:29.179> so<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.210> don't<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.570> buy<00:00:30.689> new<00:00:30.900> one

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
drill so I don't have to buy new one

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.100 
drill so I don't have to buy new one
it's<00:00:32.219> actually<00:00:32.399> my<00:00:32.640> dad's<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.120> my<00:00:33.660> dad<00:00:33.870> doesn't

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
it's actually my dad's so my dad doesn't

and we'll have to switch on the ground
so<00:03:08.859> that<00:03:08.889> we<00:03:09.129> can<00:03:09.370> turn<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.730> whole<00:03:09.849> thing<00:03:10.120> on

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
so that we can turn the whole thing on

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.990 
so that we can turn the whole thing on
and<00:03:10.480> off<00:03:10.980> adding<00:03:11.980> some<00:03:12.189> tape<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.699> prevent

electronics<00:05:59.980> in<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:00.370> original<00:06:00.850> charger<00:06:01.390> so

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
electronics in the original charger so

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.110 
electronics in the original charger so
that<00:06:02.200> the<00:06:02.350> new<00:06:02.530> lithium-ion<00:06:03.250> cells<00:06:03.700> can<00:06:04.000> be

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
that the new lithium-ion cells can be

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.900 
that the new lithium-ion cells can be
charged<00:06:04.540> with<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:04.990> suitable<00:06:05.410> charger<00:06:05.910> all

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
charged with the suitable charger all

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.970 
charged with the suitable charger all
you<00:06:07.210> have<00:06:07.390> to<00:06:07.540> do<00:06:07.690> is<00:06:07.900> solder<00:06:08.170> some<00:06:08.590> external

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
you have to do is solder some external

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.700 
you have to do is solder some external
wire<00:06:09.460> to<00:06:09.790> the<00:06:09.910> original<00:06:10.390> charges<00:06:10.810> contacts

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
wire to the original charges contacts

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.830 
wire to the original charges contacts
making<00:06:12.520> sure<00:06:12.760> that<00:06:12.940> you<00:06:13.090> have<00:06:13.270> some<00:06:13.510> kind<00:06:13.720> of

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
making sure that you have some kind of

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.970 
making sure that you have some kind of
indicator<00:06:14.320> of<00:06:14.680> the<00:06:14.890> polarity<00:06:16.440> to<00:06:17.440> charge<00:06:17.710> your

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
indicator of the polarity to charge your

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.800 
indicator of the polarity to charge your
new<00:06:18.250> battery<00:06:18.460> you'll<00:06:19.000> need<00:06:19.240> a<00:06:19.270> charger

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
new battery you'll need a charger

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.470 
new battery you'll need a charger
capable<00:06:20.350> of<00:06:20.470> charging<00:06:21.010> lithium<00:06:21.490> cells<00:06:21.790> which

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
capable of charging lithium cells which

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.470 
capable of charging lithium cells which
includes<00:06:22.900> lipo<00:06:23.530> charges<00:06:24.100> if<00:06:24.340> your<00:06:25.000> charger

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
includes lipo charges if your charger

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.750 
includes lipo charges if your charger
has<00:06:25.690> the<00:06:25.840> option<00:06:26.290> change<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.890> voltage<00:06:27.070> type

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
has the option change the voltage type

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.710 
has the option change the voltage type
to<00:06:28.090> Li<00:06:28.390> IO<00:06:29.250> if<00:06:30.250> it<00:06:30.430> doesn't<00:06:30.730> just<00:06:30.940> stick<00:06:31.570> with

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
to Li IO if it doesn't just stick with

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.920 
to Li IO if it doesn't just stick with
lipo<00:06:32.260> as<00:06:32.500> it's<00:06:32.740> close<00:06:32.950> enough<00:06:33.010> not<00:06:33.580> too

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
lipo as it's close enough not too

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.700 
lipo as it's close enough not too
to<00:06:34.130> change<00:06:35.130> its<00:06:35.400> mode<00:06:35.669> to<00:06:36.090> 4s<00:06:36.750> which<00:06:37.320> stands

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
to change its mode to 4s which stands

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.120 
to change its mode to 4s which stands
for<00:06:37.889> four<00:06:38.639> in<00:06:38.910> series<00:06:39.479> and<00:06:39.720> change<00:06:40.680> the<00:06:40.889> rate

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
for four in series and change the rate

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.820 
for four in series and change the rate
to<00:06:41.520> a<00:06:41.550> conservative<00:06:42.300> 1m<00:06:42.930> you<00:06:43.410> can<00:06:43.590> increase

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
to a conservative 1m you can increase

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.650 
to a conservative 1m you can increase
the<00:06:44.100> am<00:06:44.190> throat<00:06:44.550> to<00:06:44.789> whatever<00:06:45.000> the<00:06:45.330> battery

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
the am throat to whatever the battery

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
the am throat to whatever the battery
will<00:06:45.870> take<00:06:46.169> without<00:06:46.710> it<00:06:46.889> getting<00:06:47.100> too<00:06:47.430> warm

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
will take without it getting too warm

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.050 
will take without it getting too warm
make<00:06:49.680> sure<00:06:49.919> that<00:06:50.130> you<00:06:50.250> turn<00:06:50.430> the<00:06:50.580> battery<00:06:50.759> on

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
make sure that you turn the battery on

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.150 
make sure that you turn the battery on
when<00:06:51.389> you're<00:06:51.539> charging<00:06:52.050> it<00:06:52.169> and<00:06:52.380> take<00:06:52.919> care

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
when you're charging it and take care

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.920 
when you're charging it and take care
when<00:06:53.370> hooking<00:06:53.729> it<00:06:53.880> up<00:06:54.000> to<00:06:54.060> the<00:06:54.330> charger<00:06:54.780> so

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
when hooking it up to the charger so

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.120 
when hooking it up to the charger so
that<00:06:55.199> you<00:06:55.380> don't<00:06:55.590> get<00:06:55.800> the<00:06:55.979> polarity<00:06:56.490> mixed<00:06:56.850> up

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
that you don't get the polarity mixed up

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.370 
that you don't get the polarity mixed up
so<00:06:59.130> now<00:06:59.310> your<00:06:59.550> drill<00:06:59.940> should<00:07:00.389> last<00:07:00.690> longer<00:07:01.050> and

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
so now your drill should last longer and

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.840 
so now your drill should last longer and
be<00:07:02.039> more<00:07:02.699> powerful<00:07:03.180> than<00:07:03.479> it<00:07:03.600> was<00:07:03.720> before<00:07:03.960> and

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 
be more powerful than it was before and

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.249 
be more powerful than it was before and
so<00:07:05.850> yeah<00:07:06.240> give<00:07:06.449> it<00:07:06.539> a<00:07:06.570> go<00:07:06.720> it's<00:07:06.990> worthwhile

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 
so yeah give it a go it's worthwhile

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:10.939 
so yeah give it a go it's worthwhile
especially<00:07:07.910> seeing<00:07:08.910> as<00:07:09.060> it's<00:07:09.240> so<00:07:09.419> cheap<00:07:09.949> here

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
especially seeing as it's so cheap here

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.950 
especially seeing as it's so cheap here
are<00:07:11.130> some<00:07:11.400> other<00:07:11.699> videos<00:07:12.030> that<00:07:12.539> you<00:07:12.630> might<00:07:12.780> be

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
are some other videos that you might be

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.960 
are some other videos that you might be
interested<00:07:13.050> in<00:07:13.470> and<00:07:13.620> hopefully<00:07:14.370> I'll<00:07:14.580> see<00:07:14.940> you

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:14.970 
interested in and hopefully I'll see you

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.349 
interested in and hopefully I'll see you
next<00:07:15.330> time<00:07:15.539> draw
