00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:29.000
 It is a lot of course this time 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.460
 superficially as a theme of strangeness 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.590
 the piece is built on it 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.559
 that is an issue that is clearly the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.640
 main character othello also concerns 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.190
 of course, also because of his skin color 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.750
 which clearly makes him a stranger but 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.030
 that also affects the other characters 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.770
 So it is generally the case that the figures 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.410
 can not really find each other 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.239
 that they make each other out before them 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.030
 be someone other than you in 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.960
 Reality is and is therefore also 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.960
 everyone isolated for themselves 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.250
 when I first read the piece 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.240
 I have my eyes right at one 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.240
 stuck 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.260
 kss camera would be translated roughly 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.900
 I love her and if I do not love her 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.460
 more love, the chaos comes back and 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.369
 we asked ourselves what is this 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.020
 chaos that lives in him and with fear 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.640
 has that it could break out again 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.470
 That's why we have more specific 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.570
 asked and have different 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.700
 found the clear on it 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.280
 point out that othello already in the past 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.140
 childhood has experienced war and fought 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.270
 has and has come to think that he 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.729
 probably served as a child soldier 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.200
 has to go in black africa the water 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.560
 assuming that someone is one 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.959
 war trauma carries in him that he over 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.550
 the largest part of the piece is created 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.739
 but suppress that memory 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.900
 Break yourself and also 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.500
 partly because of the murder of that 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.500
 mona happens 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.410
 in a square work it is like that 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.450
 that I was solely due to 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.310
 I worked improvisations were no 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.640
 Movements before really every move 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.590
 every dance language you talk to in the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.780
 piece looks is in cooperation with 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.150
 the dances were created and is from her 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.150
 own input has been put together
