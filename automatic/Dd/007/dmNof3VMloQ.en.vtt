how<00:00:39.930> does<00:00:40.110> HP<00:00:40.260> actually<00:00:40.710> accomplish<00:00:41.190> this

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
how does HP actually accomplish this

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.730 
how does HP actually accomplish this
first<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> double<00:00:42.750> swath<00:00:42.990> technology

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
first we have a double swath technology

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.680 
first we have a double swath technology
meaning<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.220> each<00:00:44.430> pass<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.240> printhead

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
meaning that each pass of the printhead

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.870 
meaning that each pass of the printhead
drops<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.470> point<00:00:46.710> six<00:00:46.950> seven<00:00:47.130> inches<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> each

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
drops one point six seven inches of each

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.970 
drops one point six seven inches of each
some<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.810> the<00:00:48.870> competing<00:00:49.170> devices<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
some of the competing devices in the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.330 
some of the competing devices in the
industry<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:51.150> swathes<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.690> 1.07<00:00:52.620> inches<00:00:53.070> or

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
industry have swathes of 1.07 inches or

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.330 
industry have swathes of 1.07 inches or
one<00:00:53.940> inch<00:00:54.150> a<00:00:54.480> wider<00:00:54.780> swath<00:00:55.170> allows<00:00:55.740> us<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.130> take

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
one inch a wider swath allows us to take

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.830 
one inch a wider swath allows us to take
fewer<00:00:56.579> print<00:00:56.910> passes<00:00:57.300> which<00:00:57.510> drives

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
fewer print passes which drives

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.470 
fewer print passes which drives
production<00:00:58.770> level<00:00:59.070> speeds<00:00:59.310> the<00:01:00.030> second<00:01:00.360> item

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
production level speeds the second item

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.510 
production level speeds the second item
is<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.900> use<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> optical<00:01:01.560> media<00:01:02.040> advance

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
is we use the optical media advance

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.420 
is we use the optical media advance
sensor<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.540> this<00:01:03.690> technology<00:01:04.280> maintains<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
sensor so this technology maintains a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.450 
sensor so this technology maintains a

consistent registering of the media with

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.120 
consistent registering of the media with
the<00:01:08.579> writing<00:01:08.939> system<00:01:09.179> so<00:01:09.780> each<00:01:09.990> pass<00:01:10.679> it's

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the writing system so each pass it's

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.669 
the writing system so each pass it's
optimized<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.909> ensure<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.270> each<00:01:12.630> drop<00:01:13.499> of
