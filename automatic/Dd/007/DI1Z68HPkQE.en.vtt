and<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> think<00:01:32.610> bright<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> Potter<00:01:33.420> does<00:01:34.409> a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and I think bright and Potter does a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.499 
and I think bright and Potter does a
spot<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.040> job<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:36.030> he's<00:01:36.119> doing<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.390> great

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
spot on job I think he's doing a great

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.719 
spot on job I think he's doing a great
job<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.320> grunt<00:01:37.560> sounds<00:01:37.950> great<00:01:38.159> he<00:01:38.250> has<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> deep

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
job the grunt sounds great he has a deep

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.219 
job the grunt sounds great he has a deep
voice<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:39.240> lot<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> people<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.840> he<00:01:39.960> has<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
voice a lot of people think he has a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.679 
voice a lot of people think he has a
thick<00:01:40.560> Brooklyn<00:01:41.070> accent<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.360> there

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
thick Brooklyn accent and it is there

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.410 
thick Brooklyn accent and it is there
but<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.680> think<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.310> know<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.640> Lisp<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
but I think you know the Lisp and the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.870 
but I think you know the Lisp and the
slur<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.380> whole<00:01:46.560> accent<00:01:47.130> fits<00:01:47.700> pretty

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
slur and the whole accent fits pretty

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.789 
slur and the whole accent fits pretty
well<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.299> Brandon<00:01:48.899> Potter<00:01:49.170> does<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> good

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
well I think Brandon Potter does a good

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.870 
well I think Brandon Potter does a good
job<00:01:49.860> sounding<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.000> he's<00:01:51.299> deaf<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:53.520> lot<00:01:53.820> of

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
job sounding like he's deaf but a lot of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.510 
job sounding like he's deaf but a lot of
people<00:01:54.060> want<00:01:54.360> him<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.810> more<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.159> not

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
people want him to be more you know not

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.249 
people want him to be more you know not
recognizable<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> can't<00:01:57.810> really<00:01:57.960> hear

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
recognizable but you can't really hear

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.350 
recognizable but you can't really hear
what<00:01:58.380> he's<00:01:58.500> trying<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.979> say<00:01:59.070> or<00:01:59.610> understand<00:02:00.180> it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
what he's trying to say or understand it

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.480 
what he's trying to say or understand it
I<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.560> would<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:01.829> work<00:02:02.159> in

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
I think that would really work in

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.320 
I think that would really work in
English<00:02:02.820> too<00:02:03.000> much<00:02:03.210> because<00:02:03.450> you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
English too much because you

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.540 
English too much because you
hearing<00:02:04.870> is<00:02:04.960> trying<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:05.440> say<00:02:05.680> but<00:02:06.040> at<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.340> same

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
hearing is trying to say but at the same

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.880 
hearing is trying to say but at the same
time<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:07.030> don't<00:02:07.150> want<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.540> be<00:02:07.690> too<00:02:07.890> you

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.940
