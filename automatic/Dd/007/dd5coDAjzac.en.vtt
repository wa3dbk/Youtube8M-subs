00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.710
 where they advise us and I think that does not 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.260
 it's being too late to talk to them 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.060
 of the meeting of youtube mexico 2014 and 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.250
 is that by this time the kiss of 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.630
 chayo and stretch and the photos of marcela and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.180
 beautiful moon and the fact that 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.369
 werevertumorro sauerkraut will win all 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.230
 awards is already more than talked about by 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.029
 true talking about keeping one of 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 you tweeted this picture that appears 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.440
 in the video of him and me alone with this one 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.120
 very fine expression that does not fall in love 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.070
 I say my five minutes of fame had to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.230
 to be worth something not good then to great 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.360
 traits I tell them we reached the boss and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.309
 all of us who came from the province as 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.410
 they tell us in the capital we set out to 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.969
 invade the houses of the chilangos me 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.039
 for my part I went to where for 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.840
 morpho because according to what they told me 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.579
 It was those who lived closer 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.879
 destination of the next day although in the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.100
 df all distance of an hour or less already 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.890
 it's short the next day we got super 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.110
 late to 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.090
 of meeting but good is something of 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.920
 hope delay it gave me great pleasure to see 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.229
 so many new faces and so many faces 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.780
 known and if I could define everything 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.030
 this group of youtubers that we were in 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.140
 the meeting would say that we are like a 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.630
 zoo there are bloggers filmmakers musicians 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.630
 people who drive news there are strawberries 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.790
 rich poor Mexicans hear panelists 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.860
 in short I think that the only thing we have in 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.259
 common is that we are all creative in 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.060
 some good area that they did not have 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.770
 nothing to do in your house of something that 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.210
 I realized that I have to see a 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.190
 little bit more to the bloggers because there 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.110
 many people who did not recognize did not know 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.479
 Who was nobody has been talking to you 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.700
 with rain he has a brother for him and 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.619
 has a brother I think I have many 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.869
 more channels to see as I wanted 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.070
 know quickly everyone has to do 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.740
 a triumphal entry 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.360
 then I fell at the entrance of the truck 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.759
 let's say there were many curves in the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.039
 way and then I felt a little bit wrong 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.670
 when we arrived they separated us in rooms 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.890
 open point 1 and with no curves of 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.479
 reverently I'm still waiting for me 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.800
 open the door the next day was the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.330
 photo of the assistants 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.130
 more or less like a picture of 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.870
 generation but you did not know those of al 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.150
 side and the night was the delivery of the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.450
 awards obviously I win one 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.709
 at the best interest 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.709

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.730

 maximum january awaits your prize in your home 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.510
 u2 but very likely them 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.220
 they encouraged a thousand videos of people 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.400
 receiving their prizes and in the night 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.409

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.269

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.400
 maxi yards so you will not record them but 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.780

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.430
