00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.620 
with the camera and to really work with
that<00:03:14.010> obviously<00:03:14.459> he<00:03:14.940> checked<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.359> was

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
that obviously he checked that I was

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.770 
that obviously he checked that I was
okay<00:03:16.139> as<00:03:16.319> well<00:03:16.769> I'm<00:03:17.130> often<00:03:17.549> crying<00:03:18.150> or<00:03:18.480> about<00:03:18.750> a

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
okay as well I'm often crying or about a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.420 
okay as well I'm often crying or about a
died<00:03:19.079> or<00:03:19.139> something<00:03:19.440> like<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.829> was<00:03:20.130> fine

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
died or something like that I was fine

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.099 
died or something like that I was fine
so<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.180> decided<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.690> make<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.079> a

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
so we just decided to make that a

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.690 
so we just decided to make that a
feature<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.799> images<00:03:23.099> which<00:03:23.220> i<00:03:23.310> think<00:03:23.519> is

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
feature of the images which i think is

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.580 
feature of the images which i think is
really<00:03:23.940> interesting<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.840> hopefully<00:03:25.260> it's

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
really interesting and hopefully it's

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.559 
really interesting and hopefully it's
worked<00:03:25.739> really<00:03:25.799> well<00:03:26.060> as<00:03:27.060> we<00:03:27.269> were<00:03:27.359> filming

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
just now we just noticed that there were

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.460
