00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
let's try an American h2o card similar

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.550 
let's try an American h2o card similar
sort<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.240> thing<00:01:30.420> should<00:01:30.600> happen<00:01:32.930> yep<00:01:33.960> there<00:01:34.470> we

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
sort of thing should happen yep there we

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.940 
sort of thing should happen yep there we
go

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
go

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.770 
go
so<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:36.690> is<00:01:36.840> fully<00:01:37.110> unlocked<00:01:38.390> now<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so this one is fully unlocked now I

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.480 
so this one is fully unlocked now I
noticed<00:01:40.320> pamplets<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.740> had<00:01:40.890> some<00:01:41.070> problems

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
noticed pamplets you had some problems

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.350 
noticed pamplets you had some problems
with<00:01:41.759> some<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.479> his<00:01:42.720> micro<00:01:43.440> tax<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.300> think<00:01:45.300> I

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
with some of his micro tax I think I

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.250 
with some of his micro tax I think I
figured<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.690> way<00:01:45.720> around<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:47.009> unlock<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:48.390> this

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
figured a way around the unlock so this

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.760 
figured a way around the unlock so this
is<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.680> unlocked<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.140> locked

one so let's fire up this one with an
orange<00:01:57.090> SIM<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:02.040> see<00:02:02.340> what<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.640> does

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.340 

there<00:02:25.490> we<00:02:25.580> go<00:02:25.910> picks<00:02:26.090> up<00:02:26.270> cellular<00:02:26.690> service<00:02:27.110> no

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
there we go picks up cellular service no

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
now this one is locked by that I mean it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.650 
now this one is locked by that I mean it
will<00:02:34.430> only<00:02:34.550> accept<00:02:35.140> SIM<00:02:36.140> cards<00:02:36.500> from<00:02:36.890> Orange

will only accept SIM cards from Orange
this<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.840> an<00:02:38.960> old<00:02:39.110> one<00:02:39.320> this<00:02:39.740> is<00:02:39.920> how<00:02:40.070> they<00:02:40.190> used

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
this is an old one this is how they used

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.450 
this is an old one this is how they used

micro<00:02:44.210> Apple<00:02:45.050> SIM<00:02:45.500> card<00:02:45.770> nonsense<00:02:46.640> some<00:02:47.480> cards

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
micro Apple SIM card nonsense some cards

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.920 
micro Apple SIM card nonsense some cards
back<00:02:47.930> then<00:02:48.140> were<00:02:48.290> large<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:49.630> let's<00:02:50.630> try<00:02:50.870> this

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
back then were large so let's try this

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.520 
back then were large so let's try this
again

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
again

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.910 
again
with<00:02:52.160> an<00:02:52.520> h2o<00:02:52.940> SIM<00:02:53.390> card<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:56.500> we<00:02:57.500> should<00:02:57.680> get

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
with an h2o SIM card and we should get

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.700 
with an h2o SIM card and we should get
into<00:02:58.190> specials<00:02:59.180> there<00:02:59.840> we<00:02:59.960> go<00:03:00.110> into<00:03:00.380> special

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
into specials there we go into special

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.180 
into specials there we go into special
code<00:03:01.100> now<00:03:01.450> without<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.630> code<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.650> can't<00:03:03.950> use

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
code now without that code you can't use

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:13.870 
code now without that code you can't use
another<00:03:04.220> SIM<00:03:04.670> card<00:03:09.340> let's<00:03:10.340> try<00:03:12.580> let's<00:03:13.580> try<00:03:13.700> a

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
another SIM card let's try let's try a

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.490 
another SIM card let's try let's try a
bold<00:03:14.150> SIM<00:03:14.420> card<00:03:15.100> just<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.220> make<00:03:16.400> sure

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.979 

nope<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:21.829> need<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.400> have<00:03:22.519> it<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:25.810> I've<00:03:26.810> gone

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
nope I need to have it so I've gone

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.380 
nope I need to have it so I've gone
ahead<00:03:27.049> and<00:03:27.260> programmed<00:03:27.799> up<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:28.730> special<00:03:29.090> SIM

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
ahead and programmed up this special SIM

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.170 
ahead and programmed up this special SIM
card<00:03:30.730> which<00:03:31.730> will<00:03:31.970> put<00:03:32.180> this<00:03:32.329> into<00:03:32.569> test<00:03:32.900> mode

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
card which will put this into test mode

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.309 
card which will put this into test mode
hopefully<00:03:37.209> there<00:03:38.209> we<00:03:38.329> go

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
hopefully there we go

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.229 
hopefully there we go
and<00:03:39.650> this<00:03:39.799> is<00:03:39.950> designed<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.579> remove<00:03:40.970> the

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
and this is designed to remove the

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.270 
and this is designed to remove the
service<00:03:41.599> provider<00:03:41.959> restriction<00:03:43.209> so<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:45.290> go<00:03:45.530> 0

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
service provider restriction so you go 0

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.210 
service provider restriction so you go 0
6

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:59.710 

and<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:54.450> should<00:03:54.720> do<00:03:54.870> it

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:09.320 

so<00:04:00.720> let's<00:04:01.710> try<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:03.600> h2o<00:04:03.990> card<00:04:04.380> again<00:04:08.330> that

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
so let's try the h2o card again that

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.710 
so let's try the h2o card again that
should<00:04:09.540> now<00:04:09.720> go<00:04:09.960> straight<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.410> searching

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
should now go straight to searching

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.930 
should now go straight to searching
there<00:04:12.720> we<00:04:12.810> go<00:04:13.430> isn't<00:04:14.430> obviously<00:04:14.670> going<00:04:14.880> to

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
there we go isn't obviously going to

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.440 
there we go isn't obviously going to
pick<00:04:15.090> up<00:04:15.210> any<00:04:15.360> cellular<00:04:15.690> service<00:04:16.260> here<00:04:17.450> let's

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
pick up any cellular service here let's

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:35.030 
pick up any cellular service here let's
try<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:19.160> singular<00:04:20.160> card<00:04:28.910> there<00:04:29.910> we<00:04:30.030> go<00:04:33.770> in<00:04:34.770> fact

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
try a singular card there we go in fact

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.900 
try a singular card there we go in fact
we<00:04:35.520> could<00:04:35.670> try<00:04:35.880> any<00:04:36.060> SIM<00:04:36.330> card<00:04:37.640> let's<00:04:38.640> try<00:04:38.850> it

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
we could try any SIM card let's try it

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.870 
we could try any SIM card let's try it
tell<00:04:39.120> us<00:04:39.270> sim<00:04:39.450> card
