00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
I like his aesthetic gets drawn straight

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.359

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
from just the character let's talk about

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.720 
from just the character let's talk about
his<00:02:15.459> weapon<00:02:15.879> of<00:02:16.239> course<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:16.629> an<00:02:16.720> SMG<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.730> it

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
his weapon of course it's an SMG and it

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.670 
his weapon of course it's an SMG and it
performs<00:02:19.060> quite<00:02:19.209> well<00:02:19.299> in<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.689> category<00:02:20.170> SMGs

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
performs quite well in the category SMGs

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.020 
performs quite well in the category SMGs
are<00:02:20.769> not<00:02:20.860> renowned<00:02:21.129> for<00:02:21.310> being<00:02:21.489> strong<00:02:21.819> but<00:02:21.970> I

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
are not renowned for being strong but I

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.080 
are not renowned for being strong but I
think<00:02:22.240> jacket<00:02:22.770> performs<00:02:23.770> maybe<00:02:23.980> top<00:02:24.580> two<00:02:24.849> or

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
think jacket performs maybe top two or

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.720 
think jacket performs maybe top two or
even<00:02:25.270> one<00:02:25.510> I've<00:02:26.050> enjoyed<00:02:26.950> using<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.400> tonight

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
even one I've enjoyed using it tonight

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.040 
even one I've enjoyed using it tonight
found<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.120> be<00:02:28.209> quite<00:02:28.330> functional<00:02:28.930> with

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
found to be quite functional with

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.839 
found to be quite functional with
certain<00:02:29.379> setups<00:02:29.860> I'm<00:02:30.220> quite<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.459> high-level

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
again within my infamy level so I am

again within my infamy level so I am
quite<00:02:33.489> skilled<00:02:34.209> out<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.599> might<00:02:34.720> be<00:02:34.840> different

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
quite skilled out it might be different

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.420 
quite skilled out it might be different
when<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:35.440> don't<00:02:35.620> have<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.830> same<00:02:36.040> sort<00:02:36.370> of

when you don't have the same sort of
skills<00:02:36.819> but<00:02:37.330> do<00:02:37.569> remember<00:02:37.599> with<00:02:38.500> SMGs<00:02:39.159> you

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
skills but do remember with SMGs you

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.890 
skills but do remember with SMGs you
don't<00:02:39.519> need<00:02:39.819> very<00:02:39.849> many<00:02:40.209> skill<00:02:40.599> points<00:02:40.840> to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
don't need very many skill points to

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.539 
don't need very many skill points to
make<00:02:41.049> them<00:02:41.200> functional<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:42.040> only<00:02:42.190> need<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.459> go

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
make them functional you only need to go

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.699 
make them functional you only need to go
a<00:02:42.580> little<00:02:42.670> bit<00:02:43.000> up<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.390> ghost<00:02:43.720> tree<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.470> I've

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
a little bit up the ghost tree and I've

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.110 
a little bit up the ghost tree and I've
really<00:02:45.010> felt<00:02:45.160> like<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.400> fire<00:02:45.670> rate<00:02:45.910> works

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
really felt like the fire rate works

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.509 
really felt like the fire rate works
well<00:02:46.420> for<00:02:46.660> me<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.780> even<00:02:47.230> pump<00:02:47.799> that<00:02:47.950> fire<00:02:48.220> up

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
well for me I even pump that fire up

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.250 
well for me I even pump that fire up
rate<00:02:48.819> up<00:02:49.060> further<00:02:49.599> with<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.440> SMG<00:02:51.160> skill<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:53.140> I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
rate up further with the SMG skill and I

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.990 
rate up further with the SMG skill and I
just<00:02:53.470> tear<00:02:53.769> through<00:02:54.040> what<00:02:54.489> are<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.700> enemies

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
just tear through what are the enemies

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.610 
just tear through what are the enemies
you<00:02:55.150> have<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.540> be<00:02:55.599> very<00:02:55.720> accurate<00:02:55.959> with<00:02:56.260> it

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
you have to be very accurate with it

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.130 
you have to be very accurate with it
you're<00:02:56.829> gonna<00:02:56.920> kick<00:02:57.280> like<00:02:57.519> mad<00:02:57.849> and<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.720> can<00:02:59.049> be

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
you're gonna kick like mad and it can be

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.539 
you're gonna kick like mad and it can be
functional<00:02:59.560> for<00:02:59.590> taking<00:02:59.890> out<00:02:59.980> snipers<00:03:00.370> just

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
functional for taking out snipers just

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.740 
functional for taking out snipers just
because<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:00.849> has<00:03:00.940> reasonably<00:03:01.299> high<00:03:01.450> base

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
because it has reasonably high base

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.110 
because it has reasonably high base
damage<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.410> can<00:03:02.530> be<00:03:02.620> modified<00:03:02.769> for<00:03:03.640> even<00:03:03.940> more

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
damage and can be modified for even more

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.150 
damage and can be modified for even more
quite<00:03:04.420> easily<00:03:04.629> I<00:03:04.840> think<00:03:04.900> mine<00:03:05.230> sits<00:03:05.500> at<00:03:05.620> 35

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
quite easily I think mine sits at 35

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.729 
quite easily I think mine sits at 35
damage<00:03:06.579> which<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:07.120> comfortable<00:03:08.109> place<00:03:08.620> for

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
damage which is a comfortable place for

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.030 
damage which is a comfortable place for
it<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.129> be<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.870> can<00:03:10.900> take<00:03:11.170> out<00:03:11.319> snipers<00:03:11.739> in<00:03:11.859> one

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
it to be you can take out snipers in one

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.880 
it to be you can take out snipers in one
shot<00:03:12.400> on<00:03:12.900> most<00:03:13.900> difficulties<00:03:14.410> other<00:03:14.709> than

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
shot on most difficulties other than

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.130 
shot on most difficulties other than
death<00:03:15.129> wish

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
death wish

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.099 
death wish
and<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.980> just<00:03:18.129> got<00:03:18.280> not<00:03:18.430> going<00:03:18.579> to<00:03:18.640> notice<00:03:18.790> it

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
and you just got not going to notice it

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.319 
and you just got not going to notice it
it's<00:03:20.109> damage<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.739> it's<00:03:21.340> really<00:03:21.670> capable<00:03:22.030> is

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
it's damage is it's really capable is

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.059 
it's damage is it's really capable is
that<00:03:22.629> of<00:03:22.780> an<00:03:22.870> assault<00:03:23.170> rifle<00:03:23.260> essentially

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
that of an assault rifle essentially

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.099 
that of an assault rifle essentially
admittedly<00:03:24.700> gonna<00:03:24.910> be<00:03:25.000> very<00:03:25.269> much<00:03:25.450> faster<00:03:25.750> and

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
admittedly gonna be very much faster and

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.720 
admittedly gonna be very much faster and
even<00:03:26.200> run<00:03:26.410> out<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.530> ammo<00:03:26.890> very<00:03:27.099> quickly<00:03:27.370> but<00:03:27.609> it

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
even run out of ammo very quickly but it

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.000 
even run out of ammo very quickly but it
also<00:03:27.940> functions<00:03:28.239> well<00:03:28.750> on<00:03:29.140> ammo<00:03:29.590> picking<00:03:29.920> up

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
also functions well on ammo picking up

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.530 
also functions well on ammo picking up
again<00:03:30.400> assuming<00:03:30.849> you're<00:03:30.970> accurate<00:03:31.420> you're

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
again assuming you're accurate you're

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.930 
again assuming you're accurate you're
aiming<00:03:31.720> for<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.900> head<00:03:31.959> as<00:03:32.230> much<00:03:32.349> as<00:03:32.500> possible

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
aiming for the head as much as possible

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.740 
aiming for the head as much as possible
but<00:03:33.940> again<00:03:34.060> there<00:03:34.359> are<00:03:34.419> some<00:03:34.510> interesting

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
but again there are some interesting

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.289 
but again there are some interesting
bills<00:03:35.139> I<00:03:35.319> use<00:03:35.620> swansong<00:03:36.220> for<00:03:36.430> example<00:03:36.880> that

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
bills I use swansong for example that

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.789 
bills I use swansong for example that
can<00:03:37.450> be<00:03:37.569> used<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.840> take<00:03:37.959> up<00:03:38.139> bulldozers<00:03:38.650> with

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
can be used to take up bulldozers with

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.020 
can be used to take up bulldozers with
this<00:03:38.950> thing<00:03:39.130> because<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.400> shoots<00:03:39.609> so<00:03:39.760> fast

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
this thing because it shoots so fast

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.449 
this thing because it shoots so fast
just<00:03:40.269> tears<00:03:40.599> through<00:03:41.260> even<00:03:42.069> the<00:03:42.160> highest

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
just tears through even the highest

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.879 
just tears through even the highest
health<00:03:42.639> enemies<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.450> well<00:03:44.230> it<00:03:44.319> can<00:03:44.500> be<00:03:44.590> useful

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
health enemies and well it can be useful

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.229 
health enemies and well it can be useful
for<00:03:44.919> is<00:03:45.160> running<00:03:45.400> into<00:03:45.549> a<00:03:45.579> cloak<00:03:45.849> and<00:03:45.880> just

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
for is running into a cloak and just

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.690 
for is running into a cloak and just
bang<00:03:47.139> you're<00:03:47.410> dead<00:03:47.440> it's<00:03:48.130> not<00:03:48.340> maybe<00:03:48.489> as

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
bang you're dead it's not maybe as

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.580 
bang you're dead it's not maybe as
satisfying<00:03:49.120> as<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.299> shotgun<00:03:49.840> but<00:03:50.019> quickly

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
satisfying as the shotgun but quickly

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.470 
satisfying as the shotgun but quickly
loading<00:03:51.190> 20<00:03:51.639> bullets<00:03:51.790> straight<00:03:52.209> into<00:03:52.359> his

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
loading 20 bullets straight into his

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.930 
loading 20 bullets straight into his
head<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:52.840> so<00:03:53.650> that's<00:03:53.799> pretty<00:03:54.130> satisfying<00:03:54.340> so

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
head and so that's pretty satisfying so

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.819 
head and so that's pretty satisfying so
I<00:03:55.150> have<00:03:55.299> really<00:03:55.599> enjoyed<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:56.109> and<00:03:56.169> again<00:03:56.470> with

I have really enjoyed it and again with
the<00:03:56.889> right<00:03:57.040> skill<00:03:57.370> set<00:03:57.579> up<00:03:57.700> it<00:03:57.910> can<00:03:58.090> augment

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
the right skill set up it can augment

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.750 
the right skill set up it can augment
any<00:03:59.109> setup<00:04:00.040> really<00:04:00.459> quite<00:04:00.910> well<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:03.400> yeah<00:04:03.549> it

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
any setup really quite well so yeah it

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.000 
any setup really quite well so yeah it
gets<00:04:03.940> my<00:04:04.060> thumbs<00:04:04.329> up<00:04:04.540> on<00:04:04.720> that<00:04:05.169> front<00:04:05.470> next<00:04:05.799> up

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
gets my thumbs up on that front next up

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.940

the Alip of a melee weapons that already
exist<00:04:14.889> not<00:04:15.400> too<00:04:15.639> impressed<00:04:16.030> by<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.930> looks

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
exist not too impressed by it it looks

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.620 
exist not too impressed by it it looks
good<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.919> fits<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.549> with<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:18.820> feel<00:04:19.060> but<00:04:19.510> there

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
good it fits in with the feel but there

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.940 
good it fits in with the feel but there
are<00:04:19.690> definitely<00:04:19.989> better<00:04:20.109> melee<00:04:20.380> weapons<00:04:20.799> out

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
are definitely better melee weapons out

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.520 
are definitely better melee weapons out
there<00:04:20.979> so<00:04:21.459> don't<00:04:21.940> just<00:04:22.090> look<00:04:22.240> for<00:04:22.300> this<00:04:22.570> now

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
there so don't just look for this now

the perk deck and this is really what's

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.279 
the perk deck and this is really what's
most<00:04:25.150> important<00:04:25.660> about<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.840> new<00:04:25.990> character

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
most important about a new character

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:27.839 
most important about a new character
pack<00:04:26.560> if<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:26.800> ask<00:04:26.979> me<00:04:27.130> this<00:04:27.250> is<00:04:27.370> what<00:04:27.460> adds<00:04:27.639> new

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
pack if you ask me this is what adds new

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.060

elements<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.750> game<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:29.169> really<00:04:29.830> what

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
elements to the game and really what

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
jackets sociopath perk deck does is draw

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.400 
jackets sociopath perk deck does is draw
together<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.820> lot<00:04:33.970> of<00:04:34.060> previous<00:04:34.660> ideas<00:04:35.229> and

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
together a lot of previous ideas and

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.740 
together a lot of previous ideas and
bring<00:04:35.530> it<00:04:35.650> into<00:04:35.860> one<00:04:36.099> maybe<00:04:36.640> slightly<00:04:37.240> weaker

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
bring it into one maybe slightly weaker

bring it into one maybe slightly weaker
perk<00:04:38.289> decks<00:04:38.680> so<00:04:38.979> I'm<00:04:39.550> not<00:04:39.729> not<00:04:39.940> saying<00:04:40.150> the

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
perk decks so I'm not not saying the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.460 
perk decks so I'm not not saying the
perk<00:04:40.479> deck<00:04:40.659> is<00:04:40.780> weak<00:04:40.960> but<00:04:41.140> the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
perk deck is weak but the

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.080 
perk deck is weak but the
year<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:42.070> skills<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.520> get<00:04:42.640> in<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:42.970> you're

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
getting sort of weaker variants so

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.740

I'm<00:05:04.300> trying<00:05:04.540> to<00:05:04.630> think<00:05:04.720> what<00:05:04.870> that<00:05:04.990> is<00:05:06.480> it

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
I'm trying to think what that is it

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.810 
I'm trying to think what that is it
functions<00:05:08.380> quite<00:05:08.700> coherently

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.820 
it's more of a tank build and if you're
a<00:05:18.610> tank<00:05:18.910> build<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:20.050> may<00:05:20.200> want<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.470> think<00:05:20.560> about

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
a tank build you may want to think about

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.090 
a tank build you may want to think about
using<00:05:21.100> Armour<00:05:21.790> or<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.630> health<00:05:23.530> per<00:05:23.770> decade

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
using Armour or the health per decade

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.880 
using Armour or the health per decade
it's<00:05:24.430> name<00:05:24.640> escapes<00:05:24.910> me<00:05:25.150> right<00:05:25.270> now<00:05:25.770> over<00:05:26.770> this

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
it's name escapes me right now over this

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.100 
it's name escapes me right now over this
so<00:05:27.190> it's<00:05:27.730> a<00:05:27.850> bit<00:05:27.970> of<00:05:28.000> a<00:05:28.090> difficult<00:05:28.300> toss-up<00:05:28.930> I

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
so it's a bit of a difficult toss-up I

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.350 
so it's a bit of a difficult toss-up I
do<00:05:29.530> find<00:05:30.070> that<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.460> armor<00:05:30.700> regeneration<00:05:31.150> is

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
do find that the armor regeneration is

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.060 
do find that the armor regeneration is
helpful<00:05:31.900> but<00:05:32.050> inconsistent<00:05:32.860> because<00:05:33.010> you

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
helpful but inconsistent because you

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.200 
helpful but inconsistent because you
actually<00:05:33.190> have<00:05:33.400> to<00:05:33.580> make<00:05:33.730> sure<00:05:33.850> you<00:05:34.000> pick<00:05:34.180> up

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
actually have to make sure you pick up

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.840 
actually have to make sure you pick up
kills<00:05:34.630> which<00:05:35.110> can<00:05:35.320> be<00:05:35.410> even<00:05:35.680> less<00:05:35.919> likely<00:05:36.190> when

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
kills which can be even less likely when

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.060 
kills which can be even less likely when
you're<00:05:37.000> playing<00:05:37.270> with<00:05:37.419> friends<00:05:37.600> however<00:05:38.260> if

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
you're playing with friends however if

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.470 
you're playing with friends however if
you<00:05:39.280> want<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:39.460> secure<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:39.880> kills<00:05:40.090> running

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
you want to secure the kills running

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.900 
you want to secure the kills running
things<00:05:40.600> like<00:05:40.780> shotguns<00:05:41.260> a<00:05:41.350> minigun<00:05:41.790> they<00:05:42.790> are

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
things like shotguns a minigun they are

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.880 
things like shotguns a minigun they are
perfect<00:05:43.419> for<00:05:43.570> it<00:05:43.780> soon<00:05:43.960> Jones<00:05:44.230> really<00:05:44.740> well

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
perfect for it soon Jones really well

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.159 
perfect for it soon Jones really well
and<00:05:45.130> I<00:05:45.190> found<00:05:45.460> some<00:05:45.640> genuine<00:05:46.510> success<00:05:46.960> with

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
and I found some genuine success with

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.560 
and I found some genuine success with
that<00:05:47.200> the<00:05:47.560> fear<00:05:47.830> can<00:05:48.100> save<00:05:48.850> you<00:05:49.090> at<00:05:49.210> moments

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
that the fear can save you at moments

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.840 
that the fear can save you at moments
when<00:05:49.690> you<00:05:49.840> must<00:05:50.140> need<00:05:50.530> it<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:50.860> so<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.669> perk

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
when you must need it and so the perk

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.060 
when you must need it and so the perk
day<00:05:52.030> is<00:05:52.240> very<00:05:52.510> much<00:05:52.690> so<00:05:52.870> functional<00:05:53.410> however

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
day is very much so functional however

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.620 
day is very much so functional however
my<00:05:54.190> disappointment<00:05:54.850> was<00:05:54.940> when<00:05:55.150> I<00:05:55.180> originally

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
my disappointment was when I originally

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.450 
my disappointment was when I originally
wanted<00:05:55.750> to<00:05:55.960> get<00:05:56.140> on<00:05:56.260> and<00:05:56.410> use<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.680> SMG<00:05:57.310> the

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
wanted to get on and use the SMG the

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.760 
wanted to get on and use the SMG the
melee<00:05:57.640> weapon<00:05:58.060> and<00:05:58.210> have<00:05:59.020> it<00:05:59.110> all<00:05:59.229> synergize

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
melee weapon and have it all synergize

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.260 
melee weapon and have it all synergize
that<00:06:00.250> just<00:06:00.460> doesn't<00:06:00.610> happen<00:06:00.850> which<00:06:01.120> i<00:06:01.210> think

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
that just doesn't happen which i think

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.000 
that just doesn't happen which i think
is<00:06:01.479> a<00:06:01.510> shame<00:06:01.840> because<00:06:02.110> on<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.620> whole<00:06:02.650> they've

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
is a shame because on the whole they've

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.950 
is a shame because on the whole they've
tried<00:06:03.310> to<00:06:03.580> to<00:06:04.030> make<00:06:04.210> that<00:06:04.360> happen<00:06:04.419> with<00:06:04.750> a<00:06:04.810> lot

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
tried to to make that happen with a lot

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.930 
tried to to make that happen with a lot
of<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.140> other<00:06:05.350> perk<00:06:05.680> decks<00:06:06.070> and<00:06:06.310> sort<00:06:06.880> of

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
of the other perk decks and sort of

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.180 
of the other perk decks and sort of
standard<00:06:07.360> skill<00:06:07.690> setups<00:06:08.080> you'll<00:06:08.229> see<00:06:08.470> so

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
standard skill setups you'll see so

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.980 
standard skill setups you'll see so
again<00:06:09.610> I'm<00:06:10.060> slightly<00:06:10.270> disappointed<00:06:10.840> by<00:06:10.960> that

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
again I'm slightly disappointed by that

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.900 
again I'm slightly disappointed by that
but<00:06:11.440> it<00:06:11.560> is<00:06:11.710> a<00:06:11.740> functional<00:06:12.280> perk<00:06:12.460> that<00:06:12.669> for

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
but it is a functional perk that for

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.300 
but it is a functional perk that for
certain<00:06:13.120> play<00:06:13.479> styles<00:06:13.990> again<00:06:14.770> overkill

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
certain play styles again overkill

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.530 
certain play styles again overkill
shotgun<00:06:15.760> users<00:06:16.030> are<00:06:16.120> probably<00:06:16.210> going<00:06:16.450> to

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
shotgun users are probably going to

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.880 
shotgun users are probably going to
benefit<00:06:16.870> from<00:06:17.020> it<00:06:17.200> more<00:06:17.350> than<00:06:17.440> anyone<00:06:17.650> else

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
benefit from it more than anyone else

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.230 
benefit from it more than anyone else
because<00:06:18.190> you're<00:06:18.310> going<00:06:18.400> to<00:06:18.490> naturally<00:06:18.669> be<00:06:19.060> up

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
because you're going to naturally be up

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.120 
because you're going to naturally be up
close<00:06:19.419> and<00:06:19.510> personal<00:06:20.110> someone<00:06:20.680> like<00:06:20.830> me<00:06:21.010> who

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
close and personal someone like me who

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.250 
close and personal someone like me who
has<00:06:21.220> a<00:06:21.280> temporal<00:06:21.669> into<00:06:21.970> melee<00:06:22.240> as<00:06:22.510> well<00:06:22.750> you're

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
has a temporal into melee as well you're

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.960 
has a temporal into melee as well you're
gonna<00:06:23.350> get<00:06:23.530> some<00:06:23.770> additional<00:06:24.190> benefit<00:06:24.640> out<00:06:24.790> of

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
gonna get some additional benefit out of

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.140 
gonna get some additional benefit out of
that<00:06:25.320> so<00:06:26.320> the<00:06:26.410> per<00:06:26.560> deck<00:06:26.830> works<00:06:27.040> well<00:06:27.400> but<00:06:27.940> only

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
that so the per deck works well but only

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.150 
that so the per deck works well but only
really<00:06:28.540> I<00:06:28.720> feel<00:06:29.020> if<00:06:29.260> you<00:06:29.350> think<00:06:29.380> about<00:06:29.800> it<00:06:30.100> a

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
really I feel if you think about it a

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.130 
really I feel if you think about it a
lot<00:06:30.340> let's<00:06:31.000> compare<00:06:31.330> it<00:06:31.390> to<00:06:31.479> rope<00:06:31.750> you<00:06:31.960> don't

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
lot let's compare it to rope you don't

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.600 
lot let's compare it to rope you don't
have<00:06:32.229> to<00:06:32.320> think<00:06:32.500> about<00:06:32.710> that<00:06:32.800> things<00:06:33.100> slap<00:06:33.400> bad

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
have to think about that things slap bad

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.280 
have to think about that things slap bad
on<00:06:33.790> suddenly<00:06:34.450> you're<00:06:34.660> surviving<00:06:34.930> the<00:06:35.140> most

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
on suddenly you're surviving the most

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.650 
on suddenly you're surviving the most
ridiculous<00:06:35.860> of<00:06:35.979> situations<00:06:36.580> so<00:06:36.669> it's<00:06:37.479> no

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
ridiculous of situations so it's no

rogue is still crazy strong but again if
