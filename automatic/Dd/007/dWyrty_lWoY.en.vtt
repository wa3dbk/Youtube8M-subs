00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
harder on the surface and I think you

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.529

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
whereas this one I feel it's a little

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.189 
whereas this one I feel it's a little
bit<00:00:45.160> softer<00:00:45.670> you<00:00:46.539> know<00:00:46.629> if<00:00:46.719> you<00:00:46.840> press<00:00:47.170> down

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
bit softer you know if you press down

really hard with your fingernail you

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.299 
really hard with your fingernail you

at the test volume of coming out of the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.510 
at the test volume of coming out of the
speaker<00:01:16.230> when<00:01:17.230> the<00:01:17.530> phone<00:01:17.740> is<00:01:17.770> laid<00:01:18.130> down<00:01:18.280> like

this and it seemed to have no problem
doesn't<00:01:20.560> seem<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.340> change<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.790> volume<00:01:21.970> at<00:01:22.330> all

so I think that's good okay let's go
inside<00:01:25.380> okay<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:27.060> material<00:01:28.060> here<00:01:28.420> the

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990

like a soft polyester so anyway the

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.520 
like a soft polyester so anyway the
edges<00:01:54.790> here<00:01:55.150> seems<00:01:55.750> to<00:01:55.840> be<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.080> little<00:01:56.350> bit

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530

uneven unlike the the genuine flip cover
the<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.870> edges<00:02:02.260> are<00:02:02.520> beveled<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:05.050> seems

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
the the edges are beveled and it seems

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.050 
the the edges are beveled and it seems
you<00:02:06.220> know<00:02:06.340> just<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.610> little<00:02:06.850> bit<00:02:06.940> more

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
you know just a little bit more

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.430 
you know just a little bit more

very small on this but it matches up

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
coming out of there but just

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.810 
coming out of there but just
appearance-wise<00:02:53.770> I<00:02:53.950> think<00:02:54.490> they<00:02:54.580> could<00:02:54.730> have

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
appearance-wise I think they could have

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.970 
appearance-wise I think they could have
done<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:54.970> little<00:02:55.180> bit<00:02:55.390> better<00:02:55.650> another<00:02:56.650> thing

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
done a little bit better another thing

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.820 
done a little bit better another thing
is<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.640> galaxy<00:02:58.270> note<00:02:58.300> 2<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.140> kind<00:02:59.560> of<00:02:59.620> like

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
is the galaxy note 2 it is kind of like

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.500 
is the galaxy note 2 it is kind of like
a<00:03:00.150> embossed<00:03:01.150> print<00:03:01.690> there<00:03:02.140> whereas<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:04.120> is

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
a embossed print there whereas this is

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.980 
a embossed print there whereas this is
just<00:03:05.050> printed<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.800> here<00:03:06.070> but<00:03:06.850> uh<00:03:06.880> speaking<00:03:07.720> of

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
just printed on here but uh speaking of

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.410 
just printed on here but uh speaking of
which<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.530> feel<00:03:08.770> that<00:03:09.280> they<00:03:09.910> could<00:03:10.060> have<00:03:10.180> done<00:03:10.210> a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
which I feel that they could have done a

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.910 
which I feel that they could have done a
little<00:03:10.750> bit<00:03:10.960> better<00:03:11.140> on<00:03:11.290> their<00:03:11.440> printing<00:03:11.800> the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
little bit better on their printing the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.100 
little bit better on their printing the
cheese<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.160> little<00:03:12.370> bit<00:03:12.790> deeper<00:03:13.330> in<00:03:13.540> there<00:03:13.750> than

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
cheese a little bit deeper in there than

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.820 
cheese a little bit deeper in there than
the<00:03:14.260> eye<00:03:14.770> off<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.790> there<00:03:16.560> okay<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:19.620> let's<00:03:20.620> see

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
the eye off of there okay so let's see

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.930 
the eye off of there okay so let's see
what<00:03:20.860> else<00:03:22.830> okay<00:03:23.830> so<00:03:23.890> when<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:24.580> put<00:03:24.820> in<00:03:24.910> the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
what else okay so when I put in the

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.820 
what else okay so when I put in the
phone<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.450> noticed<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.200> phone<00:03:26.440> dropped

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
phone I noticed that the phone dropped

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.729 
phone I noticed that the phone dropped
in<00:03:27.010> pretty<00:03:27.310> easily<00:03:27.400> into<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.540> right<00:03:29.380> but<00:03:29.650> as

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
in pretty easily into it right but as

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.370 
in pretty easily into it right but as
you<00:03:29.800> can<00:03:29.920> see<00:03:30.130> uh<00:03:30.300> it's<00:03:31.300> not<00:03:31.570> easy<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:32.050> take<00:03:32.230> out

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
you can see uh it's not easy to take out

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.350 
you can see uh it's not easy to take out
it<00:03:32.620> drops<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.130> really<00:03:33.310> easy<00:03:33.489> but<00:03:33.880> it's<00:03:34.180> hard

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
it drops and really easy but it's hard

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.180 
it drops and really easy but it's hard
to<00:03:34.420> take<00:03:34.660> a<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:35.410> don't<00:03:35.650> have<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:35.920> worry<00:03:36.100> about

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
to take a you don't have to worry about

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.290 
to take a you don't have to worry about
it<00:03:36.459> falling<00:03:36.489> out<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.980> one<00:03:38.980> thing<00:03:39.220> is<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.459> the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
it falling out and one thing is a the

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.920 
it falling out and one thing is a the
surface<00:03:41.140> where<00:03:41.830> the<00:03:42.550> edges<00:03:43.239> here<00:03:43.660> they're<00:03:43.900> a

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
surface where the edges here they're a

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.699 
surface where the edges here they're a
little<00:03:44.470> bit<00:03:44.709> above<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.780> glass<00:03:46.780> itself<00:03:47.050> so<00:03:47.680> it

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
little bit above the glass itself so it

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.290 
little bit above the glass itself so it
does<00:03:48.160> offer<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.550> little<00:03:48.910> bit<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.120> protection

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
does offer a little bit of protection

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.800 
does offer a little bit of protection
for<00:03:49.900> example<00:03:50.830> I<00:03:51.430> guess<00:03:51.820> if<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.120> were<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.660> put

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
for example I guess if you were to put

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.330 
for example I guess if you were to put
your<00:03:52.989> phone<00:03:53.170> down<00:03:53.200> for<00:03:53.620> like<00:03:53.770> that<00:03:53.950> for<00:03:54.190> some

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
your phone down for like that for some

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.460 
your phone down for like that for some
reason<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:55.060> plastic<00:03:55.480> would<00:03:55.630> hit<00:03:55.810> first<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.350> I

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
reason the plastic would hit first and I

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.699 
reason the plastic would hit first and I
think<00:03:56.709> that<00:03:56.860> is<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.070> plus<00:03:58.030> from<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.709> genuine

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
think that is a plus from the genuine

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.850 
think that is a plus from the genuine
flip<00:04:00.010> cover<00:04:01.170> okay<00:04:02.170> and<00:04:02.440> as<00:04:02.920> as<00:04:03.430> in<00:04:03.880> terms<00:04:04.120> of

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
flip cover okay and as as in terms of

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.790 
flip cover okay and as as in terms of
size<00:04:06.570> right<00:04:07.570> it's<00:04:07.840> actually<00:04:08.290> adding<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.620> little

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
size right it's actually adding a little

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.850 
size right it's actually adding a little
bit<00:04:08.950> bulk<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.550> sides<00:04:09.940> here<00:04:10.269> on<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.510> top

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
bit bulk to the sides here on the top

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.890 
bit bulk to the sides here on the top
and<00:04:11.860> what<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.700> means<00:04:12.970> is<00:04:13.180> compared<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.780> the

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
and what that means is compared to the

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.110 
and what that means is compared to the
flip<00:04:14.140> cover<00:04:14.410> just<00:04:15.160> going<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.519> be<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.670> little<00:04:15.910> bit

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
flip cover just going to be a little bit

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.900 
flip cover just going to be a little bit
wider<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:17.019> little<00:04:17.320> bit<00:04:17.440> taller<00:04:17.650> as<00:04:18.100> you<00:04:18.790> could

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
wider and little bit taller as you could

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.820 
wider and little bit taller as you could
see<00:04:18.940> I'm<00:04:19.359> trying<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.960> line<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.410> up<00:04:20.620> with<00:04:20.680> the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
see I'm trying to line it up with the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.279 
see I'm trying to line it up with the
edges<00:04:21.250> here<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.669> it's<00:04:21.789> a<00:04:21.940> little<00:04:22.270> bit<00:04:22.450> more

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
edges here and it's a little bit more

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.050 
edges here and it's a little bit more
just

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
just

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.550 
just
little<00:04:24.210> bit<00:04:24.300> more<00:04:24.480> there<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:24.960> that's

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
little bit more there and that's

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.420 
little bit more there and that's
understandable<00:04:26.780> another<00:04:27.780> thing<00:04:28.169> is<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.430> the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
understandable another thing is that the

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.200 
understandable another thing is that the

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
one of them actually told me a couple of

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.790 
one of them actually told me a couple of
weeks<00:05:14.940> ago<00:05:15.060> that<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:15.630> god<00:05:15.960> they<00:05:16.320> broke<00:05:16.590> their

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
weeks ago that the god they broke their

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.980 
weeks ago that the god they broke their
screen<00:05:17.570> and<00:05:19.190> it<00:05:20.190> was<00:05:20.550> a<00:05:20.580> very<00:05:20.970> unfortunate<00:05:21.180> and

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
screen and it was a very unfortunate and

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.020 
screen and it was a very unfortunate and
it<00:05:22.350> is<00:05:22.500> because<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:22.919> phone<00:05:23.160> is<00:05:23.190> heavy<00:05:23.610> and<00:05:23.880> it

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
it is because the phone is heavy and it

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.480 
it is because the phone is heavy and it
if<00:05:24.270> it<00:05:24.570> happens<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.050> land<00:05:25.470> in<00:05:25.710> these<00:05:26.220> four

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
if it happens to land in these four

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.600 
if it happens to land in these four
corners<00:05:27.090> face<00:05:27.780> down<00:05:28.080> at<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.800> just<00:05:29.340> a<00:05:29.460> right

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
corners face down at the just a right

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.870 
corners face down at the just a right
angle<00:05:30.000> seems<00:05:30.840> like<00:05:31.110> it's<00:05:31.620> very<00:05:32.340> prone<00:05:32.700> to

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
angle seems like it's very prone to

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.730 
angle seems like it's very prone to
cracking<00:05:33.150> just<00:05:33.600> just<00:05:34.050> because<00:05:34.289> it's<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:34.560> heavy

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
cracking just just because it's so heavy

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.650 
cracking just just because it's so heavy
imagine<00:05:35.220> all<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:35.370> forced<00:05:35.910> landing<00:05:36.240> on<00:05:36.419> these

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
imagine all that forced landing on these

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.570 
imagine all that forced landing on these
corners<00:05:37.560> here<00:05:38.160> and<00:05:38.990> that's<00:05:39.990> why<00:05:40.430> note<00:05:41.430> the

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
corners here and that's why note the

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.969 
corners here and that's why note the
genuine<00:05:42.090> samsung<00:05:42.330> flip<00:05:42.690> cover<00:05:42.960> sure<00:05:43.680> if<00:05:43.830> it

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
genuine samsung flip cover sure if it

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.550 
genuine samsung flip cover sure if it
fell<00:05:44.340> with<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.060> flat<00:05:45.300> bonded<00:05:45.780> be<00:05:45.930> no<00:05:46.080> problem

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
fell with the flat bonded be no problem

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.100 
fell with the flat bonded be no problem
but<00:05:46.850> imagine<00:05:47.850> you<00:05:48.300> know<00:05:48.419> you<00:05:48.780> were<00:05:48.870> just

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
but imagine you know you were just

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.210 
but imagine you know you were just
unlucky<00:05:49.320> and<00:05:49.740> it<00:05:50.070> fell<00:05:51.350> fell<00:05:52.350> like<00:05:52.590> that<00:05:52.770> still

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
unlucky and it fell fell like that still

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.110 
unlucky and it fell fell like that still
ok<00:05:54.060> and<00:05:54.479> I<00:05:54.960> I<00:05:54.990> think<00:05:55.740> this<00:05:56.280> case<00:05:56.580> would<00:05:56.820> offer

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
ok and I I think this case would offer

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.500 
ok and I I think this case would offer
actually<00:05:58.020> a<00:05:58.050> little<00:05:58.289> bit<00:05:58.530> better<00:05:58.680> protection

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
actually a little bit better protection

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.570 
actually a little bit better protection
also<00:06:00.590> even<00:06:01.590> if<00:06:01.680> it<00:06:01.860> dropped<00:06:02.130> out<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.340> corner

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
also even if it dropped out the corner

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.700 
also even if it dropped out the corner
and<00:06:02.700> the<00:06:02.789> glass<00:06:03.000> didn't<00:06:03.389> crack<00:06:03.600> the<00:06:03.710> January

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
and the glass didn't crack the January

considering getting this exact case I

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.330

think<00:07:18.930> a<00:07:19.050> few<00:07:19.259> points<00:07:19.560> mentioned<00:07:19.710> here<00:07:20.099> might

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 
think a few points mentioned here might

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.059 
think a few points mentioned here might
benefit<00:07:20.789> you<00:07:20.930> when<00:07:21.930> determining<00:07:22.259> if<00:07:22.740> you<00:07:22.889> want

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:23.069 
benefit you when determining if you want

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:26.240 
benefit you when determining if you want
to<00:07:23.220> buy<00:07:23.370> like<00:07:23.580> a<00:07:23.610> 45<00:07:24.270> or<00:07:24.870> forty<00:07:25.169> dollar<00:07:25.380> flip
