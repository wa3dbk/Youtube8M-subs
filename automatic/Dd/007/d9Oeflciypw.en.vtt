about housing both inside and outside

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.469 
about housing both inside and outside
that<00:01:06.270> moves<00:01:06.960> around<00:01:07.140> there's<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.270> couple<00:01:09.270> of

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that moves around there's a couple of

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.410 
that moves around there's a couple of
reasons<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.930> those<00:01:10.260> are<00:01:11.119> work<00:01:12.119> out<00:01:12.270> really

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
reasons that those are work out really

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.050 
reasons that those are work out really
well<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.020> them<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.890> fixed<00:01:14.520> location

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
well one of them is that fixed location

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.700 
well one of them is that fixed location
oftentimes<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> homeless<00:01:16.439> become

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
oftentimes the homeless become

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.760 
oftentimes the homeless become
habituated<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.610> location<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:19.080> jobs<00:01:19.439> in

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
habituated to that location the jobs in

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.830 
habituated to that location the jobs in
the<00:01:20.070> places<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> plug<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.180> within<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.600> area

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
the places to plug in within that area

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.170 
the places to plug in within that area
gets<00:01:22.259> filled<00:01:23.040> up<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.880> move<00:01:24.060> around

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
gets filled up and so as you move around

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.179 
gets filled up and so as you move around
to<00:01:24.540> different<00:01:24.570> locations<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.799> homeless<00:01:26.070> not

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
to different locations the homeless not

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.590 
to different locations the homeless not
get<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> chance<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.820> plug<00:01:27.030> into<00:01:27.240> different

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600

and you as you said a couple of winters

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.500 
and you as you said a couple of winters
and<00:06:13.750> so<00:06:13.930> that's<00:06:14.140> that's<00:06:14.890> homeless<00:06:15.160> yeah<00:06:16.150> and<00:06:16.420> I

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
and so that's that's homeless yeah and I

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.920 
and so that's that's homeless yeah and I
used<00:06:17.110> to<00:06:17.590> I<00:06:17.950> used<00:06:18.130> to<00:06:18.460> direct<00:06:19.270> a<00:06:19.570> lot<00:06:19.690> of<00:06:19.840> my

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
used to I used to direct a lot of my

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.290 
used to I used to direct a lot of my
anger<00:06:20.230> towards<00:06:20.650> the<00:06:21.160> homeless<00:06:21.430> services<00:06:21.940> but

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
anger towards the homeless services but

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.590 
anger towards the homeless services but
I've<00:06:22.630> I've<00:06:23.530> become<00:06:23.920> more<00:06:24.580> appreciative<00:06:25.270> with

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
I've I've become more appreciative with

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.510 
I've I've become more appreciative with
the<00:06:26.110> people<00:06:26.380> there<00:06:26.620> doing<00:06:26.890> what<00:06:27.160> they<00:06:27.280> can

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
the people there doing what they can

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.350 
the people there doing what they can
with<00:06:27.760> money<00:06:28.330> and<00:06:28.780> some<00:06:28.960> time<00:06:29.200> that<00:06:29.320> they<00:06:29.470> have

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
with money and some time that they have

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.939 
with money and some time that they have
so<00:06:30.720> I<00:06:31.050> you<00:06:31.620> know<00:06:31.760> it's<00:06:32.760> often<00:06:32.970> folks<00:06:33.419> who<00:06:33.949> don't

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
so I you know it's often folks who don't

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:37.010 
so I you know it's often folks who don't
get<00:06:35.160> their<00:06:35.310> hands<00:06:35.520> dirty<00:06:35.669> that<00:06:36.270> I<00:06:36.330> think<00:06:36.780> that

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
get their hands dirty that I think that

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.560 
get their hands dirty that I think that
responsibility<00:06:37.980> lies<00:06:38.310> with<00:06:38.340> do<00:06:39.150> you<00:06:39.270> think

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
responsibility lies with do you think

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.469 
responsibility lies with do you think
other<00:06:39.780> communities<00:06:40.669> instead<00:06:41.669> of<00:06:41.910> you<00:06:42.150> know<00:06:42.270> I

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
other communities instead of you know I

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.270 
other communities instead of you know I
always<00:06:42.810> say<00:06:43.020> it<00:06:43.110> this<00:06:43.260> way<00:06:43.320> communities<00:06:44.070> have

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
always say it this way communities have

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.400 
always say it this way communities have
one<00:06:44.490> or<00:06:44.639> two<00:06:44.930> solutions

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
one or two solutions

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.350 
one or two solutions
they<00:06:46.919> can<00:06:47.100> either<00:06:47.220> bulldoze<00:06:47.729> homelessness

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
they can either bulldoze homelessness

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.110 
they can either bulldoze homelessness
and<00:06:49.199> some<00:06:49.410> literally<00:06:49.919> do<00:06:50.100> that<00:06:50.310> they<00:06:50.669> bulldoze

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
and some literally do that they bulldoze

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.300 
and some literally do that they bulldoze
the<00:06:51.300> ten<00:06:51.449> cities<00:06:51.780> away<00:06:51.930> but<00:06:52.830> it<00:06:52.919> never<00:06:53.100> really

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
the ten cities away but it never really

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.370 
the ten cities away but it never really
goes<00:06:53.550> away<00:06:53.610> or<00:06:54.030> they<00:06:54.180> embrace<00:06:54.660> solutions

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
goes away or they embrace solutions

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.650 
goes away or they embrace solutions
do<00:06:56.310> you<00:06:56.400> consider<00:06:56.820> this<00:06:57.060> as<00:06:57.300> a<00:06:57.330> viable

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
do you consider this as a viable

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.350 
do you consider this as a viable
solutions<00:06:58.440> that<00:06:58.770> you<00:06:59.340> know<00:06:59.490> when<00:06:59.760> shelters

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
solutions that you know when shelters

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.450 
solutions that you know when shelters
are<00:07:00.540> being<00:07:00.570> overrun<00:07:01.110> and<00:07:01.620> there's<00:07:02.040> no<00:07:02.220> money

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
are being overrun and there's no money

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.800 
are being overrun and there's no money
that<00:07:02.850> they<00:07:03.330> allow<00:07:04.940> homeless<00:07:05.940> communities<00:07:06.479> to

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
that they allow homeless communities to

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.129 
that they allow homeless communities to
develop<00:07:06.960> on<00:07:07.380> a<00:07:07.410> parcel<00:07:08.130> someplace<00:07:08.990> you'll<00:07:09.990> run

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139 
develop on a parcel someplace you'll run

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:11.900 
develop on a parcel someplace you'll run
into<00:07:10.229> folks<00:07:10.440> with<00:07:10.650> very<00:07:11.130> strong<00:07:11.400> opinions<00:07:11.820> on

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:11.910 
into folks with very strong opinions on

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.690 
into folks with very strong opinions on
both<00:07:12.090> sides<00:07:12.330> of<00:07:12.479> that<00:07:12.510> issue<00:07:12.630> I<00:07:13.190> I<00:07:14.190> believe

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:14.700 
both sides of that issue I I believe

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.090 
both sides of that issue I I believe
that<00:07:14.910> there's<00:07:15.090> a<00:07:15.440> population<00:07:16.440> of<00:07:16.530> people<00:07:16.710> that

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100 
that there's a population of people that

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.950 
that there's a population of people that
even<00:07:17.490> when<00:07:17.760> you<00:07:17.850> provide<00:07:18.060> them<00:07:18.419> with<00:07:18.570> in<00:07:18.780> an

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
even when you provide them with in an

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.890 
even when you provide them with in an
indoor<00:07:19.440> location<00:07:19.550> with<00:07:20.550> services<00:07:21.150> that<00:07:21.720> they

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 
indoor location with services that they

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.219 
indoor location with services that they
issue<00:07:22.800> that<00:07:23.190> for<00:07:23.720> the<00:07:24.720> life<00:07:24.900> that<00:07:25.080> they've

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:25.229 
issue that for the life that they've

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:27.260 
issue that for the life that they've
become<00:07:25.350> habituated<00:07:25.979> to<00:07:26.160> so<00:07:26.789> there's<00:07:26.970> a<00:07:27.060> small

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.270 
become habituated to so there's a small

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.560 
become habituated to so there's a small
population<00:07:27.870> of<00:07:27.930> people<00:07:28.260> I<00:07:28.350> think<00:07:28.410> that<00:07:29.130> will

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.570 
population of people I think that will

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.750 
population of people I think that will
continue<00:07:30.570> to<00:07:30.690> need<00:07:30.870> services<00:07:31.470> outdoors<00:07:31.949> so<00:07:32.729> I

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:32.760 
continue to need services outdoors so I

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.180 
continue to need services outdoors so I
believe<00:07:33.240> that<00:07:33.270> this<00:07:33.539> serves<00:07:34.500> that<00:07:34.680> population

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.190 
believe that this serves that population

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.700 
believe that this serves that population
of<00:07:35.400> people<00:07:35.760> I<00:07:36.360> also<00:07:36.780> believe<00:07:37.169> that<00:07:37.200> this<00:07:37.470> is<00:07:37.680> a

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:37.710 
of people I also believe that this is a

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.860 
of people I also believe that this is a
lowest<00:07:38.370> rung<00:07:38.789> on<00:07:39.000> the<00:07:39.060> ladder

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:39.870 
lowest rung on the ladder

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.240 
lowest rung on the ladder
it<00:07:40.139> gives<00:07:40.289> folks<00:07:40.530> something<00:07:40.740> to<00:07:40.950> grab<00:07:41.100> ahold

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.250 
it gives folks something to grab ahold

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.820 
it gives folks something to grab ahold
of<00:07:41.580> so<00:07:41.789> that<00:07:41.910> they<00:07:42.030> can<00:07:42.210> take<00:07:42.360> the<00:07:42.510> next<00:07:42.539> step

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:43.830 
of so that they can take the next step

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.430 
of so that they can take the next step
do<00:07:44.190> I<00:07:44.250> think<00:07:44.400> it's<00:07:44.669> a<00:07:45.020> long-term<00:07:46.020> viable

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 
do I think it's a long-term viable

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.890 
do I think it's a long-term viable
solution<00:07:46.950> I'm<00:07:47.849> in<00:07:48.090> love<00:07:48.270> with<00:07:48.450> what<00:07:48.630> it<00:07:48.750> does

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900 
solution I'm in love with what it does

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.010 
solution I'm in love with what it does
for<00:07:49.349> people's<00:07:50.250> souls<00:07:51.000> and<00:07:51.360> their<00:07:51.599> their

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 
for people's souls and their their

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.690 
for people's souls and their their
broken<00:07:52.979> sight<00:07:53.190> keys<00:07:53.430> so<00:07:53.970> yes<00:07:54.180> I<00:07:54.360> think<00:07:54.539> it's<00:07:54.840> a

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:55.700 
broken sight keys so yes I think it's a

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.790 
broken sight keys so yes I think it's a
oh<00:07:55.760> cool<00:07:56.270> well<00:07:56.960> thank<00:07:57.110> you<00:07:57.260> very<00:07:57.380> much<00:07:57.620> for
