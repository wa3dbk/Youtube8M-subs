00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.290 
out the second before it wow weird is
that<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:34.380> does<00:03:34.770> it<00:03:35.070> appears<00:03:35.460> to<00:03:35.610> be<00:03:35.760> here<00:03:36.120> let's

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
that it does it appears to be here let's

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.490 
that it does it appears to be here let's
check<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:36.570> out<00:03:36.750> i'm<00:03:36.810> going<00:03:36.960> to<00:03:37.020> round<00:03:37.230> up<00:03:37.380> a

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
check this out i'm going to round up a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.710 
check this out i'm going to round up a
few<00:03:37.530> mobs<00:03:37.920> look<00:03:38.190> at<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.270> appears<00:03:39.300> to

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
few mobs look at that so it appears to

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.160 
few mobs look at that so it appears to
be<00:03:39.990> perhaps<00:03:40.530> maybe<00:03:41.250> on<00:03:41.550> hit<00:03:42.120> I'm<00:03:42.900> not<00:03:43.110> sure

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
be perhaps maybe on hit I'm not sure

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.140 
be perhaps maybe on hit I'm not sure
exactly<00:03:43.830> how<00:03:44.010> it's<00:03:44.190> working<00:03:44.370> but<00:03:44.670> it's<00:03:44.910> hit<00:03:45.120> in

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
exactly how it's working but it's hit in

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.660 
exactly how it's working but it's hit in
every<00:03:45.420> mob<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.050> this<00:03:46.830> is<00:03:47.040> really<00:03:47.370> cool

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
every mob and this is really cool

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.540 
every mob and this is really cool
because<00:03:47.910> as<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.710> tank<00:03:49.710> I<00:03:49.890> tend<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.190> kind<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.430> just

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
because as a tank I tend to kind of just

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.250 
because as a tank I tend to kind of just
round<00:03:50.940> everything<00:03:51.660> up<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:51.960> kill<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:55.200> I

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
round everything up and kill it so I

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.290 
round everything up and kill it so I
don't<00:03:55.410> know<00:03:55.650> if<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.220> intended<00:03:57.000> as

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
don't know if this is intended as

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.970 
don't know if this is intended as
perhaps<00:03:57.780> something<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.470> want<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.770> get

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
perhaps something that you want to get

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.500 
perhaps something that you want to get
like<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.190> buff<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.490> you'll<00:03:59.760> want<00:03:59.880> to<00:04:00.000> get<00:04:00.240> to

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
like a buff that you'll want to get to

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.660 
like a buff that you'll want to get to
make<00:04:00.660> quests<00:04:01.050> easier<00:04:01.410> maybe<00:04:02.160> it's<00:04:02.340> actually

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
make quests easier maybe it's actually

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.930 
make quests easier maybe it's actually
part<00:04:02.910> of<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.120> quest<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:04.190> mean<00:04:05.190> Jesus<00:04:05.400> if<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.760> can

queue into battle grounds with this that

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.800 
queue into battle grounds with this that
