00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.870 
going to let that come down and take
this<00:02:39.530> side<00:02:39.769> section<00:02:40.130> into<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.430> exact<00:02:40.670> same

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
this side section into the exact same

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.789 
this side section into the exact same
thing<00:02:41.180> divide<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.750> into<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.230> let<00:02:42.650> that

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
thing divide that into to let that

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.650 
thing divide that into to let that
bottom<00:02:43.190> section<00:02:43.579> fall<00:02:43.760> down<00:02:43.940> if<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.630> have

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
bottom section fall down if you have

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.839 
bottom section fall down if you have
long<00:02:44.959> hair<00:02:44.989> then<00:02:45.829> you<00:02:45.950> can<00:02:46.099> pull<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.639> up<00:02:46.669> a

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
long hair then you can pull that up a

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.159 
long hair then you can pull that up a
little<00:02:47.000> bit<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.389> crisscross<00:02:48.049> again<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:50.030> that

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:50.169 
little bit and crisscross again so that

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:54.729 
little bit and crisscross again so that
you<00:02:51.169> have<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.650> little<00:02:51.919> loop<00:02:52.790> there<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.739> then

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
you have a little loop there and then

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.319 
you have a little loop there and then
you're<00:02:54.799> going<00:02:54.919> to<00:02:54.980> pin<00:02:55.250> then<00:02:55.940> working<00:02:56.180> with

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
you're going to pin then working with

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.349 
you're going to pin then working with
this<00:02:56.630> bottom<00:02:56.989> section<00:02:57.019> here<00:02:57.650> pull<00:02:58.489> that<00:02:58.669> tail

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
this bottom section here pull that tail

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.080 
this bottom section here pull that tail
end<00:02:59.599> of<00:02:59.720> that<00:02:59.750> hair<00:03:00.079> inside<00:03:01.069> so<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.849> don't

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
end of that hair inside so you don't

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.640 
end of that hair inside so you don't
have<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.419> hanging<00:03:02.630> over<00:03:03.019> here<00:03:03.880> lonely<00:03:04.880> and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
have it hanging over here lonely and

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.940 
have it hanging over here lonely and
then<00:03:06.849> crossing<00:03:07.849> over<00:03:08.000> again<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.720> then<00:03:09.709> pin

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
then crossing over again and then pin

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.750 
then crossing over again and then pin
you<00:03:10.280> just<00:03:10.639> keep<00:03:10.819> crisscrossing<00:03:12.609> until<00:03:13.609> the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
you just keep crisscrossing until the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.650 
you just keep crisscrossing until the
ends<00:03:14.120> are<00:03:14.859> too<00:03:15.859> short<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.609> crisscross<00:03:16.849> when<00:03:17.540> it

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
ends are too short to crisscross when it

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.909 
ends are too short to crisscross when it
gets<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.959> be<00:03:17.989> short<00:03:18.260> enough<00:03:18.290> you'll<00:03:18.620> asleep

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:18.919 
gets to be short enough you'll asleep

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.670 
gets to be short enough you'll asleep
with<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.160> little<00:03:19.370> tails<00:03:19.609> out<00:03:19.790> like<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.680> so

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
with the little tails out like that so

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.339 
with the little tails out like that so
when<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:21.829> take<00:03:22.010> this<00:03:22.130> locks<00:03:22.370> section<00:03:23.349> spray

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
when you take this locks section spray

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.170 
when you take this locks section spray
and<00:03:24.680> then<00:03:25.459> we're<00:03:25.579> going<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.730> tie<00:03:25.939> a<00:03:25.969> knot<00:03:26.180> again

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
and then we're going to tie a knot again

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.229 
and then we're going to tie a knot again
then<00:03:27.689> pin<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.230> not<00:03:28.439> in<00:03:28.590> place<00:03:28.890> by<00:03:29.879> pinning

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
then pin that not in place by pinning

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.160 
then pin that not in place by pinning
the<00:03:30.269> tails<00:03:31.010> down<00:03:32.010> right<00:03:32.609> next<00:03:32.939> to<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.299> then

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
the tails down right next to it and then

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.819 
the tails down right next to it and then
you<00:03:34.319> have<00:03:34.730> these<00:03:35.730> ends<00:03:36.180> with<00:03:36.420> them<00:03:36.659> and<00:03:36.930> twist

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
you have these ends with them and twist

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.539 
you have these ends with them and twist
and<00:03:38.280> pin<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.510> then<00:03:40.379> to<00:03:40.829> finish<00:03:41.129> off<00:03:41.310> you'll

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
and pin and then to finish off you'll

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.390 
and pin and then to finish off you'll
just<00:03:41.700> spray<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.239> flyaways<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.189> smooth<00:03:44.189> the
