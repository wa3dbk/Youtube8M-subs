00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
moisturizers is that they're very

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.190 
moisturizers is that they're very
forgiving<00:02:50.800> in<00:02:51.250> color<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:51.880> say<00:02:52.540> if<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.720> turned

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
with foundation it's very very obvious

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.060 
with foundation it's very very obvious
that<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.610> doesn't<00:03:00.970> match<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.770> tinted
