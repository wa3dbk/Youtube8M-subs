00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 like 99 to all yo friends with you again 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.759
 gina elite and this is a new part of the typical 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.469
 tricks of the year five straight epic insert 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.910
 and what are we going to do today now? 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.949
 I'll show you now. I'll show you what we are. 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.760
 will we do today we are going 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.170
 in this direction we take these here booster 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.269
 Primavera you maxim these boosters 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.789
 We jump from here this welding and try 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.439
 fly to the other side of the river we will 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.480
 try to fly with glide and 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.369
 I donâ€™t know exactly how to land 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.649
 it will work out how long will we 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.690
 do but let's start well all guys 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.610
 So it's time to start, unfortunately, my horse 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.280
 today is not with me but today we have 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.079
 would be such an interesting trick itself 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.180
 so let's take the first try quickly 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.610
 still fast damn i too like that side 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.590
 Pauline okay first attempt to command and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.620
 again so I really like these 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.449
 quiet stand and which can do 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.579
 so conveniently this is what we fly with 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.739
 glide and damn it is not enough 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.229
 enough but we almost flew we almost 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.720
 flew that damn but by the law 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.299
 genre i should already do it epic 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.939
 meaning we now have all come out in the second 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.740
 Attempts here light tells you likes and 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.080
 food tells us that now with 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.200
 second try take booster yet 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:30.689
 quickly and about and right now everything will be an hour 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:33.000
 now everything will be now do not believe it 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.040
 light never but i'm alive i'm looking 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.780
 guys are not dead probably a complete moron 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.280
 but I have a feature on the table 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.810
 salt but in a glass of salt I stuck to myself 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.430
 on the finger of salt I do not know what I will do 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.680
 let's get it just a circuit maybe 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.710
 Salt we will turn out of course I am goner 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.060
 but you know, everything can help little salt 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.060
 now I will be helped to make hands 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.060
 let's try it so teaches 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.050
 I promised fence faith 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.800
 ok damn damn salt I'm 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.980
 seems to turn some kind of framework damn 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.850
 adequately let's do the trick itself 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.360
 the purpose of our video is to make the camp do 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:25.340
 there is no you will not make a tank because 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.160
 You saw what I saw friends in general 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.630
 I am a professional juggler and I tell you 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.070
 I will show you how to juggle correctly 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.500
 rather peaches 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.570
 now you will see it here 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.190
 I have what it is well in general 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.190
 let's start let's try this 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:45.040
 three three guys it's just me this 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:48.170
 I just drove so 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:53.170
 tactic is warming up 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.170
 current in the game of Anna in life and in life too 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.150
 ok enough, he has already become so soft 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.150
 Generally soft as soft 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:10.670
 and we took a sip of tea continue to do the camp 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:13.810
 actually everything is right 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.890
 neatly good wasteland and rio 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:22.459
 jump no it's too damn shit 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:27.680
 so light ear light ear takes booster 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:32.019
 both flies and flies trying not torture well 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.019
 of course I have torture attempts here 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.620

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.360
