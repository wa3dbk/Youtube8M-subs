obviously there's a demand for it there
that's<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:03.090> big<00:02:03.210> term<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.780> may<00:02:04.020> be

that's a really big term and may be

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.370 
that's a really big term and may be
competitive<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:05.939> there's<00:02:06.320> it's<00:02:07.320> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
competitive but you know there's it's a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.279 
competitive but you know there's it's a
niche<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.920> there<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.160> demand<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:10.140> that

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
niche that there is demand for so that

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.160 
niche that there is demand for so that
may<00:02:10.410> be<00:02:10.440> what<00:02:10.830> potential<00:02:11.870> industry<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.989> want

into<00:02:13.620> we<00:02:14.310> keep<00:02:14.490> going<00:02:14.730> down<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.030> list<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
into we keep going down the list and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.240 
into we keep going down the list and
we'll<00:02:16.350> find<00:02:16.560> one<00:02:16.650> that's<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.830> little<00:02:17.010> bit<00:02:17.130> less

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
we'll find one that's a little bit less

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.810 
we'll find one that's a little bit less
competitive<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:17.880> still<00:02:18.090> pretty<00:02:18.270> good<00:02:19.820> indoor

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
competitive but still pretty good indoor

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.210 
competitive but still pretty good indoor
gardening<00:02:21.240> that's<00:02:21.390> also<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> very<00:02:22.220> specific

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
gardening that's also a very specific

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.400 
gardening that's also a very specific
niche<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.570> gets<00:02:24.720> about<00:02:24.900> 80-100

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
niche and that gets about 80-100

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.140 
niche and that gets about 80-100
searches<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.160> month<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.580> now<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.760> probably<00:02:26.910> is

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
searches a month and now it probably is

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.030 
searches a month and now it probably is
not<00:02:27.270> as<00:02:27.480> seasonal<00:02:27.900> because<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.410> indoor<00:02:28.740> but

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
not as seasonal because it's indoor but

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.240 
not as seasonal because it's indoor but
um<00:02:29.660> still<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.870> good<00:02:31.080> number<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.410> people<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.070> so

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
um still a good number of people and so

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.570 
um still a good number of people and so
um<00:02:33.200> what<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.320> do<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.650> find<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.100> can<00:02:35.280> kind
