00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.540

 the Russians will not lie if something like that refused 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.050
 ranks with the most 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.350
 wonderful salon 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.619
 the most beautiful I do not know such 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.970
 acoustic sensation 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.790
 GDP in the empty hall 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.920
 I like us once 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.060
 Greece when I came to this famous 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.000
 church epigraph 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.110
 so here when I stood below and how would 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.300
 really any whisper 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.370
 he surrendered was heard as he 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.320
 the last row 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.510
 it's simple 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.220
 but money for it of course besides 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.950
 equal to the father that is very interesting 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.290
 itâ€™s even exciting what 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.180
 here's how to build it to which of this 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.180
 will turn out 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.539
 percent 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:41.889
 percent 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.909
 earlier 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.219
 and at the same time and Estonia clean 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.699
 relevant 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.369
 I was very friendly and that way 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:54.319
 didn't hit 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.509
 we have a very long time I don't know you know me on 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.819
 memory innocent gaga not very good even 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.829
 how I do not really care 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.829
 but probably it was some 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.839
 in the seventies 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:09.819
 but continued before reaching her 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.150
 positively 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.150
 late seventies but nonetheless we are with him 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.989
 have met 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:16.790
 square 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.609
 but a very good reason for loading 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.809
 for example, when was the preservation of Brodsky 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.579
 San Michele in Venice, we were with her 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.089
 also with alexander twilight 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:30.249
 then tense some concerts in 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.809
 particular japan her visit is chicago 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.079
 did not play with the light of the event however 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.779
 double concert controversy 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.169
 with the artist gewandhaus
