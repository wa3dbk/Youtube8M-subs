Hey guys how are you?

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.229
I'm Guillermo Vera

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.520
This is not me right now

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.540
But today we are gonna talk about Romania

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:29.080
Last year i had an amazing trip to Romania's capital city, Bucharest and today i'm gonna tell you guys everything about it

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:37.340
Romania is a country located on Eastern Europe. Their currency is the Romanian Leu and it equals around 4 Mexican Pesos

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.260
Their capital it's Bucharest and the official language is the Romanian

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.160
Romania It's a country with around 20 Million inhabitants and an incredible culture

00:00:49.600 --> 00:01:02.020
To stay in Bucharest i recommend Green Frog Hostel there you can get a shared room from around 20 Euro on a very clean and nice place

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:13.200
If we wanna travel around to another city on the country or to a neighbor country we can use Gara de Nord Train station located nearby the city center

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.980
There you will find train tickets of 1st second or premium class starting on very low prices

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:30.180
The heart and city center its a place called Old Town there you will find most of the pubs, strip clubs, restaurants and food courts and you will have a lot of fun

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.120
I took the task to explore the whole place and this is what i found

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:44.940
Inside Old Town we will find multiple options to eat in 24/7 like local places where you can get turkish cheap food called Shawarma

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.820
Or also we can found subway or Carrefour Mall opened 24 hours a day

00:01:50.200 --> 00:02:02.740
Night life on the city is located actually here in Old Town where you will find music and clubs for every kind of taste and every age

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:13.020
All tough this and with no doubt my favorite place to be in was a magic place called kulturhaus

00:02:13.658 --> 00:02:21.318
Kulturhaus is a place where most of the attendees are students thus its a vey cheap option for your pocket

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.780
All tough the music and ambiance there is amazing 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:34.380
It's a very recommendable and nice place and i can assure you that you will find an unforgettable time until 8 AM (the time they close)

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.360
Also the girls who frequent that place are spectacular

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:53.200
On a general level, Romania a very beauty, cheap and recommendable destination so if you have the opportunity go and visit it

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:05.980
