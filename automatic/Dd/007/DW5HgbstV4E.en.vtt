because it's such a lowly me okay and
will<00:02:13.860> be<00:02:13.980> more<00:02:14.190> reserved<00:02:14.640> wine<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.510> also<00:02:16.080> is

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
will be more reserved wine and also is

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.230 
will be more reserved wine and also is
it<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.770> change<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.310> flavor<00:02:17.550> profile<00:02:18.210> a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
it going to change the flavor profile a

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.260 
it going to change the flavor profile a
lot<00:02:18.680> where<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.890> will<00:02:20.100> find<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.550> flavors<00:02:21.090> can

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
lot where you will find that flavors can

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.750 
lot where you will find that flavors can
be<00:02:21.480> pretty<00:02:21.750> intense<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.890> if<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.190> think<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.670> we

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
be pretty intense so if I think that we

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.600 
be pretty intense so if I think that we
can<00:02:23.910> expect<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.780> 2008<00:02:25.440> Asmodeus<00:02:26.280> would<00:02:26.460> be

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
can expect the 2008 Asmodeus would be

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.150

code room we have totally eliminated the
use<00:04:17.570> of<00:04:17.600> dry<00:04:17.930> ice<00:04:18.100> so<00:04:19.100> now<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.340> can<00:04:19.820> see<00:04:20.000> when

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
use of dry ice so now you can see when

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.500 
use of dry ice so now you can see when
terror<00:04:20.600> starts<00:04:21.020> doing<00:04:21.260> is<00:04:21.410> punch<00:04:21.709> down<00:04:21.950> here

gallery I mean it doesn't go on the oak

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.750 
gallery I mean it doesn't go on the oak
so<00:06:20.349> it<00:06:20.470> doesn't<00:06:20.740> pick<00:06:20.919> up<00:06:21.010> many<00:06:21.190> colors<00:06:21.280> from
