00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
question generally most people say by

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.560 
question generally most people say by
3,000<00:00:24.300> miles<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:25.070> three<00:00:26.070> months<00:00:26.250> your<00:00:27.029> oil<00:00:27.269> sit

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
3,000 miles or three months your oil sit

3,000 miles or three months your oil sit
in<00:00:27.689> your<00:00:27.810> car<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.880> that's<00:00:29.880> pretty<00:00:30.150> good

estimate I mean kind of depends on your
car<00:00:33.660> depends<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> oil<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.770> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
car depends on the oil but you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.229

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
because you know the way I might have

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.090 
because you know the way I might have
jumped<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.049> down<00:01:07.170> or<00:01:07.590> might<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.890> rubbed

jumped up and down or might have rubbed
against<00:01:08.400> something<00:01:09.080> just<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.170> get<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> clean

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
against something just to get a clean

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.730 
against something just to get a clean
read<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.159> wipe<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.850> off<00:01:11.970> first<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:13.409> put<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
read so wipe it off first you put it

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.840 
read so wipe it off first you put it
back<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:16.100> make<00:01:17.100> sure<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.340> goes<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.670> way

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
back in make sure it goes all the way

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
back in make sure it goes all the way
back<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.509> then<00:01:19.020> pull<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.500> right<00:01:19.890> back<00:01:20.070> out

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
back in and then pull it right back out

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.840 
back in and then pull it right back out
and<00:01:21.020> there<00:01:22.020> should<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> level<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.740> there<00:01:22.950> for

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and there should be a level on there for

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.590 
and there should be a level on there for
example<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:25.880> this<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.090> looks<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.360> little

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
example this one this one looks a little

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.929 
example this one this one looks a little
low<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.590> little<00:01:28.829> place<00:01:29.009> marker<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.820> this

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
low it's a little place marker on this

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.920 
low it's a little place marker on this
one<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.299> says<00:01:30.540> add<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.650> safe<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.420> safe<00:01:33.689> is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
one that says add and safe so safe is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.929 
one that says add and safe so safe is
going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.350> obviously<00:01:35.040> you're<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.880> be

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
going to be obviously you're going to be

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.660 
going to be obviously you're going to be
good<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.390> oil<00:01:36.570> fits<00:01:37.110> below<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.130> ad<00:01:38.310> line

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
good on your oil fits below the ad line

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.910 
good on your oil fits below the ad line
and<00:01:39.079> obviously<00:01:40.079> want<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.350> go<00:01:40.409> ahead<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.740> add

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and obviously want to go ahead and add

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.880 
and obviously want to go ahead and add
some<00:01:41.130> oil<00:01:41.450> but<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:42.689> our<00:01:42.720> purposes<00:01:43.710> we're

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
some oil but for our purposes we're

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.410 
some oil but for our purposes we're
going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.189> ahead<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.369> change<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.970> oil<00:01:45.030> so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
going to go ahead and change the oil so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.620 
going to go ahead and change the oil so
that's<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.470> good<00:01:46.619> way<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> monitor<00:01:48.329> this

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
that's a good way to go to monitor this

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.060 
that's a good way to go to monitor this
every<00:01:48.990> once<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.320> while<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> make<00:01:50.040> sure

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
every once a while just to make sure

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.410 
every once a while just to make sure
that<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.399> get<00:01:50.490> enough<00:01:50.729> oil<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.090> there<00:01:51.270> because

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that you get enough oil in there because

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.450 
that you get enough oil in there because
if<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.409> too<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:52.979> oil<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
if you if you have too little oil I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.810 
if you if you have too little oil I
could<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:53.759> damage<00:01:54.149> your<00:01:54.299> car<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.820> that's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
could really damage your car so that's

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.030
