00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.559
 we go 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.930
 Now you can get cameras with a 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.030
 super zoom in various sizes is more 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.490
 You can find those with different 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.710
 scopes in small cameras other than 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.320
 the most complete, as is the case with 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.520
 nike with l 830 which has a zoom 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.990
 34 x optical and equivalent focal 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.310
 22.5 to seven hundred and sixty-five 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.840
 millimeters 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.700
 I am salt and neiman for cinema is in 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.710
 Spanish and this camera you can 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.930
 find for a price of around 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.989
 $ 250 in terms of their 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.969
 features the lens of the 830 l is 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.249
 a bit slow when taking pictures in 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.379
 low light but the body is big and you 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.570
 lets have more control and keep you 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.239
 firmer when it comes to taking your photos 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.579
 another feature is that it uses batteries 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.949
 double to which is something rare in these 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.109
 times however this could 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.879
 work in circumstances where no 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.949
 you can recharge the battery easily and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.479
 approachable mind this camera is 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.030
 practically to be used in 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.979
 automatic only so if you're 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.890
 in search of having more control over the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.510
 final result the l8 30 is not for you 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.729
 apart from that it does not have a viewer either 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.830
 electronic so you'll have to trust 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.260
 on the lcd screen to frame your 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.869
 photographs and while this may be 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.850
 good in conditions of much light will be 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.010
 hard to see what's going on 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.710
 performance of this in general is good at 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.810
 this class of cameras but the autofocus 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.729
 definitely needs more time 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.860
 when the lens is extended or in 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.470
 low light conditions as well as 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.020
 indoors what we could conclude 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.509
 is that this camera may not be the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.970
 best option to capture children who are 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.100
 move fast or pets and more than anything 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.050
 when you are using the zoom while 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.420
 The quality of the photos in the low ones does not 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.940
 are the most are better than others 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.130
 cameras with mega zoom and what it is that 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.170
 this camera shines when you take pictures in 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.450
 outside where the light conditions 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.090
 they're good so using it on those 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.490
 Cases you will have great photos and good video 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.190
 I am zalingei man and this was a first 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.190
 look at the nikon coolpix l 830
