00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
know how to do this process but

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.700 
know how to do this process but
basically<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:27.750> you're<00:01:28.020> gonna<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.470> take

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
basically all you're gonna do is take

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.960 
basically all you're gonna do is take
your<00:01:28.860> wheels<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.340> everything<00:01:29.579> off<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> bike

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
but remember it's your beater so if you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.539 
but remember it's your beater so if you
get<00:01:31.380> stripper<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.710> some<00:01:31.950> other<00:01:32.070> parts<00:01:32.400> it

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
get stripper on some other parts it

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.230 
get stripper on some other parts it
doesn't<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:32.909> matter

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
doesn't really matter

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.999 
doesn't really matter
spray<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> all<00:01:34.110> over<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.380> frame<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.619> let<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
spray it all over the frame and let the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.469 
spray it all over the frame and let the
chemical<00:01:35.369> work<00:01:35.549> now<00:01:35.970> look<00:01:36.119> at<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.270> back<00:01:36.390> of

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
chemical work now look at the back of

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
chemical work now look at the back of
your<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:37.020> probably<00:01:37.259> take<00:01:37.439> about<00:01:37.530> 15<00:01:37.950> or<00:01:38.130> 20

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
your can if probably take about 15 or 20

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.219 
your can if probably take about 15 or 20
minutes<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> desired<00:01:39.299> effect<00:01:39.479> where

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
