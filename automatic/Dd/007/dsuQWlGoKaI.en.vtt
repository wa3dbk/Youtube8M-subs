00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.169
 we are going to occupy a bag of jamaica 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.930
 it is very dry this is which in 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.059
 any store is fine so in 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.380
 bags and they have near it in the 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:31.570
 consistency 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.410
 this is what we are going to do is that what 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:39.250
 we are going to put and this is to throw ourselves as a 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.579
 red water we are going to occupy a cup of 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.170
 sugar 3 liters of water this is just what 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.980
 I put here as a sample but we're going to 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.850
 back liters ice and a fret in that 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.850
 make the water 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.540
 in a fret we are going to put a liter of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.840
 water and well there we will add what 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.880
 that is the maica we are going to put it to the fire 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.440
 here grass and this is going to draw a water 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:19.710
 completely red and this the truth that 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.640
 you have left like for 6 liters of water 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.540
 only one envelope because the truth that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.540
 It is very very 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.890
 It is very efficient 7 in the correct boiler 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.729
 this is very yielding and achieves 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.600
 pretty much up to two days and good 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.600
 already once this is boiling look 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.750
 is the consistency so there is already one 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.940
 Once it's boiling, we're going to 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.660
 to pay for fire let's let 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.530
 rest a while and in a separate fret 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.800
 let's strain this mixture to give 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.160
 everything what are the leaves that 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.550
 they bring and well once they're strained 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.900
 we're going to let it cool 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.209
 completely because we can not do it 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.830
 so hot and you do not have to be 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.830
 completely cold 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.379
 well here I have the essence of what 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.080
 it's cold jamaica and I'm going to add it 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:35.430
 here to the fret 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.740
 this is pure concentrate this is we are 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.580
 strong good let's add the 3 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.580
 liters of water 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:56.170
 we add the sugar 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.420
 and we move sugar well, sugar is 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.120
 the amount you want depends 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.930
 If they want something simple or want it 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.450
 very sweet that is already optional the ice 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.640
 they are always put at the end of sugar 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.849
 always because if you put him in front of the ice 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.620
 or put cold water on the sugar in the water 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.170
 from jamaica does not grab good at any 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.720
 drink always the water has to be a 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.150
 the time 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.860
 or not offer but not cold because if not 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.590
 will not give the sugar and last the heavens 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.360
 once we rectify that it is already 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.819
 well of sugar then we already have 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.060
 our water and serve us with the ico pico 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.959
 this type of jamaica water apart from 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.780
 being diuretic supposedly helps us to 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.719
 lose weight and it's a lot more 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.290
 refreshing that some kind of juices or 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.290
 sodas 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.790
 and also has the properties that 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.920
 reduces cholesterol and good this this 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.980
 kind of water we always take it 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.020
 for the hot season that is when more 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.200
 it seems and the truth is that if 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.020
 you realize 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.450
 what I put at cost pays a lot 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.319
 quite pretty can you give up 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.100
 to make water twice a week 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.109
 then it 's very cheap too 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.590
 imagine apart from delicious cheap 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.090
 well 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:29.120
 what else can we ask for age and ready now 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.660
 serve my jamaica water and look with it 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.580
 and all I hope you liked it I hope 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.400
 do it the truth that it is well rich 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.270
 well delicious remember that come more 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.360
 recipes 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.530
 of waters of different flavors many 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.600
 people add the lemon also to this 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.080
 water from jamaica but I'm not going to 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.940
 add lemon because I think this already 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.880
 it's a bit acidic to add 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.830
 still a little more acid as well as 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.740
 that they no longer remember to follow me 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.940
 instagram and here I am going to leave you the 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.520
