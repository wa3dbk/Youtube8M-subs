00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.800
 &lt;i&gt; A storm is approaching. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.100
 It sounds like you're looking forward to it. 

00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:28.602
 &lt;i&gt; I'm adaptable. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:00:30.603 --> 00:00:31.723
 &lt;i&gt; DE CHRISTOPHER NOLAN &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:33.764
 &lt;i&gt; What are you? &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:35.605
 I'm the Gothic account setting. 

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:56.606
 They killed him? 

00:00:57.707 --> 00:00:58.907
 I'm not sure. 

00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:03.608
 Why do not you kill me at once? 

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:05.909
 Your punishment must be more severe. 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.610
 HOPE IS LOST 

00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:10.811
 Do you think he will come back? 

00:01:13.313 --> 00:01:14.013
 &lt;i&gt; I do not know. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:19.914
 &lt;i&gt; Why did you run? Why Bane? &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.814
 You should fear him as much as I do. 

00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:25.014
 FAITH IS BROKEN 

00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:27.014
 I will not bury you 

00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:31.014
 I've buried enough members of the Wayne family. 

00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:33.314
 A FIRE WILL RISE 

00:01:36.014 --> 00:01:38.814
 You do not owe these people anymore. 

00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:43.514
 You have given everything. 

00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:46.414
 Not all. 

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:48.114
 Not yet. 

00:01:50.014 --> 00:01:51.014
 THE 20TH OF JULY 

00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:53.514
 THE EPIC CONCLUSION 

00:01:57.314 --> 00:01:58.314
 FROM THE LEGEND OF THE KNIGHT OF THE NIGHT 

00:02:08.614 --> 00:02:11.014
 My mother warned me to get into cars with strange men. 

00:02:11.514 --> 00:02:12.614
 This is not a car.
