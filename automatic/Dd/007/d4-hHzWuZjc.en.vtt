00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
we come here today we're gonna show you

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.300 
we come here today we're gonna show you
how<00:00:12.170> we<00:00:13.170> can<00:00:13.500> separate<00:00:13.980> water<00:00:14.719> and<00:00:15.719> oil<00:00:16.310> this

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
how we can separate water and oil this

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:30.830 
how we can separate water and oil this
is<00:00:17.520> what<00:00:17.760> I'm<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:22.939> close<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:30.029> your<00:00:30.300> problem

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
is what I'm so close to so your problem

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.340 
is what I'm so close to so your problem
of<00:00:31.140> separating<00:00:31.980> these<00:00:32.340> two<00:00:32.700> liquids<00:00:33.350> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
of separating these two liquids the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.770 
of separating these two liquids the
colorless<00:00:34.890> liquids<00:00:35.309> water<00:00:35.610> which<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.239> denser

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
colorless liquids water which is denser

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.750 
colorless liquids water which is denser
and<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.920> oil<00:00:38.160> which<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.540> top<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:41.579> you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and the oil which is on top so what you

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.360 
and the oil which is on top so what you
do<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.600> use<00:00:43.040> the<00:00:44.040> separating<00:00:44.820> funnel

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
do is we use the separating funnel

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.150 
do is we use the separating funnel
so<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.550> separating<00:00:48.090> funnel<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.829> see

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so this separating funnel as you can see

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.869 
so this separating funnel as you can see
I<00:00:51.469> will<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.770> close<00:00:53.960> close<00:00:55.399> this<00:00:56.399> tab<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
I will have to close close this tab to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.959 
I will have to close close this tab to
prevent<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.020> coming<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.670> then<00:00:59.940> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
prevent it from coming up and then I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.009 
prevent it from coming up and then I
will<00:01:00.359> pour<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.930> in

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
will pour it in

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:23.630 
will pour it in
this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.409> oil<00:01:05.960> okay<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.130> can

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.760 

now<00:01:24.640> yes<00:01:25.060> some<00:01:25.780> water<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.930> what<00:01:32.140> when<00:01:32.560> we

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
now yes some water and so what when we

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.140 
now yes some water and so what when we
do<00:01:32.950> is<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:34.720> will<00:01:35.230> then<00:01:36.360> open<00:01:37.360> this<00:01:39.150> separating

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
do is we will then open this separating

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.390 
do is we will then open this separating
from<00:01:40.330> you<00:01:40.600> you'll<00:01:41.380> find<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:41.800> usually

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
from you you'll find that usually

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.810 
from you you'll find that usually
there's<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.180> stopper<00:01:43.680> top<00:01:44.680> death<00:01:44.980> stopper<00:01:45.490> has

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
there's a stopper top death stopper has

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.210 
there's a stopper top death stopper has
will<00:01:46.090> be<00:01:46.120> removed<00:01:46.570> even<00:01:47.230> the<00:01:47.530> stopper<00:01:47.800> were

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
will be removed even the stopper were

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.580 
will be removed even the stopper were
there<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:49.540> they<00:01:49.720> were<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:50.020> stop<00:01:50.230> over<00:01:50.560> there

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
there if they were to stop over there

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.300 
there if they were to stop over there

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
and then I open you will find it after

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.210 
and then I open you will find it after
sometime<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.740> would<00:01:56.920> even<00:01:57.220> come<00:01:57.430> off<00:01:58.680> okay<00:01:59.680> so

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
I have to remove the stopper so that the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.870 
I have to remove the stopper so that the
water<00:02:04.450> will<00:02:04.720> come<00:02:04.930> out<00:02:05.080> when<00:02:05.230> you<00:02:05.350> see<00:02:05.880> alright

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
you is to give you this diagram and have

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.670 
you is to give you this diagram and have
a<00:02:12.130> stopper<00:02:12.550> there<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.210> they<00:02:14.050> will<00:02:14.230> ask<00:02:14.470> you

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
a stopper there and they will ask you

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.610 
a stopper there and they will ask you
what<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.010> wrong<00:02:15.310> with<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.910> setup<00:02:16.620> so

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
what is wrong with the setup so

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.990 
what is wrong with the setup so
something<00:02:18.070> that's<00:02:18.250> wrong<00:02:18.460> with<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.730> setup

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
something that's wrong with the setup

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.730 
something that's wrong with the setup
means<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.600> stopper<00:02:19.840> was<00:02:20.200> not<00:02:20.380> removed

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
means the stopper was not removed

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.410 
means the stopper was not removed
because<00:02:21.610> if<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.270> do<00:02:22.480> remove<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:24.420> water

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
because if you do remove this water

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.260 
because if you do remove this water
would<00:02:25.900> not<00:02:26.080> check<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:26.470> out<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:27.070> if<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.270> remove

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
would not check it out but if you remove

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.330 
would not check it out but if you remove
this<00:02:28.540> can<00:02:29.020> you<00:02:29.110> see<00:02:29.140> I'm<00:02:29.410> going<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.740> lift<00:02:29.980> up<00:02:30.130> my

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
this can you see I'm going to lift up my

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.360 
this can you see I'm going to lift up my
thumb<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:32.230> water<00:02:32.590> starts<00:02:33.100> coming<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:36.130> there

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
thumb the water starts coming so there

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.610 
thumb the water starts coming so there
you<00:02:36.490> are<00:02:36.750> now<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.810> have<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:39.900> waste<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:41.260> little

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
you are now you have to waste a little

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.010 
you are now you have to waste a little
bit<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:42.420> water<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:45.670> have<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.940> whistle<00:02:46.150> evyatar

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
bit of water you have to whistle evyatar

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.370 
bit of water you have to whistle evyatar
so<00:02:47.380> what<00:02:47.560> comes<00:02:47.770> out<00:02:48.010> here<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.489> pure<00:02:49.060> water

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
so what comes out here is pure water

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.910 
so what comes out here is pure water
okay<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.650> with<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.459> little<00:02:51.850> bit<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.090> water<00:02:52.920> with

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
okay so with a little bit of water with

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.479 
okay so with a little bit of water with
a<00:02:53.950> little<00:02:54.130> bit<00:02:54.459> of<00:02:54.489> water<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.709> now<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:57.010> let

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
a little bit of water and now you let

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.840 
a little bit of water and now you let
the<00:02:57.640> oil<00:02:57.820> come<00:02:58.270> true<00:02:59.130> so<00:03:00.130> what's<00:03:00.370> going<00:03:00.820> to

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
the oil come true so what's going to

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.150 
the oil come true so what's going to
come<00:03:01.060> true<00:03:01.620> will<00:03:02.620> be<00:03:02.920> oil<00:03:03.520> in<00:03:04.330> you<00:03:04.600> more<00:03:04.840> water

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
come true will be oil in you more water

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.610 
come true will be oil in you more water
so<00:03:06.160> what's<00:03:06.400> going<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.640> come<00:03:06.820> true<00:03:07.120> is<00:03:08.080> now<00:03:10.620> and

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
so what's going to come true is now and

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.290 
so what's going to come true is now and
oil<00:03:11.980> as<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.520> can<00:03:12.760> see<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.840> more<00:03:14.230> viscous<00:03:14.530> oh<00:03:15.010> no

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
oil as you can see is more viscous oh no

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.800 
oil as you can see is more viscous oh no
this<00:03:16.300> case<00:03:16.630> means<00:03:16.989> that<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.500> flows<00:03:17.890> slower<00:03:18.810> so

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
this case means that it flows slower so

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.900 
this case means that it flows slower so
frozen<00:03:20.200> water<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.489> then<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.270> are<00:03:22.470> coming<00:03:23.470> to

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
frozen water and then you are coming to
