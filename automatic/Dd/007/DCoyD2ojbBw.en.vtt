00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
weapon charges up change it into holes

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.459

as<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.820> know<00:00:53.940> weapons<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.750> dwell<00:00:55.230> wind

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
as you know weapons like dwell wind

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.069 
as you know weapons like dwell wind
one-handed<00:00:56.039> unstuff<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.239> charge<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.719> hood

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
so when you hold range you start

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.209 
so when you hold range you start
charging<00:01:00.870> you're<00:01:01.079> ready<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> tag<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.949> when

soon<00:02:18.569> too<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:19.049> mean<00:02:19.890> I'm<00:02:20.069> afraid<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.730> reducing

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
soon too I mean I'm afraid of reducing

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.210 
soon too I mean I'm afraid of reducing
my<00:02:21.269> marks<00:02:21.659> on<00:02:22.019> what<00:02:22.319> was<00:02:22.500> because<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.040> could

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
my marks on what was because I could

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.089 
my marks on what was because I could
probably<00:02:23.489> do<00:02:23.879> stand<00:02:23.939> for<00:02:24.269> nothing<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.950> then<00:02:25.950> I

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
probably do stand for nothing and then I

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.600 
probably do stand for nothing and then I
just<00:02:26.430> think<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.790> myself<00:02:26.819> okay<00:02:28.310> let's<00:02:29.310> think

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
just think to myself okay let's think

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.970 
just think to myself okay let's think
that<00:02:29.790> maybe<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.689> weapon<00:02:31.140> chain<00:02:31.439> these<00:02:31.709> are

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
that maybe this weapon chain these are

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.369 
that maybe this weapon chain these are
just<00:02:32.430> one<00:02:32.730> step<00:02:32.760> before<00:02:33.359> the<00:02:33.659> weapon<00:02:33.930> mastery

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
just one step before the weapon mastery

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.410 
just one step before the weapon mastery
but<00:02:34.709> then<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.189> same<00:02:35.400> logic<00:02:35.790> remains<00:02:36.120> in

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
but then the same logic remains in

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.660 
but then the same logic remains in
theses<00:02:37.049> have<00:02:37.319> previous<00:02:37.769> weeks<00:02:38.040> before<00:02:38.400> weapon

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
theses have previous weeks before weapon

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.819 
theses have previous weeks before weapon
mastery<00:02:39.060> don't<00:02:39.629> release<00:02:39.930> these<00:02:40.170> changes<00:02:40.620> yet

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
mastery don't release these changes yet

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.429 
mastery don't release these changes yet

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
implement it together because they're

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.869
