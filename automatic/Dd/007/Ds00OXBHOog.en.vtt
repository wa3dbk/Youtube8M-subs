00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.360
 well hello everyone with you eddie and you know 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.700
 that noticed quite a while there were no reviews on 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.070
 any skins so today in what 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.859
 show the main character's skin somewhere 3 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.660
 these are friends claude but what do we let him 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.029
 select using the skin selector and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.760
 you know that he has several options 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.859
 there is a white jersey there is such 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.099
 version of the type gta 4 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.730
 there is another option points both on the prison 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.829
 option friends are in costume 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.820
 This is seven or eight options there is Claude 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.620
 But this body is a couple of Claude skins. 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.690

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.340
 famous hero many like 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.510
 here you know the type of Franklin is the same shirt 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.750
 like Franklin's T- shirt from gta 5 then 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.030
 just wearing a black cap but this is my 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.420

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.080

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.210
 probably changing gameplay gattas 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.520

 It is interesting that CJ understand he of course 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.420
 good character but he bothers too 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.590
 sometimes you want to play for other Persians 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.110

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.810

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.240

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.610

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.860

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.840

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.799
 such know for the fleet ordinary 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.720
 prison suit well, and so do all 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.380
 see the quality at the highest level and 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.170
 textures 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.750
 there are no problems in the hands like everything is 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.659
 normal weapon pistols shotguns 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.380
 machines and you can safely run on 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.450

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.050
 I know there to steal cars to play already for 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.760
 Claude on the device and yes you can of course in 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.120
 films there shoot who is keen 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.099
 such things like the movie claud all things 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.040
 but as they say everyone has their own 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.030
 applications for all these skins 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.160
 installation is very easy can 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.940
 throw or throw up the director 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.640
 or in gta3.img notice ordinary pedestrians 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.330
