well here it is my new house it actually
I<00:00:15.910> didn't<00:00:16.180> check<00:00:16.510> to<00:00:16.689> see<00:00:16.900> how<00:00:17.020> long<00:00:17.170> it<00:00:17.349> took

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
I didn't check to see how long it took

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.679 
I didn't check to see how long it took
us<00:00:17.650> to<00:00:17.800> put<00:00:17.950> it<00:00:18.040> together<00:00:18.189> I<00:00:18.610> don't<00:00:19.450> know<00:00:19.570> when

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
us to put it together I don't know when

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.929 
us to put it together I don't know when
we<00:00:19.810> started<00:00:20.230> but<00:00:20.439> I'm<00:00:21.009> thinking<00:00:21.520> it<00:00:21.670> took<00:00:21.849> a

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
we started but I'm thinking it took a

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.010 
we started but I'm thinking it took a
good<00:00:22.150> 40<00:00:22.599> minutes<00:00:23.220> at<00:00:24.220> least<00:00:24.750> but<00:00:25.750> it's<00:00:25.900> the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
good 40 minutes at least but it's the

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.250 
good 40 minutes at least but it's the
first<00:00:26.170> time<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:27.150> now<00:00:28.150> that<00:00:28.449> I<00:00:28.480> know<00:00:29.020> where<00:00:29.230> all

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
first time and now that I know where all

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.920 
first time and now that I know where all
the<00:00:29.560> poles<00:00:29.830> go<00:00:30.160> and<00:00:30.310> everything<00:00:30.779> next<00:00:31.779> time

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
the poles go and everything next time

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.360 
the poles go and everything next time
will<00:00:32.050> be<00:00:32.169> much<00:00:32.349> easier<00:00:32.590> but<00:00:32.949> it<00:00:33.070> definitely

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
will be much easier but it definitely

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.780 
will be much easier but it definitely
takes<00:00:33.940> two<00:00:34.360> people<00:00:34.739> who<00:00:35.739> are<00:00:35.949> at<00:00:36.129> least<00:00:36.430> five

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
takes two people who are at least five

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.520 

it's<00:01:07.080> pretty<00:01:07.380> high<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.590> there<00:01:07.770> sweet<00:01:08.310> all<00:01:08.580> I

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.649 

so<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.370> haven't<00:01:17.549> put<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> center<00:01:18.150> divider<00:01:18.270> up

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
so I haven't put the center divider up

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.830 
so I haven't put the center divider up
yet<00:01:19.220> to<00:01:20.220> divide<00:01:20.490> these<00:01:20.700> rooms<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.510> there

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
yet to divide these rooms but there

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.820 
yet to divide these rooms but there
you've<00:01:21.990> got<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> inside<00:01:25.800> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you've got it so this is the inside of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.030 
you've got it so this is the inside of
the<00:01:26.040> tent<00:01:26.369> with<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.090> room<00:01:27.540> divider<00:01:27.830> hooked<00:01:28.830> up

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the tent with the room divider hooked up

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.100 
the tent with the room divider hooked up
and<00:01:30.140> as<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.440> can<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.430> doesn't<00:01:33.330> completely

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and as you can see it doesn't completely

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.710 
and as you can see it doesn't completely
separate<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.680> rooms<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:36.270> doesn't

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
separate the rooms because it doesn't

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.520 
separate the rooms because it doesn't
zip<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.530> bottom<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.750> wouldn't<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.320> much

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
zip on the bottom so it wouldn't do much

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.420 
zip on the bottom so it wouldn't do much
in<00:01:40.770> terms<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.280> creating<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.800> smaller<00:01:43.800> room<00:01:44.130> that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
in terms of creating a smaller room that

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.910 
in terms of creating a smaller room that
would<00:01:44.550> stay<00:01:44.820> warmer<00:01:45.240> I've<00:01:46.020> been<00:01:46.440> concerned

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
would stay warmer I've been concerned

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.040 
would stay warmer I've been concerned
about<00:01:48.170> whether<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:50.100> tent<00:01:50.429> might<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:51.050> chilly

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
about whether this tent might be chilly

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.490 
about whether this tent might be chilly
and<00:01:52.759> we<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.940> yet<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.570> evening

hooking that last hook at the apex of
the<00:03:25.230> room<00:03:25.379> divider<00:03:26.540> haha<00:03:27.569> that<00:03:28.410> took<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.739> feat<00:03:28.950> I

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
the room divider haha that took a feat I

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:37.640 
the room divider haha that took a feat I
was<00:03:29.970> like<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.090> ballerina<00:03:32.390> okay<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:36.530> should<00:03:37.530> say

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
was like a ballerina okay I should say

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.589 
was like a ballerina okay I should say
it<00:03:37.709> was<00:03:37.739> quite<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.069> feat<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:38.640> here's<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.450> back

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
it was quite a feat so here's the back

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.620 
it was quite a feat so here's the back
room<00:03:39.840> it's<00:03:40.019> got<00:03:40.170> this<00:03:40.319> window<00:03:41.180> here<00:03:42.180> at<00:03:42.360> the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
room it's got this window here at the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:52.479 
room it's got this window here at the
back<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:45.049> another<00:03:46.049> window<00:03:46.230> here

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.600 

so<00:03:54.470> originally<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.500> thought<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.099> back<00:03:56.310> room

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
so originally I thought the back room

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.850 
so originally I thought the back room
would<00:03:56.849> be<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:57.150> bedroom

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
would be the bedroom

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.559 
would be the bedroom
but<00:03:58.860> because<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.790> way<00:03:59.909> that<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.209> ground

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
but because of the way that the ground

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.780 
but because of the way that the ground
is<00:04:01.110> it<00:04:01.500> turns<00:04:01.769> out<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.189> ground<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.579> most

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
is it turns out that the ground is most

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.350 
is it turns out that the ground is most
level<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.360> this<00:04:04.079> second<00:04:04.470> room<00:04:04.620> here<00:04:04.950> so<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:06.150> will

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
level in this second room here so I will

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.580

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
the morning this is my view when I get

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.330 
the morning this is my view when I get
up<00:04:48.479> and<00:04:48.630> have<00:04:49.470> a<00:04:49.500> cup<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:49.740> hot<00:04:49.860> cocoa<00:04:50.190> or

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.400 

so<00:04:57.970> we'll<00:04:58.240> see<00:04:58.450> how<00:04:58.600> it<00:04:58.720> holds<00:04:58.870> up<00:04:59.140> it's

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
so we'll see how it holds up it's

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.010 
so we'll see how it holds up it's
supposed<00:04:59.710> to<00:04:59.800> rain<00:05:00.040> tomorrow<00:05:00.690> we<00:05:01.690> put<00:05:01.900> the

supposed to rain tomorrow we put the
rain<00:05:02.200> fly<00:05:02.500> on<00:05:03.390> there's<00:05:04.390> a<00:05:04.480> tarp<00:05:04.750> underneath

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
rain fly on there's a tarp underneath

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.390 
rain fly on there's a tarp underneath
optimally<00:05:07.150> we'll<00:05:07.360> have<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:08.040> platform<00:05:09.040> you

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
optimally we'll have a platform you

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.100 
optimally we'll have a platform you
would<00:05:09.520> have<00:05:09.640> a<00:05:09.670> platform<00:05:09.940> and<00:05:10.360> now<00:05:10.840> that<00:05:11.020> we

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
would have a platform and now that we

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.130 
would have a platform and now that we
know<00:05:11.160> exactly<00:05:12.160> how<00:05:12.310> big<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.610> tent<00:05:12.820> is<00:05:13.140> we're

know exactly how big the tent is we're
going<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.440> build<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:15.010> platform<00:05:15.220> to<00:05:15.850> put<00:05:16.060> it<00:05:16.150> up

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
going to build a platform to put it up

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
but Tuesday is going to be a test to see

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.590 
but Tuesday is going to be a test to see
how<00:05:22.750> well<00:05:22.930> it<00:05:22.960> holds<00:05:23.260> up<00:05:23.530> underwater<00:05:24.330> we<00:05:25.330> took

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
how well it holds up underwater we took

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.720 
how well it holds up underwater we took
quite<00:05:25.840> a<00:05:25.900> bit<00:05:26.080> of<00:05:26.140> time<00:05:26.500> to<00:05:27.130> choose<00:05:27.520> the

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
quite a bit of time to choose the

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.090 
quite a bit of time to choose the
location<00:05:27.940> and<00:05:28.630> walked<00:05:29.530> around<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.950> property

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
location and walked around the property

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.260 
location and walked around the property
quite<00:05:30.940> a<00:05:31.000> bit<00:05:31.890> trying<00:05:32.890> to<00:05:32.980> predict<00:05:33.340> where<00:05:34.150> the

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
quite a bit trying to predict where the

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.860 
quite a bit trying to predict where the
water<00:05:34.510> would<00:05:34.720> flow<00:05:36.030> so<00:05:37.030> that<00:05:37.060> I<00:05:37.270> don't<00:05:37.570> end<00:05:37.720> up

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
water would flow so that I don't end up

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.560 
water would flow so that I don't end up
sitting<00:05:38.230> in<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:39.040> middle<00:05:39.190> of<00:05:39.370> some<00:05:40.090> kind<00:05:40.420> of
