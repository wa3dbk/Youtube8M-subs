hi everybody this is done in the compost
guy<00:00:03.899> Christie<00:00:04.350> again<00:00:04.589> I<00:00:04.970> mistakenly<00:00:05.970> turned

guy Christie again I mistakenly turned

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.250 
guy Christie again I mistakenly turned
off<00:00:06.450> my<00:00:06.480> video<00:00:07.130> part<00:00:08.130> way<00:00:08.280> through<00:00:09.050> last<00:00:10.050> time

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
off my video part way through last time

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.759 
off my video part way through last time
so<00:00:11.190> I'm<00:00:11.370> just<00:00:11.519> going<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.700> sort<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.000> continue

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
so I'm just going to sort of continue

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.680 
so I'm just going to sort of continue
where<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:14.179> where<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.210> left<00:00:15.480> off<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:17.090> am<00:00:18.090> scraping

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
where I where I left off I am scraping

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
where I where I left off I am scraping
as<00:00:19.590> mentioned<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> last<00:00:20.550> one<00:00:20.850> I'm

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
as mentioned in the last one I'm

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.830 
as mentioned in the last one I'm
scraping<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.650> vermicompost<00:00:23.539> out<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
scraping the vermicompost out of the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.849 
scraping the vermicompost out of the
bottom<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.609> this<00:00:26.609> warm<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.320> smells<00:00:28.619> great

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
bottom of this warm and it smells great

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.560 
bottom of this warm and it smells great
it<00:00:30.830> it<00:00:31.830> looks<00:00:32.130> quite<00:00:32.460> good<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.860> advantage<00:00:35.250> of

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
it it looks quite good the advantage of

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.180 
it it looks quite good the advantage of
this<00:00:36.570> type<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.260> system<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.920> flow-through

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
this type of system and the flow-through

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.880 
this type of system and the flow-through
system<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.030> general<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:40.559> you're<00:00:40.770> getting

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
system in general is that you're getting

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.240 
system in general is that you're getting
an<00:00:41.280> awful<00:00:41.760> lot<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> air<00:00:42.239> flow<00:00:42.950> down<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
an awful lot of air flow down in the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.190 
an awful lot of air flow down in the
bottom<00:00:44.610> which<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.120> different<00:00:46.020> from

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
bottom which is is different from

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.209 
bottom which is is different from
something<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.309> plastic<00:00:47.969> rubbermaid<00:00:48.629> bin

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
something like a plastic rubbermaid bin

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
something like a plastic rubbermaid bin
just<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.550> those<00:00:50.820> are<00:00:51.090> tend<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.840> be

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
just because those are tend to be

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.130 
just because those are tend to be
enclosed<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.360> airflow<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.600> really<00:00:54.989> really

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
enclosed and airflow is really really

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.709 
enclosed and airflow is really really
important<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.860> helps<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> speed<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
important it helps to speed up the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.840 
important it helps to speed up the
vermicompost<00:00:58.050> process<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.520> helps<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
vermicompost process and it helps the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.450 
vermicompost process and it helps the
result<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.920> a<00:01:01.920> nicer<00:01:02.340> more<00:01:02.879> stabilized

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
result in a nicer more stabilized

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.630 
result in a nicer more stabilized
compost<00:01:05.460> which<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.090> used<00:01:07.310> more<00:01:08.310> quickly

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
compost which can be used more quickly

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.910 
compost which can be used more quickly
or<00:01:08.939> more<00:01:09.409> sooner<00:01:10.409> than<00:01:11.930> then<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.380> material

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
or more sooner than then the material

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.410 
or more sooner than then the material
that<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.130> might<00:01:14.430> get<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> bottom<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
that you might get out of the bottom of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.050 
that you might get out of the bottom of
a<00:01:15.540> plastic<00:01:16.170> bin<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.680> used<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.460> tangled<00:01:17.790> up

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
a plastic bin can be used so tangled up

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.340 
a plastic bin can be used so tangled up
in<00:01:18.210> something<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.750> don't<00:01:18.930> know<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.229> on

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
in something here I don't know what on

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.749 
in something here I don't know what on
