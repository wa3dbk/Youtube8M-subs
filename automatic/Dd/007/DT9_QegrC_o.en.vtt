question to me because if you have a

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.910 
question to me because if you have a
consumer-grade<00:01:19.240> camera<00:01:19.930> you<00:01:20.380> probably<00:01:20.409> only

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
consumer-grade camera you probably only

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.080

have a single mic input you know mic

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.940 
have a single mic input you know mic
inputs<00:01:25.510> are<00:01:25.660> only<00:01:25.870> on<00:01:26.080> certain<00:01:26.530> models<00:01:26.650> of

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
inputs are only on certain models of

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.920 
inputs are only on certain models of
camcorders<00:01:27.490> as<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.790> is<00:01:27.880> consumer<00:01:28.330> camcorders

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
camcorders as it is consumer camcorders

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.420

pocket<00:01:52.210> camera<00:01:52.390> made<00:01:52.690> by<00:01:52.720> Kodak<00:01:53.290> as<00:01:53.470> currently

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
pocket camera made by Kodak as currently

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.890 
pocket camera made by Kodak as currently
discontinued<00:01:54.550> but<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.330> can<00:01:55.480> find<00:01:55.659> it<00:01:55.780> online

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
discontinued but you can find it online

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.860 
discontinued but you can find it online
in<00:01:56.260> a2<00:01:56.409> as<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.740> microphone<00:01:57.190> input<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.540> these

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
in a2 as a microphone input and these

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.970 
in a2 as a microphone input and these
are<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:58.990> couple<00:01:59.080> of<00:01:59.230> microphones<00:01:59.470> that<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.800> use

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
are a couple of microphones that I use

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.790 
are a couple of microphones that I use
so<00:02:00.100> this<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.340> audio-technica<00:02:00.700> ATR<00:02:01.560> 35<00:02:02.560> s

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
so this is the audio-technica ATR 35 s

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.440 
so this is the audio-technica ATR 35 s
it's<00:02:03.070> a<00:02:03.159> clip-on<00:02:03.520> microphone<00:02:04.060> as<00:02:04.150> you<00:02:04.240> see

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
it's a clip-on microphone as you see

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.600 
it's a clip-on microphone as you see
right<00:02:04.630> there<00:02:05.050> I<00:02:05.229> mean<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:05.979> takes<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.280> battery

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
right there I mean it takes a battery

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.300 
right there I mean it takes a battery
which<00:02:06.790> goes<00:02:07.450> in<00:02:07.690> that<00:02:07.840> little<00:02:08.080> area<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.679> it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
which goes in that little area and it

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.990 
which goes in that little area and it
has<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:09.519> 3.5<00:02:09.909> millimeter<00:02:10.739> male<00:02:11.739> plug<00:02:12.129> and<00:02:12.459> then

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
has a 3.5 millimeter male plug and then

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.899 
has a 3.5 millimeter male plug and then
it<00:02:13.120> has<00:02:13.209> an<00:02:13.330> on<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.720> off<00:02:13.780> switch<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:14.920> it's

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
it has an on and off switch and so it's

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.369 
it has an on and off switch and so it's
a<00:02:15.970> great<00:02:16.150> mic<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.569> then<00:02:16.659> I<00:02:16.750> even<00:02:16.989> like<00:02:17.140> even

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
a great mic and then I even like even

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.869 
a great mic and then I even like even
better<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.739> Radio<00:02:18.010> Shack<00:02:18.330> 33<00:02:19.409> 30:13<00:02:20.700> which<00:02:21.700> is

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
better the Radio Shack 33 30:13 which is

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.729 
better the Radio Shack 33 30:13 which is
again<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.330> lapel<00:02:22.690> mic<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.170> also<00:02:23.319> takes<00:02:23.590> a

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
again a lapel mic it also takes a

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.199 
again a lapel mic it also takes a
battery<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.220> quality<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.760> little<00:02:25.090> bit

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
battery the quality is a little bit

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.990 
battery the quality is a little bit
better<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.480> think<00:02:25.629> than<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.140> audio<00:02:26.890> technica

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
better I think than the audio technica

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.700 
better I think than the audio technica
and<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.750> again<00:02:29.050> has<00:02:29.200> an<00:02:29.320> on<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.620> off<00:02:29.650> switch

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
and it again has an on and off switch

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.700 
and it again has an on and off switch
alright<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:31.990> solution<00:02:32.320> that<00:02:32.680> I

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
alright so this is the solution that I

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.500 
alright so this is the solution that I
found<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.310> Y<00:02:33.490> adapter<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:34.120> found<00:02:34.390> it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
found this is the Y adapter I found it

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.170 
found this is the Y adapter I found it
at<00:02:34.600> RadioShack<00:02:34.960> and<00:02:35.530> it's<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.490> little<00:02:36.880> device

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
at RadioShack and it's a little device

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.830 
at RadioShack and it's a little device
that<00:02:37.210> takes<00:02:38.130> two<00:02:39.130> inputs<00:02:39.460> they<00:02:40.450> plug<00:02:40.690> into

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
that takes two inputs they plug into

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.600 
that takes two inputs they plug into
those<00:02:40.990> female<00:02:41.320> terminals<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.010> this<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.520> how

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
those female terminals and this is how

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.120 
those female terminals and this is how
you<00:02:42.670> connect<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.380> alright<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.530> take<00:02:44.740> your<00:02:44.920> Y

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
you connect it alright so take your Y

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.550 
you connect it alright so take your Y
adapter<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.750> will<00:02:46.960> plug<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.440> the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
adapter and I will plug in the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.710 
adapter and I will plug in the
microphones<00:02:48.100> first<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.790> this<00:02:49.030> alright<00:02:49.540> so

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
microphones first to this alright so

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.260 
microphones first to this alright so
plug<00:02:49.930> each<00:02:50.050> one<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:50.820> these<00:02:51.820> are<00:02:52.000> mono

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
plug each one in these are mono

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.600 
plug each one in these are mono
microphones<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:57.010> then<00:02:57.160> once<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.400> have<00:02:57.460> them

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
microphones and then once you have them

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.280 
microphones and then once you have them
plugged<00:02:57.880> in<00:02:58.300> plug<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.870> into<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.200> mic<00:02:59.470> in

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
plugged in plug it into the mic in

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
plugged in plug it into the mic in
alright<00:03:02.290> be<00:03:02.470> kind<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.710> gentle<00:03:02.890> with<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:03.220> you

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
alright be kind of gentle with it you

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.010 
alright be kind of gentle with it you
don't<00:03:03.370> want<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.640> stress<00:03:03.880> out<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.300> jack<00:03:04.870> or

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
don't want to stress out that jack or

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.750 
don't want to stress out that jack or
that<00:03:05.140> input<00:03:05.350> cuz<00:03:05.770> that<00:03:06.190> would<00:03:06.310> be<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.460> problem

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
that input cuz that would be a problem

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.840 
that input cuz that would be a problem
and<00:03:07.120> it's<00:03:07.750> really<00:03:08.110> that<00:03:08.500> simple<00:03:08.530> alright<00:03:09.190> so

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
and it's really that simple alright so

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.280 
and it's really that simple alright so
now<00:03:09.970> let's<00:03:10.210> check<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.660> out

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.090 

five<00:03:17.290> four<00:03:17.620> three<00:03:17.650> two<00:03:17.860> one

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
five four three two one

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.180 
five four three two one
okay<00:03:18.460> so<00:03:18.520> now<00:03:18.850> I<00:03:18.880> am<00:03:19.120> testing<00:03:19.840> out<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.860> audio

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
okay so now I am testing out the audio

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.080 
okay so now I am testing out the audio
technica<00:03:22.140> 8035<00:03:23.140> s<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:24.070> hopefully<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.790> sounds

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
technica 8035 s and hopefully it sounds

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.660 
technica 8035 s and hopefully it sounds
loud<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.690> clear<00:03:25.990> and<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:27.070> if<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.460> was<00:03:27.640> the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
loud and clear and so if I was the

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.410 
loud and clear and so if I was the
talent<00:03:28.150> or<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.560> host<00:03:29.730> host<00:03:30.730> ur<00:03:30.880> talents<00:03:31.300> the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
talent or the host host ur talents the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.360 
talent or the host host ur talents the
same<00:03:31.600> thing<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:32.739> would<00:03:33.040> run<00:03:33.190> this

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
same thing but I would run this

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.949 
same thing but I would run this
microphone<00:03:33.760> first<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.150> all<00:03:34.209> up<00:03:34.420> from<00:03:34.840> the

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
microphone first of all up from the

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.360 
microphone first of all up from the
bottom<00:03:35.350> of<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.560> shirt<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:35.950> collar<00:03:36.220> and

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
bottom of the shirt to the collar and

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.590 
bottom of the shirt to the collar and
then<00:03:36.459> clip<00:03:36.670> it<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:36.880> because<00:03:37.030> we<00:03:37.150> want<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.450> hide

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
then clip it on because we want to hide

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.930 
then clip it on because we want to hide
the<00:03:37.750> wire<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.310> also<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.370> want<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:39.730> have<00:03:39.820> his

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
the wire and also you want to have his

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.060 
the wire and also you want to have his
poly<00:03:40.150> framed<00:03:40.390> is<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.540> two<00:03:40.810> shot<00:03:40.840> if<00:03:41.230> both<00:03:41.440> the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
poly framed is a two shot if both the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.520 
poly framed is a two shot if both the
talent<00:03:42.520> and<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:43.060> host<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.110> interview<00:03:44.440> we

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
talent and the host and the interview we

interviewee so you would mic them up
with<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.320> other<00:03:50.530> microphone<00:03:51.340> this<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.420> the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
with the other microphone this is the

Radio Shack 33 0 13 microphone so

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.830 
Radio Shack 33 0 13 microphone so
hopefully<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:57.670> again<00:03:57.970> sounds<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.510> loud<00:03:58.660> and

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
hopefully it again sounds a loud and

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.240 
hopefully it again sounds a loud and
clear<00:03:58.989> on<00:03:59.110> speaking<00:03:59.350> directly<00:03:59.560> into<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.100> and

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
clear on speaking directly into it and

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.250 
clear on speaking directly into it and
you<00:04:00.730> would<00:04:00.850> run<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.060> microphone<00:04:01.420> again<00:04:01.630> up

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
you would run the microphone again up

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.080 
you would run the microphone again up
from<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.680> bottom<00:04:03.070> of<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.459> shirt<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.880> top

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
and clip it on the interviewee and then

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.550 
and clip it on the interviewee and then
you'll<00:04:06.760> get<00:04:06.940> great<00:04:07.209> sound<00:04:07.480> using<00:04:07.810> one<00:04:08.260> Jack
