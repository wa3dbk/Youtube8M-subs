to go that's the spare choke these are

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.109 
to go that's the spare choke these are
the<00:02:06.719> valves<00:02:06.990> okay<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.500> Dave<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.759> drop<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the valves okay so Dave you you drop the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.699 
the valves okay so Dave you you drop the
valve<00:02:09.330> because<00:02:09.929> there<00:02:10.050> was<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.200> guide<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.590> was

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
valve because there was a guide that was

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.620 
valve because there was a guide that was
messed<00:02:10.950> up<00:02:11.129> basically

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
messed up basically

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.670 
messed up basically
well<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:16.040> exhaust<00:02:17.040> valve<00:02:18.000> seat<00:02:18.510> broke<00:02:19.470> up

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
well the exhaust valve seat broke up

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.990 
well the exhaust valve seat broke up
okay

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
okay

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.810 
okay
so<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.270> had<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.660> replace<00:02:21.900> valves<00:02:22.380> but<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.980> didn't

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
so I had to replace valves but I didn't

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.500 
so I had to replace valves but I didn't
also<00:02:23.910> replace<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.450> guides

and<00:05:38.350> we<00:05:38.800> have<00:05:39.010> one<00:05:39.840> cylinder<00:05:40.840> barrel<00:05:41.470> here<00:05:41.800> on

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
and we have one cylinder barrel here on

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.850 
and we have one cylinder barrel here on
the<00:05:42.370> right<00:05:42.550> side<00:05:42.880> so<00:05:43.240> what<00:05:43.750> are<00:05:44.170> the<00:05:44.320> gaskets

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
the right side so what are the gaskets

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.080 
the right side so what are the gaskets
here<00:05:45.130> Dave<00:05:45.340> there's<00:05:45.910> a<00:05:46.110> gasket<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.850> 1/16<00:05:48.850> inch

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
here Dave there's a gasket a 1/16 inch

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.150 
here Dave there's a gasket a 1/16 inch
aluminum<00:05:49.420> compression<00:05:50.230> plate<00:05:50.470> and<00:05:50.860> another

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
aluminum compression plate and another

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.090 
aluminum compression plate and another
gasket<00:05:52.050> no<00:05:53.050> you<00:05:53.200> said<00:05:53.440> that<00:05:53.560> you<00:05:53.680> did<00:05:53.950> the

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
gasket no you said that you did the

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.010 
gasket no you said that you did the
gasket<00:05:54.640> material<00:05:55.120> yourself<00:05:55.540> yeah<00:05:55.840> the

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
gasket material yourself yeah the

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.630 
gasket material yourself yeah the
pressure<00:05:56.290> plate<00:05:56.620> now<00:05:56.770> is<00:05:56.830> per<00:05:57.100> compression

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
pressure plate now is per compression

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.310 
pressure plate now is per compression
plate<00:05:57.850> been<00:05:58.210> compressed<00:05:58.630> is<00:05:58.870> that<00:05:58.990> something

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
plate been compressed is that something

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.170 
plate been compressed is that something
we're<00:05:59.410> gonna<00:05:59.560> run<00:05:59.830> a<00:05:59.860> half<00:06:00.070> no<00:06:00.310> it's<00:06:00.820> just<00:06:00.970> to

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
we're gonna run a half no it's just to

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.560 
we're gonna run a half no it's just to
reduce<00:06:01.420> the<00:06:01.480> compression<00:06:02.110> ratio<00:06:02.230> oh<00:06:03.570> you're

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
reduce the compression ratio oh you're

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.090 
reduce the compression ratio oh you're
supposed<00:06:04.630> to<00:06:04.900> be<00:06:04.960> able<00:06:05.050> to<00:06:05.170> take<00:06:05.380> it<00:06:05.560> out<00:06:05.680> but

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
supposed to be able to take it out but

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.650 
supposed to be able to take it out but
if<00:06:06.250> you<00:06:06.340> do<00:06:06.520> take<00:06:06.760> it<00:06:06.940> out<00:06:07.030> you're<00:06:07.360> gonna<00:06:07.420> lose

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
if you do take it out you're gonna lose

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.950 
if you do take it out you're gonna lose
you<00:06:08.110> lose<00:06:08.980> reliability<00:06:09.960> no<00:06:12.600> so<00:06:13.600> should<00:06:13.780> we<00:06:13.810> put

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
you lose reliability no so should we put

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.460 
you lose reliability no so should we put
an<00:06:14.200> extra<00:06:14.440> one<00:06:14.590> in<00:06:14.710> there<00:06:14.890> and<00:06:15.040> nobody<00:06:19.470> stirred

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
an extra one in there and nobody stirred

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.140 
an extra one in there and nobody stirred
so<00:06:21.130> so<00:06:21.370> far<00:06:21.640> so<00:06:22.030> good<00:06:22.060> on<00:06:23.020> the<00:06:23.350> tear<00:06:23.620> down<00:06:24.150> that

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
so so far so good on the tear down that

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.960 
so so far so good on the tear down that
barrel<00:06:25.390> came<00:06:25.630> up<00:06:25.810> real<00:06:26.140> nice<00:06:26.860> I<00:06:27.190> don't<00:06:27.460> see<00:06:27.910> the

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
barrel came up real nice I don't see the

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.070 
barrel came up real nice I don't see the
little<00:06:28.150> bit<00:06:28.780> of<00:06:30.300> yeah<00:06:31.300> it's<00:06:31.570> not<00:06:31.720> to<00:06:31.960> the

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
little bit of yeah it's not to the

put oil here and there and squirted here
and<00:06:42.850> there<00:06:43.000> and<00:06:43.120> carve<00:06:43.300> it<00:06:43.390> up<00:06:43.450> a<00:06:43.540> bunch<00:06:43.750> of

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
and there and carve it up a bunch of

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.110 
and there and carve it up a bunch of
stuff<00:06:44.080> and<00:06:44.380> when<00:06:45.040> I<00:06:45.070> got<00:06:45.310> it<00:06:45.460> it<00:06:45.580> was<00:06:45.610> free<00:06:46.090> that

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
stuff and when I got it it was free that

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.300 
stuff and when I got it it was free that
was<00:06:46.360> eight<00:06:46.510> years<00:06:46.540> ago<00:06:46.840> when<00:06:47.169> I<00:06:47.260> fogged<00:06:47.650> it<00:06:47.890> as

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
was eight years ago when I fogged it as

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.909 
was eight years ago when I fogged it as
well<00:06:48.550> and<00:06:48.910> it<00:06:49.330> looks<00:06:49.510> like<00:06:49.690> our<00:06:50.230> efforts<00:06:50.740> to

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 
well and it looks like our efforts to

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.650 
well and it looks like our efforts to
keep<00:06:51.100> it<00:06:51.250> from<00:06:51.540> getting<00:06:52.540> stuck<00:06:53.110> has<00:06:53.560> proven

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
keep it from getting stuck has proven

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.740 
keep it from getting stuck has proven
worthwhile<00:06:55.660> so<00:06:55.930> Cheers
