what<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.960> payment<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.789> it<00:01:25.789> will<00:01:25.999> be<00:01:26.149> twenty

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
what the payment is it will be twenty

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.859 
what the payment is it will be twenty
dollars<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.789> for<00:01:28.789> each<00:01:28.999> figure<00:01:29.389> you<00:01:29.509> buy<00:01:29.689> at

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
dollars and for each figure you buy at

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.599 
dollars and for each figure you buy at
that<00:01:30.020> price<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:30.380> will<00:01:30.679> get<00:01:30.770> another<00:01:31.100> one<00:01:31.340> for

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.450 
that price you will get another one for
15<00:01:32.119> I<00:01:32.389> think<00:01:33.229> of<00:01:33.319> it<00:01:33.439> as<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.619> buy<00:01:33.950> one<00:01:34.189> get<00:01:34.399> one

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
15 I think of it as a buy one get one

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.429 
15 I think of it as a buy one get one
offer<00:01:34.789> a<00:01:34.909> buy<00:01:35.119> one<00:01:35.389> for<00:01:35.569> twenty<00:01:35.869> get<00:01:36.079> a<00:01:36.109> second

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
offer a buy one for twenty get a second

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.039 
offer a buy one for twenty get a second
one<00:01:36.499> for<00:01:36.679> 15<00:01:37.069> it<00:01:37.700> used<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.329> be<00:01:38.539> that<00:01:38.869> all

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
one for 15 it used to be that all

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.590 
one for 15 it used to be that all
following<00:01:39.679> figures<00:01:40.159> would<00:01:40.369> be<00:01:40.520> fifteen<00:01:41.030> but

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
following figures would be fifteen but

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.879 
following figures would be fifteen but
then<00:01:41.749> I<00:01:41.840> started<00:01:42.079> to<00:01:42.170> have<00:01:42.319> problems<00:01:42.799> with

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:42.889 
then I started to have problems with

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:45.639 
then I started to have problems with
people<00:01:42.950> who<00:01:43.880> order<00:01:44.299> like<00:01:44.479> five<00:01:44.749> six<00:01:45.229> seven

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
people who order like five six seven

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.219 
people who order like five six seven
figures<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.579> I<00:01:46.880> had<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.209> make<00:01:47.359> them<00:01:47.539> all<00:01:47.780> for

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
figures and I had to make them all for

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.529 
figures and I had to make them all for
the<00:01:48.319> lower<00:01:48.469> rate<00:01:48.829> and<00:01:49.039> I<00:01:49.490> felt<00:01:50.119> I<00:01:50.209> was<00:01:50.240> being

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
the lower rate and I felt I was being

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.139 
the lower rate and I felt I was being
taken<00:01:50.719> advantage<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:52.850> will

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
taken advantage of so this will

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.389 
taken advantage of so this will
hopefully<00:01:53.450> keep<00:01:54.020> people<00:01:54.770> from<00:01:54.950> asking<00:01:55.159> for

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
hopefully keep people from asking for

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.190 
hopefully keep people from asking for
less<00:01:55.729> than<00:01:55.939> four<00:01:56.389> or<00:01:56.749> you<00:01:57.380> know<00:01:57.469> maximum<00:01:57.950> for

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
less than four or you know maximum for

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.590 
less than four or you know maximum for
either<00:02:00.200> either<00:02:00.439> way<00:02:00.649> you<00:02:00.979> know<00:02:01.359> once<00:02:02.359> your

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
either either way you know once your

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.719 
either either way you know once your
figure<00:02:02.929> is<00:02:03.079> packed<00:02:03.349> into<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.709> box<00:02:04.039> which<00:02:04.369> is<00:02:04.549> in
