futures while they're doing and where
they're<00:04:28.220> going<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:29.330> they're<00:04:29.540> not<00:04:29.690> lost<00:04:30.110> out

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
there so it's just it's just a good

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.880 
there so it's just it's just a good
group<00:04:32.690> of<00:04:32.810> people<00:04:32.870> they're<00:04:33.560> going<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.770> give

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
them the best that they can academics

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.810 
them the best that they can academics
are<00:04:35.870> good<00:04:36.080> they<00:04:36.710> expect<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.280> little<00:04:37.400> more<00:04:37.550> out

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
are good they expect a little more out

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.120 
are good they expect a little more out
of<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.000> kids<00:04:38.240> I<00:04:38.600> think<00:04:39.260> then<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.650> lot<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:40.010> other

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
of the kids I think then a lot of other

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.920 
of the kids I think then a lot of other
schools<00:04:40.490> do<00:04:40.730> they<00:04:41.030> don't<00:04:41.180> give<00:04:41.420> up<00:04:41.600> on<00:04:41.780> the

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
schools do they don't give up on the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.740 
schools do they don't give up on the
kids<00:04:42.340> lately<00:04:43.340> are<00:04:43.610> always<00:04:43.940> offering<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.570> help

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
kids lately are always offering to help

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.960 
kids lately are always offering to help
after<00:04:45.050> school<00:04:45.530> and<00:04:45.920> their<00:04:46.010> own<00:04:46.160> time<00:04:46.520> for

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
after school and their own time for

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.840 
after school and their own time for
hours<00:04:47.380> so<00:04:48.380> I<00:04:48.410> think<00:04:48.500> that<00:04:48.920> if<00:04:49.250> you<00:04:49.640> have<00:04:49.820> a

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
hours so I think that if you have a

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.360 
hours so I think that if you have a
child<00:04:50.120> that<00:04:50.360> goes<00:04:50.540> here<00:04:50.830> there's<00:04:51.830> no<00:04:52.040> reason

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
child that goes here there's no reason

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.250 
child that goes here there's no reason
for<00:04:52.580> failure<00:04:52.730> they<00:04:53.180> don't<00:04:53.330> set<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.780> kids<00:04:54.110> up

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
for failure they don't set the kids up

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.740 
for failure they don't set the kids up
for<00:04:54.410> failure<00:04:54.620> they<00:04:54.920> set<00:04:55.100> them<00:04:55.220> up<00:04:55.340> for<00:04:55.370> success

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
for failure they set them up for success

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.230 
for failure they set them up for success
