Gupta has been looking into this a new
study<00:00:19.550> shows<00:00:19.670> just<00:00:20.210> exactly<00:00:20.510> what<00:00:20.750> it<00:00:20.869> is<00:00:20.900> what

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
study shows just exactly what it is what

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.779 
study shows just exactly what it is what
did<00:00:21.289> it<00:00:21.380> fine<00:00:21.560> well<00:00:21.920> that's<00:00:22.279> very<00:00:22.519> interesting

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
did it fine well that's very interesting

did it fine well that's very interesting
a<00:00:23.000> study<00:00:23.210> out<00:00:23.269> of<00:00:23.359> Denmark<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:23.960> first<00:00:24.230> of<00:00:24.320> all

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
a study out of Denmark and first of all

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.689 
a study out of Denmark and first of all
I<00:00:24.410> think<00:00:24.619> a<00:00:24.740> lot<00:00:24.890> of<00:00:24.920> people<00:00:25.009> do<00:00:25.340> use<00:00:25.519> their

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
I think a lot of people do use their

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.089 
I think a lot of people do use their
cell<00:00:25.880> phones<00:00:26.119> despite<00:00:26.599> those<00:00:26.810> signing<00:00:27.380> you

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
cell phones despite those signing you

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.290 
cell phones despite those signing you
know<00:00:28.160> I've<00:00:28.220> use<00:00:28.429> it<00:00:28.550> in<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.730> hospital<00:00:28.939> every

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
know I've use it in the hospital every

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.579 
know I've use it in the hospital every
now<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:29.630> then<00:00:29.720> my<00:00:29.810> blackberry<00:00:30.259> or<00:00:30.320> something

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
now and then my blackberry or something

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.800 
now and then my blackberry or something
like<00:00:30.710> that<00:00:30.769> not<00:00:31.130> not<00:00:31.820> in<00:00:31.970> certain<00:00:32.240> areas<00:00:32.360> as

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
like that not not in certain areas as

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.020 
like that not not in certain areas as
you<00:00:32.990> mentioned<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.470> ICU<00:00:33.890> for<00:00:34.100> example<00:00:34.550> but<00:00:35.000> a

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
you mentioned the ICU for example but a

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.580 
you mentioned the ICU for example but a
lot<00:00:35.180> of<00:00:35.240> people<00:00:35.539> do<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:36.170> I<00:00:36.200> think<00:00:36.230> that<00:00:36.469> they

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
lot of people do and I think that they

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.959 
lot of people do and I think that they
weren't<00:00:36.920> sure<00:00:37.280> there<00:00:37.520> was<00:00:37.610> actually<00:00:37.910> an

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
weren't sure there was actually an

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.790 
weren't sure there was actually an
effect<00:00:38.300> here<00:00:38.539> but<00:00:39.140> it<00:00:39.230> turns<00:00:39.379> out<00:00:39.500> there<00:00:39.680> is<00:00:39.770> a

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
effect here but it turns out there is a

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.139 
effect here but it turns out there is a
new<00:00:39.980> study<00:00:40.190> out<00:00:40.280> of<00:00:40.460> Denmark<00:00:40.640> actually

turn it back on and it can also turn
feeding<00:01:26.750> tube<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.170> people<00:01:27.470> who<00:01:27.530> have<00:01:27.650> feeding

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
feeding tube so people who have feeding

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.319 
feeding tube so people who have feeding
tube<00:01:28.189> opponents<00:01:28.640> is<00:01:28.729> it<00:01:28.909> a<00:01:28.970> ventilator

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
tube opponents is it a ventilator

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.179 
tube opponents is it a ventilator
something<00:01:29.630> with<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.780> hard<00:01:30.079> switch<00:01:30.500> on<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:30.860> yeah

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
something with a hard switch on it yeah

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.560 
something with a hard switch on it yeah
you<00:01:31.250> think<00:01:31.579> I<00:01:31.759> mean<00:01:31.880> I'm<00:01:31.970> not<00:01:32.090> sure<00:01:32.240> what<00:01:32.420> the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
you think I mean I'm not sure what the

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.910 
you think I mean I'm not sure what the
signal<00:01:32.930> is<00:01:33.049> of<00:01:33.200> somehow<00:01:33.409> it's<00:01:33.619> interfering

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
signal is of somehow it's interfering

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.590 
signal is of somehow it's interfering
with<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.220> signal<00:01:34.549> somewhere<00:01:34.970> but<00:01:35.509> it

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
with the signal somewhere but it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.539 
with the signal somewhere but it
actually<00:01:35.750> sent<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.229> signal<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:36.920> mechanical

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
actually sent a signal to the mechanical

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.460 
actually sent a signal to the mechanical
ventilator<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.060> turn<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:38.630> off<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:38.780> basically

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
ventilator and turn it off and basically

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.660 
ventilator and turn it off and basically
what<00:01:39.619> they<00:01:39.740> did<00:01:39.890> was<00:01:39.950> they<00:01:40.009> just<00:01:40.250> held<00:01:40.490> these

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
what they did was they just held these

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.850 
what they did was they just held these
phones<00:01:41.030> within<00:01:41.780> three<00:01:42.229> feet<00:01:42.259> away<00:01:42.590> they

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
phones within three feet away they

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.319 
phones within three feet away they
weren't<00:01:43.220> even<00:01:43.399> talking<00:01:43.790> on<00:01:44.119> them<00:01:44.299> just

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
weren't even talking on them just

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.630 
weren't even talking on them just
holding<00:01:44.869> him<00:01:44.960> on<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.560> seeing<00:01:46.340> what<00:01:46.460> kind<00:01:46.579> of

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
holding him on and seeing what kind of

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.370 
holding him on and seeing what kind of
electromagnetic<00:01:47.270> interference<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.290> was

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
electromagnetic interference it was

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.889 
electromagnetic interference it was
causing<00:01:48.740> is<00:01:48.890> there<00:01:49.280> any<00:01:49.430> particular<00:01:49.659> model<00:01:50.659> of

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
causing is there any particular model of

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.840 
causing is there any particular model of
phone<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:52.040> worse<00:01:52.250> than<00:01:52.399> others<00:01:52.549> I<00:01:52.790> know

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
phone that is worse than others I know

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.639 
phone that is worse than others I know
