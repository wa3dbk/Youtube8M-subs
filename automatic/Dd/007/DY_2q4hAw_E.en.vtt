would<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.420> well<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.170> do<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.469> just

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
would we do that well you do that just

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.049 
would we do that well you do that just
by<00:00:40.950> pressing<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.340> B<00:00:41.460> button<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.030> have

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
by pressing the B button when you have

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.970 
by pressing the B button when you have
nice<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.480> close<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.840> man<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.739> key

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
nice and close to you man but the key

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.380 
nice and close to you man but the key
with<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.250> really<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.579> timing<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.059> that's<00:00:45.239> true

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
with it really is timing and that's true

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.430 
with it really is timing and that's true
of<00:00:45.420> all<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> tackles<00:00:46.020> we're<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> talk

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
of all the tackles we're going to talk

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.170 
of all the tackles we're going to talk
about<00:00:46.559> today<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.280> commit<00:00:47.520> too<00:00:47.730> soon<00:00:47.969> or

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
about today if you commit too soon or

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.670 
about today if you commit too soon or
too<00:00:48.210> early<00:00:48.390> then<00:00:48.750> you're<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> be

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
too early then you're really going to be

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.840 
too early then you're really going to be
in<00:00:49.770> trouble<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.309> probably<00:00:50.370> give<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
in trouble and probably give you a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.939 
in trouble and probably give you a
opponent<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> free<00:00:51.840> run<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> goal<00:00:52.710> so

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
opponent a free run of the goal so

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.260 
opponent a free run of the goal so
you've<00:00:53.370> got<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.579> get<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.760> timing<00:00:53.969> right<00:00:54.210> and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
you've got to get that timing right and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.400 
you've got to get that timing right and
with<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> standing<00:00:54.870> tackle<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.289> when

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
with the standing tackle it's when

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.720 
with the standing tackle it's when
you're<00:00:55.530> nice<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.680> close<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.489> you're<00:00:56.579> sure

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you're nice and close and you're sure

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.650 
you're nice and close and you're sure
that<00:00:56.910> you're<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> four<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
that you're going to get a four on the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.209 
that you're going to get a four on the
ball<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.410> you're<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.590> close<00:00:58.829> enough<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
ball so if you're not close enough and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.529 
ball so if you're not close enough and
you<00:00:59.280> don't<00:00:59.309> want<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> slide<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.300> should<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
you don't want to slide what should you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.599 
you don't want to slide what should you
do<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:01.230> should<00:01:01.440> continue<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> contain<00:01:02.340> or

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
do we should continue to contain or

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.250 
do we should continue to contain or
jockey<00:01:02.910> them<00:01:03.449> until<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:04.049> nice<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
jockey them until you do get nice and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.690 
jockey them until you do get nice and
close<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> man<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:05.100> once<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.549> are

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
close to the man and then once you are

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.580 
close to the man and then once you are
hopefully<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> game<00:01:06.479> will<00:01:06.630> perform<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.229> kind

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
hopefully the game will perform a kind

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.929 
hopefully the game will perform a kind
of<00:01:07.650> auto<00:01:07.860> tackle<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.610> which<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> really

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
of auto tackle for you which is really

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.370 
of auto tackle for you which is really
my<00:01:09.270> preferred<00:01:09.540> method<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.930> win<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> ball<00:01:10.350> back

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
my preferred method of win the ball back

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
my preferred method of win the ball back
now<00:01:11.010> auto<00:01:11.369> tackle<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:11.880> something<00:01:12.150> you'd

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
now auto tackle is not something you'd

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.700 
now auto tackle is not something you'd
see<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> instruction<00:01:13.080> manual<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
see in the instruction manual but it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.670 
see in the instruction manual but it
does<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:14.729> part<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> defensive<00:01:16.080> AI<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.350> will

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
does as part of the defensive AI it will

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.740 
does as part of the defensive AI it will
tackle<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:17.729> behalf<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.299> absolutely

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
tackle on your behalf in it absolutely

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.179 
tackle on your behalf in it absolutely
and<00:01:18.960> that's<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:19.920> about<00:01:19.950> it

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
and that's what I really like about it

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.320 
and that's what I really like about it
because<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.460> leaves<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.759> free<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> think

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
because it leaves you free to think

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.760 
because it leaves you free to think
about<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> direction<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> movement<00:01:22.680> of

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
about the direction and the movement of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.440 
about the direction and the movement of
your<00:01:22.860> defending<00:01:23.280> player<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:24.180> worrying

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
your defending player and not worrying

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.600 
your defending player and not worrying
too<00:01:24.540> much<00:01:24.750> about<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.200> time<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
too much about what time to go for the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.990 
too much about what time to go for the
tackle

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
tackle

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.429 
tackle
obviously<00:01:27.570> there<00:01:27.689> are<00:01:27.720> occasions<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
obviously there are occasions when you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.810 
obviously there are occasions when you
need<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.590> actually<00:01:28.979> manually<00:01:29.340> tell<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> game

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
need to actually manually tell the game

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.910 
need to actually manually tell the game
yes<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.210> want<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.390> tackle<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.560> lot<00:01:31.890> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
yes I want to tackle now but a lot of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.990 
yes I want to tackle now but a lot of
the<00:01:32.040> time<00:01:32.220> you'll<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.400> able<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:32.909> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the time you'll be able to just to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.980 
the time you'll be able to just to
concentrate<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> movement<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
concentrate on the movement and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.390 
concentrate on the movement and
positioning<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:34.590> get<00:01:34.829> nice<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.040> close

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
positioning and then get nice and close

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.770 
positioning and then get nice and close
and<00:01:35.430> let<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> game<00:01:35.970> win<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> back<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.630> or

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
and let the game win it back for you or

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.120 
and let the game win it back for you or
at<00:01:36.869> least<00:01:36.990> attempting<00:01:37.380> now<00:01:37.619> let's<00:01:37.829> move<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
at least attempting now let's move on to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.530 
at least attempting now let's move on to
the<00:01:38.280> slide<00:01:38.460> tackle<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.939> guess<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.270> are<00:01:39.360> times

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the slide tackle I guess there are times

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.480 
the slide tackle I guess there are times
to<00:01:39.750> use<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.350> definitely<00:01:40.890> not<00:01:41.040> use<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.369> on

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
to use it and definitely not use it on

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.550 
to use it and definitely not use it on
it<00:01:41.640> yeah<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.420> I'll<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:42.659> for<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> slide<00:01:43.020> tackle<00:01:43.380> if

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it yeah so I'll go for a slide tackle if

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.289 
it yeah so I'll go for a slide tackle if
I'm<00:01:43.740> 100%<00:01:44.100> sure<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.700> I'm<00:01:44.909> going<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
I'm 100% sure that I'm going to get the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.929 
I'm 100% sure that I'm going to get the
ball<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.840> able<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.049> keep<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:47.310> as<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> last

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
ball and be able to keep it or as a last

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.310 
ball and be able to keep it or as a last
resort<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:48.899> are<00:01:48.960> really<00:01:49.049> two

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
resort and there are really two

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.139 
resort and there are really two
situations<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.250> me<00:01:50.340> are<00:01:50.369> described<00:01:50.850> as

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
situations that for me are described as

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.389 
situations that for me are described as
last<00:01:51.360> resort<00:01:51.409> that's<00:01:52.409> when<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.009> guys<00:01:53.159> threw

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
last resort that's when the guys threw

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.830 
last resort that's when the guys threw
on<00:01:53.490> gold<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> only<00:01:54.299> chance<00:01:54.630> I've

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
on gold and it's the only chance I've

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.149 
on gold and it's the only chance I've
got<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.140> make<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> challenge<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.860> go<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
got to make a challenge is to go for a

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.399 
got to make a challenge is to go for a
slide<00:01:56.399> or<00:01:56.610> secondly<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:57.780> I'm<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.170> close

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
slide or secondly if I'm not close

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.780 
slide or secondly if I'm not close
enough<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> player<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.219> I'm<00:01:59.310> between<00:01:59.640> him

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
enough to the player but I'm between him

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.520 
enough to the player but I'm between him
and<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.969> goal<00:02:00.110> sometimes<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.320> anticipate

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and the goal sometimes I can anticipate

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.440 
and the goal sometimes I can anticipate
the<00:02:02.040> direction<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> shot<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:02.969> then<00:02:03.180> slide

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the direction of the shot and then slide

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.969 
the direction of the shot and then slide
into<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> path<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> ball<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.649> hopefully

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
into the path of the ball and hopefully

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.100 
into the path of the ball and hopefully
make<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> block<00:02:05.430> do<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.060> also<00:02:06.360> slide<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
make a block do you also slide in if the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.630 
make a block do you also slide in if the
ball<00:02:07.290> has<00:02:07.439> come<00:02:07.500> away<00:02:07.770> from<00:02:07.920> their<00:02:08.099> foot

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
ball has come away from their foot

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.800 
ball has come away from their foot
slightly<00:02:08.849> say<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:09.239> they've<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.390> knocked<00:02:09.690> it

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
slightly say if they've just knocked it

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.390 
slightly say if they've just knocked it
away<00:02:09.869> yeah<00:02:10.349> that's<00:02:10.560> really<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.920> best<00:02:11.039> time<00:02:11.220> to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
away yeah that's really the best time to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.040 
away yeah that's really the best time to
make<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.550> slide<00:02:11.819> if<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.390> ball<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.629> too<00:02:12.660> close<00:02:12.989> to

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
make a slide if the ball is too close to

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.940 
make a slide if the ball is too close to
the<00:02:13.200> opponent<00:02:13.590> and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the opponent and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.680 
the opponent and
attempt<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.400> slide<00:02:14.610> tackle<00:02:14.790> there's<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.510> real

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
attempt to slide tackle there's a real

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.390 
attempt to slide tackle there's a real
high<00:02:15.959> risk<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.319> you'll<00:02:16.770> take<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.010> bit<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
high risk that you'll take a bit of the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.729 
high risk that you'll take a bit of the
man<00:02:17.550> first<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.209> give<00:02:18.330> away<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> foul<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.680> you

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
man first and give away a foul so you

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.960 
man first and give away a foul so you
really<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.040> want<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.280> time<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.489> just<00:02:20.790> as<00:02:20.879> I

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
really you want to time it just as I

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.220 
really you want to time it just as I
nudged<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.360> ball<00:02:21.480> away<00:02:21.690> with<00:02:21.870> their<00:02:22.019> touch

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
nudged the ball away with their touch

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.110 
nudged the ball away with their touch
and<00:02:22.470> then<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:22.769> hopefully<00:02:22.980> sweep<00:02:23.819> in<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
and then you can hopefully sweep in and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.550 
and then you can hopefully sweep in and
take<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.360> ball<00:02:24.510> away<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.110> guess<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.410> also

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
take the ball away and I guess it's also

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.860 
take the ball away and I guess it's also
worth<00:02:25.800> saying<00:02:26.069> never<00:02:26.340> ever<00:02:26.640> tackle<00:02:27.480> from

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
worth saying never ever tackle from

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.660 
worth saying never ever tackle from
behind<00:02:27.959> if<00:02:28.440> you're<00:02:28.560> doing<00:02:28.680> slide<00:02:28.980> tackle<00:02:29.340> yeah

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
behind if you're doing slide tackle yeah

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
absolutely I mean you're looking at a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.059 
absolutely I mean you're looking at a
straight<00:02:31.200> red<00:02:31.319> card<00:02:31.380> there<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:31.890> quite

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
straight red card there and quite

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.259 
straight red card there and quite
rightly<00:02:32.250> now<00:02:32.640> something<00:02:32.910> else<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.180> comes

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
rightly now something else that comes

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.449 
rightly now something else that comes
with<00:02:33.480> its<00:02:33.599> risks<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.080> use<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.470> too<00:02:34.920> much<00:02:34.950> in

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
with its risks if you use it too much in

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.640 
with its risks if you use it too much in
one<00:02:35.819> situation<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.450> push<00:02:36.630> pause<00:02:36.840> now<00:02:37.110> that's

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
one situation is push pause now that's

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.140 
one situation is push pause now that's
right<00:02:37.769> yeah<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.190> do<00:02:38.310> use<00:02:38.580> push/pull<00:02:38.819> quite<00:02:39.120> a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
right yeah I do use push/pull quite a

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.520 
right yeah I do use push/pull quite a
lot<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:39.450> under<00:02:39.720> quite<00:02:39.900> an<00:02:39.959> effective<00:02:40.380> way<00:02:40.500> to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
lot so under quite an effective way to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.380 
lot so under quite an effective way to
just<00:02:41.280> get<00:02:41.430> your<00:02:41.519> body<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.880> front<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
just get your body in front of the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.240 
just get your body in front of the
attacker<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.140> perhaps<00:02:43.530> just<00:02:43.799> sort<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:43.950> edging

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
attacker and perhaps just sort of edging

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.460 
attacker and perhaps just sort of edging
away<00:02:44.430> from<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.819> ball<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:45.989> do<00:02:46.110> have<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.380> be

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
away from the ball but you do have to be

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.509 
away from the ball but you do have to be
careful<00:02:46.620> with<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.980> as<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.099> said<00:02:47.280> if<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.489> use

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
careful with it as you said if you use

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.530 
careful with it as you said if you use
it<00:02:47.730> too<00:02:47.880> much<00:02:47.910> or<00:02:48.299> if<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:48.510> a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
it too much or if you have a

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.940 
it too much or if you have a
particularly<00:02:48.989> strict<00:02:49.230> referee<00:02:49.470> who<00:02:49.680> will

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
particularly strict referee who will

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.170 
particularly strict referee who will
quite<00:02:50.130> rightly<00:02:50.340> punish<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:50.910> usually

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
quite rightly punish you and usually

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.150 
quite rightly punish you and usually
that<00:02:51.299> will<00:02:51.420> mean<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:51.870> yellow<00:02:52.319> card<00:02:52.560> or<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.920> very

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
that will mean a yellow card or and very

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.620 
that will mean a yellow card or and very
least<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.489> free-kick<00:02:53.700> for<00:02:54.030> your<00:02:54.150> opponent<00:02:54.540> so

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
least a free-kick for your opponent so

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.390 
least a free-kick for your opponent so
you<00:02:54.870> do<00:02:55.230> have<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.530> be<00:02:55.650> careful<00:02:55.799> with<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.310> it

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
you do have to be careful with it but it

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.039 
you do have to be careful with it but it
can<00:02:56.549> be<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> really<00:02:57.299> effective<00:02:57.360> tool<00:02:57.840> if<00:02:57.989> you

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
can be a really effective tool if you

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:58.580 
can be a really effective tool if you
use<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.319> well

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
use it well

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.900 
use it well
it's<00:02:58.709> also<00:02:58.920> useful<00:02:59.340> if<00:02:59.459> someone's<00:02:59.730> about<00:02:59.790> to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
it's also useful if someone's about to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.670 
it's also useful if someone's about to
pull<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.150> trigger<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.630> now<00:03:00.780> on<00:03:00.989> goal<00:03:01.200> yai

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
pull the trigger and now on goal yai

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.630 
pull the trigger and now on goal yai
they<00:03:01.950> won't<00:03:02.099> know<00:03:02.220> about<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.459> pull<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
they won't know about to pull the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.699 
they won't know about to pull the
trigger<00:03:02.910> or<00:03:03.090> even<00:03:03.299> if<00:03:03.420> they're<00:03:03.660> about<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.590> play

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
trigger or even if they're about to play

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.380 
trigger or even if they're about to play
a<00:03:04.769> pass<00:03:05.040> or<00:03:05.280> if<00:03:05.370> they're<00:03:05.519> right<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
a pass or if they're right on the the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.509 
a pass or if they're right on the the
touch<00:03:06.569> line<00:03:06.780> using<00:03:07.709> your<00:03:07.829> body<00:03:07.980> then<00:03:08.160> just<00:03:08.430> to

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
touch line using your body then just to

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.559 
touch line using your body then just to
sort<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.730> nudge<00:03:08.880> them<00:03:09.060> on<00:03:09.150> where<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.450> other

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
sort of nudge them on where the other

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.960 
sort of nudge them on where the other
can<00:03:09.840> either<00:03:10.620> make<00:03:10.980> them<00:03:11.099> take<00:03:11.340> out<00:03:11.489> play<00:03:11.790> or

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
can either make them take out play or

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.309 
can either make them take out play or
can<00:03:12.120> miss<00:03:12.299> kick<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.569> pass<00:03:12.750> or<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.959> shot<00:03:13.170> and

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
can miss kick the pass or the shot and

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.360 
can miss kick the pass or the shot and
that<00:03:13.470> could<00:03:13.620> make<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.739> difference<00:03:14.069> between<00:03:14.160> a

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
that could make a difference between a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.620 
that could make a difference between a
goal<00:03:14.730> another<00:03:15.239> goal

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630
