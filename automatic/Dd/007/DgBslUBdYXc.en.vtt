again and it is if it's coming back into
view<00:02:18.710> then<00:02:18.890> gradually<00:02:19.460> what<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.640> want<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.030> do<00:02:20.180> is

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
view then gradually what I want to do is

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.020 
view then gradually what I want to do is
to<00:02:20.450> start<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.870> reduce<00:02:21.080> my<00:02:21.650> steering<00:02:22.190> taking<00:02:22.940> it

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
to start to reduce my steering taking it

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.180 
to start to reduce my steering taking it
back<00:02:23.210> towards<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.780> right<00:02:23.930> feeding<00:02:24.800> off<00:02:24.950> in<00:02:25.100> a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
back towards the right feeding off in a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.940 
back towards the right feeding off in a
very<00:02:25.310> gradual<00:02:25.880> basis<00:02:26.420> until<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.350> car<00:02:27.530> starts

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
very gradual basis until the car starts

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.440 
very gradual basis until the car starts
to<00:02:27.980> come<00:02:28.220> back<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.610> checking<00:02:29.060> all<00:02:29.180> around

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
to come back in checking all around

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.600 
to come back in checking all around
again<00:02:29.720> for<00:02:29.750> safety<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.890> making<00:02:31.160> sure<00:02:31.460> that

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
again for safety and making sure that

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.390 
again for safety and making sure that
eventually<00:02:32.000> I've<00:02:32.870> got<00:02:33.320> my<00:02:33.530> car<00:02:33.860> nice<00:02:34.100> and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
eventually I've got my car nice and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.360 
eventually I've got my car nice and
straight<00:02:34.960> my<00:02:35.960> steering<00:02:36.470> then<00:02:36.680> wants<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.130> come

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
straight my steering then wants to come

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.610 
straight my steering then wants to come
back<00:02:37.520> finishing<00:02:38.150> nice<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:38.930> straight<00:02:39.200> as<00:02:39.410> well

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
back finishing nice and straight as well

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.530 
back finishing nice and straight as well
so<00:02:40.220> as<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.400> car<00:02:40.610> comes<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:41.000> straight<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.450> the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
so as the car comes in straight to the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.540 
so as the car comes in straight to the
bay<00:02:41.720> my<00:02:42.230> steering<00:02:42.680> finish<00:02:42.980> is<00:02:43.130> nice<00:02:43.310> and

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
bay my steering finish is nice and

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.030 
bay my steering finish is nice and
straight<00:02:43.820> and<00:02:44.060> then<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.600> should<00:02:45.320> be<00:02:45.380> in<00:02:45.680> my<00:02:45.860> bay

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
straight and then I should be in my bay

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.980 
straight and then I should be in my bay
enough<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.670> can<00:02:46.970> check<00:02:47.210> both<00:02:47.480> left<00:02:47.810> and

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
enough that I can check both left and

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.810 
enough that I can check both left and
right<00:02:48.230> look<00:02:48.530> across<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.100> base<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.490> make<00:02:49.610> sure

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
right look across the base to make sure

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.980 
right look across the base to make sure
that<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.000> feel<00:02:50.030> I've<00:02:50.360> come<00:02:50.540> back<00:02:50.660> far<00:02:50.960> enough

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
that I feel I've come back far enough

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.530 
that I feel I've come back far enough
with<00:02:51.860> my<00:02:52.040> two<00:02:52.100> door<00:02:52.430> mirrors<00:02:52.760> I'm<00:02:52.940> convinced

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
with my two door mirrors I'm convinced

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.120 
with my two door mirrors I'm convinced
I'm<00:02:53.660> in<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.900> bay<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:54.650> I'm<00:02:54.740> going<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:54.950> go

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
I'm in the bay so I'm going to go

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.520 
I'm in the bay so I'm going to go
handbrake<00:02:55.580> on<00:02:55.730> an<00:02:55.850> internee<00:02:56.270> tral<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.750> if<00:02:57.410> I

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
handbrake on an internee tral and if I

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.170 
handbrake on an internee tral and if I
needed<00:02:57.740> to<00:02:57.860> check<00:02:58.160> with<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.460> car<00:02:58.640> secured<00:02:59.030> I

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
needed to check with the car secured I

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.300 
needed to check with the car secured I
could<00:02:59.390> open<00:02:59.570> my<00:02:59.780> door<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.410> just<00:03:00.890> have<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.070> quick

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
could open my door and just have a quick

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.890 
could open my door and just have a quick
look<00:03:01.460> down<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.060> can<00:03:02.240> see<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.630> I've<00:03:02.750> got<00:03:02.870> a

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
look down and I can see that I've got a

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.930 
look down and I can see that I've got a
nice<00:03:03.200> gap<00:03:03.530> next<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.040> me<00:03:04.160> between<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.700> car<00:03:04.910> and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
nice gap next to me between the car and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.990 
nice gap next to me between the car and
the<00:03:05.210> load<00:03:05.830> I'm<00:03:06.830> looking<00:03:07.220> for<00:03:07.460> approximately

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
the load I'm looking for approximately

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.780 
the load I'm looking for approximately
equal<00:03:08.330> gaps<00:03:08.540> on<00:03:08.750> both<00:03:08.990> sides<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.490> should

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
equal gaps on both sides so I should

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.910 
equal gaps on both sides so I should
have<00:03:11.030> probably<00:03:11.330> about<00:03:11.690> that<00:03:12.080> much<00:03:12.140> distance

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
have probably about that much distance

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.920 
have probably about that much distance
between<00:03:13.100> me<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.880> line<00:03:14.150> on<00:03:14.330> both<00:03:14.540> sides

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
between me and the line on both sides

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.050 
between me and the line on both sides
and<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.709> way<00:03:15.860> I<00:03:15.890> know<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.340> I've<00:03:16.430> come<00:03:16.610> equal

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
and that way I know that I've come equal

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.420 
and that way I know that I've come equal
into<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.390> bay<00:03:17.600> so<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.350> recap<00:03:18.650> on<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.190> one

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
into the bay so to recap on this one

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.520 
into the bay so to recap on this one

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
wheels are in the bay and you're roughly

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.029 
wheels are in the bay and you're roughly
straight<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.110> you've<00:04:54.440> got<00:04:54.590> pretty<00:04:54.860> much

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
straight and you've got pretty much

equal gaps on both sides that will be

equal gaps on both sides that will be
sufficient<00:04:57.560> for<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.800> driving<00:04:58.190> test<00:04:58.400> for<00:04:59.270> the

in<00:05:01.340> for<00:05:01.819> us<00:05:01.880> to<00:05:02.030> see<00:05:02.240> our<00:05:02.419> way<00:05:02.599> out<00:05:02.900> again<00:05:03.229> and

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
in for us to see our way out again and

this<00:05:03.889> is<00:05:04.039> what<00:05:04.159> makes<00:05:04.370> it<00:05:04.520> safe<00:05:04.819> while<00:05:05.120> we

this is what makes it safe while we

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
suggest that do reverse Bay Park because

suggest that do reverse Bay Park because
when<00:05:07.789> you<00:05:07.880> come<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.210> leave<00:05:08.389> the<00:05:08.539> parking<00:05:08.840> bay
