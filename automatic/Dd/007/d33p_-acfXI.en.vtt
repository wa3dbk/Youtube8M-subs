00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.120
 Hello dear friends today I want 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:12.030
 talk about pontach our native 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.890
 immigration are they if they are then 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.390
 none 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:22.369
 but in fact I can share 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.210
 two of our two trends so to speak 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:31.259
 characteristic of two large categories in 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.199
 Our immigration is from Vyatka 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.900
 republics and people say from European 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:41.670
 republics of the former USSR 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:47.570
 how is it different why they divided 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:51.050
 differ in the form of ponto say so 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.200
 the fact that the pantheon is 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.430
 as they manifest in what they are 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.620
 manifest if we talk about 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.150
 our former compatriots from the former 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.100
 Asian republics 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:12.320
 yes they are primarily expressed in clothes 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.720
 for some reason, our compatriots 2 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.950
 Asian republics they prefer 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.990

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.800
 gold gold jewelry 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.370
 and clothes that is their Ponte is expressed 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.070
 first of all in accessories devices 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:42.560

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:44.810

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.420
 they like to dress a lot 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:53.829
 gold itself on them is very often possible 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.000

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.840

 allow when need yourself at home 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.399
 banquet 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.780
 our compatriots from European 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.130
 parts of the former USSR 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:17.349
 they are usually expressed in expensive 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.349
 machines than 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.030
 let's say more 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.319
 the desire to slip one more expensive 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.840
 car saw jumps 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.080
 I just knew a few families a few 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.799
 people who basically earn 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.459
 yourself very very modest up life but when 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:46.180
 that they have possession of these dear ones 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:51.720
 cars to Europeans 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:55.080
 there would be such a type you do not worship the 6 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.290

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.130

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.920
 license plates on cars 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.629
 people drink their own words 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.480
 in Latin letters of loading and value 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.840

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.600
