00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
important i think that a lot of

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.900 
important i think that a lot of
employers<00:04:12.420> look<00:04:12.930> for<00:04:12.959> college<00:04:13.489> you<00:04:14.489> know<00:04:14.610> in

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
employers look for college you know in

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.670 
employers look for college you know in
your<00:04:15.120> background<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:15.840> shows<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.500> can

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
your background it shows that you can

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.620 
your background it shows that you can
complete<00:04:17.489> something<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:18.150> shows<00:04:18.390> that

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
complete something that shows that
