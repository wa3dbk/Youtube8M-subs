 Something cute while crossing the street 

00:00:16.437 --> 00:00:23.331
 There are people trying to talk to you. 

00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:30.336
 You're being rude, there's no excuse, your attitude is not cute. 

00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:33.348
 We can not sit down - Sit down! 

00:00:33.348 --> 00:00:36.795
 And watch the minds of our children - fragile minds! 

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:40.885
 Turn into puree, "Puree!" in front of miniature screens

 Drop your phone. Drop your iPad. - I'm going to fire him! 

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:09.617
 Of a time in technology and eye in people's eyes. In the eyes! 

00:01:09.617 --> 00:01:16.514
 There's a whole nation of idiots trying to drive. 

00:01:16.514 --> 00:01:20.941
 While they watch horrible endings type A Rush Hour 3 

00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:22.693
 Actually, I even like Rush Hour 3. 

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:27.024
 There's Jackie Chan doing a little of it, Chris Tucker doing it. It's good. Did you see? 

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:33.344
 Call them aside, shout in your ears 

00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:39.988
 For them to hear the message self and clear 

00:01:39.988 --> 00:01:46.524
 And Todd showed us with his shiny head in dome 

00:01:46.524 --> 00:01:51.031

00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:13.293
 There are sheets to join and chimneys that need a clean 

00:02:13.293 --> 00:02:19.580
 And god forbid you read a book without sexy vampires 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.810
 Wait a second, just a second 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.209
