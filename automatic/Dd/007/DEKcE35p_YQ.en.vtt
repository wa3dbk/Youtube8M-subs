00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:36.500

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.650
 chord sequence in the chorus 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:49.759
 the entrance 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:49.759
 the same entrance h &amp; h 7d body 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.060

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:15.319
 chords with the words chorus love not for 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:20.390
 something in spite of love is not for the song and not 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:23.890
 for beautiful poems love not for letters and 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.890
 not for frequent calls to 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.890
 love not for something love in spite of 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.510
 As for the fight in this song, the video 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.590
 you could see a bit of a mutated 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.310
 more eraser 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.680
 What is the difference between what I show 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.590
 now and so what could you hear on 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.500
 video video i play six without 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.720
 muffling and fingertips it's me 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.550
 made to guitar not 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.030
 overlapped hair to be understood 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:07.210
 all the words of the fight we play the same thing 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:12.450
 and in the song not when we play down then 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:16.260
 jamming two up down up 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.379
 how will this fight sound fast 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.379
 tempo 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:39.050
 I will lose the first verse and chorus now 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.849
 love songs in spite of failures with chords 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.849
 how should it sound 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.560
 you can 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.940
 you can not speak and already told everything 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.040

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.050
