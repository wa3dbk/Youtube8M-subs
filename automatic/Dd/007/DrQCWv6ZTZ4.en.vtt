00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
maybe because of the fact that like I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.210 
maybe because of the fact that like I
went<00:01:13.170> through<00:01:13.409> some<00:01:13.560> things<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.950> everything

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
like sharp at the end so i got a needle

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.080 
like sharp at the end so i got a needle
and<00:04:28.930> then<00:04:29.560> i<00:04:29.770> like<00:04:30.100> stuck<00:04:30.490> it<00:04:30.640> through<00:04:30.850> and
