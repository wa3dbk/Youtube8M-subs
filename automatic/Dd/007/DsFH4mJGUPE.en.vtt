00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.360 
and I saw Olaf and Kristoff and Sven but
I<00:00:36.570> thought<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.380> one<00:00:37.620> scene<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.219> movie

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
I thought of that one scene in the movie

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.450 
I thought of that one scene in the movie
I<00:00:38.760> think<00:00:39.450> Olaf<00:00:40.079> said<00:00:40.469> cuz<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.980> haven't<00:00:41.250> seen<00:00:41.340> it

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
I think Olaf said cuz I haven't seen it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.560 
I think Olaf said cuz I haven't seen it
in<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> while<00:00:41.610> Olaf<00:00:42.570> said<00:00:43.489> who's<00:00:44.489> what<00:00:45.390> did<00:00:45.510> he

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
in a while Olaf said who's what did he

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.529 
in a while Olaf said who's what did he
say<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> dog<00:00:46.079> did<00:00:47.070> he<00:00:47.340> either<00:00:47.489> said<00:00:47.789> donkey<00:00:48.329> or

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
say the dog did he either said donkey or

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.139 
say the dog did he either said donkey or
moose<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.800> think<00:00:50.430> he<00:00:50.520> might<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.700> said<00:00:50.879> moose

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
are really really really super cute set

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.550 
are really really really super cute set
definitely<00:02:48.600> go<00:02:48.690> check<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:49.080> out<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.470> you

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
definitely go check it out if you

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.500 
definitely go check it out if you
haven't<00:02:49.590> seen<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.280> Olaf<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
haven't seen it but Olaf is in a

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.610 
haven't seen it but Olaf is in a
completely<00:02:51.960> different<00:02:52.140> pose<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:53.959> so<00:02:54.959> you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
completely different pose and so you

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.470 
completely different pose and so you
can't<00:02:55.830> put<00:02:55.980> him<00:02:56.100> in<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.730> pose<00:02:56.970> because<00:02:57.180> his

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
can't put him in that pose because his

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.290 
can't put him in that pose because his
arms<00:02:57.630> can't<00:02:57.989> move<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.489> really<00:02:59.730> cute

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
arms can't move so that is really cute

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.360 
arms can't move so that is really cute
that's<00:03:00.810> I'm<00:03:01.200> pretty<00:03:01.530> happy<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:02.010> they<00:03:02.130> had

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
that's I'm pretty happy that they had

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.800 
that's I'm pretty happy that they had
him<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.580> different<00:03:02.730> pose<00:03:03.060> instead<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.630> just

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
him in a different pose instead of just

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.770 
him in a different pose instead of just
leaving<00:03:04.200> him<00:03:04.410> how<00:03:04.620> he<00:03:04.680> was<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.489> then

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
leaving him how he was and then

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.510 
leaving him how he was and then
Christoph<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:06.810> pretty<00:03:07.140> cool<00:03:07.380> too<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.890> like<00:03:08.489> how

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
Christoph is pretty cool too I like how

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.760 
Christoph is pretty cool too I like how
his<00:03:09.060> hands<00:03:09.360> are<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.600> fists<00:03:12.230> but<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.260> really<00:03:13.620> like

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
his hands are in fists but I really like

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.310 
his hands are in fists but I really like
the<00:03:13.920> details<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.300> paint<00:03:15.600> in<00:03:15.900> some<00:03:16.200> of

these<00:03:16.489> figures<00:03:17.489> faces<00:03:17.970> like<00:03:18.270> I<00:03:18.510> think<00:03:18.989> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
these figures faces like I think the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.380

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
then we've got hands and I think they

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.039 
then we've got hands and I think they
did<00:04:13.159> a<00:04:13.189> pretty<00:04:13.280> awesome<00:04:13.609> job<00:04:14.030> on<00:04:14.120> him<00:04:14.389> I<00:04:14.629> like

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
did a pretty awesome job on him I like

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.080 
did a pretty awesome job on him I like
how<00:04:15.500> he's<00:04:15.709> posed<00:04:15.980> her<00:04:16.250> he<00:04:16.340> has<00:04:16.519> one<00:04:16.820> hand

how he's posed her he has one hand

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.229 
how he's posed her he has one hand
behind<00:04:17.239> his<00:04:17.509> back<00:04:17.750> because<00:04:18.590> it<00:04:19.459> makes<00:04:20.060> him

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
behind his back because it makes him

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.379 
behind his back because it makes him
look<00:04:20.329> a<00:04:20.479> little<00:04:20.599> funny<00:04:20.840> but<00:04:22.120> I<00:04:23.120> like<00:04:23.360> the
