 individual performance that ultimately 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.880
 has also reflected in what is the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.419
 team performance 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.700

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.890
 football if you think that at the same time 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:50.530
 what about the matches are very tight 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.300
 where you run a lot you squeeze a lot 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.219

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.710
 we are going a little bit in the 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.410
 definition that we have to have a little 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.449
 more of tranquility at the time of day 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.980
 to define important that there is material 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.420
 human like to have a better 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.350
 football development within the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.320

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.570
 group a group of professionals and 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.930
 very very nice and good people let's hope 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.630
 and with the running of the parties like that but 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.009
 everything classifies the octagonal power 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.780
 secure it at once and showed a 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.399
 even performance as has been felt 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.720
 that first line fliers now that we 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.830
 to CÃ³rdoba for the problem that all 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.649

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:38.040

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:41.210
 trailer coupled well colombia yes yes yes 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.640
 where to go I have a very good relationship 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.020
 I always say that the important thing is 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.800
 more than anything the football have good 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.330
 relationship outside the court I do not know if you 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.670

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.500

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.479
 here he did not speak the rival who is known and 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.820
 He knows to do a tough game like me 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.790
 it seems that it makes a match similar to what 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.520
 that was to summon mangano that the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.760
 they have to score points in our two 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.080
 we have to score points also for 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.080
 to mount ones up
