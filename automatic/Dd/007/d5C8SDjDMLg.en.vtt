in this video I want to talk very
briefly<00:00:07.089> about<00:00:07.720> Z<00:00:08.290> brushes<00:00:08.709> two<00:00:08.980> and<00:00:09.160> a<00:00:09.219> half<00:00:09.400> D

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
briefly about Z brushes two and a half D

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.910 
briefly about Z brushes two and a half D
world<00:00:10.030> and<00:00:10.389> what<00:00:10.809> that<00:00:10.959> means<00:00:11.170> to<00:00:11.379> you<00:00:11.680> in

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
world and what that means to you in

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.910 
world and what that means to you in
terms<00:00:12.160> of<00:00:12.340> using<00:00:12.549> ZBrush<00:00:13.059> now<00:00:13.809> if<00:00:14.080> you<00:00:14.650> are

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
terms of using ZBrush now if you are

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.870 
terms of using ZBrush now if you are
used<00:00:15.340> to<00:00:15.639> just<00:00:16.449> standard<00:00:16.990> 2d<00:00:17.619> apps<00:00:17.859> and<00:00:18.340> by

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
used to just standard 2d apps and by

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.279 
used to just standard 2d apps and by
this<00:00:18.939> I<00:00:19.210> mean<00:00:19.240> things<00:00:19.689> like<00:00:19.810> maybe<00:00:20.850> GIMP<00:00:21.850> or

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
this I mean things like maybe GIMP or

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.200 
this I mean things like maybe GIMP or
Photoshop<00:00:23.460> which<00:00:24.460> I'll<00:00:24.580> just<00:00:24.610> abbreviate<00:00:24.880> to

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
Photoshop which I'll just abbreviate to

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.439 
Photoshop which I'll just abbreviate to
PS<00:00:25.510> then<00:00:26.140> you're<00:00:26.560> familiar<00:00:26.740> with<00:00:27.400> a<00:00:27.670> document

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
PS then you're familiar with a document

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.650 
PS then you're familiar with a document
or<00:00:28.660> a<00:00:29.080> canvas<00:00:29.440> area<00:00:30.039> that<00:00:30.550> just<00:00:30.580> navigates<00:00:31.359> in

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
or a canvas area that just navigates in

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.439 
or a canvas area that just navigates in
X&amp;Y<00:00:34.859> meaning<00:00:35.859> it's<00:00:36.129> just<00:00:36.460> generally<00:00:37.120> some

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
X&amp;Y meaning it's just generally some

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.360 
X&amp;Y meaning it's just generally some
sort<00:00:37.719> of<00:00:37.780> squarish<00:00:38.379> like<00:00:38.620> canvas<00:00:39.129> that<00:00:39.309> you

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
sort of squarish like canvas that you

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.669 
sort of squarish like canvas that you
always<00:00:39.640> look<00:00:40.059> at<00:00:40.239> like<00:00:40.420> so<00:00:40.690> it'll<00:00:41.260> have<00:00:41.379> some

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:41.679 
always look at like so it'll have some

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.709 
always look at like so it'll have some
sort<00:00:41.890> of<00:00:41.949> a<00:00:42.039> picture<00:00:42.280> on<00:00:42.550> it<00:00:42.729> and<00:00:42.850> you<00:00:43.449> move

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
sort of a picture on it and you move

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.360 
sort of a picture on it and you move
around<00:00:43.870> you<00:00:44.350> slide<00:00:44.620> left<00:00:44.859> and<00:00:45.039> right<00:00:45.159> and<00:00:45.339> up

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
around you slide left and right and up

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.009 
around you slide left and right and up
and<00:00:45.519> down<00:00:45.550> maybe<00:00:45.760> you<00:00:45.850> zoom<00:00:46.149> in<00:00:46.359> you'll<00:00:46.870> get

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
and down maybe you zoom in you'll get

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.450 
and down maybe you zoom in you'll get
those<00:00:47.170> pixels<00:00:47.559> closer<00:00:47.829> to<00:00:48.010> your<00:00:48.129> face<00:00:48.280> so<00:00:48.429> you

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
those pixels closer to your face so you

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.360 
those pixels closer to your face so you
can<00:00:48.639> work<00:00:48.729> on<00:00:48.909> stuff<00:00:49.210> if<00:00:49.749> you<00:00:50.229> are<00:00:50.440> used<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:50.889> 3d

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
can work on stuff if you are used to 3d

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.079 
can work on stuff if you are used to 3d
apps<00:00:53.159> such<00:00:54.159> as<00:00:54.190> things<00:00:54.940> like<00:00:55.030> maybe<00:00:55.420> Maya<00:00:57.089> or

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
apps such as things like maybe Maya or

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.000 
apps such as things like maybe Maya or
3ds<00:00:58.170> max<00:01:00.629> then<00:01:01.629> you're<00:01:01.929> used<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.289> navigating

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
3ds max then you're used to navigating

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.039 
3ds max then you're used to navigating
in<00:01:03.159> X<00:01:04.440> Y<00:01:05.440> &amp;<00:01:05.860> Z<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:07.119> that's<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.570> little<00:01:07.810> bit<00:01:07.900> of<00:01:07.990> a

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
in X Y &amp; Z and that's a little bit of a

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.050 
in X Y &amp; Z and that's a little bit of a
different<00:01:08.409> thing<00:01:08.590> generally<00:01:09.370> you're<00:01:09.670> given

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
different thing generally you're given

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.540 
different thing generally you're given
some<00:01:10.570> sort<00:01:10.780> of<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.140> 3d<00:01:11.590> scene<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:13.060> that's<00:01:14.550> that's

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
some sort of a 3d scene so that's that's

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.210 
some sort of a 3d scene so that's that's
my<00:01:15.760> 3d<00:01:16.030> grid<00:01:16.210> okay<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:17.170> you'll<00:01:17.860> have<00:01:18.010> some

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
my 3d grid okay and you'll have some

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.790 
my 3d grid okay and you'll have some
sort<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.520> object<00:01:19.030> around<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.510> or<00:01:20.110> inside<00:01:20.590> that

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
sort of object around it or inside that

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.680 
sort of object around it or inside that
grid<00:01:21.010> and<00:01:21.130> you'll<00:01:21.640> have<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:21.820> view<00:01:22.210> which<00:01:22.510> is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
grid and you'll have a view which is

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.630 
grid and you'll have a view which is
kind<00:01:22.930> of<00:01:22.990> like<00:01:23.050> a<00:01:23.170> camera<00:01:23.740> or<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.490> could

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
kind of like a camera or it could

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.980 
kind of like a camera or it could
actually<00:01:24.790> be<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:25.120> camera<00:01:25.450> depending<00:01:25.660> on<00:01:25.900> your

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
actually be a camera depending on your

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.560 
actually be a camera depending on your
piece<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.170> software<00:01:26.530> of<00:01:26.680> course<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:27.570> you're

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
piece of software of course and you're

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.240 
piece of software of course and you're
going<00:01:28.690> to<00:01:28.720> be<00:01:28.870> moving<00:01:29.140> that<00:01:29.470> camera<00:01:29.920> around

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
going to be moving that camera around

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.100 
going to be moving that camera around
and<00:01:30.520> looking<00:01:30.910> at<00:01:31.060> your<00:01:31.180> object<00:01:31.570> from<00:01:31.690> multiple

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
and looking at your object from multiple

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.080 
and looking at your object from multiple
sides<00:01:32.350> or<00:01:32.560> flying<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.250> camera<00:01:33.670> through<00:01:33.910> your

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
sides or flying that camera through your

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.570 
sides or flying that camera through your
scene<00:01:34.360> your<00:01:35.020> objects<00:01:35.770> are<00:01:35.980> going<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.430> be

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
scene your objects are going to be

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.460 
scene your objects are going to be
stationary<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.540> you're<00:01:38.110> going<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.350> be

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
stationary and you're going to be

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.350 
stationary and you're going to be
manipulating<00:01:38.770> some<00:01:39.460> sort<00:01:39.730> of<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:39.880> camera<00:01:40.180> or

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
manipulating some sort of a camera or

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.150 
manipulating some sort of a camera or
view<00:01:40.720> in<00:01:40.870> order<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.530> see<00:01:41.740> everything<00:01:41.980> from

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
view in order to see everything from

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.830 
view in order to see everything from
different<00:01:42.580> angles<00:01:42.910> as<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.060> need<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:43.330> right

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
different angles as you need to right

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.270 
different angles as you need to right
but<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.290> doesn't<00:01:44.350> mean<00:01:44.680> that<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.920> objects

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
but that doesn't mean that the objects

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.920 
but that doesn't mean that the objects
have<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.490> be<00:01:45.700> stationary<00:01:46.210> you<00:01:46.360> can<00:01:46.510> grab<00:01:46.720> and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
have to be stationary you can grab and

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.420 
have to be stationary you can grab and
move<00:01:47.140> them<00:01:47.380> preserving<00:01:47.920> them<00:01:48.070> wherever<00:01:48.310> you

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
move them preserving them wherever you

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.220 
move them preserving them wherever you
want<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.790> can<00:01:48.909> even<00:01:49.000> animate<00:01:49.750> them<00:01:49.870> they

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
want you can even animate them they

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.350 
want you can even animate them they
exist<00:01:50.650> in<00:01:50.800> this<00:01:50.920> 3d<00:01:51.340> world<00:01:51.580> that's<00:01:51.909> right<00:01:52.090> okay

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
exist in this 3d world that's right okay

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.450 
exist in this 3d world that's right okay
but<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.290> idea<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:53.770> that<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.130> world

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
but the the idea is that the world

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.120 
but the the idea is that the world
itself<00:01:55.090> is<00:01:55.360> doing<00:01:56.350> something<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:57.040> your

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
itself is doing something and your

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.410 
itself is doing something and your
camera<00:01:57.490> is<00:01:57.550> doing<00:01:57.640> something<00:01:57.940> else<00:01:58.060> entirely

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
camera is doing something else entirely

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.149 
camera is doing something else entirely
your<00:01:58.840> cameras<00:01:59.200> independent<00:01:59.740> of<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.950> scene

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
your cameras independent of the scene

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.410 
your cameras independent of the scene
the<00:02:01.150> ZBrush<00:02:01.840> two<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.380> half<00:02:02.560> D<00:02:02.890> world<00:02:03.300> as<00:02:04.300> I

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
the ZBrush two and a half D world as I

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.610 
the ZBrush two and a half D world as I
remember<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.840> actually<00:02:05.050> draw<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.260> five<00:02:05.470> in

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
remember to actually draw the five in

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.600 
remember to actually draw the five in
here<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:05.860> time<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.659> little<00:02:07.870> different

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
here this time is a little different

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.180 
here this time is a little different
what<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.789> get<00:02:10.060> really<00:02:10.690> is<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:11.290> view<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.099> then

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
what you get really is a view and then

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.709 
what you get really is a view and then
let<00:02:12.519> me<00:02:12.579> see<00:02:12.760> if<00:02:12.849> I<00:02:12.909> can<00:02:12.999> find<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.209> nice<00:02:13.450> way<00:02:13.689> to

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.719 
let me see if I can find a nice way to

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.599 
let me see if I can find a nice way to
draw<00:02:14.049> this<00:02:14.230> out<00:02:14.439> let's<00:02:14.769> just<00:02:14.829> assume<00:02:15.249> that<00:02:15.310> we

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:15.609 
draw this out let's just assume that we

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:21.030 
draw this out let's just assume that we
have<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.819> view<00:02:16.120> very<00:02:16.480> much<00:02:16.659> like<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.840> camera

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.289 

and<00:02:22.359> it's<00:02:23.359> looking<00:02:23.659> out<00:02:24.079> into<00:02:24.799> this<00:02:25.519> world

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
and it's looking out into this world

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.000 
and it's looking out into this world
which<00:02:26.629> has<00:02:26.900> depth<00:02:27.260> we<00:02:27.469> already<00:02:27.680> talked<00:02:27.920> about

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
which has depth we already talked about

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.119 
which has depth we already talked about
that<00:02:28.310> in<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.459> previous<00:02:28.609> video<00:02:28.969> how<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.409> ZBrush

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
that in a previous video how the ZBrush

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.429 
that in a previous video how the ZBrush
canvas<00:02:31.670> can<00:02:31.879> actually<00:02:32.239> store<00:02:32.569> depth<00:02:32.959> so<00:02:33.230> stuff

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
canvas can actually store depth so stuff

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.710 
canvas can actually store depth so stuff
can<00:02:33.590> kind<00:02:33.739> of<00:02:33.799> pop<00:02:34.040> out<00:02:34.189> at<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:35.599> this

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
can kind of pop out at you but this

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.670 
can kind of pop out at you but this
camera<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.409> locked<00:02:37.069> into<00:02:37.400> position<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:39.319> never

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
camera is locked into position you never

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.190 
camera is locked into position you never
ever<00:02:40.010> get<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.400> move<00:02:40.579> it<00:02:40.730> now<00:02:41.659> you<00:02:41.720> can<00:02:42.170> see

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
ever get to move it now you can see

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.160 
ever get to move it now you can see
things<00:02:42.709> rotate<00:02:43.340> inside<00:02:44.060> your<00:02:44.599> two-and-a-half

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
things rotate inside your two-and-a-half

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.860 
things rotate inside your two-and-a-half
d<00:02:45.349> view<00:02:45.650> inside<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.459> ZBrush<00:02:46.849> for<00:02:47.359> instance<00:02:47.719> you

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
d view inside of ZBrush for instance you

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.520 
d view inside of ZBrush for instance you
could<00:02:48.079> have<00:02:48.139> some<00:02:48.650> sort<00:02:48.980> of<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.250> 3d<00:02:49.700> model<00:02:50.120> of

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
could have some sort of a 3d model of

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.460 
could have some sort of a 3d model of
I'm<00:02:51.530> gonna<00:02:51.680> draw<00:02:51.829> the<00:02:51.889> most<00:02:52.069> amazing<00:02:53.019> dog<00:02:54.019> real

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
I'm gonna draw the most amazing dog real

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.159 
I'm gonna draw the most amazing dog real
quick<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.489> get<00:02:55.609> a<00:02:55.639> dog<00:02:55.900> okay<00:02:56.900> it's

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
quick so you get a dog okay it's

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:58.210 
quick so you get a dog okay it's
actually<00:02:57.260> more<00:02:57.560> like<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.709> horse<00:02:57.919> than<00:02:58.099> anything

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
actually more like a horse than anything

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.890 
actually more like a horse than anything
yeah<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.519> does<00:02:58.669> but<00:02:59.090> it's<00:02:59.419> a<00:02:59.510> stick<00:02:59.720> horse

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
yeah it does but it's a stick horse

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.550 
yeah it does but it's a stick horse
that's<00:03:00.169> fine

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
that's fine

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.259 
that's fine
but<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.129> will<00:03:01.250> have<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.400> model<00:03:01.639> and<00:03:01.879> you<00:03:02.090> can

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
but you will have a model and you can

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.819 
but you will have a model and you can
rotate<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.840> around<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.290> make<00:03:03.379> it<00:03:03.409> face<00:03:03.680> all

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
rotate it around and make it face all

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.740 
rotate it around and make it face all
kinds<00:03:04.099> of<00:03:04.129> different<00:03:04.400> directions<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:05.030> it

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
kinds of different directions and it

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.440 
kinds of different directions and it
will<00:03:06.109> look<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.680> lot<00:03:07.040> like<00:03:07.400> you're<00:03:07.760> navigating<00:03:07.939> a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
will look a lot like you're navigating a

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.750 
will look a lot like you're navigating a
3d<00:03:08.750> scene<00:03:09.049> you<00:03:09.260> get<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.620> illusion<00:03:10.010> then

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
3d scene you get the illusion then

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.300 
3d scene you get the illusion then
you're<00:03:11.030> in<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.329> regular<00:03:11.629> 3d<00:03:12.109> scene<00:03:12.319> exactly<00:03:13.040> but

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
you're in a regular 3d scene exactly but

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.679 
you're in a regular 3d scene exactly but
what's<00:03:13.489> really<00:03:13.700> going<00:03:14.090> on<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.450> that<00:03:14.569> that

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
what's really going on is that that

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.030 
what's really going on is that that
camera<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.109> locked<00:03:15.260> in<00:03:15.500> place<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:15.919> you're

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
camera is locked in place and you're

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.500 
camera is locked in place and you're
just<00:03:16.220> positioning<00:03:16.730> exactly<00:03:17.239> where<00:03:17.389> this

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
just positioning exactly where this

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.179 
just positioning exactly where this
three<00:03:17.720> model<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.200> 3d<00:03:18.470> model<00:03:18.709> is<00:03:18.799> gonna<00:03:19.010> be

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:19.189 
three model a 3d model is gonna be

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.069 
three model a 3d model is gonna be
positioned<00:03:19.639> okay<00:03:20.000> you're<00:03:20.150> just<00:03:20.269> locating<00:03:20.959> it

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
positioned okay you're just locating it

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.719 
positioned okay you're just locating it
somewhere<00:03:21.379> in<00:03:21.500> space<00:03:21.799> so<00:03:22.250> let<00:03:22.340> me<00:03:22.400> go<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.609> give

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:22.729 
somewhere in space so let me go and give

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.610 
somewhere in space so let me go and give
a<00:03:22.790> quick<00:03:22.940> demonstration<00:03:23.209> of<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.440> if<00:03:24.500> we

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
a quick demonstration of this so if we

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.640 
a quick demonstration of this so if we
jump<00:03:24.859> over<00:03:24.979> into<00:03:25.639> ZBrush<00:03:26.139> here<00:03:27.139> we<00:03:27.260> are<00:03:27.440> I'm

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
jump over into ZBrush here we are I'm

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.740 
jump over into ZBrush here we are I'm
gonna<00:03:27.769> open<00:03:28.099> up<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.370> lightbox<00:03:28.849> and<00:03:29.269> we<00:03:29.540> have

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
gonna open up the lightbox and we have

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.809 
gonna open up the lightbox and we have
some<00:03:30.019> files<00:03:30.379> that<00:03:30.680> came<00:03:30.889> along<00:03:31.129> with<00:03:31.190> ZBrush

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
some files that came along with ZBrush

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.229 
some files that came along with ZBrush
and<00:03:32.290> I'll<00:03:33.290> grab<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.859> certainly<00:03:34.489> not<00:03:34.819> stick

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
and I'll grab a certainly not stick

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.530 
and I'll grab a certainly not stick
horse<00:03:35.419> looking<00:03:35.870> model<00:03:36.199> of<00:03:36.379> a<00:03:36.500> dog<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:37.120> as<00:03:38.120> I

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
horse looking model of a dog and as I

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.020 
horse looking model of a dog and as I
click<00:03:38.599> and<00:03:39.109> drag<00:03:39.169> out<00:03:39.739> here<00:03:39.919> in<00:03:40.010> my<00:03:40.099> view<00:03:40.430> we

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
click and drag out here in my view we

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.300 
click and drag out here in my view we
are<00:03:41.060> rotating<00:03:41.479> around<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.440> 3d<00:03:42.709> model<00:03:42.799> or<00:03:43.220> it

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
are rotating around this 3d model or it

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.550 
are rotating around this 3d model or it
looks<00:03:43.729> like<00:03:44.120> we're<00:03:44.449> rotating<00:03:44.690> around<00:03:45.079> this<00:03:45.290> 3d

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
looks like we're rotating around this 3d

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.909 
looks like we're rotating around this 3d
model<00:03:45.949> in<00:03:46.159> truth<00:03:46.790> my<00:03:47.449> camera<00:03:47.989> is<00:03:48.139> locked<00:03:48.349> in<00:03:48.620> in

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
model in truth my camera is locked in in

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.129 
model in truth my camera is locked in in
space<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.519> it's<00:03:49.699> not<00:03:49.879> moving<00:03:50.299> at<00:03:50.479> all<00:03:50.510> what

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
space and it's not moving at all what

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.469 
space and it's not moving at all what
I'm<00:03:51.260> doing<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.739> I'm<00:03:51.979> rotating<00:03:52.879> this<00:03:53.060> model

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:53.479 
I'm doing is I'm rotating this model

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.909 
I'm doing is I'm rotating this model
around<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.169> looking<00:03:54.530> at<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:54.769> from<00:03:54.799> different

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
around and looking at it from different

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.250 
around and looking at it from different
angles<00:03:55.340> just<00:03:55.699> like<00:03:56.150> if<00:03:56.299> you<00:03:56.419> had<00:03:56.629> a<00:03:56.659> little<00:03:56.930> toy

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
angles just like if you had a little toy

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.649 
angles just like if you had a little toy
dog<00:03:57.620> you're<00:03:58.459> not<00:03:58.639> going<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.060> just<00:03:59.209> hold<00:03:59.419> the

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
dog you're not going to just hold the

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.119 
dog you're not going to just hold the
dog<00:03:59.870> in<00:04:00.139> place<00:04:00.379> with<00:04:00.560> your<00:04:00.709> hand<00:04:00.889> and<00:04:01.010> then

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
dog in place with your hand and then

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:02.710 
dog in place with your hand and then
move<00:04:01.310> your<00:04:01.489> head<00:04:01.669> around<00:04:01.819> it<00:04:02.150> in<00:04:02.269> a<00:04:02.359> circle

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
move your head around it in a circle

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.119 
move your head around it in a circle
mm-hm<00:04:03.079> you'd<00:04:03.229> be<00:04:03.319> really<00:04:03.470> talented<00:04:03.709> if<00:04:04.040> you

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
mm-hm you'd be really talented if you

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.800 
mm-hm you'd be really talented if you
could<00:04:04.250> do<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.400> true<00:04:05.000> instead<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.780> just

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
could do that true instead you just

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.020 
could do that true instead you just
rotate<00:04:06.409> the<00:04:06.590> dog<00:04:06.769> and<00:04:07.040> you<00:04:07.129> kind<00:04:07.519> of<00:04:07.579> twist<00:04:07.849> it

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
rotate the dog and you kind of twist it

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.369 
rotate the dog and you kind of twist it
in<00:04:08.120> your<00:04:08.269> hand<00:04:08.479> and<00:04:08.599> generally<00:04:09.019> your<00:04:09.199> head

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
in your hand and generally your head

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.289 
in your hand and generally your head
itself<00:04:09.799> stays<00:04:10.069> relatively<00:04:10.639> stationary

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
itself stays relatively stationary

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.360 
itself stays relatively stationary
that's<00:04:11.599> exactly<00:04:12.229> what's<00:04:12.409> going<00:04:12.680> on<00:04:12.829> in<00:04:12.979> ZBrush

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
that's exactly what's going on in ZBrush

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.879 
that's exactly what's going on in ZBrush
it's<00:04:13.759> important<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.299> know<00:04:14.479> that<00:04:14.509> because<00:04:14.989> in<00:04:15.829> a

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
it's important to know that because in a

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.140 
it's important to know that because in a
lot<00:04:16.039> of<00:04:16.070> cases<00:04:16.310> where<00:04:16.579> you<00:04:16.669> feel<00:04:16.849> like<00:04:17.000> you're

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
lot of cases where you feel like you're

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.360 
lot of cases where you feel like you're
maybe<00:04:17.299> zooming<00:04:18.079> in<00:04:18.320> on<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.769> model<00:04:19.130> what<00:04:19.250> you're

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
maybe zooming in on a model what you're

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.460 
maybe zooming in on a model what you're
actually<00:04:19.519> doing<00:04:19.699> is<00:04:20.120> scaling<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:20.930> model<00:04:21.289> up

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
actually doing is scaling that model up

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.890 
actually doing is scaling that model up
and<00:04:21.709> scaling<00:04:22.400> it<00:04:22.610> down<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.120> it's<00:04:23.509> precisely

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
and scaling it down and it's precisely

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.219 
and scaling it down and it's precisely
this<00:04:24.500> behavior<00:04:25.250> of<00:04:25.460> ZBrush<00:04:26.120> is<00:04:26.300> document<00:04:27.080> this

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
this behavior of ZBrush is document this

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.649 
this behavior of ZBrush is document this
two<00:04:27.469> and<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.650> half<00:04:27.800> denature<00:04:28.250> that<00:04:28.849> allows<00:04:29.360> it

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:29.659 
two and a half denature that allows it

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:30.900 
two and a half denature that allows it
to<00:04:29.870> maintain

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
to maintain

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.880 
to maintain
millions<00:04:31.840> and<00:04:32.080> millions<00:04:32.440> upwards<00:04:32.740> of<00:04:32.830> a

millions and millions upwards of a

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.280 
millions and millions upwards of a
billion<00:04:33.160> polygons<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.840> fact<00:04:35.020> that<00:04:35.140> they<00:04:35.230> do

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
billion polygons the fact that they do

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.080 
billion polygons the fact that they do
not<00:04:35.440> have<00:04:35.950> a<00:04:36.250> scene<00:04:36.700> that<00:04:36.790> they<00:04:36.910> had<00:04:37.000> to

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
not have a scene that they had to

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.370 
not have a scene that they had to
navigate<00:04:37.480> through<00:04:37.750> allows<00:04:37.990> them<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.200> really

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
navigate through allows them to really

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.440 
navigate through allows them to really
optimize<00:04:39.010> how<00:04:39.460> things<00:04:39.700> get<00:04:39.850> rendered<00:04:40.060> out<00:04:40.270> to

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
optimize how things get rendered out to

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.000 
optimize how things get rendered out to
your<00:04:40.540> screen<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:41.110> guess<00:04:41.320> one<00:04:41.470> of<00:04:41.500> the<00:04:41.680> things<00:04:41.890> I

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
your screen I guess one of the things I

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.460 
your screen I guess one of the things I
could<00:04:42.190> really<00:04:42.430> make<00:04:42.730> this<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.510> don't<00:04:44.200> know<00:04:44.320> this

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
could really make this I don't know this

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.800 
could really make this I don't know this
illusion<00:04:45.160> so<00:04:45.400> strong<00:04:45.790> I'm<00:04:46.120> already<00:04:46.330> there<00:04:46.510> yes

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
illusion so strong I'm already there yes

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.050 
illusion so strong I'm already there yes
the<00:04:47.050> fact<00:04:47.200> that<00:04:47.350> we<00:04:47.500> have<00:04:47.650> this<00:04:47.860> grid<00:04:48.310> yeah<00:04:48.880> and

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
the fact that we have this grid yeah and

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.280 
the fact that we have this grid yeah and
you're<00:04:49.180> so<00:04:49.360> used<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:49.630> seeing<00:04:49.840> this<00:04:50.020> if<00:04:50.170> you're

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
you're so used to seeing this if you're

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.050 
you're so used to seeing this if you're
from<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.470> 3d<00:04:50.740> package<00:04:51.130> I<00:04:51.280> mean<00:04:51.430> you<00:04:51.520> see<00:04:51.670> a<00:04:51.700> 3d

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
from a 3d package I mean you see a 3d

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.460 
from a 3d package I mean you see a 3d
grid<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.450> that<00:04:52.540> immediately<00:04:52.990> tells<00:04:53.080> you<00:04:53.380> this

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
grid and that immediately tells you this

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.320 
grid and that immediately tells you this
is<00:04:53.530> a<00:04:53.650> 3d<00:04:53.980> scene<00:04:54.190> in<00:04:54.340> fact<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.970> first<00:04:55.180> time<00:04:55.270> I

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
is a 3d scene in fact the first time I

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.090 
is a 3d scene in fact the first time I
ever<00:04:55.570> saw<00:04:55.810> this<00:04:55.990> in<00:04:56.170> ZBrush<00:04:56.560> I<00:04:56.740> kind<00:04:57.070> of

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
ever saw this in ZBrush I kind of

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.620 
ever saw this in ZBrush I kind of
giggled<00:04:57.430> because<00:04:57.730> I<00:04:57.760> was<00:04:57.940> thinking<00:04:58.240> oh<00:04:58.390> it's

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
giggled because I was thinking oh it's

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.570 
giggled because I was thinking oh it's
like<00:04:58.780> Mudbox<00:04:59.200> now<00:04:59.410> you<00:04:59.830> actually<00:05:00.010> have<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.310> 3d

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
like Mudbox now you actually have a 3d

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.460 
like Mudbox now you actually have a 3d
scene<00:05:00.790> but<00:05:01.180> it's<00:05:01.300> not<00:05:01.480> it's<00:05:01.930> just<00:05:02.020> a<00:05:02.260> grid

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
scene but it's not it's just a grid

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.230 
scene but it's not it's just a grid
that's<00:05:02.680> attached<00:05:02.950> to<00:05:02.980> your<00:05:03.250> model<00:05:03.580> and<00:05:03.760> really

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
that's attached to your model and really

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.790 
that's attached to your model and really
in<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.390> end<00:05:04.480> you're<00:05:05.110> doing<00:05:05.350> the<00:05:05.440> same<00:05:05.590> thing

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
in the end you're doing the same thing

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.350 
in the end you're doing the same thing
with<00:05:05.950> or<00:05:06.100> without<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.460> grid<00:05:06.670> it's<00:05:06.910> just<00:05:07.120> sort

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
with or without the grid it's just sort

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.690 
with or without the grid it's just sort
of<00:05:07.480> a<00:05:07.690> sanity<00:05:08.620> check<00:05:08.650> to<00:05:09.040> make<00:05:09.130> sure<00:05:09.190> you<00:05:09.460> kind

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
of a sanity check to make sure you kind

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.000 
of a sanity check to make sure you kind
of<00:05:09.790> know<00:05:09.970> where<00:05:10.450> you<00:05:10.630> are<00:05:10.660> in<00:05:11.050> relation<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.530> the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
of know where you are in relation to the

it's<00:05:26.860> now<00:05:27.040> just<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.610> feature<00:05:27.880> on<00:05:28.210> our<00:05:28.450> canvas

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
it's now just a feature on our canvas

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.200 
it's now just a feature on our canvas
it's<00:05:29.140> a<00:05:29.290> collection<00:05:29.710> of<00:05:29.920> pixels<00:05:30.850> that<00:05:31.030> have

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
it's a collection of pixels that have

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.180 
it's a collection of pixels that have
some<00:05:31.600> depth<00:05:31.840> to<00:05:31.960> them<00:05:32.200> so<00:05:32.680> I<00:05:32.710> can<00:05:32.980> grab

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
some depth to them so I can grab

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.190 
some depth to them so I can grab
something<00:05:33.640> like<00:05:33.850> a<00:05:34.030> regular<00:05:34.510> brush<00:05:34.720> tool<00:05:34.990> and

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
something like a regular brush tool and

well<00:05:35.950> that's<00:05:36.220> a<00:05:36.280> pretty<00:05:36.460> terrible<00:05:36.700> brush<00:05:37.150> let

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
well that's a pretty terrible brush let

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.420 
well that's a pretty terrible brush let
me<00:05:37.480> click<00:05:37.720> on<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.870> Alpha<00:05:38.350> panel<00:05:38.740> and<00:05:38.890> choose

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
me click on the Alpha panel and choose

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.960 
me click on the Alpha panel and choose
alpha<00:05:39.640> zero<00:05:40.030> one<00:05:40.270> and<00:05:41.340> then<00:05:42.340> I<00:05:42.400> can<00:05:42.550> paint<00:05:42.790> back

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
alpha zero one and then I can paint back

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.190 
alpha zero one and then I can paint back
here<00:05:43.180> as<00:05:43.240> well<00:05:43.390> and<00:05:43.480> you<00:05:43.540> can<00:05:43.720> see<00:05:43.930> that<00:05:44.110> my

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
here as well and you can see that my

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.960 
here as well and you can see that my
painting<00:05:44.650> is<00:05:44.710> actually<00:05:45.100> affecting<00:05:45.640> the<00:05:45.670> dog

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
painting is actually affecting the dog

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.580 
painting is actually affecting the dog
as<00:05:46.240> well<00:05:46.270> so<00:05:46.810> what<00:05:46.900> happens<00:05:47.170> if<00:05:47.260> you<00:05:47.320> go<00:05:47.410> back

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
as well so what happens if you go back

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.870 
as well so what happens if you go back
into<00:05:47.770> edit<00:05:47.950> now<00:05:48.190> and<00:05:48.370> rotate

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
into edit now and rotate

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.640 
into edit now and rotate
well<00:05:49.000> I<00:05:49.030> can't<00:05:49.390> you'll<00:05:49.930> notice<00:05:50.170> that<00:05:50.260> my<00:05:50.380> edit

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
well I can't you'll notice that my edit

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.420 
well I can't you'll notice that my edit
button<00:05:50.860> is<00:05:50.950> actually<00:05:51.070> grayed<00:05:51.400> out

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
button is actually grayed out

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.730 
button is actually grayed out
interesting<00:05:52.210> because<00:05:52.390> edit<00:05:52.900> only<00:05:53.050> works<00:05:53.560> with

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
interesting because edit only works with

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.200 
interesting because edit only works with
the<00:05:53.830> most<00:05:54.010> recent<00:05:54.430> thing<00:05:54.670> that<00:05:54.820> you've<00:05:54.970> done

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
the most recent thing that you've done

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.360 
the most recent thing that you've done
so<00:05:55.990> for<00:05:56.170> instance<00:05:56.530> if<00:05:56.650> I<00:05:56.740> really<00:05:57.070> wanted<00:05:57.280> to

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
so for instance if I really wanted to

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.890 
so for instance if I really wanted to
edit<00:05:57.460> that<00:05:57.700> dog<00:05:57.910> and<00:05:58.120> I<00:05:58.150> just<00:05:58.180> hit<00:05:58.420> control<00:05:58.660> Z<00:05:58.750> a

couple<00:05:59.230> of<00:05:59.320> times<00:05:59.530> to<00:05:59.800> get<00:05:59.980> us<00:06:00.100> to<00:06:00.220> a

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
couple of times to get us to a

you<00:06:10.690> had<00:06:10.870> to<00:06:10.900> think<00:06:11.200> of<00:06:11.350> this<00:06:11.470> not<00:06:11.710> as<00:06:12.250> an

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
you had to think of this not as an

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.150 
you had to think of this not as an
actual<00:06:13.030> 3d<00:06:13.420> model<00:06:13.900> in<00:06:14.020> terms<00:06:14.350> of<00:06:14.620> zebra<00:06:14.950> it's

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
actual 3d model in terms of zebra it's

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.910 
actual 3d model in terms of zebra it's
just<00:06:15.400> an<00:06:15.520> element<00:06:15.880> for<00:06:16.270> making<00:06:16.750> an<00:06:16.930> image<00:06:17.680> if

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
just an element for making an image if

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.610 
just an element for making an image if

now if you're planning on exporting this
out<00:06:26.980> to<00:06:27.250> an<00:06:27.400> obj<00:06:27.910> so<00:06:27.970> that<00:06:28.240> you<00:06:28.300> can<00:06:28.450> open<00:06:28.660> it<00:06:28.750> up

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
out to an obj so that you can open it up

out to an obj so that you can open it up
in<00:06:28.990> 3d<00:06:29.590> application<00:06:30.160> X<00:06:30.340> then<00:06:30.970> that's<00:06:31.150> kind<00:06:31.300> of

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
in 3d application X then that's kind of

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.450 
in 3d application X then that's kind of
its<00:06:31.540> own<00:06:31.630> thing<00:06:31.690> but<00:06:32.410> that's<00:06:32.620> like<00:06:32.770> too<00:06:32.980> vastly

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
its own thing but that's like too vastly

different behaviors of ZBrush I also
want<00:06:35.530> to<00:06:35.560> mention<00:06:35.650> this<00:06:36.010> if<00:06:36.220> you're<00:06:36.670> used<00:06:36.970> to

know here's your whole document that you
slide<00:06:41.830> around<00:06:42.210> ZBrush<00:06:43.210> is<00:06:43.390> also<00:06:43.690> fully

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
slide around ZBrush is also fully

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.580 
slide around ZBrush is also fully
capable<00:06:44.140> of<00:06:44.410> doing

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
capable of doing

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.450 
capable of doing
so<00:06:46.590> it<00:06:46.650> feels<00:06:46.800> like<00:06:46.890> you're<00:06:47.100> moving<00:06:47.220> your

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
so it feels like you're moving your

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.370 
so it feels like you're moving your
viewport<00:06:47.820> around<00:06:48.060> but<00:06:48.210> really<00:06:48.420> it's<00:06:48.690> if<00:06:48.960> you

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
viewport around but really it's if you

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.660 
viewport around but really it's if you
picture<00:06:49.620> this<00:06:49.860> viewport<00:06:50.160> as<00:06:50.340> being<00:06:50.520> like<00:06:50.640> a

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
picture this viewport as being like a

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.940 
picture this viewport as being like a
window<00:06:51.090> into<00:06:51.270> ZBrush<00:06:51.660> is<00:06:51.840> world<00:06:52.050> you<00:06:52.770> can<00:06:52.920> just

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 
window into ZBrush is world you can just

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.830 
window into ZBrush is world you can just
kind<00:06:53.190> of<00:06:53.280> you<00:06:53.970> know<00:06:54.060> kind<00:06:54.240> of<00:06:54.330> move<00:06:54.540> your<00:06:54.690> eyes

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
kind of you know kind of move your eyes

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.390 
kind of you know kind of move your eyes
around<00:06:54.870> and<00:06:55.320> look<00:06:55.500> at<00:06:55.590> different<00:06:55.620> parts<00:06:56.190> of

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
around and look at different parts of

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.190 
around and look at different parts of
the<00:06:56.550> window<00:06:56.850> but<00:06:57.390> you're<00:06:57.570> not<00:06:57.690> really<00:06:57.930> doing

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.200 
the window but you're not really doing

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.320 
the window but you're not really doing
anything<00:06:58.530> else<00:06:58.770> we<00:06:59.190> can<00:06:59.370> for<00:06:59.820> that<00:06:59.910> matter<00:07:00.060> we

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
anything else we can for that matter we

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.420 
anything else we can for that matter we
can<00:07:00.480> also<00:07:00.600> zoom<00:07:00.830> but<00:07:01.830> that's<00:07:02.010> just<00:07:02.100> making

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
can also zoom but that's just making

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.490 
can also zoom but that's just making
those<00:07:02.580> pixels<00:07:02.970> get<00:07:03.210> bigger<00:07:03.480> and<00:07:03.660> smaller<00:07:03.870> it's

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
those pixels get bigger and smaller it's

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.430 
those pixels get bigger and smaller it's
not<00:07:04.710> really<00:07:05.310> making<00:07:05.550> the<00:07:06.240> model<00:07:06.540> get<00:07:07.200> bigger

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 
not really making the model get bigger

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.020 
not really making the model get bigger
or<00:07:07.620> smaller<00:07:07.710> it's<00:07:08.040> two<00:07:08.220> entirely<00:07:08.580> separate

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
or smaller it's two entirely separate

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.760 
or smaller it's two entirely separate
modes<00:07:09.270> of<00:07:09.420> navigation<00:07:09.960> and<00:07:10.080> we'll<00:07:10.350> talk<00:07:10.590> about

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
modes of navigation and we'll talk about

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.320 
modes of navigation and we'll talk about
both<00:07:11.070> of<00:07:11.100> those<00:07:11.370> in<00:07:11.670> an<00:07:11.850> upcoming<00:07:11.970> video

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
both of those in an upcoming video

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.370 
both of those in an upcoming video
