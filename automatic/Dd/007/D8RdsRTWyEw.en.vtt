skeptical of of such high returns from
the<00:00:59.270> day<00:00:59.510> we<00:00:59.809> started<00:01:00.290> six<00:01:00.980> weeks<00:01:01.280> later<00:01:01.550> the

the day we started six weeks later the
system<00:01:02.960> was<00:01:03.140> in<00:01:03.410> place<00:01:03.440> our<00:01:03.980> employees<00:01:04.670> were

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
system was in place our employees were

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.420 
system was in place our employees were
trained<00:01:05.239> and<00:01:05.539> we<00:01:05.689> were<00:01:05.869> using<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.680> system<00:01:06.979> as

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
trained and we were using the system as

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.209 
trained and we were using the system as
it<00:01:07.909> was<00:01:08.060> expected<00:01:08.869> to<00:01:09.049> be<00:01:09.229> used<00:01:09.590> the

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
it was expected to be used the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.670 
it was expected to be used the
infrastructure<00:01:10.789> requirements<00:01:11.680> really

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
infrastructure requirements really

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.850 
infrastructure requirements really
wasn't<00:01:12.950> much<00:01:13.280> at<00:01:13.490> all<00:01:13.670> on<00:01:13.850> our<00:01:14.030> part<00:01:14.390> I<00:01:15.140> was

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
wasn't much at all on our part I was

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.920 
wasn't much at all on our part I was
actually<00:01:16.040> really<00:01:16.520> surprised<00:01:17.090> with<00:01:17.479> how<00:01:17.900> easy

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
actually really surprised with how easy

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.920 
actually really surprised with how easy
it<00:01:18.710> was<00:01:19.010> to<00:01:19.040> implement<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.760> system<00:01:20.210> in<00:01:20.479> 30

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
it was to implement the system in 30

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.770 
it was to implement the system in 30
minutes<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:22.460> can<00:01:22.700> be<00:01:22.729> up<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.270> using<00:01:23.659> the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
minutes you can be up and using the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.679 
minutes you can be up and using the
system<00:01:23.990> as<00:01:24.439> an<00:01:25.130> operator<00:01:25.610> on<00:01:25.760> the<00:01:26.030> floor<00:01:26.360> it's

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
system as an operator on the floor it's

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.070 
system as an operator on the floor it's
very<00:01:27.200> intuitive<00:01:27.740> it's<00:01:28.250> very<00:01:28.760> easy<00:01:29.150> to<00:01:29.390> use

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
very intuitive it's very easy to use

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.100 
very intuitive it's very easy to use
