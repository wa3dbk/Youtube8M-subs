interior of it on the inside is really
cool<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> memory<00:01:39.060> foam<00:01:39.210> material<00:01:39.390> so

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
cool this is a memory foam material so

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.300 
cool this is a memory foam material so
you<00:01:40.439> know<00:01:40.500> sort<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.740> those<00:01:40.890> mattress

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
movies or something you know it's kind
of<00:01:44.759> squishy<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.689> know<00:01:45.810> holds<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.290> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
of squishy and it you know holds on to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.100 
of squishy and it you know holds on to
its<00:01:46.829> up<00:01:47.159> its<00:01:47.460> shape<00:01:48.360> whatever<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.750> pushing<00:01:49.020> up

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
its up its shape whatever is pushing up

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.870 
its up its shape whatever is pushing up
against<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> sort<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.399> an<00:01:50.490> eggcrate

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
against it it's a sort of an eggcrate

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.330 
against it it's a sort of an eggcrate
kind<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.659> pattern<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.680> if<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.130> kind<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
kind of a pattern on it if I can kind of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
kind of a pattern on it if I can kind of
catch<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.570> light<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
catch that in the light and on the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.109 
catch that in the light and on the
camera<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.490> pretty<00:01:56.610> cool<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.939> first

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
camera so this is pretty cool the first

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.730 
camera so this is pretty cool the first
case<00:01:57.299> I've<00:01:57.479> seen<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.049> memory<00:01:58.530> foam

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
case I've seen it with this memory foam

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.740 
case I've seen it with this memory foam
so<00:01:58.950> no<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.310> should<00:01:59.729> contour<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.479> shape

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so no this should contour to the shape

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.719 
so no this should contour to the shape
of<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.020> iPad<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.009> pretty<00:02:02.189> cool<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
of the iPad you know pretty cool so a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
pretty nice looking stuff right there so

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.709 
pretty nice looking stuff right there so
let's<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> ipad<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:06.149> there<00:02:06.329> are<00:02:06.360> four

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
let's get the ipad in so there are four

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.150 
let's get the ipad in so there are four
corners<00:02:07.079> again<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> description<00:02:07.950> set

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
corners again like the description set

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.180 
corners again like the description set
and<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.759> stick<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.119> ipad<00:02:09.479> in

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
and you can just stick the ipad in

and you can just stick the ipad in
inside<00:02:11.190> there<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.970> holds<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.270> really<00:02:12.540> well

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
inside there this holds it really well

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.030 
inside there this holds it really well
in<00:02:12.959> place<00:02:13.349> on<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.800> only

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
in place on the only

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
it up a little bit to get the cable in

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.640 
it up a little bit to get the cable in
there<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.569> microphone<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.230> little<00:02:34.470> cover

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
there the microphone is a little cover

there the microphone is a little cover
but<00:02:34.829> it's<00:02:34.920> not<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.069> big<00:02:35.280> deal<00:02:35.310> because<00:02:35.609> not

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
but it's not a big deal because not

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.270 
but it's not a big deal because not
right<00:02:36.180> up<00:02:36.329> against<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.840> speaker<00:02:37.290> up<00:02:38.010> top<00:02:38.220> here

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
right up against the speaker up top here

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.129 
right up against the speaker up top here
it's<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.879> little<00:02:39.090> tough<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.299> get<00:02:39.480> at<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.900> power

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
it's a little tough to get at the power

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.929 
it's a little tough to get at the power
button<00:02:40.769> which<00:02:41.220> would<00:02:41.340> be<00:02:41.430> over<00:02:41.579> here<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.730> guess

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
button which would be over here I guess

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.670 
button which would be over here I guess
right<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.659> have<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.870> power<00:02:43.019> button<00:02:43.319> because

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
right you have the power button because

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.379 
right you have the power button because
it<00:02:43.769> is<00:02:43.889> covered<00:02:44.189> up<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.489> what<00:02:44.879> it<00:02:44.969> is<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.239> this

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
it is covered up and what it is is this

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.960 
it is covered up and what it is is this
little<00:02:45.659> lip<00:02:45.930> kind<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.650> comes<00:02:47.099> up<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.579> you<00:02:47.790> know

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
little lip kind of comes up and you know

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.640 
little lip kind of comes up and you know
it's<00:02:48.120> kind<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.389> good<00:02:48.540> bad<00:02:48.689> thing<00:02:48.900> where<00:02:49.170> this

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
it's kind of a good bad thing where this

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.929 
it's kind of a good bad thing where this
will<00:02:49.799> give<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.040> some<00:02:50.189> protection<00:02:50.730> because

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
will give it some protection because

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.520 
will give it some protection because
it's<00:02:51.329> not<00:02:51.540> going<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.290> know<00:02:52.349> it's<00:02:52.470> not
