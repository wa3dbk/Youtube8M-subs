00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
tree this tree is not growing in its

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.020 
tree this tree is not growing in its
natural<00:00:43.320> environment<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:44.040> got<00:00:44.250> all<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
natural environment it's got all the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.590 
natural environment it's got all the
great<00:00:45.210> things<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:46.470> requires<00:00:47.180> Sun<00:00:48.180> water

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
great things it requires Sun water

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.290 
great things it requires Sun water
nutrition<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.220> growing<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.670> lot

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
nutrition so it's growing a lot

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.990 
nutrition so it's growing a lot
it<00:00:51.540> becomes<00:00:51.870> very<00:00:52.110> heavy<00:00:52.430> becomes<00:00:53.430> very<00:00:53.640> thick

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
it becomes very heavy becomes very thick

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000 
it becomes very heavy becomes very thick
becomes<00:00:54.720> more<00:00:54.900> prone<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.200> breakage<00:00:55.470> as<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
becomes more prone to breakage as a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.890 
becomes more prone to breakage as a
result<00:00:56.400> this<00:00:56.490> is<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:56.910> they've<00:00:57.120> done<00:00:57.390> to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.270 
behind me you can see that Manuel is
cutting<00:02:32.180> off<00:02:32.300> part<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.590> tree<00:02:33.890> that's<00:02:34.100> on

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
cutting off part of the tree that's on

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.790 
cutting off part of the tree that's on
the<00:02:34.460> top<00:02:34.730> topping<00:02:35.630> off<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.780> tree<00:02:36.170> that's<00:02:36.560> not

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
the top topping off the tree that's not

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.380 
the top topping off the tree that's not
supposed<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.220> be<00:02:37.370> good<00:02:37.580> but<00:02:37.880> in<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:38.150> instance

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
supposed to be good but in this instance

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.460 
supposed to be good but in this instance
it's<00:02:38.810> okay

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
it's okay

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.320 
it's okay
right<00:02:39.980> this<00:02:40.160> is<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.580> wouldn't<00:02:40.910> really<00:02:41.120> be

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
right this is this wouldn't really be

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.020 
right this is this wouldn't really be
considered<00:02:42.020> topping<00:02:42.590> what<00:02:42.980> he's<00:02:43.100> doing<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.700> we

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
considered topping what he's doing is we

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.750 
considered topping what he's doing is we
call<00:02:44.240> it<00:02:44.270> reduction<00:02:44.900> turning<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.310> is

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
call it reduction turning so it is

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.000 
call it reduction turning so it is
shortening<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.540> limbs<00:02:47.810> but<00:02:48.200> we<00:02:48.560> shorten<00:02:48.920> them

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
shortening the limbs but we shorten them

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.130 
shortening the limbs but we shorten them
properly<00:02:49.430> cut<00:02:49.850> them<00:02:50.030> back<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.420> our<00:02:50.450> branches

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
properly cut them back to our branches

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.970 
properly cut them back to our branches
so<00:02:51.770> that<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:51.980> cut<00:02:52.880> black<00:02:53.150> tracheal<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.500> we<00:02:54.710> are

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
so that the cut black tracheal so we are

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.180 
so that the cut black tracheal so we are
all<00:02:55.280> done<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.210> the<00:02:56.510> tree<00:02:56.930> was<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.500> hundred

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
all done and the tree was a hundred

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.070 
all done and the tree was a hundred
percent<00:02:58.580> better<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:59.150> can't<00:02:59.480> wait<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.810> see<00:02:59.960> the
