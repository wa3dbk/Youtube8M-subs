 I advise you to experiment with them 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.610
 types or perhaps to create more messages 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.050

 just enter your link here and then 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.370
 go to the next step 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.930
 I recommend you choose this 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.510
 goal if you have a facebook page 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.400

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.500

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.780
 value with versions on the website semila 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.760
 the previous goal but in this case 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.959
 you can measure the actions that people 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.750
 run on your site 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.549
 then monitor conversions like 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.650
 purchases or registrations on 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.269
 specify page for example a site e 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.430

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.380
 information before you can activate 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.510
 I would need this listing though 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.030
 a tracking pixel you can create 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.920
 and insert following calmly le 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.510
 indications that facebook itself gives you 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.090
 going sometimes we have interactions with 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.010

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.250
 and engaging, such as a video 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.710

 increase your audience and build the 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.870
 your brand does not need to create a 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.550
 remember, however, to choose some 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.710
 images that expected in the function e 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.720
 are in line with tourism 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.640
 this listing is great for increasing 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.380
 the fanbase of your matri page 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.450
 advises you to weave it with others 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.070
 types of ads to render again 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.810
 more effective than its strategy 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.760
 marketing 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.290
 the two following goals installation 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.300
 application interaction with 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.220

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.490

 obviously all this is useful both in 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.900
 applications to promote no 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.060
 let's move on to the last two goals 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.800
 for me they are among the most interesting 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.449
 event responses if you have the program 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.949

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.539
 occasion of meeting that concerns the 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.400
 topping can increase the 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.319
 participation in the event by promoting the 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.389
 specific page is created on facebook 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.250
 if your event is already active and visible 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.960
 on your page you will find a menu a 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.150
 drop down to be able to select it 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.610
 otherwise I should go back to yours 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.349
 page to create it as new we ad 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.800
 example we can create the event for 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.669
 social media marketing of 2014 and then 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.520

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.110
 its products or services 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.419
 select the offer from the drop-down menu 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.330

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.030

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.639
