 part dl to the constitutional reform project that will lead to referendum 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.530
 this time he said he will propose the creation of communal power as power 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.569
 of the state 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.230
 it's about transferring powers to the communal power 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.020
 as for example that it is the community itself that is in charge of 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.490
 manage the issue of garbage and basic services by managing the 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.700
 resources needed for that purpose 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.170
 also the mate of resources attributions what they are of the state 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.090
 the government 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.330
 transfer them 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.340
 to the community 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.220
 attributions that are from mayors 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.220
 and I'm sure the mayors are not going to oppose that 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.790
 I'm sure the governors will be able to oppose 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.050
 But those who oppose Moreno 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.290
 they will have the right to object but the final decision will be in the hands of gm 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.360

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.010

 and asked on behalf of the peoples of the world to stop 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.920
