other than you don't you think probably

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.020 
other than you don't you think probably
just<00:00:12.930> about<00:00:13.140> everyone<00:00:13.680> on<00:00:13.890> the<00:00:14.040> planet<00:00:14.310> feels

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
just about everyone on the planet feels

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.740 
just about everyone on the planet feels
like<00:00:15.300> they<00:00:15.450> don't<00:00:15.630> fit<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.049> most<00:00:16.980> definitely

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
like they don't fit in most definitely

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.850 
like they don't fit in most definitely
but<00:00:18.750> my<00:00:18.870> question<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.320> why<00:00:19.470> does<00:00:19.619> everyone

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
but my question is why does everyone

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.450 
but my question is why does everyone
keep<00:00:19.950> trying<00:00:20.869> well<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.170> think<00:00:22.320> once<00:00:22.770> everyone

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
keep trying well I think once everyone

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.019 
keep trying well I think once everyone
realizes<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.150> they're<00:00:25.100> very<00:00:26.100> beautiful<00:00:26.730> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
realizes that they're very beautiful and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.810 
realizes that they're very beautiful and
unique<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.690> their<00:00:28.080> own<00:00:28.140> way<00:00:28.340> then<00:00:29.340> they<00:00:29.520> can<00:00:29.670> be

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
unique in their own way then they can be

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.460 
unique in their own way then they can be
more<00:00:30.000> accepting<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.539> themselves<00:00:31.020> is<00:00:31.320> that

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
more accepting of themselves is that

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.930
