00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.359 
you could actually go to your load up
screen<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:13.020> use<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> previous<00:01:14.070> saved

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
screen and then use the previous saved

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.010 
screen and then use the previous saved
file<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.119> aren't<00:01:15.299> thought<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.869> you
