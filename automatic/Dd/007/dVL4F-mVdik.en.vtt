movie as a composer some years ago I won

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.600 
movie as a composer some years ago I won
a<00:00:44.070> brothers<00:00:44.430> movie<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.989> still<00:00:46.430> trying<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
a brothers movie I was still trying to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.049 
a brothers movie I was still trying to
find<00:00:47.820> my<00:00:48.030> way<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.600> Los<00:00:48.930> Angeles<00:00:49.850> but<00:00:50.850> we've

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
find my way in Los Angeles but we've

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.920 
find my way in Los Angeles but we've
created<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.840> great<00:00:52.829> formula<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:54.210> Hans<00:00:54.539> how<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
created a great formula with Hans how to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.150 
created a great formula with Hans how to
incorporate<00:00:55.440> big<00:00:56.010> African<00:00:56.989> choirs<00:00:58.160> drums

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
incorporate big African choirs drums

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.700 
incorporate big African choirs drums
with<00:00:59.789> Eurocentric<00:01:00.570> instrument<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
with Eurocentric instrument and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.969 
with Eurocentric instrument and
orchestration<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.449> think<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.530> even

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
orchestration and I think that even

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.640 
orchestration and I think that even
though<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> movie<00:01:05.519> didn't<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.900> great<00:01:07.439> as

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
though the movie didn't do as great as

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.520 
though the movie didn't do as great as
anticipated<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.150> soundtrack<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.200> put<00:01:10.409> us

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
anticipated the soundtrack really put us

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.969 
anticipated the soundtrack really put us
out<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.260> did<00:01:13.439> one<00:01:13.680> or<00:01:13.830> two

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
out there and I think I did one or two

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.590 
out there and I think I did one or two
other<00:01:14.159> projects<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:14.880> Hans<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.390> started

the Masters or to the public but do you
see<00:05:54.520> two<00:05:54.729> things<00:05:54.970> I<00:05:55.240> think<00:05:55.530> generally<00:05:56.530> even<00:05:57.460> in

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
see two things I think generally even in

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.029 
see two things I think generally even in
the<00:05:57.880> most<00:05:58.200> traumatized<00:05:59.200> countries<00:05:59.680> in<00:05:59.800> a<00:05:59.860> war

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
the most traumatized countries in a war

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:05.219 
the most traumatized countries in a war
people<00:06:00.070> have<00:06:00.820> a<00:06:00.850> life<00:06:01.210> and<00:06:02.110> people<00:06:02.620> do<00:06:04.229> get

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
people have a life and people do get

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.810 
people have a life and people do get
entertainment<00:06:06.070> it's<00:06:06.430> some<00:06:07.060> some<00:06:07.539> level<00:06:08.130> and<00:06:09.130> I

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
entertainment it's some some level and I

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.480 
entertainment it's some some level and I
think<00:06:10.120> what<00:06:10.330> the<00:06:10.479> ranking<00:06:10.960> offers<00:06:11.590> the<00:06:12.039> global

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
think what the ranking offers the global

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.580 
think what the ranking offers the global
community<00:06:13.030> is<00:06:13.539> one<00:06:13.960> of<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.140> very<00:06:14.350> few

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
community is one of the very few

though it's deeply african-inspired in
essence<00:06:32.280> so<00:06:32.970> I<00:06:33.020> don't<00:06:34.020> think<00:06:34.229> even<00:06:34.710> when

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
essence so I don't think even when

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.749
