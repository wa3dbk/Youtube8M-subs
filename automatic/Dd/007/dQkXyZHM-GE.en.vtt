00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.370
 Turn your garden into a green oasis of grass 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.319
 then full of the movie will help you with that 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:11.759
 start digging the existing soil about twenty centimeters deep 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.769
 as well as for the old turf to be trenched or removed so that the 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.539
 clean soil comes on top 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.579
 compacting the soil with a forest or kick this sturdy 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.470
 now the rule can start earlier 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.470
 use a heart for the first coarse equalization 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.180
 Then cover the substrate street with a plank so that any bumps and 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:37.600
 pits disappear into the soil 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.690
 make sure that the height plus minus 2 centimeters lower than it 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.610
 court sets 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.610
 This is easy to control the dog shelves flat to the bottom next to it 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.630
 terrace to set the fire 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.970
 the subsurface structures through a light fine egelization 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.610
 you do this through the bottom about three centimeters deep 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.620
 closer obstacle 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.720
 possibly with extra and pk and fertilizer added food 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.480
 for a quick rooting of the sod 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.480
 now one can start laying the turf 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.810
 Always start in a right corner of the dunes and make sure there is such a good one 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 connecting to the terrace on the curb 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.320
 slide the turf close to each other with the board so that it is nice and tight 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 come to lie 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.680
 cut the turf to length with a knife or spades 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.450
 and turns left over pieces to explain why in the following 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.320
 keep this order of giving away 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.320
 consistent 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.200
 holden turf barack obama and put them in half band 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.910
 same principle as a brick wall 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.349
 make sure that the grass side connects well together 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.319
 or in the attic with the school job 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.519
 start spraying the soles immediately 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.700
 due to this a few days plentiful and then regularly 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.529
 want to know if you have sprayed enough 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:39.269
 much better than the turf 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.219
 to see if the surface is well wet 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.959
 checks regularly 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.059
 until the turf is solid 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.059
 we wish you a lot of pain pleasure 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.949
 hendriks turf 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.409
 just as around presse rouches
