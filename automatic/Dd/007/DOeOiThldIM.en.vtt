figure<00:00:00.450> out<00:00:00.570> what<00:00:00.719> she<00:00:00.840> could<00:00:01.050> wait<00:00:01.199> once<00:00:01.439> she

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
figure out what she could wait once she

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.409 
figure out what she could wait once she
should<00:00:01.740> weigh<00:00:01.890> okay<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.610> this<00:00:02.970> is<00:00:03.149> how<00:00:03.270> i<00:00:03.300> did

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
should weigh okay and this is how i did

should weigh okay and this is how i did
it<00:00:03.540> i<00:00:03.720> started<00:00:04.110> by<00:00:04.200> looking<00:00:04.380> at<00:00:04.620> her<00:00:04.710> lean<00:00:04.890> body

mass now why would I do that because
that's<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.389> root<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.690> her<00:00:09.809> weight<00:00:09.990> right

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740

that's<00:00:11.610> how<00:00:11.730> much<00:00:11.880> she<00:00:11.910> weighs<00:00:12.210> when<00:00:12.420> you

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
that's how much she weighs when you

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.759 
that's how much she weighs when you

out<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:16.229> she's<00:01:16.350> losing<00:01:16.710> about

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
out that if she's losing about

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.770 
out that if she's losing about
thirty-six<00:01:17.369> pounds<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.729> fat<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.150> we're

thirty-six pounds of fat and we're

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.060 
thirty-six pounds of fat and we're
losing<00:01:18.869> fat<00:01:19.170> at<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.350> pace<00:01:19.500> about<00:01:19.799> two<00:01:19.950> to

three pounds a week we could be done in
12<00:01:22.020> weeks<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.860> knew<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.009> right<00:01:23.549> from<00:01:23.759> day

something<00:06:29.850> how<00:06:30.810> often<00:06:31.050> do<00:06:31.290> you<00:06:31.320> see<00:06:31.470> a<00:06:31.500> program

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
something how often do you see a program

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.610 
something how often do you see a program
ran<00:06:32.250> that<00:06:32.610> efficiently<00:06:33.290> with<00:06:34.290> diet<00:06:34.530> and

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
ran that efficiently with diet and

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.050 
ran that efficiently with diet and
exercise<00:06:34.710> manipulation<00:06:35.640> happening<00:06:35.970> on<00:06:36.030> a

weekly basis never almost never so my

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.190 
weekly basis never almost never so my
message<00:06:38.070> do<00:06:38.610> you<00:06:38.700> guys<00:06:38.880> is<00:06:39.150> results<00:06:39.840> like<00:06:40.020> this

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
message do you guys is results like this

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.550 
message do you guys is results like this
are

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
are

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.370 
are
possible<00:06:41.010> results<00:06:41.400> like<00:06:41.520> this<00:06:41.669> can<00:06:41.910> be<00:06:42.090> real

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 
but this is a kind of science that needs

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.540 
but this is a kind of science that needs
to<00:06:45.510> be<00:06:45.630> applied<00:06:45.960> and<00:06:46.230> as<00:06:47.160> long<00:06:47.280> as<00:06:47.430> we're
