00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:35.300
 afa l island it's been days 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:38.080
 weeks of months of years she does not 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.080
 never disappears 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.420
 it's the same with the cold one 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.250
 terrible cold 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.110
 sometimes I had the feeling that my 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.110
 blood circulation was slowing down 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.870
 I was impressed by my own 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.510
 endurance given the circumstances I would have 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.870
 had to fall seriously ill and die soon 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.870
 the beginning 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.700
 one night I was put in a cell 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:41.619
 whose window was broken kgb 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.210
 wanted to see if he could get me 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:49.689
 to die of cold he would have said he broke 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.770
 the glass and the cold kill her I was 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.390
 desperate I said to myself but god did you 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.890
 abandoned 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.600
 forgotten matthew is what I suffered 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.600
 during all these years for nothing 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.250
 and in my despair I started to 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.250
 pray 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.040
 usually I took in silence but there 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.040
 I shouted god did you abandon me 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.239
 the valley cry of the deepest of me 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.060
 one night I had a dream 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.700
 and in this dream someone told me to 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:54.020
 pray for alexander I never had 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.440
 heard of him but with my 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.730
 church 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.730
 we began to pray 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.000
 immediately I felt a heat or 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.000
 others 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.860
 it was supernatural 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.150
 as a mother who serves on her heart 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.700
 his proud prior child and warms him up 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:30.519
 by breath full of compassion 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:33.640
 it was a living solar itself that 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.290
 were going right to my heart there 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.620
 created a source from which to flow 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.129
 a pair a wonderful peace and 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.129
 soothing 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.920
 it's like someone caring 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.190
 had just put his hand on my shoulder 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.620
 jelly actually felt this gesture wanted 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.250
 to say you're not alone you're not 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.050
 abandoned we are with you 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.050
 we share your sufferings 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.799
 that's how you made me 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.769
 physically feel the heat of the 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.250
 I felt it on the skin in 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.250
 my whole being 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:37.760
 it was as if the prayers changed 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:40.460
 love in heat in the morning 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.910
 guards or yes a shock he did not understand 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.680
 nothing not only I was alive but 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.460
 my body gave off the same heat 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.460
 than a normal person 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.930
 I heard a doctor say it's 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.380
 impossible 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.380
 this inexplicable 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.569
 six months later a door letter 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.199
 open we propose to pray for 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:13.709
 alexander that's how we have 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:17.330
 learned he was for six months we 

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:17.330
 had prayed without knowing anything about him 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.080
 alexander had mounted a movement 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.259
 Christian extended to the whole union 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.509
 soviet for this crime against the state 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.749
 he was sent to a camp north of 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:34.740
 Siberia a place we do not come back to 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:37.759
 not finally a lot of people have 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.759
 started praying for me 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.030
 we 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.180
 Oh 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.150
 Oh 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:05.099
 and that's exactly the moment that 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:06.120
 I was released the prayer opened the 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.580
 prison doors 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.360
 and as the gospel says it frees 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.360
 the captives 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.240
