00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello girls we find ourselves 

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:05.549
 today with a new video is 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.069
 a video of the hit leader tube this is the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.870
 first dressed in saddle on my chain he 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.580
 Witsel is already some on my blog 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.620
 uninteresting I'll put that we talk 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.960
 information I realized a few 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.359
 crop top models quite easy to 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.010
 realize and as summer comes I 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.779
 how nice it was to make you feel 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.430
 do that I really hope that you 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.529
 I'll leave you right away with 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.869
 all the steps to achieve the 8 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.970
 march it you will need funds to 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.329
 basic rethel and a pair of scissors 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.040
 simply at first I 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.079
 just listen to using my pair of 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.469
 frangy scissors all through my 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.329
 water 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.399
 of course before doing this step there 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.250
 we will have to try the top to know 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:49.350
 where do you stop once it's done 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.579
 I come to take two fringes and I 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.800
 ties between them making a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.090
 double knot and then I would have done the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.510
 same thing for all the others 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.510
 fringe 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.199
 then you have several options to 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.900
 you leave the fringes like this and 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.060
 your water is over or you decide 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.820
 to shorten the fringes in this case 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.590
 draw a small line with the length 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:20.440
 that you wish with screaming marratier 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.479
 is cut out with the silos after having 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.100
 cut a first time tried the top 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.650
 to see if the length is right for you 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.110
 and I still do not agree with you 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.110
 take a pair of scissors a pencil 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.790
 and you redÃ©couper all I 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.400
 wanted something short enough so 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.930
 that's what I did and of course you 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.250
 can you stop there 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.200
 I chose to make braces 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.450
 cross at the back so for that I 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.490
 feel neither water nor I cut them 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.840
 braces 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.070
 then I meet them and once 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.700
 that they are in place I hold them 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.619
 with pins 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.990
 I will then thread a needle and 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.910
 I'm going to do some stitches 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.740
 it's really super simple you do not have 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.420
 no need to be a great couture ya 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.320
 you just have to pretend 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.320
 refuse to admit to think 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.350
 and that's it for the first 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.350
 model 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.709
 facing the second model so I already have 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.950
 do my frog all along a wall 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.950
 top 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.519
 I then come attached but frau I 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.870
 will do so it's always the same 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.870
 technique for the first model 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.880
 then for the second row in 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.860
 every knot there are two fringes actually 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.690
 he understand a close in a knot 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.790
 is innocent bangs in the night of a 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.430
 side and then you tied them in 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.260
 doing a duplicate will only create as a 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.450
 kind of grid and suddenly I 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.050
 repeat the same thing over four to five 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.050
 projects in sight 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.950
 then I have two options I 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.950
 discover all the fringes that exceeds 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.380
 and that's what it gives 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.590
 either I size a little but fringes and I 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.620
 leave them like that and that's the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.620
 result 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.090
 for these top quacks I will need in 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.340
 the chalk church and a pair of 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.019
 scissors 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.599
 I chose my vegetables without size 34 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.370
 36 for it to fit well after 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.799
 it's up to you to see what size you 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.659
 will go so at first I more 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:45.420
 my church to both being careful 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:46.950
 from all sides be well put once 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.049
 that it's done I want to come traced to the 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.030
 chalk where I want to cut for 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.430
 to start does not undertake any 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.590
 case it might happen we find a 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.329
 neckline 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.370
 once I've drawn I wanted 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.030
 cut with my scissors 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.030
 quite simply 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.340
 and that's my own top is over 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.480
 then I do exactly the same thing 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.220
 thing I 'm coming get the piece of 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.580
 fabric that I cut on the first 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.610
 vegetable 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.190
 because I want the neckline to be 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.050
 a little bit missing legs I was coming 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.780
 pass an inward line for 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.270
 that the hole is smaller and then 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:38.680
 like I still take the studio and I 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.680
 cut and voila 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.520
 so here are the girls it's over for the 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.690
 first duel on the chain I hope that 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.270
 it will have pleased you
