penetrates<00:00:27.900> them<00:00:28.439> what<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.920> done<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
penetrates them what we have done is

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.060 
penetrates them what we have done is
because<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.349> combined<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.040> with

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
because we have combined it with

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.910 
because we have combined it with
tretinoin<00:00:32.730> retin-a<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.690> retina<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> mild

tretinoin retin-a and retina is a mild
acid<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.059> does<00:00:36.210> basically<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.930> it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
acid what it does basically the it

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.799 
acid what it does basically the it

than a hundredth of a centimeter but

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.389 
than a hundredth of a centimeter but
it's<00:00:44.250> enough<00:00:44.930> to<00:00:45.930> allow<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.500> penetration<00:00:47.370> of

it's enough to allow the penetration of
the<00:00:47.460> actual<00:00:47.910> medication<00:00:48.539> now<00:00:48.780> I'm<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the actual medication now I'm here to

where<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.590> does<00:00:52.739> its<00:00:52.920> work<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.000> does<00:00:54.180> here

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
where it does its work what it does here

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.189 
where it does its work what it does here
it<00:00:54.719> increases<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:56.190> absorption<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:57.270> monoxide

it increases the absorption of monoxide
and<00:00:58.379> retin-a<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.640> does<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.030> opens

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and retin-a and what it does it opens
