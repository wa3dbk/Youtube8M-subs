00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello very good to all welcome a 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:09.240
 day more today I teach you how to put the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.219
 background in the nintendo eshop it's worth I know 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.139
 which is something that almost everyone knows 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.780
 but for people who do not know it 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.970
 here I am, so it's worth first 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.390
 that we have to get to put 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.000
 funds is to buy a card of these 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.740
 OK 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.740
 which is usually bought in any 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.820
 hypermarket and any side you have 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.559
 videogames and good because of the back 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.370
 a code that I'm going to cover in case 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.220
 flies 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.870
 has a code here that you have to 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.970
 introduce as follows 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.230
 I will say next to see in the 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.830
 screen below the nintendo eshop 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.980
 here is a menu worth you download down 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.949
 and you give to add funds is super 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.260
 simple and then you have to give to use 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.690
 an oscar flashlight if you have the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.100
 card that has shown you a card 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.960
 of credit that I get on that subject does not 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.010
 I get in because I prefer to use once 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.019
 I understand he did call 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.240
 and then you have to enter the 16 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.920
 character of the activation code that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 figure the reverse of the nintendo already 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.270
 Oscar and I introduce it did not take anything to 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.670
 see little sent me a style like 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.159
 want to call introduce 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.159
 to see skin to skin 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.320
 perfect 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.320
 this this and this 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.360
 anyway, even if you had seen the 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.160
 code would have happened nothing but 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.390
 because once someone activates her 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.750
 that you can not reactivate many 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.040
 times if not this would be an authentic 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.650
 someone would buy one already be all 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.570
 the world with that same code adding 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.770
 funds and good is already full introduced 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.640
 so let's accept 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.020
 and it's worth 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.020
 it is already loading 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.040
 we leave it like this 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.599
 and we wait for him to load 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.140
 then funds to be added 15 euros 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:22.099
 I want to serve these funds because yes 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.099
 well then we add them 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.110
 and it's already there when I was given 15 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.520
 jump 15 because we already have the funds 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.480
 added 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.480
 now let's accept 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.129
 and we already have the funds added to 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.410
 inside so if you liked the 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:49.140
 dalai video favorites and we won in 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.140
 the next video until the next goodbye
