00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:11.730 

I'm<00:00:03.720> cold

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.669 

now<00:00:12.740> I<00:00:12.769> say<00:00:13.099> is<00:00:13.280> a<00:00:13.309> bit<00:00:13.549> unusually<00:00:13.940> busy<00:00:14.119> today

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
now I say is a bit unusually busy today

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.310 
now I say is a bit unusually busy today
the<00:00:15.679> traffic<00:00:16.100> is<00:00:16.219> not<00:00:16.460> backed<00:00:17.060> up<00:00:17.330> this<00:00:17.990> far

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
the traffic is not backed up this far

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.670 
the traffic is not backed up this far
normally<00:00:18.830> so<00:00:19.220> I<00:00:19.869> think<00:00:20.869> we're<00:00:20.990> facing<00:00:21.260> and

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
normally so I think we're facing and

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.090 
normally so I think we're facing and
incredibly

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:01:11.399 

looks<00:00:26.700> like<00:00:26.910> quite<00:00:27.150> busy<00:00:27.390> right<00:00:27.690> in

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.810 

oh<00:01:11.469> well<00:01:12.329> my<00:01:13.329> choice<00:01:13.539> but<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.929> wait

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.370 

there's<00:01:17.450> no<00:01:17.540> I'm<00:01:17.750> going<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:17.960> fit<00:01:18.110> through<00:01:18.200> that

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
there's no I'm going to fit through that

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.410 
there's no I'm going to fit through that
gun<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:22.250> tend<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:22.909> keep<00:01:23.090> away<00:01:23.390> from

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
gun and I tend to keep away from

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.200 
gun and I tend to keep away from
filtering<00:01:24.380> from<00:01:24.650> large<00:01:25.310> trucks<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:25.910> this<00:01:26.030> I'm

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
filtering from large trucks and this I'm

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:59.790 
filtering from large trucks and this I'm
absolutely<00:01:26.600> short<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.200> get<00:01:27.320> through

yeah so I have ordered a new exhaust
first<00:02:59.950> bike<00:03:00.129> which<00:03:00.519> hope<00:03:00.730> she<00:03:00.939> should

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
first bike which hope she should

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.500 
first bike which hope she should
hopefully<00:03:01.510> should<00:03:01.780> be<00:03:02.170> coming<00:03:02.530> today<00:03:02.739> and

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.959 

basically<00:03:09.450> it's<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.569> so<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.170> i<00:03:11.200> can

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969 
basically it's just so that i can

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.130 
basically it's just so that i can
replace<00:03:12.969> that<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.180> want<00:03:13.359> the<00:03:13.450> bike<00:03:13.659> to<00:03:13.930> sound

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
replace that you want the bike to sound

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.670 
replace that you want the bike to sound
louder<00:03:15.659> Mimi<00:03:16.659> for<00:03:16.959> situations<00:03:17.379> like<00:03:17.439> this

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
louder Mimi for situations like this

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.619 
louder Mimi for situations like this
while<00:03:17.920> I'm<00:03:17.980> filling<00:03:18.370> free<00:03:18.519> traffic<00:03:18.760> now<00:03:19.120> can<00:03:19.510> I

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629
