I'm not to fight this guy and before you

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.889 
I'm not to fight this guy and before you
find<00:01:41.159> somebody<00:01:41.400> as<00:01:42.030> say<00:01:42.299> there's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> vent

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
find somebody as say there's a vent

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.600 
find somebody as say there's a vent
coming<00:01:43.200> up<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.680> watch<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.130> event<00:01:44.430> like

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
coming up you can watch the event like

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.399 
coming up you can watch the event like
say<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.390> watch<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.750> computer<00:01:46.140> versus

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
say you watch like computer versus

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.149 
say you watch like computer versus
computer<00:01:46.770> fights<00:01:47.329> and<00:01:48.329> say<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.750> UFC<00:01:49.470> 130<00:01:49.950> was

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
computer fights and say like UFC 130 was

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.389 
computer fights and say like UFC 130 was
on<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.000> watch<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.770> obviously

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
on you can watch it and it's obviously

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.280 
on you can watch it and it's obviously
computer<00:01:53.850> versus<00:01:54.119> computer<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:55.110> pretty

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
computer versus computer but it's pretty

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.359 
computer versus computer but it's pretty
cool<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.770> watch<00:01:55.920> stuff<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
cool that you can watch stuff like that

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.149 
cool that you can watch stuff like that
it<00:01:56.670> makes<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.000> look<00:01:57.540> kind<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:57.899> Vargas<00:01:58.740> is

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it makes it look kind of like Vargas is

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.789 
it makes it look kind of like Vargas is
real<00:01:59.430> life<00:01:59.700> as<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.649> considering<00:02:01.649> it's

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
real life as you can be considering it's

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.069 
real life as you can be considering it's
a<00:02:01.860> video<00:02:01.979> game<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.689> it's<00:02:03.689> pretty<00:02:03.899> cool

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
a video game but it's pretty cool

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.859 
a video game but it's pretty cool
because<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.409> makes<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:05.399> goes<00:02:06.240> along<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
because it makes it it goes along the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.859 
because it makes it it goes along the
lines<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.560> career<00:02:07.920> mode<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.459> don't<00:02:09.090> do<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
lines of the career mode I don't do it

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.869 
lines of the career mode I don't do it
I<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.170> go<00:02:10.259> straight<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.590> my<00:02:10.679> fight<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.280> for

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
I just go straight to my fight but for

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.280 
I just go straight to my fight but for
some<00:02:12.000> people<00:02:12.090> might<00:02:12.360> want<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.659> watch<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:13.019> and

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
some people might want to watch that and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.750 
some people might want to watch that and
it<00:02:13.500> makes<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.799> feel<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.069> it's<00:02:14.310> more<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.700> a

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
it makes it feel like it's more of a

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.670 
it makes it feel like it's more of a
career<00:02:14.970> mode<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:16.110> guess<00:02:16.260> that's<00:02:16.440> pretty

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
career mode and I guess that's pretty

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.039 
career mode and I guess that's pretty
good<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.129> little<00:02:17.400> subtle<00:02:17.819> thing<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.900> don't

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
good a little subtle thing and I don't

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.600 
good a little subtle thing and I don't
have<00:02:19.140> had<00:02:19.260> any<00:02:19.530> other<00:02:19.650> ones<00:02:19.890> because<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.400> really

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
have had any other ones because I really

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.860 
have had any other ones because I really
didn't<00:02:20.790> plan<00:02:20.909> to<00:02:20.970> curb<00:02:21.209> moon<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> other<00:02:21.599> ones

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
didn't plan to curb moon the other ones

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.979 
didn't plan to curb moon the other ones
but<00:02:22.610> I'm<00:02:23.610> playing<00:02:23.849> this<00:02:23.970> curve<00:02:24.269> career<00:02:24.810> mode

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
but I'm playing this curve career mode

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.960 
but I'm playing this curve career mode
because<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.920> course<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.459> servers<00:02:26.790> are<00:02:26.909> down

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
because of course the servers are down

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.729 
because of course the servers are down
once<00:02:27.360> again<00:02:27.599> I<00:02:27.629> got<00:02:27.840> two<00:02:28.019> fights<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.500> today

discussed<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.630> in<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.870> video<00:03:16.079> before<00:03:16.230> this

discussed this in a video before this

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.890 
discussed this in a video before this
but<00:03:16.859> it<00:03:17.669> shouldn't<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.269> they<00:03:18.450> should

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
him to show the video of that or my

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.339 
him to show the video of that or my
first<00:03:59.730> fight<00:03:59.940> in<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.060> UFC<00:04:00.290> probably<00:04:01.290> the

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
first fight in the UFC probably the

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.990 
first fight in the UFC probably the
first<00:04:01.500> fine<00:04:01.709> do<00:04:01.889> see<00:04:02.160> because<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.519> sounds<00:04:02.790> more

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
first fine do see because it sounds more

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.030 
first fine do see because it sounds more
appealing<00:04:03.599> because<00:04:04.019> a<00:04:04.440> lot<00:04:04.680> of<00:04:04.709> people<00:04:04.769> don't

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
appealing because a lot of people don't

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.509 
appealing because a lot of people don't
even<00:04:05.129> know<00:04:05.250> what<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:05.730> WFA<00:04:06.239> is<00:04:06.480> or<00:04:06.750> what<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:06.959> was

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
even know what the WFA is or what it was

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.759 
even know what the WFA is or what it was
so<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:09.150> first<00:04:09.329> UFC<00:04:09.840> fight<00:04:10.139> i'll<00:04:10.290> probably<00:04:10.530> put

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769
