00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 i 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.770
 hello friends of turn cat this time 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.040
 I bring you a room for Huawei 510 is 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.710
 a run kit kat 4.4 points 4 is going to 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.660
 to show 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.339
 well I want to clarify is that these icons 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.099
 I a pack of icons are not the 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:31.720
 originals that the good car brings 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.720
 to enter to see when he brings 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.880
 i 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.300
 let's go about the device and we'll see 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.910
 that is an android 4.4 points 2 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.910
 kit kat as you will see here friends 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.930
 I want to clarify but it will give you my 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.060
 points about this room this rom this is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.110
 a rom that brings quite fluidity in the 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.260
 device in question 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.370
 and applications when you work them 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.820
 there is no lag 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.460
 yes that's not for games do not eat 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.140
 quite the battery when you're playing 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.880
 very much I do not recommend it to play if 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.460
 they want it for 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.490
 for everyday use more applications what 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.220
 simpler is not very good and even 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.860
 I'm going to show you a screenshot of me 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.600
 drums 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.590
 is already regulated by approving 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.590
 approximately 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.430
 I tried like four days and everything so 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.220
 regular always lasted me is the battery 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.180
 12 hours almost almost 13 hours with wifi 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.340
 on and the cell phone signal 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.950
 practice is very good this battery and 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.090
 As I tell you, this course works 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.450
 for applications to say 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.640
 practically stick for the common but if 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.470
 is for games I do not recommend it not for 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.010
 games you do not eat pretty much the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.460
 good battery that's my point that 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.110
 I found and sometimes in the games there is a 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.910
 little bit of lag in the games in which 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.220
 He still needs more work to be 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.140
 a constantly being updated now 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.020
 that brings the section in the settings 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.850
 good in configurations here comes 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.860
 comes here pad with sun from where we 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.570
 mentions 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.910
 they will be updating with treatment 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.200
 to the rumba that is a point in favor 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.230
 but the bad is what it is 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.400
 alak in the games but the good thing is the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.950
 Battery not have not changed anything 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.050
 I have not installed any module anything else 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.960
 that my personal things that are this 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.720
 my emails the applications my data 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.420
 cetera 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.070
 and the route is very good for me 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.140
 This is how I work very well everyday 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.420
 good friends I want to clarify that this 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.840
 rom brings his section here of 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.180
 customization where you'll find topics 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.230
 we can change the interface we will see that 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.180
 as the classic is a 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.920
 here we will see all the critics and already 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.019
 They have a personalized the 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.330
 notifications can work this 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.730
 the 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.820
 what is the notification bar 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.680
 practically good friends this one 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.390
 recommended is Russia wants to install 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.790
 for daily use and for the battery but 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.580
 for games not good friends for 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.120
 continue with installation turning off my 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.120
 device 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.230
 good here as it enters me 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.550
 good recovery on restarting we can 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.340
 be from the recovery no longer turning off 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.480

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.950
 power off dimension 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.730
 we will explore 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.060
 inhabitants will automatically feel the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.060
 recovery mode 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.590

 contributions no longer the room but of another type 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.039
 since practically my channel is 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.330
 Focusing a lot on the contributions of rice 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.009

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.260
 good friends will continue and the uip that 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.670
 let's clean the device in with 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.430
 advanced 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.260
 usually here the 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.090
 five first because it is very clean 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.130
 the device the internal and the micro 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.580
 headquarters did not select it because there are times 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.580
 that is saved 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.639
 let's say applications or personal data 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.210
 a few music so good 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.889
 just enough to give him win to sip me 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.229
 and I do because 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.849
 I like the rom for the battery more than 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.910
 nothing for the battery because as a quota 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:16.090
 of data at school and everything 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.010
 the battery lasted me very well and that's why the 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.620
 will keep bringing good time friends 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.110

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.430
 ok since it has been cleared the 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.660

00:06:55.509 --> 00:07:00.400
 of the glasses and the rom 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.110
 good friends since you already have our 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.840

 it takes approximately 4 minutes with 5 

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:41.500
 minutes 

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:45.550
