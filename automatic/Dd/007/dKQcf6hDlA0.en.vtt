next thing you want to consider is the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.450 
next thing you want to consider is the
magnification<00:01:14.740> this<00:01:15.740> will<00:01:15.980> affect<00:01:16.310> your

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
magnification this will affect your

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.120 
magnification this will affect your
depth<00:01:16.760> of<00:01:16.910> field<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.570> feel<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.990> view<00:01:18.229> so

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
depth of field and feel the view so

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.880 
depth of field and feel the view so
choose<00:01:19.430> wisely

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
choose wisely

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.710 
choose wisely
