00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.539
 here is the bestseller of nissan the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.830
 qashqai has passed more than 2 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.730
 million copies since its 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.740
 marketing 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.050
 so this second generation has it 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.590
 the potential to succeed to his elder one on 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.590
 see it right now 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.360
 when we have as a customer it is 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.060
 difficult to renew without hitting 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.410
 nissan raises the bet modernizes his 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.060
 model then it's a little pity 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.640
 since it comes in the rank especially 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.080
 compared to the previous generation 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.790
 but however the model retains its 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.860
 adn ie a mix of genres 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.059
 between the world of sedan and 4 4 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.010
 then right away the points 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.989
 distinctives maintained by the manufacturer 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.820
 got double bump on the bonnet 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.700
 a whole new shield a little bit more 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.290
 prominent led daytime running lights but 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.119
 also this v-shaped grille that you 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.830
 will find on several future models 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.420
 of the range so the next x trail 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.430
 so we finish this tour of the owner 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.430
 by the template which is increasing 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.390
 the qashqai is longer down but 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.710
 also wider 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.210
 you have to know that it's based on a 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.580
 any new platform platform 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.619
 modular which is shared equally by 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.800
 renault and soon by the future 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.800
 mÃ©gane 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.850
 the cabin has been totally redesigned 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.890
 has been modernized and above all we see 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.119
 a good when it comes to quality 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.899
 perceived compared to the previous 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.640
 generation 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.590
 whether it is at the level of plastics 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.390
 inserts it's really qualitative but 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.770
 it's not all the kkl is progressing 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.610
 also in terms of content 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.860
 technology 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.270
 so now you will have available in 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.690
 option or on the highest level of 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.759
 finish 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.780
 the nissan these little schild then this 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.340
 program contains a lot 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.899
 of equipment so I'm not going all the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.700
 quote but among them we will remember the 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.410
 park assist the green crossing 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.479
 dina dead angle detection but also 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.250
 the detection of moving objects 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.800
 in parallel the qashqai appears 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.330
 a brand new multimedia console 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.860
 with downloadable applications 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.780
 basically it's a connected car a 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.250
 little bit like the airlink of girona 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.470
 so now what regards 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.090
 the habitability is not hidden it turns out 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.280
 a little less roomy it must be said 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.360
 that the competition certainly that we 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.890
 says she is making progress by 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.780
 compared to the previous generation but 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.700
 livability is still a hair 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.380
 below for example in 3008 for 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.599
 finish the trunk he progresses there 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.310
 now reaches 430 liters and above all 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.569
 becomes a little more flexible 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.989
 thanks to the presence of a floor 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.989
 removable 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.489
 welcome aboard the new qashqai there 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.379
 has for all tastes the essence of 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.579
 diesel from the powerful to the less powerful of the 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.590
 two-wheel drive four-wheel 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.280
 driving the only thing that is missing at 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.430
 catalog 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.200
 these are the seven places the future x trail 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.370
 will take on this role so now 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.889
 let's go back to the dynamic part 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.230
 today we are driving the dci 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.560
 110 which represents most of the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.480
 sales 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.469
 it is attached to the transmission to two 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.900
 drive wheels which she too 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:04.870
 represent 80% of the mixed here it is a 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.209
 marriage that goes very well from an extreme 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.769
 versatility and especially what will surprise 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.109
 today it is his sobriety 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.849
 barely 6 liters of diesel 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.349
 is quiet make reliable which is good 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.030
 known in your pronos we advise you 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.310
 also with the purchase it was tested one 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.049
 v6 dci 130 horses really a 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.129
 wonder with a little more pep 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.930
 now regarding the 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.760
 behavior be aware that nissan has 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.219
 chose to implement a kind of system 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.780
 micro braking that replaces a 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.180
 limited slip differential this is 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.590
 in fact a very elaborate esp that allows 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.980
 to limit the oversteer and the under 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.750
 turn 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.280
 obviously it has disadvantages like 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.719
 early wear of platelets 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.519
 but what really seduced us 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:42.069
 the calibration of suspensions that offers 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.509
 a very good compromise between dynamism and 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.419
 comfort you have to know that this one 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:46.930
 car that turns flat surprisingly on 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.220
 the curves 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.750
 especially for a vehicle of this size 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.699
 but especially that proves extremely 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.079
 comfortable on long distances that 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.580
 falls well since it is intended for the 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.140
 family 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.120
 then successful bet we think yes 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.250
 so despite some flaws like a 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.690
 habitability slightly recessed by 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.310
 compared to the competition it is thought that the 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.620
 qashqai really has a lot of arguments 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.410
 to succeed and win in the segment 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.480
 and find his place on everything as his 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.260
 modern design are strong content 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.940
 technology 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.070
 its dynamic behavior and especially 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.900
 its tariffs to adjust since it starts at 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.360
 21500 euros it will take about 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.190
 26000 euros for the heart of range with 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.060
 a marketing that will take place 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.060
 as of February 2
