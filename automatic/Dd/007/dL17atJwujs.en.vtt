00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
there so it is lined up well we got the

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.210 
there so it is lined up well we got the
body<00:01:11.150> mounted<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:11.750> frame<00:01:12.020> which<00:01:12.830> is<00:01:12.860> good

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
body mounted to the frame which is good

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.310 
body mounted to the frame which is good
so<00:01:13.460> now<00:01:13.640> it's<00:01:13.940> not<00:01:14.150> moving<00:01:14.420> it's<00:01:14.930> not<00:01:15.110> going<00:01:15.259> to

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
so now it's not moving it's not going to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.410 
so now it's not moving it's not going to
shift<00:01:15.470> on<00:01:15.680> us<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.400> what<00:01:16.490> we're<00:01:16.640> taking<00:01:16.820> with<00:01:17.210> is

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
shift on us so what we're taking with is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.219 
shift on us so what we're taking with is
our<00:01:17.600> new<00:01:17.750> body<00:01:17.990> mounts<00:01:19.060> what<00:01:20.060> we<00:01:20.180> have<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:20.750> your

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
our new body mounts what we have is your

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.960 
our new body mounts what we have is your
upper<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.680> lower<00:01:21.770> bushing<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.580> got<00:01:22.850> your

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
upper and lower bushing so you got your

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.300 
upper and lower bushing so you got your
body<00:01:23.119> mount<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.960> upper<00:01:23.990> bushing<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:25.220> you

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
body mount the upper bushing that you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.789 
body mount the upper bushing that you
put<00:01:25.460> into<00:01:25.610> place

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
put into place

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.060 
put into place
get<00:01:27.799> it<00:01:27.920> in<00:01:28.009> there<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:29.020> then<00:01:30.020> we<00:01:30.619> want<00:01:30.799> to<00:01:30.890> line

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
get it in there and then we want to line

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.180 
get it in there and then we want to line
that<00:01:31.280> up<00:01:31.340> with<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.820> hole<00:01:32.110> right<00:01:33.110> here<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:34.100> the

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
that up with the hole right here and the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.760 
that up with the hole right here and the
best<00:01:34.399> way<00:01:34.549> to<00:01:34.580> do<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.539> to<00:01:36.140> just<00:01:36.380> literally

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
best way to do that is to just literally

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.290 
best way to do that is to just literally
bolt<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.970> box<00:01:39.580> get<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.610> good<00:01:40.850> snug

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
bolt it to the box get a good snug

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.760 
bolt it to the box get a good snug
because<00:01:41.569> that's<00:01:41.720> where<00:01:41.929> it's<00:01:42.319> going<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.560> rest

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
because that's where it's going to rest

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.219 
because that's where it's going to rest
this<00:01:42.920> anyway<00:01:46.240> there<00:01:47.240> that's<00:01:47.509> in<00:01:47.720> place<00:01:47.960> what

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
this anyway there that's in place what

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.809 
this anyway there that's in place what
we'll<00:01:48.350> just<00:01:48.530> we'll<00:01:48.619> clamp<00:01:48.830> it<00:01:49.039> on<00:01:49.190> both<00:01:49.490> sides

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
we'll just we'll clamp it on both sides

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.210 
we'll just we'll clamp it on both sides
and<00:01:50.179> weld<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.140> down<00:01:51.319> both<00:01:51.560> sides<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.069> then

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
and weld it down both sides and then

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.370 
and weld it down both sides and then
it's<00:01:52.369> permanent<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.840> I'm<00:01:53.899> going<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.080> take<00:01:54.200> this

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
it's permanent so I'm going to take this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.130 
it's permanent so I'm going to take this
air<00:01:54.560> grinder<00:01:54.950> I'm<00:01:55.159> going<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.670> prep<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.600> sides

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
air grinder I'm going to prep the sides

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.529 
air grinder I'm going to prep the sides
of<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.860> bracket<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.819> we<00:01:58.909> can<00:01:59.060> weld<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.390> to

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
of the bracket so that we can weld it to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.740 
of the bracket so that we can weld it to
the<00:01:59.630> frame<00:02:00.049> of<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.229> car

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.830 

because<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.830> mounts<00:02:06.160> are<00:02:06.280> going<00:02:06.400> to<00:02:06.460> be

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
because the mounts are going to be

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.719 
because the mounts are going to be
metal-on-metal<00:02:08.100> you<00:02:09.100> don't<00:02:09.280> want<00:02:09.460> to<00:02:09.550> leave

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
metal-on-metal you don't want to leave

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.760 
metal-on-metal you don't want to leave
this<00:02:09.910> bare<00:02:10.090> metal<00:02:10.270> underneath<00:02:10.600> so<00:02:10.960> to<00:02:11.020> rust<00:02:11.380> so

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
this bare metal underneath so to rust so

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.170 
this bare metal underneath so to rust so
what<00:02:11.950> we<00:02:12.040> need<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.280> do<00:02:12.490> is<00:02:12.610> use<00:02:12.760> some<00:02:12.790> weld

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
what we need to do is use some weld

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.450 
what we need to do is use some weld
through<00:02:13.360> primer<00:02:13.420> spray<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.680> down<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.340> it's

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
through primer spray it down and it's

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.830 
through primer spray it down and it's
got<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> metal<00:02:15.790> additive<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.750> can

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
got a metal additive to it so you can

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.260 
got a metal additive to it so you can
weld<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.680> still<00:02:17.920> seal<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.520> from<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
weld in and still seal it from the
