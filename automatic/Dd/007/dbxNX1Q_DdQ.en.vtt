00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
moments that if I know that this is

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.050 
moments that if I know that this is
gonna<00:01:50.259> happen<00:01:50.710> then<00:01:51.340> I'm<00:01:51.460> gonna<00:01:51.670> play<00:01:51.850> this

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
differently yes that's one way but as a

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.520 
differently yes that's one way but as a
character<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.750> doesn't<00:01:55.810> happen<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.440> the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
character that doesn't happen to the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.020
