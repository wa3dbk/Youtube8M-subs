00:00:00.747 --> 00:00:02.372
 You can 

00:00:02.907 --> 00:00:04.044
 he was asked. 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.378
 Before the scorpion, 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.878
 watch showing short bar and 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.930
 we need to see where it shows. 

00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:15.306
 It's exactly 7. 

00:00:15.696 --> 00:00:19.274
 Then we're behind the 7th hour. 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.221
 Then the minute, 

00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:25.075
 we're looking at the long bar showing the minute. 

00:00:26.096 --> 00:00:28.170
 The minute hand shows 12. 

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.130
 In the case of minutes, 

00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:33.558
 If the minute shows 12 

00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:35.561
 0 minutes past. 

00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:40.476
 Each digit on the clock is equal to 5 minutes. 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.246
 The clock here is exactly 7. 

00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:46.775
 It's 7:00. 

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:49.257
 Let's do another example. 

00:00:51.204 --> 00:00:52.254
 Where's the scorpion now? 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.947
 It looks close to 8 rather than 7. 

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:59.673
 But what's important is that he passed 7, 

00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:01.430
 hasn't reached 8 yet. 

00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:04.816
 So we're still on the 7th. 

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:06.710
 It is 7 o'clock. 

00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:09.823
 Watch out, scorpion and minute hand 

00:01:09.824 --> 00:01:13.976
 clockwise So it's not yet 8. 

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:17.204
 What were we doing thinking about the minutes? 

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:19.569
 We were starting at the top of the clock, 

00:01:20.484 --> 00:01:23.250
 The notch 12 represents 0 minutes. 

00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:27.964
 Then every notch up to the minute hand. 

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:29.648
 We go by adding 5. 

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.093
 Zero, five, 

00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:34.312
 Ten, fifteen, 

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:41.946
 twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty and forty-five. 

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:46.513
 That's 45 minutes. 

00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:49.560
 Answer 7, 45. 

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:51.626
 Come on, one more example. 

00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:53.583
 Where's Scorpio? 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.166
 Between 1 and 2. 

00:01:56.085 --> 00:01:59.734
 But it's important to remember that the scorpion is clockwise. 

00:02:00.588 --> 00:02:03.516
 Scorpion is past 1 and is about to reach 2. 

00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:08.928
 So it's still in the first hour. It's 1:00. 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.554
 We're in minutes and 

00:02:12.134 --> 00:02:15.335
 From five to five, we count five. 

00:02:15.884 --> 00:02:23.028
 Zero, five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, 

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:26.897
 Thirty-five, forty, forty-five. 

00:02:27.357 --> 00:02:29.722
 It's 1: 45. 

00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:38.312
 Here's another example. Scorpio once again between 1 and 2. So 1 is past but has not yet reached 2. 

00:02:39.072 --> 00:02:41.266
 So we're still in the first hour. 

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:43.431
 Let's take a minute. 

00:02:43.987 --> 00:02:45.634
 The minute hand shows 12 

00:02:46.252 --> 00:02:48.401
 time is 0 minutes. 

00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:50.753
 1 when showing 5, 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.112
 When displaying 2, 10 and 3 on the display 

00:02:56.571 --> 00:02:58.204
 15 minutes. 

00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:01.826
 Then it's 1: 15. 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.602
 Let's do one last one. 

00:03:05.014 --> 00:03:06.473
 Come on, come on! 

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:09.302
 Here the scorpion shows exactly 2. 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.886
 Your minute hand is exactly 12. 

00:03:12.684 --> 00:03:14.283
 Then clock 

00:03:14.284 --> 00:03:15.891
 2:00.
