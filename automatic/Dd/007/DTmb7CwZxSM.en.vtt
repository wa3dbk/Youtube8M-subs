00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990

particular<00:02:43.170> video<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:44.220> just<00:02:44.520> went<00:02:44.820> full

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
particular video I just went full

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.090 
particular video I just went full
lightning<00:02:45.750> because<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.110> have<00:02:46.350> more<00:02:46.620> lightning

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
lightning because I have more lightning

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.300 
lightning because I have more lightning
here<00:02:47.310> than<00:02:47.640> physical<00:02:48.180> or<00:02:48.390> fire<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.920> let's<00:02:50.130> get

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
here than physical or fire and let's get

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.220 
here than physical or fire and let's get
back<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.730> business<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.300> see<00:02:51.510> how<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.870> build

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
back to business and see how this build

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.850 
back to business and see how this build
actually<00:02:52.709> performs<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:54.450> said<00:02:54.720> before<00:02:54.860> this

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
actually performs as I said before this

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.570 
actually performs as I said before this
is<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.970> great<00:02:57.660> farming<00:02:58.410> build<00:02:58.650> simply<00:02:59.190> because

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
is a great farming build simply because

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.449 
is a great farming build simply because
the<00:02:59.760> movement<00:03:00.239> speed<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.900> great<00:03:01.800> as<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.310> can

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
the movement speed is great as you can

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.520 
the movement speed is great as you can
see<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.730> already<00:03:02.760> started<00:03:03.390> war-winning<00:03:04.050> just

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
see I already started war-winning just

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.280 
see I already started war-winning just
to<00:03:04.620> get<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.920> extra<00:03:05.070> movement<00:03:05.610> speed<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.360> you

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
to get the extra movement speed and you

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.910 
to get the extra movement speed and you
can<00:03:07.500> see<00:03:07.650> here<00:03:07.980> some<00:03:08.220> new<00:03:09.000> goblins<00:03:09.930> they<00:03:10.560> drop

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
can see here some new goblins they drop

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.690 
can see here some new goblins they drop
a<00:03:10.950> ton<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.580> legendaries<00:03:12.570> on<00:03:13.380> live<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:14.400> won't

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
a ton of legendaries on live you won't

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.960 
a ton of legendaries on live you won't
have<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:15.440> pick<00:03:16.440> up<00:03:16.650> legendaries<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.610> they

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
have to pick up legendaries like they

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.940 
have to pick up legendaries like they
fall<00:03:18.269> here<00:03:18.600> because<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.410> don't<00:03:19.620> have<00:03:19.650> two

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
fall here because you don't have two

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.660 
fall here because you don't have two
thousand<00:03:20.459> percent<00:03:21.049> increased<00:03:22.049> operate<00:03:22.680> so

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
thousand percent increased operate so

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.400 
thousand percent increased operate so
that<00:03:23.910> would<00:03:24.060> make<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.480> able<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.870> just<00:03:25.200> go

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
that would make you able to just go

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.070 
that would make you able to just go
ahead<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.739> use<00:03:26.370> all<00:03:26.700> your<00:03:26.970> dots<00:03:27.269> all<00:03:27.660> your

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
ahead and use all your dots all your

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.460 
ahead and use all your dots all your
tornadoes<00:03:28.739> just<00:03:29.310> prop<00:03:29.820> them<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:31.170> go

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
tornadoes just prop them and you just go

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.789 
tornadoes just prop them and you just go
on<00:03:31.500> with<00:03:31.950> your<00:03:32.220> you're<00:03:32.910> clearing<00:03:33.299> ahead<00:03:33.799> and

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
on with your you're clearing ahead and

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.039 
on with your you're clearing ahead and
actually<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.580> this<00:03:35.760> video<00:03:36.180> after<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.720> killed

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
actually in this video after I killed

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.440 
actually in this video after I killed
the<00:03:37.170> rift<00:03:37.410> Guardian<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.190> next<00:03:38.640> map<00:03:38.940> has

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
the rift Guardian the next map has

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.680 
the rift Guardian the next map has
greater<00:03:40.170> density<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.310> can<00:03:41.820> see<00:03:42.180> how<00:03:42.209> fast

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
greater density so you can see how fast

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.229 
greater density so you can see how fast
you<00:03:42.840> can<00:03:42.930> clear<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.350> map<00:03:43.799> with<00:03:44.190> good<00:03:44.580> density<00:03:44.850> as

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
you can clear a map with good density as

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.690 
you can clear a map with good density as
well<00:03:45.510> so<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.410> is<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:46.799> an<00:03:46.950> average<00:03:47.340> rift

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
well so this is just an average rift

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.840 
well so this is just an average rift
that<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.720> already<00:03:48.959> kill<00:03:49.920> everything<00:03:50.610> that

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
that you already kill everything that

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.310 
that you already kill everything that
moves<00:03:51.320> almost<00:03:52.320> instantly<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.750> again<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:55.080> is

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
moves almost instantly and again this is

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.070 
moves almost instantly and again this is
not<00:03:55.500> an<00:03:55.650> optimized<00:03:56.250> build<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:57.269> can<00:03:57.540> pretty

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
not an optimized build you can pretty

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.380 
not an optimized build you can pretty
much<00:03:58.170> go<00:03:59.130> for<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.790> ton<00:04:00.239> more<00:04:00.810> dps<00:04:01.620> on<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:02.549> then

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
much go for a ton more dps on it then

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.500 
much go for a ton more dps on it then
you<00:04:03.600> can<00:04:03.780> see<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.110> this<00:04:04.230> video<00:04:04.549> but<00:04:05.549> I'm<00:04:06.030> not

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
you can see in this video but I'm not

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.320 
you can see in this video but I'm not
sure<00:04:06.540> about<00:04:06.900> how<00:04:07.680> this<00:04:07.950> build<00:04:08.250> can<00:04:08.549> perform<00:04:09.060> in

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
sure about how this build can perform in

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.860 
sure about how this build can perform in
greater<00:04:09.630> rifts<00:04:10.280> simply<00:04:11.280> because<00:04:11.730> if<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.660> have

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
greater rifts simply because if you have

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.170 
greater rifts simply because if you have

about this build is not the damage
because<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.280> damage<00:05:07.520> is<00:05:07.880> not<00:05:07.910> amazing<00:05:08.600> as<00:05:08.960> you

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
because the damage is not amazing as you

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.530 
because the damage is not amazing as you
can<00:05:09.260> see<00:05:09.500> but<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.980> movement<00:05:10.250> speed<00:05:10.790> and<00:05:11.030> the

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
iteration of the set with what it is now

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.570

on<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.060> PTR<00:05:29.480> you<00:05:30.350> can<00:05:30.590> pretty<00:05:30.830> much<00:05:30.920> see<00:05:31.340> it's

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
on the PTR you can pretty much see it's

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.610 
on the PTR you can pretty much see it's
a<00:05:31.760> huge<00:05:32.120> improvement<00:05:32.330> they<00:05:33.320> thought<00:05:33.590> about

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
a huge improvement they thought about

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.920 
a huge improvement they thought about
the<00:05:34.130> damage<00:05:34.760> reduction<00:05:35.090> on<00:05:35.600> a<00:05:35.630> whirlwind

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
the damage reduction on a whirlwind

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.770 
the damage reduction on a whirlwind
build<00:05:36.380> they<00:05:36.980> thought<00:05:37.250> about<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.940> damage<00:05:38.480> and

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
build they thought about the damage and

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.170 
build they thought about the damage and
I<00:05:39.260> think<00:05:39.590> this<00:05:39.770> is<00:05:39.830> all<00:05:40.280> because<00:05:40.610> of<00:05:40.820> the

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
I think this is all because of the

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.510 
I think this is all because of the
feedback<00:05:41.450> on<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.080> set<00:05:42.350> on<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:43.040> forums

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.690

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
because as much as people complain that

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.150 
because as much as people complain that
blizzard<00:05:47.300> that<00:05:47.330> never<00:05:47.750> reads<00:05:48.170> what<00:05:48.920> the

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
updates what I can say is that they

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.749 
updates what I can say is that they
brought<00:06:52.690> potential<00:06:53.680> to<00:06:53.860> this<00:06:54.009> class<00:06:54.310> and<00:06:54.580> the

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 
brought potential to this class and the

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.790 
brought potential to this class and the
fact<00:06:55.030> that<00:06:55.120> we<00:06:55.360> have<00:06:55.630> alternatives<00:06:56.440> to<00:06:56.770> the

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
fact that we have alternatives to the

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.580 
fact that we have alternatives to the
permanent<00:06:57.550> crowd<00:06:57.910> control<00:06:58.120> builds<00:06:58.960> like<00:06:59.199> wake
