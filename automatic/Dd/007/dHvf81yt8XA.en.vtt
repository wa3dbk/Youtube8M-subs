 that person directs to look for 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.190

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.470
 This can be watching here is traffic. 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.250
 heavy team of belo horizonte 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.520
 and he is giving it 8 walking slowly 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.830
 time use I give my opinion I 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.840
 I think it's a good average with the car 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.860
 of this category is a charge of 140 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.290
 automatic horses is comfortable large 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.829
 and I have nothing to complain about this 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.960
 car is an exceptional car who goes 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.020
 want to buy a car can sound 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.600
 buy because it does not give a problem and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.649
 I recently did a maintenance of it 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.890
 and I spent about 400 and 500 reais and 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.909
 there is enough thing no parts are not 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.090
 faces 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.670
 the labor is not expensive and it will 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.299
 do that nor is it just maintenance 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.560
 preventive never want to stay round 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.140
 does not break 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.870
 you can buy without a shadow of a doubt 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.260
 what a car saw 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.810
 and he now at this time walk alcohol 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.370
 not everyone knows that he who else 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.920

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.490
 us per liter walking in the morning 5 month 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.850
 six does not walk in the morning and 16 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.720
 stepping gives ones like so with five and a half 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.660
 but my letter regulating at all to 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.970
 maintenance every day so I guess this 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.040
 provides that the car is a stay a 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.940
 little more economic, but it's a car 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.220
 exceptional, so I support people who 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.160
