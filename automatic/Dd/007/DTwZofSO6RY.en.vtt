00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
way to protect the lens more plastic

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.120 
way to protect the lens more plastic
this<00:03:25.310> is<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.580> last<00:03:25.760> bag<00:03:25.970> I'm<00:03:26.150> taking<00:03:26.450> off<00:03:27.130> lens

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
this is the last bag I'm taking off lens

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.039 
this is the last bag I'm taking off lens
hood<00:03:28.340> I<00:03:28.370> mean<00:03:28.519> it's<00:03:28.640> not<00:03:28.760> that<00:03:28.820> big<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.750> figure

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
hood I mean it's not that big you figure

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.770 
hood I mean it's not that big you figure
you<00:03:30.080> have<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.470> 300<00:03:30.950> 2.8<00:03:31.489> it's<00:03:31.910> pretty<00:03:32.390> similar

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
you have a 300 2.8 it's pretty similar

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.479 
you have a 300 2.8 it's pretty similar
to<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.019> size<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.230> weight<00:03:33.799> of<00:03:33.830> that<00:03:34.190> but

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
to the size and weight of that but

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.930 
to the size and weight of that but
that's<00:03:34.790> because<00:03:35.090> this<00:03:35.330> is<00:03:35.510> an<00:03:35.600> f4<00:03:36.019> so<00:03:36.769> it's<00:03:37.670> not

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
that's because this is an f4 so it's not

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.220 
that's because this is an f4 so it's not
as<00:03:39.549> big<00:03:40.549> if<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.120> was<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.269> 2.8<00:03:41.690> obviously<00:03:42.049> it'd<00:03:42.140> be

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
as big if it was a 2.8 obviously it'd be

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.430 
as big if it was a 2.8 obviously it'd be
huge<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:43.310> here<00:03:43.489> is<00:03:43.579> your<00:03:43.700> filter<00:03:44.120> holder<00:03:44.480> what

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
huge so here is your filter holder what

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.800 
huge so here is your filter holder what
size<00:03:45.680> does<00:03:45.889> it<00:03:46.040> take<00:03:46.220> 52<00:03:46.940> millimeter<00:03:47.420> filter

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
size does it take 52 millimeter filter

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.730 
size does it take 52 millimeter filter
drop-in<00:03:48.230> filter<00:03:48.560> and
