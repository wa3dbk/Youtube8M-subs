00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.619
 Hello everyone guys with you jov and we 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.449
 there is new interesting information super 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.789
 test well and we will start guys of course 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.039
 the most anticipated nerf of the last 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.219
 probably 6 months it certainly concerns 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.349
 t57 heavy in patch 093 scatter guns from 

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:28.509
 Motion running will be increased by 25 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.779
 percent plus to this recharge time 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.590
 guns changed from 25 seconds to 30 seconds 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.629
 as expected 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.550
 rightly the only thing that seems to me 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.440
 maybe a little brute force because 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.660
 that in this respect it was necessary here 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.560
 Only pepsi nerfit wider but also apat 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.480
 amx 50b 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.710
 and not just him there information 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.200
 add before or perry set 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.060
 bang needed to accelerate good 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.770
 experience of this accuracy is possible by 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.640
 mobility that is just needed 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.850
 these two tanks 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.190
 dilute according to the concept that is, if heavy 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.899
 with good dpm you will be admissible with good 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.540
 stabilization and even so he is not much 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.940
 moving then 50b should be very 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.560
 moving course he is more cardboard but 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.939
 at the same time he has super precision there 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.520
 did the balancing department with these 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.320
 changes he just washed these two 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.819
 Tank made them very similar to each 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.310
 friend that is now they have about 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:16.959
 equally recharge they are about 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.399
 equally oblique childhood what than 

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.469
 is distinguished by the fact that allowed 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.119
 maybe a little bit better armor is this 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.289
 looking where to shoot not guys this 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.600
 it seems something was perfect 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.219
 Wrong feeling that t57 heavy 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 the balance is just out of touch with everything 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.439
 we just have such a tank and we have it 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.450
 let's get the balance 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.909
 there is a car like that about French 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.590
 branches is completely unimportant but my Masha 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.810
 maemo maybe the developers will come to their senses and 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.969
 do something closer to the general test 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.709
 the next nerve that will be yours too 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.319
 blow up perdaki and you just fly away on 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.700
 orbit it is of course m18 hellcat here 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.299
 just a huge number of different 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.679
 changes 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.229
 cannon scatter from running gear 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.279
 increased 60 percent scatter guns from 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.439
 turning the chassis 

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:56.439
 also 60 percent passable 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.450
 Chassis reduced to us by 9 14 9 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.909
 percent there the spread of guns is too strong 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.880
 increased 50 percent overall nerve 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.679
 just huge i dont judge how 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.530
 This tanchik will be played on a common test 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.270
 in general what was the main problem of the hulk 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.950
 it is firstly it is fast secondly it 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.540
 imperceptible and the third is good 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.640
 cannon yes although it came down to principle 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.320
 there may well be long enough but 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.240
 anyway the breaking through was at the level and beyond 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.040
 account of course this tanchik bend 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.930
 make him be 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.610
 interesting and that he did not resemble his 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.260
 fellow with la guerra he is now 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.969
 called m36 jackson 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.469
 It was necessary to leave Kolkata speed but 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.790
 at the same time nerfit and accuracy but 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:33.129
 developers while they are not easy 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.049
 Hulk took this precision they him another 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.879
 and ponerfili patency in my opinion 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.349
 pick and accuracy and speed it 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.209
 all the same, the search was necessary 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.189
 Nerfit one thing is not worth taking 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.859
 speed because we are already slow 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.260
 m36 jackson there is a fig us another 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.540
 same take away accuracy there ponerfit 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.189
 and reloading in general something its 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.900
 take away but leave it quick to 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.299
 could move around again 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.310
 same two different tank here guys 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.889
 there is such a situation that with hevikom 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.720
 and amx 50b just a tank that's like that 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.370
 feeling something just randomly and 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.200
 all the treats that developers do not at all 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.450
 look at other kids don't look what 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.879
 similar tanks are there and it is very 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.439
 strange it leads to questions well and 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.540
 this dear viewers is all a nerve 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.819
 which will be in patch 093 maybe already 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.370
 closer to the exit of the common test of this 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.230
 updates we still learn something but 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.180
 so the guys at the end don't cry too much 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.950
 and did not fight hysterically and for your nerf 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.169
 favorite tank I'll throw in a little bit 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.690
 developer responses are enough 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.120
 positive developer he led Anton 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.489
 punk the other day was on wargaming f m on 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.530
 some kind of radio and reported the following 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.150
 information kvass divided into two tanks 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.459
 while in the plans that both tanks 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.590
 the player will have the details 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.150
 later there is a card selection function 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.949
 only on certain prize accounts 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.900
 maybe in the future it will be possible to disable 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:48.849
 sometimes not favorite cards but completely and not 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.769
 disconnect will not be reduced 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.409
 just a chance to hit these cards 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.760
 fv 4202 when transferring it to the straight eighth 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.979
 level is planned to give a gift 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.180
 pumping it up to its players as it was 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.760
 sometime with t-34 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.409
 fanfare guys what about what am I telling you at all 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.229
 spoke a few days ago your video 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.909
 history of freebie here of tanks it came true 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.739
 and did not say that there will be some 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.479
 condition well here we are anton punks pebbles 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.310
 that the weak will not have and just you 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:14.590
 will give the ball a premium tank of the eighth level 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.720
 and let him be some kind there I don't know not 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.609
 weaker or weaker than the other eight 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.650
 bata but it will be a ball prem tank 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.720
 just here in your hands so guys 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.449
 download office 202 faster 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.370
 pump as soon as possible and will 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.099
 you straight but when so well I suspect 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.900
 or in the fall or the end of the year so 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.050
 guys for what jow told you 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.270
 correct info 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.349
 these like under this video card stalingrad 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.300
 which by the way guys I recently 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:41.389
 showed judging by the reports 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.430
 Anton Pankov will be in patch 094 on 093 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.720
 and do not have time to finish the changed 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.449
 robin which by the way you too 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.550
 showed will be more 093 will pull 93 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:53.300
 there will also be three new top lt 8 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.069
 the level of the ussr and germany new japanese 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.580
 this year definitely will not say Anton 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:57.229
 punks 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.690
 but this year will be the second branch 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.430
 uh british firefly im on this guys 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.220
 I have all this all the interesting information 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.259
 today a little nerf a little 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.449
 ups and some interesting and very 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.430
 positive developer responses and led 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.409
 subscribe to my channel and click like 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.719
 and of course see you tomorrow in the new 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.719
 interesting video all thank you all bye
