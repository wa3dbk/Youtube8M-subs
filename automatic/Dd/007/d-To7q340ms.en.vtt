00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hey guys how are you kie 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.310
 gaming here and welcome to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.319
 my next tutorial 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.300
 Today I want you active 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.429
 bring closer and explain goalkeeping 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.710
 It is a very important aspect of one 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.570
 successful fifa game but before we 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.369
 I refer to the others 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.570
 basic fifa tutorials i 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.490
 already done 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.170
 you can find them in the playlist if you like 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.330
 Now on the screen clicks or the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.550
 link in the video description follows so 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.500
 I think everybody knows that you are yours 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.689
 Goalkeeper with passports by foot and head 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.309
 that can integrate into the game 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.050
 sometimes better than one 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.149
 risky cross pass in the defense 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.590
 Of course that's important too 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.660
 something he kept in mind 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.579
 but there should be more 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.520
 He needs the triangle button 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.649
 the ps3 and on the xbox it's the y 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.160
 Taste when you play and this button 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.899
 hold 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.489
 Get your tip out of the gate 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.800
 that works only if the opponent the ball 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.660
 Logically, as long as you have the taste 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.940
 Holds he moves directly into the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.920
 Direction of the ball you let go 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.670
 He turns back and you can do that very well 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.070
 exploit 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.960
 look here my opponent runs up 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.240
 my gate to he is as good as through 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.770
 But I'll get the goalkeeper out and that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.869
 apparently irritates him as you can see 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.090
 but instead of getting him out 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.950
 I let go of the button and he leaves 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.869
 back there but my opponent but 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.820
 apparently so confused had become 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.710
 already decided to lupfer and before 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.070
 the balkan finally caught easily 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.229
 become 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.310
 That's a great technique I only 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.799
 can recommend 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.630
 Let's continue with another example here 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.290
 Do you see how I constantly go uphill? 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.840
 with tie 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.670
 by getting the goalkeeper out it is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.740
 basic requirement that you pass 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.640
 anticipate then you can with the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.619
 correct timing 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.640
 just before the pass is played 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.650
 Get the goalkeeper out 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.229
 The goalkeeper then runs off in the ball and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.700
 If necessary , shoot him away like that 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.680
 prevents her annoying torre de 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.810
 steep passes as soon as you have a feeling 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.680
 It's easy to do that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.990
 and effective 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.490
 also the rauszuete at the beginning rausholen 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.470
 the gatekeeper urges him to fail 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.240
 as you have seen and all of you 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.840
 Aspects could possibly still be a goal 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.969
 prevent 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.040
 if everything seems already lost and 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.719
 here is my last tip for you though 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.549
 your opponent from the side on your gate 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.770
 and not really one 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.450
 in the middle he has 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.350
 with great probability itself 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.970
 shoot 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.040
 in such situations had and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.840
 Goalkeeper to get something out of the angle 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.310
 to shrink for the protect and so on 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.820
 which also increases the likelihood 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.200
 that your goalkeeper keeps the ball so people 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.590
 that 's it from me again 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.540
 page 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.520
 of course you have to first feel for it 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.370
 develop but as soon as this mastered 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.510
 improved your game considerably 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.220
 try to get the goalkeeper out a bit 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.900
 to pick up and move back around 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.610
 to force the opponent to make mistakes and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.140
 use the active mourning game around 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.790
 to prevent steep passes 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.500
 do not forget the other basic ones 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.210
 to watch fifa tutorials and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.490
 Leave a like that would make me very happy 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.900
 happy if you want more subscribed 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.700
 me and see you next time 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.420
 It makes a lot of fun with the goalkeeper 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.420
 wiz
