00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.000

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.849
 talk a lot this show 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.400
 wonderful slava's snowshow my part of 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.969
 your cast is here with me or not 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.969
 cold colucci I said it well it looks very good 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:25.410
 worked we are latinos all latinos 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.099
 but then we 're not solved by ourselves 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.009
 sorry not only nothing was saying 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.600
 colucci how are you welcome I'm very 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.190
 well thank you very much I feel very 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.720
 welcome to every time here in mexico 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.510
 I always heard about slava's snowshow 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.300
 there are key accounts you do not know how 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.920
 telling of a sunset with words is a 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.850
 very particular show is very 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.040
 difficult as so many people already 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.680
 have you seen here in Mexico and it's always the 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.810
 that is new new one thing 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.210
 new is a classic is a classic here 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.150
 In Mexico there are not many countries in the 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.460
 world we went on tour as in more than 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.920
 45 countries around the world but there 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.020
 some countries like Russia the middle 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.690
 that this state is not only like a 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.940
 classic is a very particular show 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.670
 where the visual effect is very strong 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.940
 as the image will look but there are many 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.130
 ridiculous moments and get to what 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.800
 attribute that just with mexico 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.450
 have connected so deeply good 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.689
 a lot of things I think you know 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.000
 I was talking with a friend and I told him 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.360
 that maybe the Russians and the Mexicans 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.119
 they are and they have many things like they are 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.340
 emotional very emotional people nothing more the 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.210
 difference that the Russians stay all 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.500
 the emotions inside and the Mexicans the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.920
 exprimera to the outside to the minor 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.030
 provocation and then and then another 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.670
 thing 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.500
 of this are laughs then I was going to 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.960
 put intense the Russians and the Mexicans 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.149
 and I was thinking about pure horrible thing 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:07.090
 but both because of the contradictions of 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.670
 life to love for the elements 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.940
 extremes of life is confusing 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.549
 the bad thing I'm talking about, look at me 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.140
 that we carry on the clear TV always if 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:23.079
 this was making my hair stand on end 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.500
 literal but it seems very slow and 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.209
 so better tell me tell me you loved me 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.890
 ask anything still well they are not going to 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.959
 make my hair stand on end 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.560
 wonderful these slava's characters 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.810
 Snowshow in Mexico 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.810
 good tin and paint too 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.510
 has your makeup new version here 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.360
 tell me one thing is a show for 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.910
 all ages of course yes yes yes 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.250
 a show like for example in the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.810
 2000 2008 that we will make the award of the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.459
 auditorium moon as a show 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.640
 family means it's a show 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.489
 power for the whole family and then it is 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.810
 a show to enjoy level 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.920
 different 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.709
 yes yes, that's how I would look great 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.299
 it fell to me like this is a show 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.250
 that you can enjoy so 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.340
 different there are moments to be users at 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.650
 melancholic moment to the moment of love 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.780
 the moment of hope is very good and 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.510
 there are incredible visual moments as is 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.870
 what we are looking like there is no 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.700
 special effects the specials of the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.560
 news belong to another channel 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.750
 that would not come to case right now it would appear 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.760
 something like plagiarism is not that the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.290
 clowns is forever very excited 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.180
 when coming on TV because it's a 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.670
 completely different universe for me 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.350
 it is inevitable that in addition all children 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.810
 and the adults before the hug 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.800
 of a character like the one who is 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.110
 embracing right now we are 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.150
 deeply moved and connected 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.180
 with the best of our from our 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.060
 history and our childhoods 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.280
 It is a show that is very good for 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.780
 all to return to what we say 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.580
 us as dreams of our dreams 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.560
 of childhood if he says this is very 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.350
 Well, it's not a show 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.230
 exactly for toddlers because 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.990
 we use the language and the 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.240
 language of children as the way to 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.280
 communicate but it's a very spectacle 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.680
 strong for the whole family today there 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.870
 because snow snow is an element 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.180
 very important of Russian culture is a 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.800
 element that represents the change of 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.840
 perspective because when it falls on the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.450
 snow on the city everything looks 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:35.160
 different way if you're concentrated what 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:37.470
 I tell you if you do not realize because 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.110
 the snow when it falls on the city all 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.510
 changes and that what clowns do to 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.820
 public see mix throwing where already 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.330
