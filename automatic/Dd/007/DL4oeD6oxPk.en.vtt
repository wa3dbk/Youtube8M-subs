00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.740 
mentioned there's one here and here's
the<00:02:34.540> other<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:36.670> know<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:36.790> think<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.239> will<00:02:37.390> hear

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
the other you know I think you will hear

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.649 
the other you know I think you will hear
immediately<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.769> dramatic<00:02:39.700> difference<00:02:40.120> you're

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
immediately a dramatic difference you're

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.479 
immediately a dramatic difference you're
going<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:41.079> hear<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.680> lot<00:02:41.890> more<00:02:42.099> of<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.340> music

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
going to hear a lot more of the music

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.000 
going to hear a lot more of the music
that<00:02:42.760> was<00:02:43.060> there<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.629> you<00:02:44.500> couldn't<00:02:44.890> even

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
that was there that you couldn't even

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.800 
that was there that you couldn't even
make<00:02:45.310> out<00:02:45.519> really<00:02:45.849> on<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.090> first<00:02:46.239> generation

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
make out really on the first generation

00:02:46.810 --> 00:03:05.040 
make out really on the first generation
Fire

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.960 

okay<00:03:06.050> so<00:03:06.110> I<00:03:06.290> think<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.920> difference<00:03:07.580> is<00:03:07.700> pretty

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
okay so I think the difference is pretty

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.510 
okay so I think the difference is pretty
dramatic<00:03:08.230> now<00:03:09.230> once<00:03:09.500> again<00:03:09.650> if<00:03:10.069> you<00:03:10.340> are<00:03:10.370> in

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
dramatic now once again if you are in

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.550 
dramatic now once again if you are in
the<00:03:10.610> habit<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:11.120> using<00:03:11.209> headphones<00:03:12.080> with<00:03:12.380> your

the habit of using headphones with your

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
Kindle Fire then maybe this isn't such

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.590
