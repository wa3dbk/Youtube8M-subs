 the crashes from behind are from the 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.669
 most common accidents caused by

 lack of driver attention 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.170
 the mobile system there are explores 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.240
 continuously in front of your vehicle and 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.119
 detects all types of vehicles in 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.279
 your road including motorcycles the 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.390
 system calculates the relative speed and 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.390
 in critical situations 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.110
 emits visual and audible alerts 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.350
 an imminent collision with the vehicle 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.350
 from ahead 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.280
 the system can give in the alarm of 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.920
 up to 27 seconds before impact 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.460
 both when driving in the city and in 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.460

 mobileye of origin and today safety 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.310
 and keep a following distance 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.950
 prudent between your vehicle and that of 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.870
 forward is essential if the vehicle of 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.940
 forward suddenly stops a 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.380
 safe distance allows you to stop at 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.380
 time and avoid a collision 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.810
 the mobile system there monitors the 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.030
 distance between your vehicle and that of 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.570
 forward at all times and in any 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.220
 climatic condition the mobile system there 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.350
 provides an indication in real time 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.290
 precise of the distance in question from 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.750
 second when the relative distance 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.130
 stop being safe alert of it 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.409
 by a visual and auditory signal 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.939
 the system can be calibrated to emit 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.590
 alerts to different margins of 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.450
 distance to satisfy your

 approximate are a dangerous experience 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.880
 and it bothers the mobile system life helps it 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.670
 to use long lights so 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.440
 effective and prevents you from dazzling others 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.630
 system detects the vehicles that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.900
 the unintentional exit of the lane is 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.000
 the main cause of serious accidents 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.160
 a collision with dire consequences 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.160
 it can happen in a fraction of a second 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.930
 the mobile system there can detect 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.980
 road markings and identify them when their 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.650
 vehicle gets out of the lane 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.480
 the ai mobile system recognizes when the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.489
 vehicle starts to deviate from its 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.980
 lane is without using a turn signal 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.440
 and it emits a visual and aural signal 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.090
 immediate that urges the driver to 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.090

 and pedestrians and cyclists are the most 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:06.769
 vulnerable in streets and roads and is 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.280

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.280
 detect 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.350
 the mobile system identifies pedestrians and 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.000
 cyclists during daylight hours and 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.270
 can determine if there is danger of 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.270
 collision 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.069
 in the case of a possible collision the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.260
 system issues an alert that gives you up 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.440
 2 seconds to brake and avoid a

 speed limit detection that what 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.990
 keep abreast of the various

 speed limits while driving 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.060
 the system identifies limit signals 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.920
 of speed along the way and 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.930
 issues an alert whenever the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.930
