difficult you know to transition from

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.459 
difficult you know to transition from
just<00:00:36.570> what<00:00:36.690> you're<00:00:36.809> normally<00:00:36.960> doing<00:00:37.290> with

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
just what you're normally doing with

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.770 
just what you're normally doing with
barbells<00:00:37.980> or<00:00:38.340> dumbbells<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.690> do

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
barbells or dumbbells and you can do

barbells or dumbbells and you can do
some<00:00:39.989> stuff<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> cables<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:40.920> it's

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
some stuff with the cables but it's

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.560 
some stuff with the cables but it's
important<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> understand<00:00:41.820> exactly<00:00:41.969> what

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
important to understand exactly what

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.420 
important to understand exactly what
types<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.960> movements<00:00:43.410> target<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.040> emphasize

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
types of movements target and emphasize

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.520 
types of movements target and emphasize
different<00:00:44.789> parts<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> biceps<00:00:45.780> muscle

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
different parts in the biceps muscle

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.560 
different parts in the biceps muscle
because<00:00:46.770> remember<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.550> biceps<00:00:48.000> muscle<00:00:48.420> has

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
because remember the biceps muscle has

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.529 
because remember the biceps muscle has
two<00:00:49.170> head<00:00:49.410> has<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> long<00:00:50.129> head<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.059> short<00:00:51.329> cut

two head has a long head in a short cut

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.020 
two head has a long head in a short cut
I<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> lot<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> individuals<00:00:53.129> who<00:00:53.190> execute<00:00:53.879> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
I see a lot of individuals who execute a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.049 
I see a lot of individuals who execute a
high<00:00:54.539> cable<00:00:54.989> curl<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.070> sometimes<00:00:56.730> they<00:00:56.879> have

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
high cable curl and sometimes they have

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.130 
high cable curl and sometimes they have
both<00:00:57.270> handles<00:00:57.660> I'm<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.960> going<00:00:58.109> to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
both handles I'm just going to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.410 
both handles I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.039> single<00:00:59.370> arm<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.789> where

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
demonstrate with a single arm here where

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.760 
demonstrate with a single arm here where
they're<00:01:00.570> coming<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.020> they're<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.379> curling

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
they're coming and they're just curling

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.939 
they're coming and they're just curling
up<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.820> they're<00:01:02.969> doing<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.480> curl<00:01:04.110> much<00:01:04.710> like

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
up and they're doing a curl much like

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.399 
up and they're doing a curl much like
this<00:01:05.159> okay<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.540> important<00:01:06.930> understand<00:01:07.320> that

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
this okay it's important understand that

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.080 
this okay it's important understand that
when<00:01:07.530> you're<00:01:07.619> doing<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.100> movement<00:01:08.670> because

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
when you're doing that movement because

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.390 
when you're doing that movement because
the<00:01:09.390> placement<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> humerus<00:01:10.710> again

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the placement of the humerus again

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.120 
the placement of the humerus again
because<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> bicep<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.960> its<00:01:13.200> origin<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
because the bicep of its origin it

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.429 
because the bicep of its origin it
originates<00:01:14.640> across<00:01:15.330> from<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> humerus<00:01:16.259> on

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
originates across from the humerus on

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.899 
originates across from the humerus on
the<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> scapula<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:17.729> or<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the back of the scapula here or the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.429 
the back of the scapula here or the
front<00:01:18.090> part<00:01:18.299> schedule<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> classes<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
front part schedule the classes the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.760 
front part schedule the classes the
humerus<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.880> go<00:01:21.299> ahead<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.689> AV<00:01:22.500> doctor

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
humerus as you go ahead and AV doctor

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.620 
humerus as you go ahead and AV doctor
actually<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:23.640> arm<00:01:23.820> away<00:01:24.240> from<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
actually have your arm away from the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.690 
actually have your arm away from the
center<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.990> your<00:01:25.170> body<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.220> does<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
center of your body what that does it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.609 
center of your body what that does it
puts<00:01:26.820> more<00:01:27.060> emphasis<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.930> shorter<00:01:28.320> head

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
puts more emphasis on the shorter head

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.319 
puts more emphasis on the shorter head
of<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.340> biceps<00:01:29.729> muscle<00:01:29.790> which<00:01:30.210> is

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
of the biceps muscle which is

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.929 
of the biceps muscle which is
responsible<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:31.020> girth<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.920> width<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.820> in

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
responsible for girth and width so in

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.609 
responsible for girth and width so in
this<00:01:33.030> particular<00:01:33.180> movement<00:01:33.780> because<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
this particular movement because the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.340 
this particular movement because the
humerus<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.610> away<00:01:36.360> from<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.689> body<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.020> like

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
humerus is away from the body just like

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.130 
humerus is away from the body just like
if<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.100> wide<00:01:38.549> grip<00:01:38.939> biceps<00:01:39.869> curl

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
if you have a a wide grip biceps curl

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.499 
if you have a a wide grip biceps curl
the<00:01:40.619> further<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.189> your<00:01:41.310> hands<00:01:41.670> are<00:01:41.820> hard<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the further that your hands are hard and

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.289 
the further that your hands are hard and
the<00:01:42.930> more<00:01:43.140> outward<00:01:43.950> movement<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.090> your

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the more outward movement of that your

the more outward movement of that your
arm<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.689> displaced<00:01:46.079> from<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.799> centerline<00:01:47.070> in

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
arm is displaced from the centerline in

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100 
arm is displaced from the centerline in
your<00:01:47.340> body<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:48.090> puts<00:01:48.299> more<00:01:48.479> load<00:01:48.689> an<00:01:48.810> emphasis

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
your body it puts more load an emphasis

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.620 
your body it puts more load an emphasis
on<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.340> shorter<00:01:50.759> head<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> case<00:01:51.600> of

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
on to the shorter head so in the case of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.530 
on to the shorter head so in the case of
a<00:01:51.960> high<00:01:52.259> biceps<00:01:52.860> curl<00:01:53.119> where<00:01:54.119> your<00:01:54.270> face

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
a high biceps curl where your face

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.690 
a high biceps curl where your face
forward<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.290> arm<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.649> extended<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:56.250> away

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
forward and the arm is extended out away

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.120 
forward and the arm is extended out away
from<00:01:56.729> your<00:01:57.000> body<00:01:57.060> as<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.960> curl<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.439> here<00:01:58.799> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
from your body as you curl in here it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.010 
from your body as you curl in here it
puts<00:01:59.340> more<00:01:59.520> emphasis<00:01:59.700> on<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.450> inner<00:02:00.659> head

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
puts more emphasis on that inner head

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.440 
puts more emphasis on that inner head
okay<00:02:01.770> now<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:02.969> with<00:02:03.180> free

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
okay now you can do this with free

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.120 
okay now you can do this with free
weight<00:02:03.659> which<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.439> slow<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.920> controlled

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
weight which is slow and controlled

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.039 
weight which is slow and controlled
which<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.820> good<00:02:06.060> because<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:07.020> have

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
which is good because you have

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.660 
which is good because you have
resistance<00:02:07.560> extending<00:02:08.069> all<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.280> way<00:02:08.489> through

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
resistance extending all the way through

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.139 
resistance extending all the way through
the<00:02:08.759> entire<00:02:09.060> range<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.390> motion<00:02:09.450> now<00:02:09.780> what<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
the entire range of motion now what I

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.179 
the entire range of motion now what I
like<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.390> do<00:02:10.539> is<00:02:11.140> if<00:02:11.319> you<00:02:11.409> don't<00:02:11.620> have<00:02:11.799> a<00:02:11.829> set<00:02:12.099> of

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:12.189 
like to do is if you don't have a set of

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.759 
like to do is if you don't have a set of
these<00:02:12.280> bands<00:02:12.610> guys<00:02:12.909> get<00:02:13.599> them<00:02:13.750> alright<00:02:14.049> most

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
these bands guys get them alright most

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.500 
these bands guys get them alright most
of<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:14.980> stuff<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.430> actually<00:02:15.790> have<00:02:16.239> on<00:02:16.420> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
of the stuff that I actually have on the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.149 
of the stuff that I actually have on the
workouts<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:16.930> your<00:02:16.959> website<00:02:17.379> utilizes<00:02:18.040> the

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
workouts on your website utilizes the

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.130 
workouts on your website utilizes the
bands<00:02:18.400> plus<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.390> just<00:02:19.420> can't<00:02:19.810> get<00:02:19.930> away<00:02:20.019> from

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
bands plus you just can't get away from

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.110 
bands plus you just can't get away from
the<00:02:20.379> fact<00:02:20.590> science<00:02:21.099> proves<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.549> these<00:02:21.790> things

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
the fact science proves it these things

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.780 
the fact science proves it these things
will<00:02:22.569> help<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.500> natura<00:02:23.920> are<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.069> lot<00:02:24.250> better<00:02:24.489> in

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
will help the natura are a lot better in

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.550 
will help the natura are a lot better in
most<00:02:24.970> cases<00:02:25.269> when<00:02:25.870> they're<00:02:25.989> combined<00:02:26.349> with

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
most cases when they're combined with

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.949 
most cases when they're combined with
freeways<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.700> in<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:27.909> in<00:02:28.269> this<00:02:28.480> particular

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
freeways but in this in this particular

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.630 
freeways but in this in this particular
movement<00:02:29.200> what<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.560> like<00:02:29.769> doing<00:02:30.069> is<00:02:30.159> because

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
movement what I like doing is because

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.759 
movement what I like doing is because
the<00:02:31.480> tension<00:02:31.989> of<00:02:32.109> the<00:02:32.200> band<00:02:32.439> becomes

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
the tension of the band becomes

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.589 
the tension of the band becomes
progressively<00:02:33.040> heavier<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.090> further<00:02:34.329> that<00:02:34.569> I

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
progressively heavier the further that I

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.050 
progressively heavier the further that I
stretch<00:02:34.989> in<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:35.980> movement<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.519> can<00:02:36.819> play

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
stretch in the movement I can play

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.759 
stretch in the movement I can play
around<00:02:37.209> with<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.720> weight<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.170> by<00:02:38.290> shifting

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
around with the weight just by shifting

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.160 
around with the weight just by shifting
my<00:02:38.829> body<00:02:39.159> back<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.640> forth<00:02:39.939> and<00:02:40.510> as<00:02:40.659> I<00:02:40.840> curl

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
my body back and forth and as I curl

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.710 
my body back and forth and as I curl
here<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:42.310> stronger<00:02:42.670> more<00:02:43.030> emphasized<00:02:43.540> that

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
here the stronger more emphasized that

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.899 
here the stronger more emphasized that
my<00:02:43.900> bicep<00:02:44.409> becomes<00:02:44.859> because<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:45.549> range<00:02:45.790> of

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
my bicep becomes because this range of

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.129 
my bicep becomes because this range of
motion<00:02:46.239> is<00:02:46.359> decreasing

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
motion is decreasing

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.710 
motion is decreasing
remember<00:02:47.859> the<00:02:47.980> biceps<00:02:48.430> muscle<00:02:48.519> is<00:02:49.209> primarily

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
remember the biceps muscle is primarily

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.410 
remember the biceps muscle is primarily
activated<00:02:50.440> at<00:02:50.799> a<00:02:50.859> 45<00:02:51.400> degree<00:02:51.549> angle<00:02:51.760> from<00:02:52.090> here

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
activated at a 45 degree angle from here

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.580 
activated at a 45 degree angle from here
to<00:02:52.569> here<00:02:52.870> okay

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
to here okay

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.289 
to here okay
when<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.040> arm<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.310> extended<00:02:54.579> all<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.030> way<00:02:55.180> out

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
when the arm is extended all the way out

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.780 
when the arm is extended all the way out
you<00:02:56.170> emphasize<00:02:56.560> more<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.920> brachialis<00:02:57.310> in<00:02:57.730> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
you emphasize more the brachialis in the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.280 
you emphasize more the brachialis in the
brachioradialis<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:58.900> movement<00:02:59.109> but

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
brachioradialis in this movement but

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.559 
brachioradialis in this movement but
because<00:02:59.680> the<00:03:00.489> weight<00:03:00.879> is<00:03:01.060> actually<00:03:01.239> getting

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
because the weight is actually getting

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.119 
because the weight is actually getting
heavier<00:03:01.870> where<00:03:02.049> my<00:03:02.170> bicep<00:03:02.650> becomes<00:03:02.950> more

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
heavier where my bicep becomes more

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.860 
heavier where my bicep becomes more
activated<00:03:03.639> where<00:03:04.000> i'm<00:03:04.090> stronger<00:03:04.659> in<00:03:04.750> that

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
activated where i'm stronger in that

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.720 
activated where i'm stronger in that
range<00:03:05.079> of<00:03:05.170> motion<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:06.040> weight<00:03:06.250> ratio<00:03:06.700> is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
range of motion the weight ratio is

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.640 
range of motion the weight ratio is
getting<00:03:07.150> heavier<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.900> second<00:03:08.290> reason<00:03:08.409> why<00:03:08.560> I

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
getting heavier the second reason why I

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.500 
getting heavier the second reason why I
like<00:03:08.829> using<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.220> bands<00:03:09.549> is<00:03:09.700> because<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.299> can

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
like using the bands is because you can

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.080 
like using the bands is because you can
get<00:03:10.689> a<00:03:10.810> fast<00:03:11.470> or<00:03:11.859> explosive<00:03:12.639> type<00:03:12.819> of<00:03:13.000> a

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
get a fast or explosive type of a

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.240 
get a fast or explosive type of a
movement<00:03:13.299> out<00:03:13.569> of<00:03:13.659> this<00:03:13.900> one<00:03:14.199> single<00:03:15.010> joint

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
movement out of this one single joint

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.939 
movement out of this one single joint
exercise<00:03:15.699> and<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.629> can<00:03:16.810> execute<00:03:17.109> it<00:03:17.410> at<00:03:17.500> a

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
exercise and you can execute it at a

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.670 
exercise and you can execute it at a
faster<00:03:18.459> more<00:03:18.819> rapid<00:03:19.269> pace<00:03:19.449> and<00:03:19.780> by<00:03:20.260> executing

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
faster more rapid pace and by executing
