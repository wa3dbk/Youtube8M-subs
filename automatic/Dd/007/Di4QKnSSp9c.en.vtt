itself I actually found myself thinking

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.570 
itself I actually found myself thinking
about<00:03:01.130> it

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
about it

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.150 
about it
the<00:03:01.970> idea<00:03:02.330> is<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.720> box<00:03:02.900> is<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.440> powerful

the idea is that the box is so powerful

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.650 
the idea is that the box is so powerful
that<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.580> can<00:03:04.610> give<00:03:04.820> any<00:03:05.000> child<00:03:05.300> what<00:03:05.540> they

that it can give any child what they

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.680 
that it can give any child what they
desire<00:03:06.040> however<00:03:07.040> because<00:03:07.460> there's<00:03:07.640> only<00:03:07.760> one

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.090 

everybody<00:03:11.690> becomes<00:03:12.110> jealous<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.680> aggressive

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
everybody becomes jealous and aggressive

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.010 
everybody becomes jealous and aggressive
though<00:03:13.430> rather<00:03:13.670> than<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.240> destroying<00:03:14.690> one

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
though rather than just destroying one

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.930 
though rather than just destroying one
letting<00:03:15.410> people<00:03:15.620> have<00:03:15.890> more<00:03:16.190> boxes<00:03:16.760> would

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
letting people have more boxes would

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.000 
letting people have more boxes would
give<00:03:17.090> everybody<00:03:17.450> what<00:03:17.780> they<00:03:17.810> desire<00:03:18.320> without

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010

give everybody what they desire without
fighting<00:03:19.340> over<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:19.880> that<00:03:20.239> defeats<00:03:20.690> the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
fighting over it that defeats the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.290 
fighting over it that defeats the
purpose<00:03:21.020> of<00:03:21.350> Christmas<00:03:21.770> in<00:03:21.980> some<00:03:22.790> ways<00:03:23.000> it's

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
purpose of Christmas in some ways it's

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.910 
purpose of Christmas in some ways it's
not<00:03:23.450> such<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.690> bad<00:03:23.900> idea<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.470> I<00:03:24.560> found<00:03:24.770> myself

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
not such a bad idea and I found myself

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.590 
not such a bad idea and I found myself
somewhat<00:03:25.459> sympathizing<00:03:26.090> for<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.300> villain

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
somewhat sympathizing for the villain

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.360 
somewhat sympathizing for the villain
though<00:03:27.320> it<00:03:27.440> was<00:03:27.560> brief<00:03:27.770> and<00:03:27.920> he<00:03:28.040> turns<00:03:28.220> out

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
though it was brief and he turns out

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.640 
though it was brief and he turns out
being<00:03:28.610> completely<00:03:28.940> bad<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:29.540> there's<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.230> so

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
being completely bad so there's that so
