[Applause]

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:57.150 

like<00:01:43.680> strike

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.520 

all<00:01:58.160> right<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:58.580> just<00:01:58.820> cleared<00:01:59.330> out<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.750> bullet

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
all right so just cleared out the bullet

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.800 
all right so just cleared out the bullet
trap<00:02:00.800> and<00:02:01.070> here's<00:02:02.030> all<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.270> stuff<00:02:02.300> that<00:02:02.690> came

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
trap and here's all the stuff that came

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.430 
trap and here's all the stuff that came
out<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.050> it

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
out of it

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.490 
out of it
oh<00:02:03.470> we<00:02:04.040> fired<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.330> so<00:02:05.870> you<00:02:05.960> can<00:02:06.080> see<00:02:06.229> some<00:02:06.470> of

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
oh we fired and so you can see some of

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.150 
oh we fired and so you can see some of
the<00:02:06.680> paper<00:02:07.420> wrappings<00:02:08.890> from<00:02:09.890> these<00:02:10.130> uh

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
the paper wrappings from these uh

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.750 
the paper wrappings from these uh
bullets<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:11.710> not<00:02:12.710> all<00:02:12.890> these<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.100> residue<00:02:13.610> by

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
bullets and not all these a residue by

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.930 
bullets and not all these a residue by
some<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.090> its<00:02:14.350> rust<00:02:15.350> from<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:16.070> shell<00:02:16.280> inside

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
some of its rust from the shell inside

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.100 
some of its rust from the shell inside
of<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.060> shoulder<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:17.300> got<00:02:17.450> knocked<00:02:17.600> off<00:02:17.810> with<00:02:17.990> a

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
of the shoulder I got knocked off with a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.980 
of the shoulder I got knocked off with a
round<00:02:18.500> hit<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.760> first<00:02:20.030> three<00:02:20.300> were<00:02:20.570> just

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
round hit so first three were just

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.370 
round hit so first three were just
playing<00:02:21.650> wooden<00:02:22.550> bullets<00:02:23.000> but<00:02:23.240> paper<00:02:24.020> wrapped

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
playing wooden bullets but paper wrapped

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.590 
playing wooden bullets but paper wrapped
around<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.890> make<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.340> right<00:02:25.910> diameter

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
around it to make it to right diameter

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.530 
around it to make it to right diameter
so<00:02:27.380> these<00:02:27.500> have<00:02:28.070> almost<00:02:28.459> no<00:02:28.700> weight<00:02:28.910> behind<00:02:29.270> it

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
so these have almost no weight behind it

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.740 
so these have almost no weight behind it
so<00:02:29.720> as<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.739> saw<00:02:31.310> had<00:02:32.180> no<00:02:32.650> bang<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.220> as<00:02:34.750> you

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
so as you saw had no bang to it as you

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.729 
so as you saw had no bang to it as you
know<00:02:35.840> he<00:02:35.930> didn't<00:02:36.080> have<00:02:36.170> enough<00:02:36.350> compression

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
know he didn't have enough compression

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.100 
know he didn't have enough compression
and<00:02:37.370> he's<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:39.280> second<00:02:40.280> three<00:02:40.520> group<00:02:41.000> these<00:02:41.870> were

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
and he's a second three group these were

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.410 
and he's a second three group these were
similar<00:02:42.590> wooden<00:02:43.370> bullets<00:02:43.670> with<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.880> couple<00:02:44.330> of

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
similar wooden bullets with a couple of

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.770 
similar wooden bullets with a couple of
these<00:02:44.620> copper<00:02:45.620> bb's<00:02:46.390> inserted<00:02:47.390> into<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.660> to

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
these copper bb's inserted into it to

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.240 
these copper bb's inserted into it to
give<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.080> little<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.770> little<00:02:48.920> bit<00:02:49.100> more

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
give it a little a little bit more

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.910 
give it a little a little bit more
weight<00:02:49.400> as<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.780> saw<00:02:50.930> Samba<00:02:51.230> at<00:02:51.380> work<00:02:51.560> some<00:02:51.890> of

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
weight as you saw Samba at work some of

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.870 
weight as you saw Samba at work some of
them<00:02:52.300> not<00:02:53.300> so<00:02:53.360> much<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.230> still<00:02:54.980> need<00:02:55.130> think

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
them not so much so still need think

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.560 
them not so much so still need think
these<00:02:56.000> would<00:02:56.120> be<00:02:56.270> pretty<00:02:56.690> good<00:02:56.870> for<00:02:57.080> just

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
these would be pretty good for just

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.460 
these would be pretty good for just
blinking<00:02:59.570> it<00:02:59.660> around<00:02:59.810> I<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.140> got<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.380> get

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
blinking it around I just got to get

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.910 
blinking it around I just got to get
tuned<00:03:00.860> in<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.250> powder<00:03:01.760> load<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:03.170> guess<00:03:03.320> the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
tuned in the powder load and I guess the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.850 
tuned in the powder load and I guess the
weight<00:03:04.720> issued<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.230> third<00:03:06.530> last<00:03:07.100> or<00:03:07.340> last<00:03:08.090> for

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
weight issued the third last or last for

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.610 
weight issued the third last or last for
one<00:03:09.860> of<00:03:09.950> them<00:03:10.070> being<00:03:10.220> called<00:03:10.489> off<00:03:10.640> but<00:03:11.620> these

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
one of them being called off but these

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.910 
one of them being called off but these
three<00:03:12.980> were<00:03:13.250> 45<00:03:14.180> grain<00:03:14.530> five<00:03:15.530> five<00:03:15.739> six

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
three were 45 grain five five six

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.009 
three were 45 grain five five six
bullets<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:17.000> were<00:03:17.180> inserted<00:03:17.660> into<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:20.019> paper

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
bullets that were inserted into a paper

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.680 
bullets that were inserted into a paper
casing<00:03:21.580> essentially<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:22.850> I<00:03:23.030> just<00:03:23.239> inserted

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
casing essentially so I just inserted

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.150 
casing essentially so I just inserted
backward<00:03:24.080> so<00:03:24.200> it's<00:03:24.290> like<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.410> flat<00:03:24.680> note<00:03:24.890> soft

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
backward so it's like a flat note soft

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.750 
backward so it's like a flat note soft
point<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.870> these<00:03:26.870> worked<00:03:27.170> great<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:28.160> as<00:03:28.610> you

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
point and these worked great and as you

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.780 
point and these worked great and as you
can<00:03:28.880> see<00:03:29.150> from<00:03:29.390> these<00:03:29.600> bullets<00:03:30.320> they're<00:03:31.250> semi

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
can see from these bullets they're semi

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.380 
can see from these bullets they're semi
deform<00:03:32.390> so<00:03:32.720> they're<00:03:32.989> hit<00:03:33.140> with<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:34.390> decent

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
deform so they're hit with a decent

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.390 
deform so they're hit with a decent
amount<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.690> force<00:03:35.870> behind<00:03:36.079> it<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.970> these<00:03:38.209> I<00:03:39.400> was

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
amount of force behind it so these I was

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.830 
amount of force behind it so these I was
worried<00:03:40.700> about<00:03:40.820> these<00:03:41.000> since<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.690> know<00:03:41.810> I

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
worried about these since you know I

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.009 
worried about these since you know I
have<00:03:41.989> more<00:03:42.110> force<00:03:42.350> but<00:03:43.420> none<00:03:44.420> of<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.600> casings

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
have more force but none of the casings

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.160 
have more force but none of the casings
had<00:03:45.799> primer<00:03:48.280> blowouts<00:03:49.660> so<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.690> mean<00:03:51.019> they

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
had primer blowouts so I mean they

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.890 
had primer blowouts so I mean they
worked<00:03:51.380> great<00:03:51.620> but<00:03:52.549> like<00:03:53.299> I<00:03:53.450> said<00:03:53.510> you<00:03:53.780> know

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
worked great but like I said you know

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.890 
worked great but like I said you know
using<00:03:54.110> match<00:03:54.380> heads<00:03:54.680> it's<00:03:54.890> it's<00:03:55.900> pretty

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
using match heads it's it's pretty

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.020 
using match heads it's it's pretty
reliable<00:03:57.260> as<00:03:57.739> far<00:03:57.950> as<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.190> ignition<00:03:58.340> goes<00:03:58.790> but

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
reliable as far as the ignition goes but

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.080 
reliable as far as the ignition goes but
you<00:03:59.150> can<00:03:59.299> tell<00:03:59.660> it's<00:04:00.320> extremely<00:04:01.070> dirty<00:04:01.280> it

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
you can tell it's extremely dirty it

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.920 
you can tell it's extremely dirty it
leaves<00:04:02.299> a<00:04:02.420> lot<00:04:02.510> of<00:04:02.570> uh<00:04:02.780> grits

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
leaves a lot of uh grits

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.119 
leaves a lot of uh grits
and<00:04:05.349> all<00:04:05.470> that<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:07.319> you<00:04:08.319> might<00:04:08.470> have<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.650> go<00:04:08.890> buy

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
and all that so you might have to go buy

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.899 
and all that so you might have to go buy
some<00:04:10.590> real<00:04:11.590> gunpowder<00:04:11.980> see<00:04:12.489> how<00:04:12.610> that

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
some real gunpowder see how that

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.069 
some real gunpowder see how that
performs<00:04:14.760> probably<00:04:15.760> it'll<00:04:16.449> still<00:04:16.660> be<00:04:16.810> dirty

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
performs probably it'll still be dirty
