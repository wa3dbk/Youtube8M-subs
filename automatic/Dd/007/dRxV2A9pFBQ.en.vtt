phantoms<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:47.220> thought<00:00:47.460> well<00:00:47.760> maybe<00:00:48.350> just<00:00:49.350> maybe

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
phantoms I thought well maybe just maybe

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.790 
phantoms I thought well maybe just maybe
a<00:00:50.450> smidget<00:00:51.450> maybe<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> smidget<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
a smidget maybe a smidget of a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.290 
a smidget maybe a smidget of a
possibility<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.970> will<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
possibility that this will be a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.840 
possibility that this will be a
different<00:00:54.750> game<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.320> maybe<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.309> added<00:00:56.700> some

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
different game or maybe they added some

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.330 
different game or maybe they added some
content<00:00:57.360> well<00:00:58.079> let's<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.770> here

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
we still have the same three classes

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.119 
we still have the same three classes
assault<00:01:02.309> support<00:01:02.850> recon<00:01:03.830> still<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:05.009> the

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
one in particular is metro and this was

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.100 
one in particular is metro and this was
my<00:01:11.190> least<00:01:11.520> favorite<00:01:12.390> map<00:01:12.570> because<00:01:12.899> it's

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
my least favorite map because it's

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.990 
my least favorite map because it's
purely<00:01:13.740> linear<00:01:15.650> you<00:01:16.650> pretty<00:01:17.520> much<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
purely linear you pretty much have the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
purely linear you pretty much have the
same<00:01:18.270> control<00:01:19.170> same<00:01:19.860> everything<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:22.130> what's

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
same control same everything so what's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.780 
same control same everything so what's
the<00:01:23.250> difference<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:24.170> there<00:01:25.170> any<00:01:25.790> any

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the difference is there any any

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.250

graphical<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.010> all<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.090> least<00:01:33.540> bit

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
graphical at all like in the least bit

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.969 
graphical at all like in the least bit
well<00:01:35.610> maybe<00:01:36.680> there<00:01:37.680> are<00:01:37.799> some<00:01:37.830> new<00:01:38.640> game<00:01:38.909> modes

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
this is technically a bad game because

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.699 
this is technically a bad game because
the<00:03:13.700> controls<00:03:14.090> are<00:03:14.390> pretty<00:03:14.420> much<00:03:15.110> on<00:03:15.319> point

anything<00:03:18.650> wrong<00:03:19.010> with<00:03:19.069> that<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.819> just<00:03:20.269> the

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
anything wrong with that it's just the
