00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 very good other people welcome to the 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.380
 channel welcome to a new video of 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.509
 ase topor knows how you are seeing let's go 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.069
 of karts and the game is not that bring to 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.290
 the karts by default but I've 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.480
 looked for a mod to upload a video 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.269
 to the channel as you are seeing then they are 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.250
 about 20 participants and is the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.350
 modality of a kart 125 centimeters 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.630
 cubic shifter 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.650
 there is a park where you can download cars 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.170
 of 50 100 125 and 125 shifter that is with 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.720
 gear lever is worth the and sister and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.669
 two circuits that he sonoma and he rang 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.000
 more grand prix let's run in l 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.230
 sonoma and you are going to see that it is very funny 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.980
 especially when you take me control of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.680
 traction so nothing 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.490
 let's start this race and see what 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.530
 is what can get out of here 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.340
 how are you saying the lines that you see 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.250
 it's because before I tried it added before 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.450
 I have tried to run and 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.450
 and of the marinera as 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.790
 no traction control returns day by day 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.330
 and above you have to change as 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.890
 you are seeing on the right side that the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.260
 doll for moving the lever 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.020
 changes it has is impressive is 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.409
 super fun but sushi or did 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.390
 that that and here tops or that is 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.310
 quite complicated to handle but if 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.600
 you have the cetto things download it because 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.060
 The truth is that it is very worthwhile 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.680
 It's quite fun as you are watching 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.479
 also in the top part it puts 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.220
 warning cpu occupy yes and 95% of this by 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.360
 what you have been reading is like a book 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.220
 that has Corsican Corsican 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.930
 it's not that it comes to me alone but that 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.450
 there are many people who appear and the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.040
 it seems like a book that tells you 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.240
 that the cpu be almost at the top of its 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.050
 capacity is not real but they do not taste good 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.050
 Well why does that come out? 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.780
 they're looking at that in versions 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.420
 later they will solve it because 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.560
 from what I've been reading it's worth like that 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.410
 what are we doing with this right now 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.750
 fuck saw how he is going to flip boy and 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.910
 it ends a bit too, they are voting 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.660
 the side gas is amazing 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.660
 download them and if you have the opportunity 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.160
 because it's very funny uncle good good 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.800
 good on the wheels but here when 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.430
 you run out of talc tires 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.620
 skid mother watch how the bus goes 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.030
 badri life to happen to you or fixed that the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.050
 environment is here a half mountains 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.580
 in the desert come where you go and is 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.790
 super handsome the kiel once you catch him the 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.090
 roll this with the steering wheel 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.180
 without taking into account that you go very fast 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.719
 you have to look to change gears 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.459
 you have that you can control the game of 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.590
 brake and accelerator so as not to trip and 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.140
 enter the curves so the best thing that 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.269
 you can in which the car comes to you to make a 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.180
 trope of truth is that it's super 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.700
 funny uncle is I think of the bots 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.600
 I've seen more fun in a game 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.900
 of racing you know that this is in 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.510
 the great tourism 5 already put caps and the 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.260
 it's true that I 'm leaving 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.019
 and the truth is that it rains and the truth is 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.720
 I wanted to see you upload a great video 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.190
 tourism 5 if you tell the truth what 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.990
 what happens that 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.420
 they had to connect the capturer of the 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.820
 Cat with wiring leading know 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.500
 that the hdmi is wearing helmets 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.970
 that are optical or that in the end 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.920
 I did not recognize the sound and it was a 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.020
 shit take it off then I went looking 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.250
 to see if I find something of the psycho thing 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.530
 that can be fun and fuck 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.070
 I found this and the truth is that I did not 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.730
 I regret not having had 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.290
 of not being able to god woman pussy of no 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.810
 have been able to play great tourism 5 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.850
 although surely if I get to put it 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.850
 of the audio and I bring you a video worth 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.360
 has the host and is also the steering wheel 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.280
 goddess is 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.160
 is the support is very good I swear 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.450
 weather 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.370
 download it because you are going to have fun 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.260
 I remember you go go kart 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.890
 a bot that you can find in race 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.890
 department 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.880
 and then the circuits are those of sonoma 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.130
 Wow 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.230
 good theirs is theirs laze laze 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.330
 to the vertex to the vertex but but as 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.110
 you see when there's wear and tear 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.840
 tire the thing gets complicated because in 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.360
 a certain time that you leave that you go 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.630
 and you are not able to control the point 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.700
 with on the balls gave the little message 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.590
 up there you can when you saw him at 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.639
 beginning time acojone said xia whores 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.430
 I do not fuck with you but no no 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.810
 it's something that apparently if someone knows 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.229
 of the topic that the comments leave 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.210
 but apparently it is something is something that 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.620
 is happening in this version of the seat 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.949
 You already know that I guess he's in 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.880
 development is not finalized with what 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:11.360
 little by little they will go 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.280
 correcting all 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.340
 all those roots that go 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.420
 appearing what good morning 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.740
 after we've put on first it's done 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.710
 a deal 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.810
 oh by the way the skill of the 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:29.320
 participants is one hundred percent 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:32.849
 do not lie 90 and 95 percent at 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.929
 95 to 95 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.929
 the slobber 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.210
 my mother, uncles 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:51.900
 is very good here is always half the 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:53.370
 water field that works all day 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.710
 good good good and above must 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.630
 be change gear or is this 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.880
 yes yes I already know in traction control is 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.170
 complicated to imagine if on top of the 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.870
 curve you have to leave carefully for 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:10.080
 do not trip and change the gear part 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.080
 you take what does not sound squeezed 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.790
 and it will be 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.330
 is another one that is in eighth position what 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.080
 you see above 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.520
 reid eighth is another another 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.340
 problem as you see here tells me that 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.650
 it is first but but from what I saw yes 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.360
 that there was also another book that also 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.220
 you mark does not mark you the real position no 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.480
 we know why but it is also a fault 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.950
 good are little things that are going to go 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.720
 solving safely and in the version 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.630
 end of the game all this will not come out 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.340
 but I already tell you I recommend this mode of 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.260
 the cetto thing because you're going to happen 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.190
 and depart I swear 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.630
 good kids, I hope you have 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.250
 liked and nothing we see in the next 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.250
 greetings see you later
