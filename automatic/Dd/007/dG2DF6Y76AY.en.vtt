00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.470
 double dragon was the first videogame 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.419
 that I played and I remember perfectly 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.400
 when my dad took me to the arcades 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.079
 in the late 80s and bought me 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.059
 lots of chips to spend on this 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.770
 game back then the chips were worth 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.640
 nothing and with little money you could play 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.710
 quite 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.559
 this egg was developed by three us 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.450
 Japan in 1987 and it would be 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.309
 an evolution of the game renegade everything 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.680
 that came out in the year 86 in which only 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.210
 I could use a double dragon player 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.579
 would become a benchmark of the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.199
 genus of inap or I live today little brother 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.239
 and what the genre beat em up 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.980
 pretend to be had of video games in 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.690
 where you are kicking and hitting medium 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.309
 world that crosses you on the way this 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.110
 gender is also known as prowler 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.790
 this genre differs from the games 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.530
 of fights like street fighter mortal 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.970
 combat among others having that in the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.800
 life you are not progressing in a way 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.700
 linearly you are taking the crest to 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.350
 half the world was very clear you clear the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.000
 original version of texts already maintains 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.070
 a story different from the one used by 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.840
 both in the international version narrates 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.619
 about the disaster a war 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.970
 nuclear 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.380
 a band theme now called black 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.210
 warrior frightens people from 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.740
 america but the brothers billy jimmy 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.330
 trained in martial arts they 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.399
 commission to put in place this band 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.170
 of crooks because of this the black 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.970
 warrior is to retaliate and capture 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.890
 to marion or marian as we are going to call her 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.630
 which is the weak bride towards the purest 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.520
 'style is tested rescuing tena 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.409
 'billie jean' and they venture to rescue 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.020
 to mariah and the best part is that 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.549
 we could play with him 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.899
 I think if we played in mode 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.039
 cooperative in the end we felt a 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.500
 battle to see who of the two 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.450
 players stayed with marian 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.860
 the story used is therefore similar 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.540
 but it does not allude to a war 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.270
 nuclear what nuclear war would be 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.220
 used in double dragon 2t revenge and good 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.930
 the intro is quite simple but in those 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.790
 years it seemed incredible to me a group of 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.440
 villains would beat a combo to the girl 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.570
 and he would throw on his shoulder what follows 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.310
 afterwards he was massacre by piece kicks 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.630
 like knees and if the opponent had 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.060
 a gun could be and the 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.680
 hit him with it is a plot 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.300
 completely without tone but that in these 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.890
 years became a double dragon in the 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.890
 greatest exponent of this genre 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.720
 Hello 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.420
 and this time 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.170
 the version for the Danish did not bring the 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.700
 cooperative mode so we could only 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.700
 play with only one character at a time 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.780
 we could go deep in this 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.000
 game since there are several versions of 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.709
 but I do not want to extend the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.840
 video as always I will focus on my 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.910
 personal experience as I already commented 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.319
 previously double-double 2nd solution to 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.720
 the original story of japan texts 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.140
 but this time they kill Mariano like that 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.569
 now the virgin brothers and a codon 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.280
 embarrassing what follows is hate kicks 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.280
 like knees and so on 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.080
 the version of nes is longer than the 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.490
 arcade version instead of four 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.680
 missions that the version has 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.680
 of recreational in the de nes we have 9 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.930
 in double dragon 3 the story changes 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.490
 drastically we entrust ourselves in a 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.110
 mission which is to find the 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.700
 three stones called rosettes that are 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.350
 scattered all over the world to 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.950
 then face an enemy that is 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.950
 find in egypt 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.360
 good 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.330
 and as always in the version of nes the 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.709
 things are something different just Mariana 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.060
 has disappeared and the witch that we 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.769
 entrusts the mission of finding 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.479
 stones in the arcade version here we 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.889
 gives clues about the whereabouts of marjah and 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.889
 also information about the stones 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.920
 I remember I had a pirate cartridge 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.900
 of creation a console that was a clone 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.150
 of the nes this cartridge said double 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.710
 dragon 4 but it was nothing more than a 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.140
 modification of target training eight 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.910
 for which was launched in 1990 by 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.910
 touch and his music I liked very much 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.430
 the nice memory brings me this saga 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.470
 many pieces worn many moments 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.970
 fun and although I have not investigated so 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.460
 profound technical information 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.960
 dates versions and other things I hope 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.190
 that at least serve so that we can 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.080
 go back a little bit in time and 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.080
 remember to tablet lake 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.280
 please give him thumbs up and
