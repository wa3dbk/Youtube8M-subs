runs absolutely without any problems so
next<00:03:13.719> let's<00:03:14.719> change<00:03:15.139> the<00:03:15.379> resolution

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.940 

so<00:03:19.980> now<00:03:20.670> I've<00:03:21.180> stirred<00:03:22.049> switched<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.799> the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
so now I've stirred switched to the

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.589 
so now I've stirred switched to the
native<00:03:23.280> resolution<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:25.040> 1366<00:03:26.040> x<00:03:26.790> 768<00:03:27.709> and<00:03:29.599> why

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
native resolution of 1366 x 768 and why

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.949 
native resolution of 1366 x 768 and why
we<00:03:30.870> are<00:03:30.959> standing<00:03:31.260> our<00:03:32.010> frame<00:03:32.909> rate<00:03:33.209> dropped

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
we are standing our frame rate dropped

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:41.119 
we are standing our frame rate dropped
