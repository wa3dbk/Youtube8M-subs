00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
jungler so far I want to try it on

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.109 
jungler so far I want to try it on
everyone<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:03.840> I've<00:02:03.960> tried<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.530> Zen

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.059 
everyone but I've tried it on Zen
Nocturne<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.420> Evelyn<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.170> far<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.619> need<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.920> try

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
Nocturne and Evelyn so far I need to try

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.339 
Nocturne and Evelyn so far I need to try
it<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.280> quite<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> few<00:02:08.700> more<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.810> think<00:02:10.200> it's

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
it on quite a few more but I think it's

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.380 
it on quite a few more but I think it's
pretty<00:02:10.590> safe<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.039> say<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.849> champion

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
pretty safe to say that the champion

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.020 
pretty safe to say that the champion
that

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
that

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.090 
that
if<00:02:13.090> it's<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.510> most<00:02:13.900> from<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:14.560> item<00:02:14.950> right

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.850 
if it's the most from this item right
now<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.600> Nocturne<00:02:16.600> it<00:02:16.930> actually<00:02:17.440> kind<00:02:17.770> of

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
now is Nocturne it actually kind of

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.890 
now is Nocturne it actually kind of
makes<00:02:18.069> him<00:02:18.310> viable<00:02:18.580> again<00:02:19.120> because<00:02:19.660> right<00:02:19.870> now

and<00:03:36.310> go<00:03:36.400> into<00:03:36.640> feral<00:03:36.820> flare<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.269> think<00:03:37.450> Nocturne

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
and go into feral flare I think Nocturne

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.020 
and go into feral flare I think Nocturne
is<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.380> only<00:03:38.650> one<00:03:39.160> that's<00:03:39.459> like<00:03:39.610> yeah<00:03:39.970> you

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
is the only one that's like yeah you

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.720 
is the only one that's like yeah you
definitely<00:03:40.510> go<00:03:41.049> to<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.620> build<00:03:41.950> path<00:03:42.250> because

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
definitely go to that build path because

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.420 
definitely go to that build path because
he's<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.150> farm<00:03:43.510> heavy<00:03:43.780> jungler<00:03:44.320> most<00:03:44.859> nocturnes

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
he's a farm heavy jungler most nocturnes

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.880 
he's a farm heavy jungler most nocturnes
won't<00:03:45.880> even<00:03:46.120> gank<00:03:46.540> pre<00:03:46.989> six<00:03:47.380> they're<00:03:47.650> just

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
won't even gank pre six they're just

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.310 
won't even gank pre six they're just
farming<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.579> entire<00:03:48.940> time<00:03:49.329> so<00:03:50.049> it's

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
farming the entire time so it's

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.470 
farming the entire time so it's
definitely<00:03:50.799> perfect<00:03:51.549> for<00:03:51.730> Nocturne<00:03:52.120> like<00:03:52.299> I

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
definitely perfect for Nocturne like I

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.819 
definitely perfect for Nocturne like I
think<00:03:52.660> this<00:03:52.750> item<00:03:53.109> was<00:03:53.230> just<00:03:53.440> built<00:03:53.650> for

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
think this item was just built for

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.009 
think this item was just built for
Nocturne<00:03:54.220> like<00:03:54.430> he<00:03:54.760> just<00:03:54.940> owns<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.420> it's<00:03:55.840> his

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
Nocturne like he just owns it it's his

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.349 
Nocturne like he just owns it it's his
item<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.280> haven't<00:03:57.579> really<00:03:57.730> found<00:03:58.000> anyone

item so I haven't really found anyone
that<00:03:58.600> I<00:03:58.630> would<00:03:58.810> for<00:03:59.019> sure<00:03:59.049> build<00:03:59.620> it<00:03:59.709> on<00:03:59.799> I

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
that I would for sure build it on I

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.099 
that I would for sure build it on I
would<00:04:00.400> personally<00:04:00.940> build<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.600> if<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:01.900> was

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
would personally build it if I was

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.099

this<00:05:20.180> item<00:05:20.569> is<00:05:20.719> a<00:05:20.779> little<00:05:21.259> out<00:05:21.439> of<00:05:21.469> the<00:05:21.740> meadow

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
this item is a little out of the meadow

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.040 
this item is a little out of the meadow
right<00:05:22.159> now<00:05:22.340> because<00:05:22.849> most<00:05:23.389> champions<00:05:23.870> are

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
right now because most champions are

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.200 
right now because most champions are
just<00:05:24.229> in<00:05:24.409> it<00:05:24.469> for<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:24.830> early<00:05:25.279> game<00:05:25.550> so<00:05:26.029> maybe

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
just in it for the early game so maybe

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.700 
just in it for the early game so maybe
