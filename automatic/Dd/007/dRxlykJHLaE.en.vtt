00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.170
 we are interested in controlling a computer 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.850

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.739
 portable and so boils a whole bunch 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.260
 information the use of 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.780
 processor the ram battery in the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.580
 memory still available it offers you 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.200
 a whole range of tools that I you 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.060
 will discover by yourself with 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.450
 screenshots apps 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.850
 etc. 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.940
 we are going to focus on the control 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.459
 remotely this is the theme of the video and 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.830
 this is the button in the left control to 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.239
 distance from there a new 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.860
 window appears on your phone 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.780

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.700
 authorize the same control wanted 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.530
 allow remote control of 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.519
 your mobile device 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.720
 if your phone you click on 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.549

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.650
 your mobile phone 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.910
 so this connection is maybe 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.260
 trailing than to display circle on 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.530

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.000

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.049
 the teamviewer sap window is long as 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.680
 you see it here it's all at 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:32.760
 normal is a connection that can 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.019
 to take a lot of data so I 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.400
 advise you especially to have internet 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.700
 in wifi because it can not take 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.049
 bad tintin on your package 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.980
 so here we could navigate your 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.019
 cellphone 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.799
 everything you do on the phone 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.299
 portable will be made on the shooter this is 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.069
 the principle of remote control 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.959
 I wanted to test the other functions 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.880
 like file transfer that can 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.210
 be very useful from pc to phone and from 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.560
 phone to the pc 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.940
 and that will be all for this tutorial
