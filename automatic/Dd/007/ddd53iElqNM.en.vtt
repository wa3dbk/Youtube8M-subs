playable what I've done on this
particular<00:00:22.080> one<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:23.420> mostly<00:00:24.420> upper<00:00:24.750> stack

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
particular one is mostly upper stack

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.009 
particular one is mostly upper stack
stuff<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.369> let's<00:00:26.789> see<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.449> come<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
stuff and let's see if I can come in a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.870 
stuff and let's see if I can come in a
little<00:00:28.230> further<00:00:28.939> I<00:00:30.560> went<00:00:31.560> ahead<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:32.450> epoxy<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
little further I went ahead in epoxy and

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.930 
little further I went ahead in epoxy and
moved<00:00:35.880> over<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.260> back<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.950> thumb<00:00:38.579> rest

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
moved over on the back of the thumb rest

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.150 
moved over on the back of the thumb rest
and<00:00:39.329> moved<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.020> built<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.739> over

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
and moved this and built this out over

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.940 
and moved this and built this out over
here<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.360> came<00:00:42.690> back<00:00:42.719> across<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.680> top

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
here and then came back across the top

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.869 
here and then came back across the top
and<00:00:44.370> built<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.879> palm<00:00:45.660> riser<00:00:46.020> keys<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:47.070> up<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
and built a palm riser keys on up and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.770 
and built a palm riser keys on up and
I've<00:00:48.629> done<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.050> for<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> number<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.920> reasons

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
I've done this for a number of reasons

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.529 
I've done this for a number of reasons
one<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.809> them<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.460> whenever<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.879> go<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.300> high

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
one of them is whenever you go to a high

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.430 
one of them is whenever you go to a high
note<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.829> always<00:00:56.190> want<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:57.050> able<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.230> go

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
note you always want to be able to go

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.580 
note you always want to be able to go
from<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.129> /<00:00:59.460> s<00:01:00.059> sharp<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.840> E<00:01:00.870> or<00:01:00.930> any<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.469> those

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
from a / s sharp or E or any of those

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.000 
from a / s sharp or E or any of those
things<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.219> as<00:01:02.489> close<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.830> to<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
things and be as close to that to the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.719 
things and be as close to that to the
back<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.790> these<00:01:05.939> pieces<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.780> possible<00:01:07.189> and<00:01:08.189> I

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
back of these pieces as possible and I

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.850 
back of these pieces as possible and I
find<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> way<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> factory<00:01:10.229> set<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.619> is

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
find the way that the factory set up is

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.460 
find the way that the factory set up is
you<00:01:11.549> tend<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.150> moved<00:01:12.390> over<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> little<00:01:13.020> bit

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you tend to get moved over a little bit

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.969 
you tend to get moved over a little bit
so<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.400> allows<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.270> lightning<00:01:16.259> dexterity

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
so this allows you lightning dexterity

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.510 
so this allows you lightning dexterity
that<00:01:17.009> way<00:01:17.490> also<00:01:18.240> since<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.290> make<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.799> table

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
that way also since they make the table

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.460 
that way also since they make the table
like<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> Martin<00:01:21.180> style<00:01:21.509> table<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.259> G<00:01:22.439> sharp

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
like a Martin style table the G sharp

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.520 
like a Martin style table the G sharp
runs<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.369> high<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.750> no<00:01:24.960> problems

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
runs so high that you have no problems

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.160 
runs so high that you have no problems
coming<00:01:25.890> back<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.369> any<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> table<00:01:27.630> keys<00:01:27.840> as

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
coming back to any of the table keys as

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.330 
coming back to any of the table keys as
well<00:01:28.500> when<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:30.650> additionally<00:01:31.650> with

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
well when you do this additionally with

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.580 
well when you do this additionally with
the<00:01:32.490> gold<00:01:32.759> springs<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.630> they<00:01:33.810> use<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.350> in

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the gold springs that they use on in

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.179 
the gold springs that they use on in
here<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.150> you<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.920> unfortunately<00:01:37.920> that

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
here it you have to unfortunately that

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.399 
here it you have to unfortunately that
one<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> great<00:01:39.180> things<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.720> these<00:01:39.960> were

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
one of the great things is these were

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.050 
one of the great things is these were
the<00:01:40.560> first<00:01:40.799> folks<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.189> put<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.400> high<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> sharp

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the first folks to put a high a sharp

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.630 
the first folks to put a high a sharp
key<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:43.229> they<00:01:43.380> put<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.649> unfortunately<00:01:44.490> on

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
key on but they put it unfortunately on

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.340 
key on but they put it unfortunately on
this<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.060> had<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> horn<00:01:45.540> instead<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
this I had the horn instead of on the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.710 
this I had the horn instead of on the
other<00:01:46.649> side<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.340> running<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.729> linkage<00:01:48.149> so

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
other side and running a linkage so

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.270 
other side and running a linkage so
there<00:01:48.960> were<00:01:49.079> certain<00:01:49.500> things<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.860> they<00:01:50.040> did

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
there were certain things that they did

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.950 
there were certain things that they did
over<00:01:50.579> here<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.390> kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.720> have

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
over here that just kind of have

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.800 
over here that just kind of have
affected<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.799> little<00:01:53.460> bit<00:01:53.610> hand<00:01:54.030> feel<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.750> I

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
affected a little bit hand feel so I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.870 
affected a little bit hand feel so I
find<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.380> that's<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.799> best<00:01:55.979> way<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.670> this

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
find that that's the best way to do this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.920 
find that that's the best way to do this
also

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
also

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.420 
also
as<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.799> started<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.430> go<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.399> gold

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
as I started to go the with the gold

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.930 
as I started to go the with the gold
Springs<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.630> with

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
Springs and with

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.320 
Springs and with
way<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.480> keys<00:02:07.870> when<00:02:08.320> you<00:02:08.500> put<00:02:08.770> a<00:02:09.330> fatter

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
way to the keys when you put a fatter

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.990 
way to the keys when you put a fatter
resonator<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.500> you're<00:02:11.680> playing<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.430> more<00:02:12.640> open

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
resonator and you're playing a more open

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.810 
resonator and you're playing a more open
mouthpiece<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.570> plays<00:02:14.140> real<00:02:14.740> big<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.610> has<00:02:15.790> a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
mouthpiece to plays real big it has a

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.780 
mouthpiece to plays real big it has a
tendency<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.570> blow<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.990> keys<00:02:17.230> open<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.340> when

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
tendency to blow the keys open so when

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.940 
tendency to blow the keys open so when
you<00:02:18.940> add<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.450> weight<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.930> adding<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.410> pom<00:02:20.650> key

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
you add the weight of adding the pom key

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.760 
you add the weight of adding the pom key
risers<00:02:21.550> on<00:02:21.760> over<00:02:22.150> here<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.900> in<00:02:23.140> effect<00:02:23.530> there's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
risers on over here is in effect there's

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.770 
risers on over here is in effect there's
a<00:02:23.830> whole<00:02:24.040> lot<00:02:24.280> easier<00:02:24.310> than<00:02:25.090> drilling<00:02:25.600> and

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
a whole lot easier than drilling and

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.500 
a whole lot easier than drilling and
tapping<00:02:25.960> for<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.500> second<00:02:27.010> spring<00:02:27.400> they<00:02:28.000> do<00:02:28.060> one

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
tapping for a second spring they do one

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.930 
tapping for a second spring they do one
spring<00:02:29.050> on<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.440> F<00:02:29.650> sharp<00:02:29.680> key<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.670> they

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
spring on the F sharp key and they

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.150 
spring on the F sharp key and they
really<00:02:31.270> should<00:02:31.330> have<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.440> second<00:02:32.890> one<00:02:33.040> that

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
really should have to a second one that

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.060 
really should have to a second one that
runs<00:02:33.340> up<00:02:33.640> top<00:02:33.990> another<00:02:34.990> thing<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.560> like<00:02:35.890> to

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
runs up top another thing that I like to

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.940 
runs up top another thing that I like to
do<00:02:36.280> my<00:02:36.610> custom<00:02:37.270> build<00:02:37.540> one<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.930> these<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:38.410> to

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
do my custom build one of these is to

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.550 
do my custom build one of these is to
come<00:02:39.220> down<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:40.590> leblanc<00:02:41.590> versions<00:02:42.220> have<00:02:42.850> a

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
come down the leblanc versions have a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.610 
come down the leblanc versions have a
have<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.970> screw<00:02:45.970> adjustments<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.380> rods

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
have a screw adjustments and the rods

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.130 
have a screw adjustments and the rods
don't<00:02:47.860> come<00:02:48.100> over<00:02:48.220> spar<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.760> veto<00:02:49.330> versions

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
don't come over spar the veto versions

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.820 
don't come over spar the veto versions
they<00:02:50.830> had<00:02:51.070> these<00:02:51.250> linkage<00:02:51.820> rods<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.830> you

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
they had these linkage rods and you

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.620 
they had these linkage rods and you
literally<00:02:54.190> have<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.640> be<00:02:54.670> straight<00:02:55.090> on<00:02:55.240> top<00:02:55.420> of

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
literally have to be straight on top of

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.420 
literally have to be straight on top of
the<00:02:55.690> key<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:56.140> this<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:56.770> like<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.160> be<00:02:57.310> able

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
the key like this and I like to be able

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.190 
the key like this and I like to be able
to<00:02:57.580> lay<00:02:57.790> out<00:02:57.940> just<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.270> little<00:02:58.300> bit<00:02:58.690> flatter

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
to lay out just a little bit flatter

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.670 
to lay out just a little bit flatter
when<00:03:00.100> I<00:03:00.130> play<00:03:00.460> one<00:03:00.670> over<00:03:00.940> here<00:03:01.360> so<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:02.230> went

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
when I play one over here so I went

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.480 
when I play one over here so I went
ahead<00:03:02.770> and<00:03:03.010> shortened<00:03:03.730> these<00:03:04.600> linkages<00:03:05.490> just

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
ahead and shortened these linkages just

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.360 
ahead and shortened these linkages just
the<00:03:06.670> tiny<00:03:07.000> bit<00:03:07.330> on<00:03:07.540> over<00:03:07.930> here<00:03:08.350> for<00:03:09.220> that

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
the tiny bit on over here for that

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.090 
the tiny bit on over here for that
special<00:03:09.940> key<00:03:10.150> that<00:03:10.480> could<00:03:11.230> adjust<00:03:11.680> everything

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
special key that could adjust everything

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.790 
special key that could adjust everything
so<00:03:12.940> that's<00:03:13.150> another<00:03:13.510> one<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.080> adjustments

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
so that's another one of the adjustments

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.110 
so that's another one of the adjustments
that<00:03:14.920> I've<00:03:15.040> done<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.520> there<00:03:15.670> are<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.850> whole

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
that I've done and there are a whole

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.140 
that I've done and there are a whole
host<00:03:16.420> of<00:03:16.690> other<00:03:16.959> things<00:03:17.080> but<00:03:17.739> these<00:03:18.520> when<00:03:18.970> you

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
host of other things but these when you

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.780 
host of other things but these when you
when<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:19.690> buy<00:03:19.900> one<00:03:20.230> if<00:03:20.380> you<00:03:20.500> decide<00:03:20.890> I<00:03:20.920> built<00:03:21.489> I

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
when you buy one if you decide I built I

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.930 
when you buy one if you decide I built I
don't<00:03:22.150> know<00:03:22.330> maybe<00:03:22.870> 75<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.770> hundred<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.520> these<00:03:24.640> I

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
don't know maybe 75 a hundred of these I

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.330 
don't know maybe 75 a hundred of these I
really<00:03:25.300> got<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.510> where<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.530> thought<00:03:26.920> these<00:03:27.130> were

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
really got to where I thought these were

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.470 
really got to where I thought these were
just<00:03:27.370> nifty<00:03:27.790> as<00:03:28.060> all<00:03:28.270> get-out<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:30.330> due<00:03:31.330> to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
just nifty as all get-out and due to

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.150 
just nifty as all get-out and due to
health<00:03:31.600> reasons<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.230> unfortunately<00:03:32.890> having

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
health reasons and unfortunately having

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.729 
health reasons and unfortunately having
to<00:03:33.250> leave<00:03:33.430> everything<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:35.140> I<00:03:35.350> thought<00:03:35.560> I'd

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
to leave everything and I thought I'd

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.710 
to leave everything and I thought I'd
leave<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.010> record<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.670> what<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.180> might<00:03:37.420> want<00:03:37.660> to

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
leave a record of what you might want to

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.199 
leave a record of what you might want to
do<00:03:38.290> should<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.100> decide<00:03:39.489> that<00:03:39.700> you<00:03:39.880> want<00:03:40.150> to

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
want to make one of these once you take

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.759
