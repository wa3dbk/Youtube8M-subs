doesn't have any engine oil you would
fog<00:03:05.959> through<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.380> intake<00:03:06.800> system<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.370> it

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
fog through the intake system so it

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.160 
fog through the intake system so it
coats<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.090> whole<00:03:08.360> inside<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.959> motor

unlike<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.410> four-stroke<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.130> could<00:03:13.310> just

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
unlike the four-stroke you could just

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.340 
unlike the four-stroke you could just
fog<00:03:14.060> in<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.300> spark<00:03:14.630> plug<00:03:14.840> holes<00:03:15.080> because

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
fog in the spark plug holes because

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.930 
fog in the spark plug holes because
you're<00:03:15.470> really<00:03:15.739> after<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.160> cylinders<00:03:16.640> and

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
you're really after the cylinders and

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.910 
you're really after the cylinders and
piston<00:03:17.390> rings<00:03:17.600> because<00:03:17.870> right<00:03:18.290> there's<00:03:18.739> oil

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920

should repack wheel bearings because you

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.930 
should repack wheel bearings because you
can<00:04:18.680> get<00:04:18.799> water<00:04:19.010> in<00:04:19.220> there<00:04:19.370> just<00:04:19.640> like<00:04:19.789> the

can get water in there just like the

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.750 
can get water in there just like the
motor<00:04:20.120> no<00:04:20.539> you<00:04:21.200> can<00:04:21.350> freeze<00:04:21.709> and<00:04:21.739> end<00:04:22.460> up<00:04:22.640> with

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
motor no you can freeze and end up with

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.580 
motor no you can freeze and end up with
rusty<00:04:23.090> bearings<00:04:23.450> next<00:04:23.810> year<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.169> then<00:04:24.289> when

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
rusty bearings next year and then when

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.130 
rusty bearings next year and then when
it<00:04:24.710> freezes<00:04:24.979> it<00:04:25.460> expands<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:26.330> whether<00:04:26.960> it's

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
it freezes it expands and whether it's

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.409 
it freezes it expands and whether it's
in<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.350> engine<00:04:27.800> or<00:04:28.010> yeah<00:04:28.550> not<00:04:28.940> a<00:04:28.970> good<00:04:29.060> things
