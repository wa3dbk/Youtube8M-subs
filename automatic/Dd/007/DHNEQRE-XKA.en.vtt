00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.300 
new iPhone 6 he has no interest I
actually<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.409> am<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.860> conspiracy

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
actually think I am a conspiracy

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.340 
actually think I am a conspiracy
theorist<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.820> believe<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.270> they<00:01:51.360> put<00:01:51.570> stuff

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
theorist I believe that they put stuff

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
theorist I believe that they put stuff
as<00:01:52.560> soon<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> six<00:01:53.250> came<00:01:53.430> out<00:01:53.579> my<00:01:53.729> five

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
as soon as the six came out my five

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.109 
as soon as the six came out my five
started<00:01:54.720> breaking<00:01:55.079> down<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.969> think<00:01:56.969> they

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
started breaking down and I think they

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.560 
started breaking down and I think they
put<00:01:58.369> software<00:01:59.369> something<00:01:59.820> inside<00:02:00.240> my<00:02:00.360> phone

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
put software something inside my phone

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.920 
put software something inside my phone
to<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.439> break<00:02:01.649> down<00:02:01.939> prematurely<00:02:02.939> so

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
to it have it break down prematurely so

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.990 
to it have it break down prematurely so
that<00:02:04.079> you're<00:02:04.259> forced<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.619> buy<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.860> six<00:02:05.219> now<00:02:05.880> if

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
that you're forced to buy the six now if

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
that you're forced to buy the six now if
