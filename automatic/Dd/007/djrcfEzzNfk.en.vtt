00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
bit but it's relatively going to be the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
about why is not really her early game

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.470

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.010 
number two is going to be pantheon so
again<00:03:07.280> pantheon<00:03:08.000> is<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.150> really<00:03:08.540> good<00:03:08.660> duelist

again pantheon is a really good duelist
he's<00:03:09.380> really<00:03:09.650> good<00:03:09.860> an<00:03:09.980> early<00:03:10.280> game<00:03:10.400> because

easily snowball the game this way and
get<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.690> lot<00:03:41.870> of<00:03:41.930> kills<00:03:42.260> in<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.500> early<00:03:42.740> game<00:03:42.950> if

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
get a lot of kills in the early game if

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.130 
get a lot of kills in the early game if
he<00:03:43.580> is<00:03:43.700> snowballing<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.360> can<00:03:44.540> also<00:03:44.690> build<00:03:44.990> a

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
he is snowballing you can also build a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.960 
he is snowballing you can also build a
bit<00:03:45.470> offensive<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.130> build<00:03:46.370> a<00:03:46.460> lot<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.790> damage

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
bit offensive and build a lot of damage

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.820 
bit offensive and build a lot of damage
so<00:03:47.510> that<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:47.720> can<00:03:47.870> take<00:03:48.020> out<00:03:48.200> two<00:03:48.320> issues<00:03:48.590> with

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
so that you can take out two issues with

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.040 
so that you can take out two issues with
1-click<00:03:49.340> combo<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.000> unlike<00:03:50.510> Twisted<00:03:50.870> Fate

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050

his<00:03:51.290> ultimate<00:03:51.709> is<00:03:51.800> a<00:03:51.860> really<00:03:52.250> good<00:03:52.400> initiation

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
his ultimate is a really good initiation

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.270 
his ultimate is a really good initiation
since<00:03:53.959> it<00:03:54.080> does<00:03:54.230> have<00:03:54.410> a<00:03:54.440> high<00:03:54.680> magic<00:03:55.070> base

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
since it does have a high magic base

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.580 
since it does have a high magic base
damage<00:03:55.459> at<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.850> center<00:03:56.270> and<00:03:56.480> it<00:03:57.260> does<00:03:57.440> slow

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
damage at the center and it does slow

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.440 
damage at the center and it does slow

everyone in the circle who are hit by at

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
five fifty percent for one second so it

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.490 
five fifty percent for one second so it
is<00:04:01.940> really<00:04:02.090> good<00:04:02.420> for<00:04:02.660> breaking<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.140> enemies

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
is really good for breaking the enemies

is really good for breaking the enemies

follow-up when he initiates then of

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.470 
follow-up when he initiates then of
course<00:04:16.220> he's<00:04:16.489> just<00:04:16.700> going<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:16.910> get<00:04:17.030> focused<00:04:17.239> by

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
course he's just going to get focused by

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.599 
course he's just going to get focused by
the<00:04:17.540> enemy<00:04:17.870> team<00:04:18.140> and<00:04:18.410> then<00:04:18.739> probably<00:04:19.160> explode

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
the enemy team and then probably explode

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.460 
the enemy team and then probably explode
if<00:04:19.760> he's<00:04:19.880> not<00:04:20.000> tanking<00:04:20.270> enough<00:04:20.660> other<00:04:21.350> than

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
if he's not tanking enough other than

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.020 
if he's not tanking enough other than
that<00:04:21.560> it's<00:04:21.919> pretty<00:04:21.980> easy<00:04:22.370> to<00:04:22.520> get<00:04:22.700> kills

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
that it's pretty easy to get kills

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.480 
that it's pretty easy to get kills
around<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.360> map<00:04:23.510> with<00:04:23.690> his<00:04:23.810> ultimate<00:04:24.230> and<00:04:24.490> the

around the map with his ultimate and the

you<00:04:59.259> can<00:04:59.409> always<00:04:59.560> EQ<00:05:00.129> or<00:05:00.159> flash<00:05:00.639> out<00:05:00.909> and

you can always EQ or flash out and

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.999 
you can always EQ or flash out and
especially<00:05:01.780> against<00:05:02.199> champions<00:05:02.710> who<00:05:02.830> don't

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
have any escape or dashes and so they're

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.149 
have any escape or dashes and so they're
going<00:05:05.199> to<00:05:05.259> be<00:05:05.319> trapped<00:05:05.590> unless<00:05:05.800> they<00:05:06.039> have

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
going to be trapped unless they have

going to be trapped unless they have
flash<00:05:06.460> adding<00:05:07.449> on<00:05:07.569> to<00:05:07.659> that<00:05:07.840> he<00:05:08.139> can<00:05:08.289> initiate

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
flash adding on to that he can initiate

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.890 
flash adding on to that he can initiate
from<00:05:08.949> half<00:05:09.159> a<00:05:09.280> screen<00:05:09.520> away<00:05:09.789> with<00:05:10.240> his<00:05:10.389> EQ<00:05:10.780> and

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
from half a screen away with his EQ and

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.990 
from half a screen away with his EQ and
then<00:05:11.020> using<00:05:11.199> his<00:05:11.379> are<00:05:11.560> on<00:05:11.710> someone<00:05:12.069> so<00:05:12.219> that<00:05:12.819> is

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
then using his are on someone so that is

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.610 
then using his are on someone so that is
pretty<00:05:13.240> good<00:05:13.479> too<00:05:13.539> and<00:05:13.960> since<00:05:14.169> he<00:05:14.319> has<00:05:14.349> all

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
pretty good too and since he has all

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.830 
pretty good too and since he has all
this<00:05:14.800> utility<00:05:15.400> he's<00:05:15.759> good<00:05:16.060> even<00:05:16.389> if<00:05:16.539> you<00:05:16.689> are

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
this utility he's good even if you are

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.749 
this utility he's good even if you are
behind<00:05:17.169> so<00:05:17.680> he<00:05:17.800> is<00:05:17.889> pretty<00:05:18.159> consistent<00:05:18.340> in

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
behind so he is pretty consistent in

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.270 
behind so he is pretty consistent in
that<00:05:18.939> sense<00:05:19.240> as<00:05:19.479> for<00:05:20.289> his<00:05:20.469> clears<00:05:20.770> it's<00:05:21.039> pretty

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
that sense as for his clears it's pretty

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.830 
that sense as for his clears it's pretty
good<00:05:21.490> since<00:05:21.759> he<00:05:21.879> does<00:05:22.060> have<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.240> shield<00:05:22.569> coming

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
good since he does have a shield coming

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.629 
good since he does have a shield coming
friends<00:05:23.050> w<00:05:23.349> and<00:05:23.590> he<00:05:23.680> has<00:05:23.770> armor<00:05:24.159> coming<00:05:24.430> fellas

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
friends w and he has armor coming fellas

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.240 
friends w and he has armor coming fellas
e<00:05:24.819> and<00:05:25.210> yeah<00:05:25.990> he's<00:05:26.229> just<00:05:26.409> really<00:05:26.680> good<00:05:27.039> the

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
e and yeah he's just really good the

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.249 
e and yeah he's just really good the
only<00:05:27.460> flaw<00:05:27.669> I<00:05:27.699> can<00:05:27.969> find<00:05:28.300> about<00:05:28.509> Jarvan<00:05:29.050> is

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
only flaw I can find about Jarvan is

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.170 
only flaw I can find about Jarvan is
that<00:05:29.409> sometimes<00:05:29.800> he<00:05:29.949> can<00:05:30.099> miss<00:05:30.250> his<00:05:30.400> EQ<00:05:30.969> and

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
that sometimes he can miss his EQ and

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.059 
that sometimes he can miss his EQ and
that<00:05:31.719> could<00:05:31.870> be<00:05:31.900> crucial<00:05:32.139> for<00:05:32.349> a<00:05:32.530> gank<00:05:32.800> but

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
that could be crucial for a gank but

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.159 
that could be crucial for a gank but
other<00:05:33.310> than<00:05:33.460> that<00:05:33.520> he's<00:05:34.030> very<00:05:34.060> very<00:05:34.629> good<00:05:34.960> at

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
other than that he's very very good at

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.439 
other than that he's very very good at
the<00:05:35.500> moment<00:05:35.860> now<00:05:36.759> I<00:05:36.789> do<00:05:36.940> want<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.300> talk<00:05:37.389> about

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
the moment now I do want to talk about

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.839 
the moment now I do want to talk about
nebulae<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.229> why<00:05:38.860> she's<00:05:39.310> not<00:05:39.340> on<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.669> tier

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
nebulae and why she's not on the tier

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.029 
nebulae and why she's not on the tier
list<00:05:40.060> I<00:05:40.300> do<00:05:40.750> feel<00:05:41.020> like<00:05:41.139> she's<00:05:41.199> very<00:05:41.590> powerful

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
list I do feel like she's very powerful

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.249 
list I do feel like she's very powerful
in<00:05:42.099> an<00:05:42.250> early<00:05:42.520> game<00:05:42.669> in<00:05:42.909> mid<00:05:43.120> game<00:05:43.330> but<00:05:44.020> she

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
in an early game in mid game but she

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:45.689 
in an early game in mid game but she
kind<00:05:44.440> of<00:05:44.469> just<00:05:44.620> falls<00:05:44.919> off<00:05:45.069> late<00:05:45.280> game<00:05:45.520> and

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
kind of just falls off late game and

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.570 
kind of just falls off late game and

she does do bad in the early game she's

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.260 
she does do bad in the early game she's
basically<00:05:50.979> useless<00:05:51.490> and<00:05:51.879> doesn't<00:05:52.120> really

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
basically useless and doesn't really
