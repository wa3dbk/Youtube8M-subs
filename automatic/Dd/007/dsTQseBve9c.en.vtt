00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.030
 In this short video, a few words about 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.790
 stretcher faced with the fact that not all 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.599
 know how to drive wedges 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.700
 here are these spacers in the stretcher 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:23.490
 this is done very simply wedge 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:28.140
 put with its long side on 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 subframe is inserted into the groove so we have this 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.030
 the operation is carried out with all eight 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.600
 wedges my insert them and now us 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.230
 you only need to slightly knock them 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.829
 hammer 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.789
 especially if the canvas is slack or 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.840
 such folds on the corners of the canvas here 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.180
 hammer need to act very 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.610
 carefully trying not to hurt the canvas 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.620
 don't hit it otherwise may appear 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.030
 microcracks on microcracks in the ground 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.340
 accordingly c he will pull into these 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.030
 ground oil from oil paint and in these 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.190
 There will be no dark spots on the ground. 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.190
 overdo 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.530
 so that there is no canvas like a drum 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.979
 otherwise it may be the so-called 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.200
 screw at the canvas that is, it can both 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.970
 would such a figure of eight turn around 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.510
 it is very difficult to fix but you can 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.260
 correct but 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.660
 itâ€™s better not to bring a knock 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.940
 around the perimeter 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.450
 see if there are any folds left 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.000
 on the corners and get to work here and yet 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.590
 one such trouble often 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.520
 is found on large stretchers 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.070
 center strut often close 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.460
 located close to the surface to 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.040
 back of the canvas and at the very 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.780
 the process of painting she sometimes gets in the way 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.960
 there is literally a brush rests on here 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.979
 battery 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.120
 here it is usually no longer needed after 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.490
 priming it as it performs such 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.070
 decorative function that is if you are not 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.140
 are going to sit down on a stretcher she 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.390
 really no longer needed from her 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.370
 you can get rid get rid you can 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.680
 using a hammer and you can cut it 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.910
 long but you can just one exact 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.310
 strike with a hammer 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.500
 it is necessary to beat on the center not at the edge as 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.709
 can split 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.840
 supporting rail subframe along here you need 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.080
 aim to adjust and one 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.670
 a decisive blow to knock out that rail 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.360
 Now you have a subframe ready to go. 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.980
 rake will not interfere well that's all 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.980
 short video subscribe good luck
