00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.370
 lots at all here we are all here and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.910
 today I'm going to show how 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.890
 put our icons so where we want you 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.640
 see that I have separated in space 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.910
 so between each icon there is a space and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.439
 Well, it's pretty stylish in me so I say 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.809
 for that there are two ways to do it 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:39.989
 for those who are in winter s appreciated 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:43.050
 of the oak 3 up to 5.1 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.940
 something does not want lower one can 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.750
 use grit the credoc that is found 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.250
 on cydia 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.190
 you type written locke gr.i wings 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.219
 to these cases and you can put where 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.260
 you'll want to stick me there now 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:07.590
 I am in bone 6 so 6.0.1 to be 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.479
 exact so I'm showing you here I have 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.250
 also however less so I do not want 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.380
 not here written of their case they did not 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.369
 still not updated for this 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.270
 how did I do I used 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:24.509
 I used to and black eyed blank that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.000
 which is how we find on cydia 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.710
 you demonstrate after how 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.750
 but I will first explain to you the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.310
 principle the principle of a block it was 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.369
 to put small icons between 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.869
 between our icons but psycho 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.780
 transparent or and hop 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.710
 when I click the bayanne pedestrians who 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.450
 appears so that's actually it's not 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.290
 really like outlook 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.700
 but hey that's already that so how I 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.520
 yes yes they blank 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.079
 so I 'm telling you this is why 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.719
 we will search on cydia 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.689
 you type in the search bar 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.619
 is normally at the bottom right we 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:08.300
 search and white 'so loading when 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.210
 you take the first 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.120
 take it 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.970
 and you install it I'm not going to them 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.530
 do it because it's already done once 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.050
 installed you will have his white daughter the 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.590
 little black application you to go 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.790
 click on it 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.820
 we're waiting for it to open already here page 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.430
 hosted select number of blanks y 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:37.350
 glue so we will select how many 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:43.570
 transparent icon where we can choose 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:46.300
 up to 100 here and so here goes again 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:51.010
 we selected we press down here 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.970
 create blank epote once we get 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.350
 pressed on it we will do a res pring 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:03.490
 so their minds and we will have one time 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.430
 so small zico trans not we can 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.180
 move it between the transmitting 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.090
 applications of as you want after 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.130
 little flaw month we do not see but you 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.920
 there will surely be number ie 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.990
 we'll see a little black thing instead of 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.630
 nothing at all for that how did I do 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.020
 for not bad I went on again 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.540
 cydia and I tried to search and I 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:34.420
 found something very good 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:36.010
 it was no to a shadow joke so 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.180
 shadow knowing that ie shadows 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:46.270
 do not have a shadow blank hay so that's 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:48.430
 the second install it by remaking it 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.070
 and once moved here 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.770
 you do not have long so it's 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.090
 really great melted gecamines 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.790
 alternativa creed loc 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.250
 so I think it's not bad at all and 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.260
 it's a nice effect finally here 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.940
