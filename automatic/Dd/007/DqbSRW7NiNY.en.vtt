00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.069
Over the past few years there haven't been
many flybridge cruisers

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.519
launched that break new ground for the
builders, however this week on Power Profile

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.009
we're gonna take a look at one that does
from Carver yachts

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.059
the C40

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.730
the C40 is truly a bold new design with
her low profile extended bridge

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.980
and hull design that carries the beam
well forward creating a flared bow

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.670
that adds extra interior space. The C40
has a large integrated swim platform

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.570
that provides great access to the
cockpit. Twin transom lockers conceal

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.120
the shore

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.690
hookups and hide a ton of gear. The
cockpit is quite large and open

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.230
or it can be fitted out with wrap-around
split transom seating

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.160
with integrated storage. Molded steps
provide ease of access to the wide side

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.620
deck

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.620
and the steps also create space for
storage and the optional refrigerator

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.670
or ice-maker. Molded stairs lead to the
bridge

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.359
which is a real focal point for the C40.
To port an L-shaped settee dominates the

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.109
flybridge

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.110
providing plenty of seating and storage.
Aft on the bridge extension

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.360
protected by a low rail is a great sun
lounging area. The helm as a pod design

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.630
that allows ample space for installing
multifunction displays

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.170
flanking the LCD vessel view engine and
system display

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.119
now standard on the C40 of course is the
upper helm station

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.320
and there is an optional lower helm
available for the starboard side of the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.150
salon so let's go in and take a look at
the layout in this C40

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.860
double opening glass doors provide
superior access

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.430
and fresh breezes for the salon. The salon
is an open concept design from the aft

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.960
bulkhead forward to the companionway
Carver has used natural tones for the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.079
fabric upholstery

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.020
and nylon sculptured carpet that
effectively lightens the space

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.310
Carver also designed the space for living

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.520
with a settee immediately to port with
storage

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.729
and a section that moves over to the high
low table for dining

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.159
the high low table is surrounded by an
additional U-shaped settee

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.459
with a filler cushion that converts the
dinette into a berth for two

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.129
Forward of the U-settee a glass or a cabinet is
located where the optional lower helm would

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:15.950
be installed

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.489
the standard salon entertainment system
consists of a 23 inch LCD TV

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.879
DVD player am/fm/cd marine stereo and
speakers

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.019
for comfort Carver offers a single zone
16,000 BTU air conditioning

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.989
reverse cycle heat unit or a 28,000 BTU

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.549
dual zone system that also adds a second
thirty amp shore power inlet

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.310
all wood accents including the galley
cabinetry

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.139
are stylish dark walnut and the flooring
is dusty walnut

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.010
the counters are solid surface with a
double stainless sink

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.459
electric cooktop with ventilator and
under the counter

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.609
are side by side Nova Kool
refrigerator/freezer

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.680
and microwave. A welcome feature is the
cavernous below deck storage

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.859
accommodations are forward and down two
steps

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.180
the mid cabin has twin berths

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.200
or filler cushion to convert the
sleeping area to a double bed

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.510
in the cabin are a hanging locker with a
light and mirror,

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.669
LED lighting, two reading lights, and
an opening port with screen

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.760
a second door reveals the gas head

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.169
for those wonderful nights aboard
at anchor

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.019
the C40's master has four opening
ports and a large

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.479
overhead hatch with screens and shades for
ventilation

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:38.000
thank you Carver, I'm seeing all too
many cruisers from other companies

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.139
that are hermetically sealed forcing you
to run the generator and air conditioning

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.359
when away from the dock. The C40 with its
two heads

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.829
spoils the owners with the private head.
This well-appointed space has solid

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:51.829
surface counters

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.979
vanity with vessel sink, a walk in
shower with bench seat

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.049
exhaust fan, electric toilet, opening port
with screen,

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.840
and LED lights. Carver's been a popular

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.220
name in boating for decades with a full
line of cruisers, both aft cabins and

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.680
cockpit motor yachts

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.500
Now recently they've really stepped up
their game with the launch of the C34

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.729
and now the C40 a cruiser really
worthwhile looking into

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.280
While we have had a chance to spend time
aboard the c40

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.190
big East winds following Fort Lauderdale
International Boat Show

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.800
prevented us from filming on water.
However we will have the opportunity

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.970
and we'll post the updated power profile
on boattest.ca

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.729
and USboattest.com.
