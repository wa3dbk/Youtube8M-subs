00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
black ops 1 maps in black ops 3 which

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.940 
black ops 1 maps in black ops 3 which
ones<00:03:06.310> would<00:03:06.490> they<00:03:06.700> be<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.120> why<00:03:07.200> but<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.410> feel

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
ones would they be and why but I feel

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.320 
ones would they be and why but I feel
like<00:03:08.980> maybe<00:03:09.400> there<00:03:09.670> is<00:03:09.820> something<00:03:10.060> with

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
like maybe there is something with

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.180 
like maybe there is something with
Terese<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.870> mean<00:03:11.020> we've<00:03:11.140> already<00:03:11.410> had<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.740> remake

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
Terese I mean we've already had a remake

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.820 
Terese I mean we've already had a remake
of<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.520> in<00:03:12.700> black<00:03:13.240> ops<00:03:13.480> 1<00:03:13.720> zombies<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.740> that

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
of it in black ops 1 zombies and that

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.830 
of it in black ops 1 zombies and that
was<00:03:14.980> just<00:03:15.100> like<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.310> complete<00:03:15.730> remaster<00:03:16.420> but<00:03:16.750> it

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
was just like a complete remaster but it

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.270 
was just like a complete remaster but it
was<00:03:16.930> literally<00:03:17.230> just<00:03:17.350> untouched<00:03:17.920> at<00:03:18.130> that

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
was literally just untouched at that

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.220 
was literally just untouched at that
point<00:03:18.580> but<00:03:18.700> we've<00:03:18.850> already<00:03:19.030> had<00:03:19.239> a<00:03:19.480> remaster

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
point but we've already had a remaster

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.960 
point but we've already had a remaster
of<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.560> recent<00:03:20.890> black<00:03:21.040> ops<00:03:21.220> 1<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.640> don't

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
of the recent black ops 1 so I don't

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.570 
of the recent black ops 1 so I don't
know<00:03:22.120> why<00:03:22.480> they<00:03:22.840> do<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.110> again<00:03:23.530> in<00:03:23.800> black<00:03:24.190> ops<00:03:24.400> 3

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
know why they do it again in black ops 3

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.180 
know why they do it again in black ops 3
but<00:03:25.450> if<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.930> watch<00:03:26.140> my<00:03:26.170> video<00:03:26.620> on<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.980> loading

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
but if you watch my video on the loading

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.720 
but if you watch my video on the loading
screen<00:03:27.750> video<00:03:28.750> which<00:03:29.110> like<00:03:29.590> suggest<00:03:30.430> maybe

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
screen video which like suggest maybe

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.390

Teresa's<00:03:31.330> coming<00:03:31.540> back<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.590> differences<00:03:33.370> are

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
Teresa's coming back the differences are

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.940 
Teresa's coming back the differences are
quite<00:03:34.000> noticeable<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:34.840> it's<00:03:35.260> strange<00:03:35.739> I

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
quite noticeable and it's strange I

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.650 
quite noticeable and it's strange I
don't<00:03:36.160> know<00:03:36.280> why<00:03:36.580> but<00:03:36.940> they<00:03:37.060> wouldn't<00:03:37.480> put

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
don't know why but they wouldn't put

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.479 
don't know why but they wouldn't put
that<00:03:37.840> in<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.020> presentation<00:03:38.470> if<00:03:38.800> it<00:03:39.190> didn't

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
that in the presentation if it didn't

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.040 
that in the presentation if it didn't
have<00:03:39.640> some<00:03:39.850> sort<00:03:40.000> of<00:03:40.090> reasoning<00:03:40.570> behind<00:03:40.690> it

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
have some sort of reasoning behind it

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.300 
have some sort of reasoning behind it
perhaps<00:03:41.440> maybe<00:03:41.650> we<00:03:41.830> could<00:03:41.950> even<00:03:41.980> get<00:03:42.250> a

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
perhaps maybe we could even get a

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.150 
perhaps maybe we could even get a

that<00:03:45.489> be<00:03:45.700> if<00:03:45.910> we<00:03:46.239> had<00:03:46.269> that<00:03:46.450> in<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:47.140> new<00:03:47.260> engine

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
that be if we had that in the new engine

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.810 
that be if we had that in the new engine
we<00:03:47.800> don't<00:03:47.950> even<00:03:48.130> know<00:03:48.280> what<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.550> new<00:03:48.670> engine

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
we don't even know what the new engine

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.190 
we don't even know what the new engine
is<00:03:49.030> going<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.239> be<00:03:49.360> like<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.720> zombies<00:03:50.080> but

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
is going to be like the zombies but

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.229

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
but then have it in black ops 3 that

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.949 
but then have it in black ops 3 that
would<00:03:56.739> be<00:03:56.860> absolutely<00:03:57.340> amazing<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.600> just<00:03:58.810> it
