00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
straight backwards you know like that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.660 
straight backwards you know like that
it's<00:01:09.030> very<00:01:09.900> simple<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.520> all

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
scrape but when people strafe they

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.870 
scrape but when people strafe they
usually<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.560> left<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:13.979> right<00:01:14.040> I'm<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.580> saying

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
usually go left or right I'm just saying

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.450 
usually go left or right I'm just saying
in<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.689> game<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.200> some<00:01:16.380> odd<00:01:16.770> reason<00:01:16.799> I've

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
in this game for some odd reason I've

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.399 
in this game for some odd reason I've
noticed<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.240> helps<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.049> straight

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
noticed that it helps if you straight

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.749 
noticed that it helps if you straight
backwards<00:01:20.390> it's<00:01:21.390> weird<00:01:21.659> makes<00:01:22.020> no<00:01:22.200> sense<00:01:22.759> but

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
backwards it's weird makes no sense but

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.880 
backwards it's weird makes no sense but
I've<00:01:24.000> noticed<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> helps<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:27.619> I'm<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:28.680> going

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
I've noticed it helps so I'm not going

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.719 
I've noticed it helps so I'm not going
to<00:01:28.950> name<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.310> shot<00:01:29.579> either<00:01:29.880> I'm<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:31.110> saying

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
to name the shot either I'm just saying

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.460 
to name the shot either I'm just saying

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
because basically this is exactly what

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.870 
because basically this is exactly what
