sugar level we want to preserve that
sugar<00:01:55.500> level<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:55.950> once<00:01:56.159> they're<00:01:56.310> harvested<00:01:56.850> we

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000

bring<00:01:57.210> them<00:01:57.270> back<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.899> gondolas<00:01:58.380> they'll

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
bring them back here in gondolas they'll

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.310 
bring them back here in gondolas they'll
drop<00:01:59.670> them<00:01:59.880> into<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.270> hopper<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.780> the

they'll<00:02:02.820> go<00:02:02.909> up<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.149> conveyor<00:02:03.509> belt<00:02:03.750> here

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
they'll go up this conveyor belt here

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.330 
they'll go up this conveyor belt here
and<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:04.229> drop<00:02:04.469> down<00:02:04.649> into<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.040> stainless

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
bladder press inside of that tank is a

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.330 
bladder press inside of that tank is a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
balloon in a scream type device that

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.980 
balloon in a scream type device that

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
expands and contracts and what this does

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.540 
expands and contracts and what this does
is<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.170> pushes<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.710> berries<00:02:19.950> up<00:02:20.100> against<00:02:20.460> the

is it pushes the berries up against the
screen<00:02:20.820> extracting<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.720> juice<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.830> juice

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
screen extracting the juice the juice

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.590 
screen extracting the juice the juice
will<00:02:23.250> then<00:02:23.430> get<00:02:23.640> pumped<00:02:23.940> into<00:02:24.090> our<00:02:24.360> cellar

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
will then get pumped into our cellar

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.870 
will then get pumped into our cellar
inside<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.170> fermentation<00:02:25.530> tank<00:02:26.010> now<00:02:26.760> with

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
inside of a fermentation tank now with

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.370 
inside of a fermentation tank now with
the<00:02:26.970> red<00:02:27.120> grapes<00:02:27.360> they<00:02:27.630> will<00:02:27.780> bypass<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
the red grapes they will bypass the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.050 
the red grapes they will bypass the
bladder<00:02:28.560> press<00:02:28.770> process<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.430> we<00:02:29.460> need<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:29.880> the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
bladder press process so we need all the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.970 
bladder press process so we need all the
skins<00:02:30.330> intact<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> red<00:02:31.080> grapes<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.500> order

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
skins intact on the red grapes in order

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.500 
skins intact on the red grapes in order
to<00:02:32.070> extract<00:02:32.370> all<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.790> colors<00:02:33.090> for<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.330> red

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
to extract all the colors for the red

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.110 
to extract all the colors for the red
wine<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.710> red<00:02:34.890> grapes<00:02:35.130> will<00:02:35.280> actually<00:02:35.700> go

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
wine so the red grapes will actually go

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.640 
wine so the red grapes will actually go
through<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.450> D<00:02:36.540> stemming<00:02:36.900> process<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.500> then

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
through the D stemming process and then

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.890 
through the D stemming process and then
get<00:02:37.830> pumped<00:02:38.130> right<00:02:38.280> into<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.730> cellar<00:02:38.970> hole
