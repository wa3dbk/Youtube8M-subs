patent you can see a little picture here
that<00:00:46.079> was<00:00:46.170> came<00:00:46.350> from<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.680> patent<00:00:47.329> you<00:00:48.329> know

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
that was came from the patent you know

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.470 
that was came from the patent you know
it<00:00:48.750> looks<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.559> I'm<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.480> advertisement

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
it looks like that I'm the advertisement

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
it looks like that I'm the advertisement
will<00:00:51.600> actually<00:00:51.960> disable<00:00:52.469> some<00:00:52.620> features

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
will actually disable some features

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.799 
will actually disable some features
while<00:00:53.129> explain<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:54.090> course<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.570> would<00:00:54.719> probably

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
while explain of course I would probably

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
while explain of course I would probably
think<00:00:55.110> you'll<00:00:55.350> probably<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.710> disabled<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
think you'll probably just disabled a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.729 
think you'll probably just disabled a
mouse<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.360> something<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.469> it

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
mouse or something like that and it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.939 
mouse or something like that and it
could<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:58.980> either<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.550> an<00:00:59.699> audio

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
could be either just an audio

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.170 
could be either just an audio
advertisement<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> video<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.879> audio

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
advertisement or a video and audio

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.840 
advertisement or a video and audio
advertisement<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.110> combination<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:05.250> both<00:01:05.489> for

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
advertisement or combination of both for

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.670 
advertisement or combination of both for
that<00:01:06.450> doesn't<00:01:06.720> make<00:01:06.780> sense<00:01:06.840> combination<00:01:07.590> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that doesn't make sense combination of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.810 
that doesn't make sense combination of
those<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.369> either<00:01:08.580> or

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
those but it's going to be either or

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.039 
those but it's going to be either or
audio<00:01:09.240> video<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:11.070> know<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.220> don't<00:01:11.700> really

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
audio video and you know I don't really

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.420 
audio video and you know I don't really
at<00:01:13.049> first<00:01:13.380> glance<00:01:13.530> from<00:01:13.950> looking<00:01:14.250> at<00:01:14.310> this

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
at first glance from looking at this

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.580 
at first glance from looking at this
article<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.030> was<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.330> oh<00:01:15.509> no<00:01:15.810> that's<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
article I was like oh no that's that

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.530
