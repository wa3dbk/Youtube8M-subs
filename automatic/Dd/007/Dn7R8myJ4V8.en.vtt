joint<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.740> normal<00:02:42.070> DW<00:02:42.520> tube<00:02:42.730> joint<00:02:43.030> design

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
joint the normal DW tube joint design

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.380 
joint the normal DW tube joint design
which<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:43.930> well<00:02:44.110> known<00:02:44.550> yeah<00:02:45.550> that's<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.270> new

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
which is well known yeah that's a new

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.020 
which is well known yeah that's a new
stance<00:02:46.690> from<00:02:47.500> summertime<00:02:48.190> on<00:02:48.370> they<00:02:48.610> will<00:02:48.760> come

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
stance from summertime on they will come

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.340 
stance from summertime on they will come
with<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.450> PDP<00:02:49.840> concept<00:02:50.760> hardware<00:02:51.760> pack<00:02:52.350> that's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
with a PDP concept hardware pack that's

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.700 
with a PDP concept hardware pack that's
actually<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.800> new<00:02:54.010> 9000<00:02:54.790> pebble<00:02:55.590> it's<00:02:56.590> the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
actually the new 9000 pebble it's the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.490 
actually the new 9000 pebble it's the
normal<00:02:57.040> version<00:02:57.220> here<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:59.080> regular<00:02:59.470> version

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
normal version here the regular version

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.300 
normal version here the regular version
and<00:03:00.010> s<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> XF<00:03:00.880> paddle<00:03:01.410> same<00:03:02.410> as<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.770> says<00:03:03.040> on

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
and s the XF paddle same as it says on

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.820 
and s the XF paddle same as it says on
the<00:03:03.610> concept<00:03:04.120> pedal<00:03:04.420> x<00:03:04.600> f<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.050> for<00:03:05.230> extended

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
the concept pedal x f is for extended

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.740 
the concept pedal x f is for extended
footboard<00:03:06.250> so<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:06.880> is<00:03:07.000> 1<00:03:07.210> inch<00:03:07.420> longer

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
footboard so this is 1 inch longer

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.370 
footboard so this is 1 inch longer
compared<00:03:08.710> to<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.640> normal<00:03:09.940> DW<00:03:10.390> paddle<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:11.320> you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
compared to the normal DW paddle so you

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.010 
compared to the normal DW paddle so you
get<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.560> long<00:03:11.830> board<00:03:12.360> totally<00:03:13.360> different<00:03:13.750> feel

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
get a long board totally different feel

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.260 
get a long board totally different feel
it<00:03:14.290> helps<00:03:15.010> for<00:03:15.220> all<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.520> slide<00:03:15.760> techniques

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
it helps for all the slide techniques

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.750 
it helps for all the slide techniques
and<00:03:16.570> for<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.590> Bigfoots<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.490> younger

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
and for the Bigfoots of the younger

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.370 
and for the Bigfoots of the younger
generation<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.880> we<00:03:22.570> have<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.720> couple<00:03:23.050> of<00:03:23.260> new

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
generation so we have a couple of new

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.420 
generation so we have a couple of new
features<00:03:23.620> on<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.160> 9000<00:03:25.060> pedal<00:03:26.430> the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
features on the 9000 pedal the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.800
