taking that point five off from his

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.790 
taking that point five off from his
rating<00:03:11.120> simply<00:03:11.810> because<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:12.080> his<00:03:12.350> weak<00:03:12.560> foot

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
rating simply because of his weak foot

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.340 
rating simply because of his weak foot
and<00:03:12.980> because<00:03:13.490> of<00:03:13.640> his<00:03:13.760> incredibly<00:03:14.630> high<00:03:14.990> price

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
and because of his incredibly high price

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.080 
and because of his incredibly high price
he's<00:03:16.100> probably<00:03:16.340> one<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.850> costliest

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
he's probably one of the costliest

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.090 
he's probably one of the costliest
players<00:03:17.600> you'll<00:03:17.810> ever<00:03:18.110> see<00:03:18.410> he's<00:03:18.650> like<00:03:18.860> three

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.800 
players you'll ever see he's like three
times<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.430> price<00:03:19.460> of<00:03:19.760> Ronaldo<00:03:20.120> that's<00:03:20.330> quite

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
times the price of Ronaldo that's quite

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.240 
times the price of Ronaldo that's quite
a<00:03:20.840> lot<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:21.380> I<00:03:21.440> think<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:21.770> you'll<00:03:21.860> be<00:03:21.980> better<00:03:22.130> off

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
a lot so I think so you'll be better off
