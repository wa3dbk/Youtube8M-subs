far as the emotion of this particular
green<00:01:58.649> goes<00:01:59.009> how<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.969> keep<00:02:00.210> them<00:02:00.479> writing

green goes how do you keep them writing
the<00:02:01.110> way<00:02:01.229> instead<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.680> getting<00:02:01.740> engulfed<00:02:02.310> by

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the way instead of getting engulfed by

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.749 
the way instead of getting engulfed by
oh<00:02:02.540> it's<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.780> difficult<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.130> try<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> keep

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
oh it's so difficult we we try to keep

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.609 
oh it's so difficult we we try to keep
them<00:02:05.939> sequestered<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.750> our<00:02:06.990> building<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:07.439> much

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
them sequestered in our building as much

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.600 
them sequestered in our building as much
as<00:02:07.799> possible<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.550> studying<00:02:09.090> fill

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
as possible and studying fill

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.810 
as possible and studying fill
and<00:02:09.759> having<00:02:10.030> extra<00:02:10.360> meetings<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:11.020> etc<00:02:11.580> but<00:02:12.580> I

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
and having extra meetings and etc but I

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.210 
and having extra meetings and etc but I
mean<00:02:13.290> if<00:02:14.290> they<00:02:14.470> stopped<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.800> get<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.950> milkshake

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
mean if they stopped to get a milkshake

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.760 
mean if they stopped to get a milkshake
it's<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.150> game<00:02:16.360> if<00:02:16.630> they<00:02:16.900> go<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.500> mail<00:02:17.740> a

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
it's the game if they go to mail a

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.710 
it's the game if they go to mail a
letter<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.160> guess<00:02:18.580> it's<00:02:18.760> just<00:02:18.820> email<00:02:19.210> now<00:02:19.420> but

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
letter I guess it's just email now but

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.890 
letter I guess it's just email now but
that's<00:02:20.170> okay<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.800> tad<00:02:20.980> example<00:02:21.480> if<00:02:22.480> they<00:02:22.660> go<00:02:22.840> to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
that's okay a tad example if they go to

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.780 
that's okay a tad example if they go to
their<00:02:23.050> class<00:02:23.290> they're<00:02:23.710> asked<00:02:24.310> them<00:02:24.460> there's

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
their class they're asked them there's

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.280 
their class they're asked them there's
no<00:02:25.000> way<00:02:25.180> around<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:27.390> we<00:02:28.390> try<00:02:28.870> just<00:02:28.900> to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
no way around it and so we try just to

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.770 
no way around it and so we try just to
have<00:02:29.440> them<00:02:29.650> trust<00:02:30.610> us<00:02:30.820> as<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.330> source<00:02:31.570> of

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
have them trust us as the source of

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.550 
have them trust us as the source of
what's<00:02:31.960> going<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.170> help<00:02:32.230> them<00:02:32.410> be<00:02:32.530> successful

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
what's going to help them be successful

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.620 
what's going to help them be successful
rather<00:02:33.310> than<00:02:33.490> listen<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.850> what<00:02:34.450> other<00:02:34.570> people

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
rather than listen to what other people

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.750 
rather than listen to what other people
have<00:02:34.960> to<00:02:35.050> say<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.770> that<00:02:35.800> concern<00:02:36.250> just<00:02:36.520> as<00:02:36.610> far

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
have to say is that concern just as far

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.640 
have to say is that concern just as far
as<00:02:36.880> Joe<00:02:37.090> get<00:02:37.300> too<00:02:37.420> hyped<00:02:37.630> up<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.140> make

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
as Joe get too hyped up and make

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.530 
as Joe get too hyped up and make
mistakes<00:02:38.950> because<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.459> think<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.270> just

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
mistakes because I I think so just

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.870 
mistakes because I I think so just
because<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.650> many<00:02:41.740> people<00:02:42.100> care<00:02:42.310> about<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.700> and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
because so many people care about it and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.230 
because so many people care about it and
they<00:02:42.970> can't<00:02:43.030> get<00:02:43.420> around<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.940> we<00:02:45.940> find

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
they can't get around it and we find

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.729 
they can't get around it and we find
players<00:02:46.510> taking<00:02:46.900> naps<00:02:47.110> here<00:02:47.350> in<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.560> building

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
players taking naps here in the building

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.290 
players taking naps here in the building
and<00:02:48.100> staying<00:02:48.340> here<00:02:48.550> longer<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:48.910> mean<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.239> is

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
and staying here longer I mean this is

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.090 
and staying here longer I mean this is
sanctuary<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:50.140> there's<00:02:50.500> some<00:02:50.770> degree<00:02:51.070> of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
sanctuary and there's some degree of

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.970 
sanctuary and there's some degree of
normalcy<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.870> not<00:02:53.050> just<00:02:53.110> another<00:02:53.709> game

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
normalcy of it's not just another game

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.520 
normalcy of it's not just another game
because<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.640> rivalry<00:02:55.090> but<00:02:55.300> their<00:02:55.900> routine

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
because of the rivalry but their routine

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.380 
because of the rivalry but their routine
as<00:02:56.739> normal<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:57.610> they'd<00:02:57.760> rather<00:02:57.940> be<00:02:58.180> here

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
as normal and so they'd rather be here

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.090 
as normal and so they'd rather be here
when<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.810> outside<00:02:59.140> world<00:02:59.350> doesn't<00:02:59.830> feed<00:02:59.980> it

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
when the outside world doesn't feed it

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.130 
when the outside world doesn't feed it
as<00:03:00.220> normal<00:03:00.570> how<00:03:01.570> many<00:03:01.750> times<00:03:01.930> have<00:03:02.110> you

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
as normal how many times have you

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.650 
that is obviously if you got put a
finger<00:03:15.700> on<00:03:15.850> that's<00:03:16.060> what's<00:03:16.269> that's<00:03:16.510> what's

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
finger on that's what's that's what's

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.310 
finger on that's what's that's what's
changing<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.320> outcome<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:20.170> pretty

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
changing the outcome and it's pretty

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.250 
changing the outcome and it's pretty
easy<00:03:20.560> when<00:03:20.890> we're<00:03:21.100> even<00:03:22.000> or<00:03:22.150> +1<00:03:22.510> we<00:03:22.810> win<00:03:23.019> if

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
easy when we're even or +1 we win if

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.410 
easy when we're even or +1 we win if
we're<00:03:23.500> in<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:24.160> negative<00:03:24.400> category<00:03:25.030> we<00:03:25.209> don't

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
we're in a negative category we don't

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.060 
we're in a negative category we don't
and<00:03:25.630> there<00:03:26.320> are<00:03:26.410> other<00:03:26.470> contributing<00:03:27.040> factors

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
and there are other contributing factors

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.920 
and there are other contributing factors
but<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:27.700> credit<00:03:28.030> Utah<00:03:28.299> for<00:03:28.510> playing<00:03:28.720> well<00:03:28.900> in

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
but I credit Utah for playing well in

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.920 
but I credit Utah for playing well in
creating<00:03:29.440> turnovers<00:03:30.239> but<00:03:31.239> if<00:03:31.360> you<00:03:31.480> had<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.750> say

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
creating turnovers but if you had to say

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.960 
creating turnovers but if you had to say
what's<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.200> glaring<00:03:32.680> thing<00:03:32.910> but<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:33.940> think

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
what's the glaring thing but I think

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.789 
what's the glaring thing but I think
that's<00:03:34.330> for<00:03:34.600> any<00:03:34.750> game<00:03:35.320> that<00:03:35.350> has<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.590> lot

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
that's for any game that has a lot

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.310 
that's for any game that has a lot
riding<00:03:35.830> on<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.600> you<00:03:37.600> have<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.870> be<00:03:37.989> able<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.230> be

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
riding on it you have to be able to be

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.070 
riding on it you have to be able to be
mentally<00:03:38.500> tough<00:03:38.769> handled<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.459> motion<00:03:40.299> and<00:03:40.510> the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
mentally tough handled a motion and the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.810 
mentally tough handled a motion and the
execution<00:03:41.350> sound<00:03:41.860> hold<00:03:42.130> on<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.400> ball<00:03:42.580> and

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
execution sound hold on the ball and

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.910 
execution sound hold on the ball and
these<00:03:43.540> kind<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:43.810> games<00:03:43.959> six<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.560> eight<00:03:44.680> go

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
these kind of games six of the eight go

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.340 
these kind of games six of the eight go
down<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.250> last<00:03:45.430> play<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:47.110> ones<00:03:47.290> that

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
down to the last play the ones that

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.680 
down to the last play the ones that
don't<00:03:47.620> usually<00:03:47.799> mean<00:03:48.160> there's<00:03:48.430> maybe<00:03:49.209> 13

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
don't usually mean there's maybe 13

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.320 
don't usually mean there's maybe 13
turnovers<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.290> two<00:03:50.380> games<00:03:50.620> which<00:03:51.610> that's

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
turnovers and two games which that's

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.080 
turnovers and two games which that's
hard<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.810> play<00:03:53.080> well<00:03:53.260> when<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.530> happens

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
hard to play well when that happens

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.699 
hard to play well when that happens
national<00:03:55.090> teams<00:03:55.299> have<00:03:55.450> made<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.870> big<00:03:56.110> impact<00:03:56.260> as

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
national teams have made a big impact as

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.800 
national teams have made a big impact as
yeah<00:03:56.890> that's<00:03:57.519> that's<00:03:57.730> that's<00:03:58.090> number<00:03:58.450> two<00:03:58.600> on

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
yeah that's that's that's number two on

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.870 
yeah that's that's that's number two on
that<00:03:59.170> would<00:03:59.320> be<00:03:59.470> field<00:03:59.860> position<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.400> next<00:04:00.730> to

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
that would be field position is next to

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.060 
that would be field position is next to
so<00:04:01.030> if<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.180> were<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.360> say<00:04:01.500> not<00:04:02.500> just<00:04:02.769> in<00:04:02.950> this

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
so if I were to say not just in this

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.610 
so if I were to say not just in this
particular<00:04:03.280> game<00:04:03.820> but<00:04:04.150> any<00:04:05.140> game<00:04:05.440> where

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
particular game but any game where

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.340 
particular game but any game where
there's<00:04:05.769> two<00:04:06.030> quality<00:04:07.030> or<00:04:07.209> opponents<00:04:08.049> are

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
there's two quality or opponents are

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.199 
there's two quality or opponents are
relatively<00:04:08.769> evenly<00:04:09.160> matched<00:04:09.370> opponents<00:04:10.030> man

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
relatively evenly matched opponents man

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.880 
relatively evenly matched opponents man
turnovers<00:04:10.750> in<00:04:10.840> field<00:04:11.049> position<00:04:11.440> matter<00:04:11.620> and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
turnovers in field position matter and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.010 
turnovers in field position matter and
that's<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.430> same<00:04:12.610> in<00:04:12.730> ours<00:04:12.880> coach

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
that's the same in ours coach

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.110 
that's the same in ours coach
you<00:04:14.560> look<00:04:14.770> at<00:04:14.920> utah's<00:04:15.250> offense<00:04:15.760> they<00:04:15.940> have<00:04:15.970> a

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
you look at utah's offense they have a

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.640 
you look at utah's offense they have a
mobile<00:04:16.330> quarterback<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.140> Travis<00:04:17.440> Wilson

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
mobile quarterback and Travis Wilson

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.710 
mobile quarterback and Travis Wilson
does<00:04:18.220> it<00:04:18.370> help<00:04:18.459> your<00:04:18.640> defense<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.270> be<00:04:19.300> able<00:04:19.630> to

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
does it help your defense to be able to

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.750 
does it help your defense to be able to
go<00:04:19.870> against<00:04:20.140> tasting<00:04:20.830> own<00:04:21.070> practice<00:04:21.550> to

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
go against tasting own practice to

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.030 
go against tasting own practice to
prepare<00:04:22.090> for<00:04:22.270> that<00:04:22.300> yeah<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:23.260> does<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.890> the

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
prepare for that yeah it does that the

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.710 
prepare for that yeah it does that the
offenses<00:04:24.550> aren't<00:04:24.790> identical<00:04:25.150> but<00:04:25.450> there<00:04:25.630> are

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
offenses aren't identical but there are

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.390 
offenses aren't identical but there are
some<00:04:25.990> similarities<00:04:26.440> and<00:04:26.860> tastesing<00:04:27.190> is<00:04:27.310> one

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
some similarities and tastesing is one

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.010 
some similarities and tastesing is one
of<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.550> fastest<00:04:27.970> players<00:04:28.210> on<00:04:28.450> our<00:04:28.480> team<00:04:28.600> and

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
of the fastest players on our team and

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.840 
of the fastest players on our team and
we<00:04:29.110> know<00:04:29.260> we<00:04:29.710> can't<00:04:29.950> catch<00:04:30.160> him<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.550> probably

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
we know we can't catch him and probably

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
we know we can't catch him and probably
won't<00:04:30.940> be<00:04:31.120> able<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.330> catch<00:04:31.510> Utah's

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
won't be able to catch Utah's

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.440 
won't be able to catch Utah's
quarterback<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:33.610> gives<00:04:33.760> us<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:34.030> great<00:04:34.150> point

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
quarterback so it gives us a great point

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.320 
quarterback so it gives us a great point
of<00:04:34.600> reference<00:04:34.810> in<00:04:35.710> practice<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.820> see<00:04:37.030> what<00:04:37.210> the

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
of reference in practice to see what the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.360 
of reference in practice to see what the
angles<00:04:37.630> need<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.900> look<00:04:38.050> like<00:04:38.230> etc<00:04:38.440> you've

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
angles need to look like etc you've

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.860 
angles need to look like etc you've
never<00:04:39.520> had<00:04:39.670> a<00:04:39.730> bye<00:04:39.970> week<00:04:40.000> leading<00:04:40.450> up<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.780> the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
never had a bye week leading up to the

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.270 
never had a bye week leading up to the
utah<00:04:41.110> game<00:04:41.140> can<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:41.530> talk<00:04:41.890> about<00:04:41.920> how<00:04:42.220> that

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
utah game can you talk about how that

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.100 
utah game can you talk about how that
might<00:04:42.850> help<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:43.240> emotion<00:04:43.660> wise<00:04:43.840> and

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
might help you emotion wise and

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.140 
might help you emotion wise and
otherwise<00:04:44.290> i<00:04:44.650> think<00:04:44.860> it's<00:04:45.010> if<00:04:45.550> i<00:04:45.730> were<00:04:45.850> to<00:04:45.970> say

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
otherwise i think it's if i were to say

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.940 
otherwise i think it's if i were to say
from<00:04:46.330> what<00:04:46.420> i<00:04:46.480> saw<00:04:46.720> today<00:04:46.750> it's<00:04:47.260> than<00:04:47.800> the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
from what i saw today it's than the

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.680 
from what i saw today it's than the
other<00:04:48.100> way<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:49.000> looks<00:04:49.270> like<00:04:49.330> they<00:04:49.660> were

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
other way and it looks like they were

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
prepared to play it yet but if I had to

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.760

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
right after Texas I don't think I said

right after Texas I don't think I said
that<00:05:02.890> last<00:05:03.070> week<00:05:03.220> but<00:05:03.520> just<00:05:03.730> after<00:05:04.000> Connor

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
that last week but just after Connor

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.060

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
going through it man it seems like a

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.980 
going through it man it seems like a
month<00:05:06.340> since<00:05:06.490> we<00:05:06.610> played<00:05:06.820> was<00:05:07.450> it<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.600> good<00:05:07.780> week

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
month since we played was it a good week

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.570 
month since we played was it a good week
for<00:05:08.020> certain<00:05:08.560> players<00:05:08.800> to<00:05:09.160> get<00:05:09.280> healthy

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
for certain players to get healthy

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.040 
for certain players to get healthy
however<00:05:10.060> we'll<00:05:10.480> see<00:05:10.660> um<00:05:10.900> that's<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:12.100> hope

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
however we'll see um that's the hope

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.660 
however we'll see um that's the hope
they<00:05:14.050> didn't<00:05:14.650> take<00:05:14.770> his<00:05:14.890> big<00:05:15.070> a<00:05:15.100> jump<00:05:15.370> as<00:05:15.580> I

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
they didn't take his big a jump as I

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.860 
they didn't take his big a jump as I
thought<00:05:15.850> they<00:05:16.090> would<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:16.300> looking<00:05:16.660> at<00:05:16.780> him

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
thought they would and looking at him

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.780 
thought they would and looking at him
today<00:05:17.050> I<00:05:17.770> thought<00:05:18.280> they<00:05:18.460> would<00:05:18.580> have<00:05:18.670> been

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
today I thought they would have been

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.840 
today I thought they would have been
fresher<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:19.420> and<00:05:20.050> maybe<00:05:20.920> not<00:05:21.190> practicing<00:05:21.730> as

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
fresher and and maybe not practicing as

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.700 
fresher and and maybe not practicing as
much<00:05:22.030> or<00:05:22.360> not<00:05:22.420> having<00:05:22.780> a<00:05:22.840> game<00:05:23.050> had<00:05:23.590> the

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
much or not having a game had the

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.560 
much or not having a game had the
opposite<00:05:24.160> effect<00:05:24.250> I'm<00:05:24.820> not<00:05:25.000> worried<00:05:25.300> yet<00:05:25.450> in

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
opposite effect I'm not worried yet in

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.700 
opposite effect I'm not worried yet in
terms<00:05:25.690> of<00:05:25.840> being<00:05:25.990> able<00:05:26.080> to<00:05:26.230> have<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.410> ready<00:05:26.650> by

was<00:06:20.110> 7<00:06:20.410> for<00:06:20.440> 7<00:06:20.650> or<00:06:20.980> 646<00:06:21.460> and<00:06:21.880> so<00:06:21.970> he<00:06:22.060> just<00:06:22.210> keeps

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
was 7 for 7 or 646 and so he just keeps

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.320 
was 7 for 7 or 646 and so he just keeps
rolling<00:06:22.690> along<00:06:22.930> which

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
rolling along which

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.240 
rolling along which
yeah<00:06:24.659> that<00:06:25.229> makes<00:06:25.650> a<00:06:25.800> huge<00:06:25.949> difference

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
yeah that makes a huge difference

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.070 
yeah that makes a huge difference
because<00:06:26.520> every<00:06:27.000> point<00:06:27.240> matters<00:06:27.750> especially

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
because every point matters especially

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.490 
because every point matters especially
in<00:06:28.470> this<00:06:28.560> game<00:06:28.800> now<00:06:29.569> this<00:06:30.569> game's<00:06:30.810> impact<00:06:31.289> on

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
recruiting is that overblown have you

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:34.879

some point a 28-7 we lost two weeks
especially<00:07:52.199> through<00:07:52.710> some<00:07:53.339> of<00:07:53.400> the<00:07:53.490> receivers

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:53.879 
especially through some of the receivers

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:55.490 
especially through some of the receivers
and<00:07:54.089> try<00:07:54.210> Anderson<00:07:54.719> how<00:07:54.990> do<00:07:55.050> you<00:07:55.139> feel<00:07:55.349> your

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.500 
and try Anderson how do you feel your

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.670 
and try Anderson how do you feel your
secondary<00:07:55.919> matches<00:07:56.279> up<00:07:57.199> well<00:07:58.199> I<00:07:58.319> think<00:07:58.379> I

00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 
secondary matches up well I think I

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.499

think<00:07:58.919> he's<00:07:59.069> faster<00:07:59.430> than<00:07:59.460> all<00:07:59.669> of<00:07:59.789> us<00:07:59.879> well

00:08:00.499 --> 00:08:00.509
