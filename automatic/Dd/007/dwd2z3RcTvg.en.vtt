00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
significantly bigger the platter here is

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.630 
significantly bigger the platter here is
actually<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> exact<00:00:40.800> same<00:00:40.980> size<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
actually the exact same size as the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
platter of a CD J the the resolution of

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.690 
platter of a CD J the the resolution of
the<00:00:46.170> display<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.739> inside<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.250> also<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the display on the inside is also the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.520 
the display on the inside is also the
same<00:00:47.910> resolution<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.750> see<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:48.960> me<00:00:49.230> on

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
same resolution is what you see on me on

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.970 
same resolution is what you see on me on
a<00:00:49.770> CD<00:00:50.160> J<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> 7-inch<00:00:52.079> platter<00:00:52.379> right

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
a CD J so this is a 7-inch platter right

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.470 
a CD J so this is a 7-inch platter right
now<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.250> lights<00:00:53.430> up<00:00:53.640> blue<00:00:53.850> because<00:00:54.360> I'm

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
now it lights up blue because I'm

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.900 
now it lights up blue because I'm
controlling<00:00:54.840> deck<00:00:55.140> 1<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.920> control<00:00:56.340> deck<00:00:56.550> 3

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
controlling deck 1 if I control deck 3

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.180 
controlling deck 1 if I control deck 3
you<00:00:57.149> see<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.449> lights<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:57.899> white<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.739> know<00:00:58.890> so

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
you see it lights up white you know so

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.439 
you see it lights up white you know so
you<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.640> advantage<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.270> well

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
you have that advantage as well

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.630 
you have that advantage as well
obviously<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.739> are<00:01:01.800> noticeable<00:01:02.250> right<00:01:02.460> here

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
obviously they are noticeable right here

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.460 
obviously they are noticeable right here
are<00:01:02.730> these<00:01:02.879> paths<00:01:03.300> these<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.719> not<00:01:03.870> multicolor

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
are these paths these are not multicolor

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.910 
are these paths these are not multicolor
paths<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.670> they<00:01:05.850> correspond<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.380> hot<00:01:07.590> cues

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
paths so they correspond to the hot cues

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.590 
paths so they correspond to the hot cues
on<00:01:08.070> my<00:01:08.220> screen<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.970> see<00:01:09.180> right<00:01:09.330> there<00:01:09.390> on

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
on my screen you can see right there on

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
looking at the mixer you have sound

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.030 
looking at the mixer you have sound
color<00:01:30.270> effects<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.619> DJ

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.310 
color effects just like you have on a DJ
m<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.579> your<00:01:32.850> sound<00:01:33.119> Cal<00:01:33.270> effects<00:01:33.689> your<00:01:33.900> echo

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
m so your sound Cal effects your echo

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.310 
m so your sound Cal effects your echo

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.370 
4 channels 1 2 3 &amp; 4 you also have them
on<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.899> microphone<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.909> master<00:01:45.420> now

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
on the microphone and on the master now

on the microphone and on the master now
over<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.040> section<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.670> new

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
over here in this section you have a new

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.899 
over here in this section you have a new
feature<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.630> oscillator<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:50.130> let<00:01:50.640> me<00:01:50.729> bring

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
feature the oscillator so let me bring

00:01:50.909 --> 00:02:06.410 
feature the oscillator so let me bring
up<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:52.439> volume<00:01:52.890> right<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.100> my

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.969 

so<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.450> forwarded<00:02:07.870> -<00:02:08.110> types<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.800> oscillators

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
so I forwarded - types of oscillators

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.470 
so I forwarded - types of oscillators
noise<00:02:09.789> symbol<00:02:10.509> siren<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.350> horn<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:13.030> see<00:02:13.240> over

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
noise symbol siren and horn you see over

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.080 
noise symbol siren and horn you see over
here<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.750> says<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.260> B<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.070> this<00:02:15.520> actually<00:02:15.970> has

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
here it says a B so this actually has

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.180 
here it says a B so this actually has
two<00:02:16.330> sound<00:02:16.600> cards<00:02:16.870> built-in<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:17.800> could<00:02:18.070> do

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
two sound cards built-in so you could do

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.270 
two sound cards built-in so you could do
a<00:02:18.220> seamless<00:02:18.850> transition<00:02:18.880> from<00:02:19.570> one<00:02:19.810> laptop<00:02:20.280> to
