purplish tryna color which I love and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.230 
purplish tryna color which I love and
those<00:01:42.990> are<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.490> strand<00:01:44.490> pearls<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
those are just strand pearls in the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.910 
those are just strand pearls in the
center<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> holes<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.829> I

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
center that have the holes there but I

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.889 
center that have the holes there but I
did<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.640> anything<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.149> glued<00:01:48.570> them<00:01:48.720> in

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
did not so anything I just glued them in

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.469 
did not so anything I just glued them in
and<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:50.009> think<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.490> piece<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.060> made<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and I think that piece I made in the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.690 
and I think that piece I made in the
back<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> strand<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.040> pearls<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.490> made<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
back of the strand of pearls I made a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.209 
back of the strand of pearls I made a
little<00:01:53.970> too<00:01:54.180> short<00:01:54.659> but<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.740> okay<00:01:56.189> because

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
little too short but it's okay because

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.580 
little too short but it's okay because
it<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.700> gives<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.119> little<00:01:57.149> hint<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.780> /<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it just gives a little hint of / on the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.950 
it just gives a little hint of / on the
side

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
side

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.460 
side
