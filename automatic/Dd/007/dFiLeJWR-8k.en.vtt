right<00:01:59.009> next<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.640> treatment<00:01:59.909> we're<00:02:00.000> gonna<00:02:00.090> be

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
right next to treatment we're gonna be

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.450 
right next to treatment we're gonna be
moving<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.259> lamb<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.009> slaughter<00:02:02.219> and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
moving on to is lamb to slaughter and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.950 
moving on to is lamb to slaughter and
that's<00:02:02.579> where<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:02.909> had<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.119> incapacitate<00:02:03.479> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that's where we had to incapacitate a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.450 
that's where we had to incapacitate a
survivor<00:02:04.590> when<00:02:04.920> you're<00:02:05.070> playing<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.430> he

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
survivor when you're playing is he

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.020 
survivor when you're playing is he
infected<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:06.240> found<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:07.250> it's<00:02:08.250> really<00:02:08.459> this

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
infected I found that it's really this

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.219 
infected I found that it's really this
one's<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.330> little<00:02:09.450> bit<00:02:09.660> more<00:02:09.810> up<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.989> chance

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
one's a little bit more up to chance

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.440 
one's a little bit more up to chance
just<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.739> last<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.520> found<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
just like the last one so I found it

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.940 
just like the last one so I found it
easier<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.410> uh

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
easier to just uh

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.130 
easier to just uh
load<00:02:14.129> up<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.340> second<00:02:14.700> profile<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.540> have

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
load up a second profile and just have

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.990 
load up a second profile and just have
my<00:02:16.440> second<00:02:16.800> controller<00:02:17.129> sitting<00:02:17.489> there<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.849> I

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
my second controller sitting there so I

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.930 
my second controller sitting there so I
am<00:02:18.300> gonna<00:02:18.420> have<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.660> split<00:02:19.170> screen<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.940> but

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
am gonna have a split screen and but

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.309 
am gonna have a split screen and but
there<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.269> no<00:02:21.480> one<00:02:21.629> actually<00:02:21.840> playing<00:02:22.200> the

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
there is no one actually playing the

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.960 
there is no one actually playing the
second<00:02:22.620> controller<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.129> I'll<00:02:23.489> explain<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.940> a

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
second controller and I'll explain it a

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.910 
second controller and I'll explain it a
little<00:02:24.000> bit<00:02:24.300> more<00:02:24.510> when<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.230> time<00:02:25.410> comes<00:02:25.680> why

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
little bit more when the time comes why

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.240 
little bit more when the time comes why
I<00:02:25.950> chose<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.400> do<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.650> keep<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.769> mind<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.099> if

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
I chose to do that keep in mind that if

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.430 
I chose to do that keep in mind that if
you<00:02:29.370> don't<00:02:29.610> have<00:02:29.879> a<00:02:29.940> second<00:02:30.510> controller<00:02:30.989> or<00:02:31.319> if

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
you don't have a second controller or if

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.470 
you don't have a second controller or if
you're<00:02:31.620> somehow<00:02:31.920> too<00:02:32.069> lazy<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.880> create<00:02:33.450> a

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
you're somehow too lazy to create a

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.720 
you're somehow too lazy to create a
second<00:02:34.170> account<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.860> can't<00:02:35.099> do<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.459> with<00:02:35.640> a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
second account you can't do this with a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.160 
second account you can't do this with a
friend<00:02:35.970> online<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.540> don't<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.019> do<00:02:37.140> it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
friend online you don't have to do it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.740

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
much damage just to make the achievement

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.830 
much damage just to make the achievement
go<00:02:49.860> by<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.040> little<00:02:50.430> bit<00:02:50.519> easier<00:02:50.880> make<00:02:51.569> sure<00:02:51.690> that

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840

you have entered the safe room first or

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.270 
you have entered the safe room first or
the<00:02:54.810> achievement<00:02:55.290> will<00:02:55.410> not<00:02:55.590> unlock<00:02:55.890> as<00:02:56.130> the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the achievement will not unlock as the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.030 
the achievement will not unlock as the
achievement<00:02:56.700> wants<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.780> enter<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.410> leave
