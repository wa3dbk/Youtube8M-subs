to Nintendo's super FX chip which was

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.060

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
right on the game cartridge itself thus

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.529 
right on the game cartridge itself thus
making<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.140> game<00:01:11.170> much<00:01:11.590> more<00:01:11.860> expensive

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
making the game much more expensive

making the game much more expensive
Nintendo<00:01:13.539> of<00:01:13.660> course<00:01:13.929> had<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.289> exact<00:01:14.710> same

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
Nintendo of course had the exact same

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.219 
Nintendo of course had the exact same
problem<00:01:15.460> with<00:01:15.640> their<00:01:15.789> super<00:01:16.179> FX<00:01:16.450> chip<00:01:16.570> but

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
problem with their super FX chip but

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.440 
problem with their super FX chip but
where<00:01:17.560> Sega<00:01:17.890> only<00:01:18.310> released<00:01:18.640> virtual<00:01:19.179> racing

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450

wooden<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.170> on<00:01:20.350> chip<00:01:20.619> Nintendo<00:01:21.490> released<00:01:21.850> a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
wooden and on chip Nintendo released a

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.510 
wooden and on chip Nintendo released a
fair<00:01:22.330> amount<00:01:22.450> of<00:01:22.750> games<00:01:23.020> with<00:01:23.380> super<00:01:23.860> FX<00:01:24.160> and

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
fair amount of games with super FX and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.880 
fair amount of games with super FX and
later<00:01:25.060> on<00:01:25.270> super<00:01:25.690> FX<00:01:25.959> to<00:01:26.289> chip

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
later on super FX to chip

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.490 
later on super FX to chip
but<00:01:27.550> then<00:01:27.670> again<00:01:27.789> Sega<00:01:28.420> was<00:01:28.569> also<00:01:28.929> working<00:01:29.200> on

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
but then again Sega was also working on

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.999 
but then again Sega was also working on
the<00:01:29.560> 32x<00:01:30.340> add-on<00:01:30.819> which<00:01:31.810> had<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.410> pretty<00:01:32.709> fast

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
the 32x add-on which had the pretty fast

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.070 
the 32x add-on which had the pretty fast

video accelerator Hardware on board

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.809 
video accelerator Hardware on board
which<00:01:35.679> meant<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.039> games<00:01:36.250> could<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.729> be

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
which meant the games could to be

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.120 
which meant the games could to be
cheaper<00:01:37.209> once<00:01:37.539> you<00:01:37.660> had<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.020> 32x<00:01:38.560> Hardware

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
cheaper once you had the 32x Hardware

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.490 
cheaper once you had the 32x Hardware
another<00:01:39.970> difference<00:01:40.450> between<00:01:40.569> the<00:01:40.899> super<00:01:41.349> FX

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
and sv b chip was that the SGP chip was

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:47.279 
and sv b chip was that the SGP chip was
only<00:01:45.220> there<00:01:45.429> for<00:01:45.459> polygons<00:01:46.270> calculations<00:01:47.050> and

amazing although the game didn't age
very<00:03:28.680> well<00:03:28.799> but<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.760> holds<00:03:29.910> true<00:03:30.239> for<00:03:30.569> all

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
so let's see what we have here first up

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.699 
so let's see what we have here first up
is<00:03:44.489> hard<00:03:44.760> driving<00:03:45.269> also<00:03:46.019> an<00:03:46.079> arcade<00:03:46.380> port

released for the Mega Drive in 1990 so

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.220 
released for the Mega Drive in 1990 so
it's<00:03:50.069> a<00:03:50.220> very<00:03:50.489> early<00:03:50.790> release<00:03:51.480> for<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.840> system

it's a very early release for the system

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
but the poor Mega Drive has to do all

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.140 
but the poor Mega Drive has to do all
the<00:04:00.419> rendering<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.109> it<00:04:01.410> shows<00:04:01.849> the<00:04:02.849> framerate

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
the rendering and it shows the framerate

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.110 
the rendering and it shows the framerate
is<00:04:03.599> horrible<00:04:04.260> we<00:04:04.709> get<00:04:04.889> around<00:04:05.099> 5<00:04:05.519> frames<00:04:05.880> per

is horrible we get around 5 frames per

whole game is barely playable actually

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.770 
whole game is barely playable actually
because<00:04:11.549> of<00:04:11.669> the<00:04:11.730> poor<00:04:12.000> controls<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.720> of

because of the poor controls and of

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.619 
because of the poor controls and of
course<00:04:13.049> due<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.889> low<00:04:14.010> framerate<00:04:14.450> if<00:04:15.450> you

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
course due to the low framerate if you

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.330 
course due to the low framerate if you
compare<00:04:15.989> that<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.349> arcade<00:04:16.829> version<00:04:16.859> of

compare that to the arcade version of
hard<00:04:17.549> drive<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.570> see<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.139> is<00:04:19.169> a

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
hard drive and you see that it is a

pretty<00:04:19.680> poor<00:04:20.039> port<00:04:20.489> but<00:04:21.359> then<00:04:21.510> again<00:04:21.660> the

the<00:06:00.090> frame<00:06:00.330> rates<00:06:00.720> dropped<00:06:01.050> considerable

whereas Virtua racing never slows down I
really<00:06:06.030> wonder<00:06:06.360> how<00:06:06.390> much<00:06:06.660> more<00:06:06.930> cool<00:06:07.200> games

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
really wonder how much more cool games

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.380 
really wonder how much more cool games
could<00:06:08.130> have<00:06:08.280> been<00:06:08.430> made<00:06:08.640> with<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:08.880> SPG

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
could have been made with the SPG

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.630 
could have been made with the SPG
opinions<00:06:09.930> but<00:06:10.740> I<00:06:10.770> guess<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.160> high<00:06:11.310> price

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
opinions but I guess the high price

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.910 
opinions but I guess the high price
really<00:06:11.940> killed<00:06:12.270> it<00:06:12.390> off<00:06:12.570> that's<00:06:13.170> just<00:06:13.530> a<00:06:13.620> shame

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
really killed it off that's just a shame

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.250 
really killed it off that's just a shame
because<00:06:14.190> there<00:06:14.880> was<00:06:15.000> obviously<00:06:15.600> a<00:06:15.900> lot<00:06:16.200> of

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260

scaling<00:06:23.540> Sega<00:06:24.540> was<00:06:24.690> always<00:06:25.050> trying<00:06:25.290> new

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
scaling Sega was always trying new

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.470 
scaling Sega was always trying new
things<00:06:25.590> and<00:06:26.100> that<00:06:26.460> made<00:06:26.730> him<00:06:26.880> an<00:06:27.000> innovative

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480

but<00:06:29.050> Sega<00:06:29.289> also<00:06:29.620> was<00:06:30.009> very<00:06:30.250> bad<00:06:30.580> at<00:06:30.759> supporting

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
but Sega also was very bad at supporting

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.480 
but Sega also was very bad at supporting
the<00:06:31.479> things<00:06:31.750> they<00:06:31.960> built<00:06:32.199> under<00:06:32.770> scaring<00:06:33.250> away

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
the things they built under scaring away
