00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.510
 Greetings from the minuszone we 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.400
 make fried chicken of it today only 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.470
 following things we have once 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.700
 our spices and sometimes here 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.670
 cumin basil some nutmeg 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.920
 paprika powder and a clove of garlic 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.980
 then we only have baking powder then 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.160
 we have that at fannie mae wiener 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.540
 of course, milk parsley salt 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.510
 and pepper as the first cinema so many 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.199
 this has to be cut into small pieces 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.199
 become 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:10.840
 neumann of all those we roll off and the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:12.670
 piece also acts again if we the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.080
 you have to have a lot of club lately 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 also peel off the skin it looks very like this 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.680
 appearance 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.000
 for that we take a piece and 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.790
 Usually you can just skin like that 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.680
 you should still pull off with the fingers 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.600
 somewhere a little bit fat in it 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.160
 have as well as here then you can do that too 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.670
 even with a knife once briefly 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.670
 cut off 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.110
 Today we continue with one 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:02:05.530
 bowl and we make it under family 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:02:05.530
 into and not part of our culture and 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.050
 our baking powder is still too 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.780
 what comes next is our garlic 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.680
 but have to chop finely 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.270
 Now I have the garlic fast 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.270
 hacked now he also comes with it 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.000
 stir everything well 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.090
 we have to get our petri on, too 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.090
 The first time it is finely chopped 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:29.739
 so now is a hacked you come 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:35.830
 a bowl and then a lot of milk 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:38.250
 to and part of our pannier 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.250
 mixture 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.290
 is the whole then a creamy 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:24.480
 consistency reaches something like a thin one 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:25.980
 pancake dough now we come slowly 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.650
 for the big finale 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:36.410
 now we take ours 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:36.410
 chickens once divided the dough and 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:44.000
 then in our our fannie mae 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.580
 then I have ours here 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.390
 deep fryers it to 170 degrees 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.390
 heated 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.000
 Here we cautiously give ours 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.000
 children share purely 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.819
 of course you can have more than a purely 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:13.449
 but I would like to do this for the first time 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:16.419
 show about ten minutes 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:20.169
 so good now from minutes to 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:22.039
 now it has so nice golden brown color 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.949
 and now it's ready to eat 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.800
 So the first piece is ready 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:30.460
 that ever before and to see if that 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.400
 already through 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.770
 that should not be through and the 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.289
 Judgments are a little too big 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.280
 you have to change the temperature of the 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.099
 friedrich down a bit 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.199
 regulate to about 160 degrees and then 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.409
 the whole thing a bit longer in it 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.409
 to let 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.430
 but that certainly looks like that 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.479
 I'll do a few more then 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.979
 right that more 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.979
 and then that means good appetite
