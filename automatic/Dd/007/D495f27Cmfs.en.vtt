00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.029
 hello to all my fellow citizens must simply take to defragment his 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:18.500
 hard drive it's the thought that one has to mobilize percent once per cent 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.399
 per month for those who do not use too much a little more often for what is 

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:24.400
 who download a lot who use a lot of their health 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.630
 computer 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.060
 so the goal everyone has passion fundamentals it's really 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:32.760
 when you imagine your office in office 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.760
 quoting marca on which we have all our papers 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.800
 regarding the record is on the right as on the left so sacred of the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.850
 fractions of 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.190
 the record and what makes that when you go to search so this 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.810
 folder in there usually we remember all the others to find it 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.770
 what means me 7 by angers so the goal defragmentation 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.010
 it is precisely to reorganize all this ensemble 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.800
 so for this match you go to the start menu 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.050
 all the programs 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.190
 accessories here 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.610
 and system tools 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.770
 so here steel below you have a disk defragmenter 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.730
 so there for this one we use his engine to discuss or a dose for 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.450
 to know who is already very good 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.310
 you go the disk defragmenter 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.250
 1 who are much more successful have died in less than 28 years of hindsight the idea 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.380
 to find things a lot better especially francs exchanges as per 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.840
 example 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.460
 so to assemble use this one so figured out that this from amount 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.460
 of the isq 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.830
 so here and there an iron dome window disk defragmentation 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.980
 so do not choose sight 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.510
 the disk to defragment as a rule is the disk 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.970
 so the routine to give a structure could very well do it 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.600
 for something else 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.310
 a click on its clients suite we just have to click on defragment 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.870
 so there the operation 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.100
 to start 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.190
 so there for example you have the legend play the fragmented files 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.980
 and we see hiring 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.960
 the open spaces every time the goal here is really the worst that the evil 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.869
 all this is that it is 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.289
 homogeneous 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.529
 so it takes it can take fifteen minutes to walk me in force 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.849
 three hours her husband have little time other hard drives 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.409
 so here's a little bit for less stressful defragmentation 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.409
 yet do it too I will stop 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:27.359
 so we'll see but what is the only one to have demanded that the system 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.929
 leads failing is ranked among these defragmentation more than 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:31.949
 the register 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.979
 and you have other software otherwise very very well passed 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:38.049
 this one the disc of the clothes 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.659
 so that gives you the Remoise in model version to follow 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.480
 these same principles so you select there I want selected six 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.649
 then the fatal ones 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.819
 so the world already graphically it's a little better 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.649
 and then to laval so in fact he wanted a percentage of the documentation of the 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:58.669
 of the system 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.979
 basically the last you have% 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.749
 that you have gained in percentage so this interesting relationships so there one 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:09.479
 sees in them the work done the total files it is displayed and 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:13.889
 fragmented my heart is at 96 4 by increasing as you go 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.950
 benefit from the ps fragments - the two young boys 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:21.609
 on my pc I have a lot of fragment when I should miss you 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.289
 relatively often 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:25.839
 when we see the pursuit at mans is very soon on 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.849
 springs for computer years like hi to all
