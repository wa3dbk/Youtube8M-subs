00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:08.519
 Welcome to my first therapy 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:12.570
 quicktipp my name is michael in 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.340
 I would like to show this quicktipp how 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.250
 one quickly and easily under 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.000
 exposed photos or dark 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.519
 areas of a photo of one 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.890
 can undergo exposure correction 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:32.309
 to do this, we'll switch these two up here 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.649
 triangles one once for the bright 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.500
 areas and once for the dark ones 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.059
 areas become the dark areas 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.210
 now shown here in white 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.309
 now we can light up here 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.030
 that either adjust automatically 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.879
 let or first the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.149
 Make exposure compensation and that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.770
 we do not do anything else now 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.620
 we take the slider with the left 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.769
 maustaste hold it and pull to 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.600
 him to the right so the white ones 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.890
 areas within the picture 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.710
 disappear 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.840
 you have to be careful that you have it 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.729
 otherwise the picture will not be exaggerated 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.009
 bad and overexposed effect 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.860
 I would suggest we do that 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.070
 at 125 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.619
 Now we switch our two triangles 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.770
 out again and you can see clearly here 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.240
 in the shadow areas also here in 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.799
 these areas have the picture 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.780
 clearly brightened I'll show it yet 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.710
 once we set it to neutral 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.100
 here shadow area and so on 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.790
 keep it sharp at 3 corners and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.450
 pull and pull the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:59.310
 Exposure compensation the slider 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:04.110
 slide to the right until these ways 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:08.479
 areas change so much that we 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.479
 Satisfied with the result
