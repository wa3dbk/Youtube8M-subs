00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hi I'm going to demonstrate how you can

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.680 
hi I'm going to demonstrate how you can
make<00:00:03.270> your<00:00:03.480> own<00:00:03.510> teletext<00:00:04.200> service<00:00:04.490> using<00:00:05.490> a

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
make your own teletext service using a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.160 
make your own teletext service using a
Raspberry<00:00:06.690> Pi<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:07.880> v-bit<00:00:08.880> pi<00:00:09.240> teletext

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
Raspberry Pi and v-bit pi teletext

Raspberry Pi and v-bit pi teletext
inserter<00:00:11.599> first<00:00:12.599> thing<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.870> do<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.290> make<00:00:14.160> some

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
pages so I go to my laptop and I've got

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.310 
pages so I go to my laptop and I've got
some<00:00:20.580> scripts<00:00:21.119> here<00:00:22.070> and<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:25.050> first<00:00:25.260> thing

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
some scripts here and the first thing

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.009 
some scripts here and the first thing
I'm<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.240> run<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.420> news<00:00:27.689> reader

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
I'm going to do is run the news reader

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:39.940 
I'm going to do is run the news reader
which<00:00:28.789> grabs<00:00:29.789> pages<00:00:30.689> from<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> BBC

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.720 

what<00:00:40.460> it's<00:00:40.610> doing<00:00:41.090> now<00:00:41.120> is<00:00:41.650> it's<00:00:42.650> grabbing<00:00:43.430> all

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
what it's doing now is it's grabbing all

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.500 
what it's doing now is it's grabbing all
of<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:43.970> headlines<00:00:44.420> from<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:45.110> RSS<00:00:45.650> feed<00:00:45.680> and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
of the headlines from the RSS feed and

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.440 
of the headlines from the RSS feed and
copying<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.990> web<00:00:48.200> pages<00:00:49.090> so<00:00:50.090> that<00:00:50.240> they're

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
copying the web pages so that they're

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.490 
copying the web pages so that they're
all<00:00:50.630> stored<00:00:51.110> on<00:00:51.320> my<00:00:51.820> laptop<00:00:52.990> so<00:00:53.990> that's<00:00:54.170> all<00:00:54.350> of

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
all stored on my laptop so that's all of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.880 
all stored on my laptop so that's all of
those<00:00:54.620> pages<00:00:54.980> in<00:00:55.340> now<00:00:55.700> I<00:00:55.730> can<00:00:56.000> run<00:00:56.890> another

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
those pages in now I can run another

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.229 
those pages in now I can run another
process<00:00:58.460> which<00:00:59.290> will<00:01:00.610> extract<00:01:01.610> all<00:01:01.790> of<00:01:01.910> the

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
process which will extract all of the

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.540 
process which will extract all of the
information<00:01:03.050> out<00:01:03.200> of<00:01:03.230> those<00:01:03.410> web<00:01:03.770> pages<00:01:03.800> and

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
information out of those web pages and

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.120 
information out of those web pages and
turn<00:01:05.059> them<00:01:05.300> into<00:01:05.530> teletext<00:01:06.530> pages<00:01:08.860> so<00:01:09.860> while

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
turn them into teletext pages so while

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.130 
turn them into teletext pages so while
that's<00:01:10.280> busy<00:01:10.700> I'll<00:01:10.820> show<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:11.240> what<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.960> rest

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
that's busy I'll show you what the rest

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.340 
that's busy I'll show you what the rest
of<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.790> system<00:01:13.790> is<00:01:14.410> so<00:01:15.410> you<00:01:15.470> have<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:18.020> be<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.200> bit

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
of the system is so you have to be a bit

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.999 
of the system is so you have to be a bit
PI<00:01:18.680> here<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.910> videos<00:01:20.300> coming<00:01:20.630> in<00:01:20.869> it's<00:01:21.800> being

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
PI here the videos coming in it's being

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.980 
PI here the videos coming in it's being
processed<00:01:22.340> by<00:01:23.020> decoded<00:01:24.020> by<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.350> chip<00:01:24.710> it's

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
processed by decoded by that chip it's

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.350 
processed by decoded by that chip it's
being<00:01:26.990> really<00:01:27.500> really<00:01:27.920> videos<00:01:28.400> re-encoded<00:01:29.210> by

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
being really really videos re-encoded by

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.010 
being really really videos re-encoded by
that<00:01:29.570> chip<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:31.100> takes<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:32.149> teletext<00:01:32.600> feed

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
that chip and it takes the teletext feed

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.280 
that chip and it takes the teletext feed
from<00:01:33.320> that<00:01:33.680> FIFO<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:35.720> gets<00:01:35.960> sent<00:01:36.200> back

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
from that FIFO and that gets sent back

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.810 
from that FIFO and that gets sent back
out<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.759> TV<00:01:38.420> which<00:01:38.750> is<00:01:39.220> here<00:01:40.220> which<00:01:40.670> has

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
out to the TV which is here which has

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.200 
out to the TV which is here which has
got<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.920> video<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.070> an<00:01:43.160> old<00:01:43.340> slide<00:01:43.820> that<00:01:44.090> I

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
got a a video of an old slide that I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.630 
got a a video of an old slide that I
inherited<00:01:44.660> from<00:01:45.140> Sky<00:01:45.890> one<00:01:46.660> so<00:01:47.660> now<00:01:48.640> this

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
inherited from Sky one so now this

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.580 
inherited from Sky one so now this
process<00:01:49.940> is<00:01:50.149> finished<00:01:50.479> it's<00:01:50.869> converted<00:01:51.440> all

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
process is finished it's converted all

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.639 
process is finished it's converted all
of<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.800> pages<00:01:52.009> that<00:01:52.369> I<00:01:52.399> want<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:53.840> now<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.050> can<00:01:54.380> go

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
of the pages that I want so now I can go

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.290 
of the pages that I want so now I can go
to<00:01:56.380> winscp<00:01:57.380> which<00:01:58.190> is<00:01:58.429> just<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.759> handy<00:01:59.149> way<00:01:59.270> of

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
to winscp which is just a handy way of

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.109 
to winscp which is just a handy way of
moving<00:01:59.780> files<00:02:00.369> I'll<00:02:01.369> select<00:02:01.670> all<00:02:01.819> the<00:02:01.970> files

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.309 
moving files I'll select all the files
that<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:04.000> computers<00:02:05.000> just<00:02:05.209> made<00:02:05.539> and<00:02:05.840> I'll

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
that the computers just made and I'll

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.309 
that the computers just made and I'll
put<00:02:06.619> them<00:02:06.770> onto<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.130> Raspberry<00:02:07.520> Pi<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:08.840> it's

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
put them onto the Raspberry Pi so it's

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.300 
put them onto the Raspberry Pi so it's
now<00:02:09.560> going<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.830> copy<00:02:10.100> them<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.970> all<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.300> pages

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
now going to copy them so all the pages

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.020 
now going to copy them so all the pages
are<00:02:16.310> being<00:02:16.550> sent<00:02:16.790> over<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.760> telly
