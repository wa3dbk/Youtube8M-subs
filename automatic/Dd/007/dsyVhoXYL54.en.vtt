I also rendered out some videos on the

I also rendered out some videos on the

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
laptop to test it and I actually

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.020 
laptop to test it and I actually
performed<00:04:06.989> better<00:04:07.230> than<00:04:07.560> my<00:04:07.769> main<00:04:08.040> PC<00:04:08.580> which

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
performed better than my main PC which

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.630 
performed better than my main PC which
only<00:04:09.239> has<00:04:09.420> an<00:04:09.570> i5<00:04:10.080> in<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.250> mainly

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
only has an i5 in it but that is mainly

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.370 
only has an i5 in it but that is mainly
due<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.300> fact<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.750> did<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.110> test

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
due to the fact that I did the test

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.539 
due to the fact that I did the test
without<00:04:14.330> GPU<00:04:15.330> rendering<00:04:15.600> so<00:04:16.320> my<00:04:16.470> PC<00:04:16.919> with<00:04:17.160> GPU

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
without GPU rendering so my PC with GPU

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.710 
without GPU rendering so my PC with GPU
rendering<00:04:17.790> obviously<00:04:18.359> is<00:04:18.419> going<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.600> be

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
rendering obviously is going to be

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.570 
rendering obviously is going to be
faster<00:04:19.230> but<00:04:19.590> it's<00:04:19.739> still<00:04:19.980> an<00:04:20.250> impressive

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
faster but it's still an impressive
