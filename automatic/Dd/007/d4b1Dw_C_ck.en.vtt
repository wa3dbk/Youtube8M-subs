stack up compared to the guys Tab s 10.5
this<00:01:13.200> tablet<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.009> be<00:01:14.159> lighter<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
this tablet is going to be lighter and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.139 
this tablet is going to be lighter and
thinner<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.829> the<00:01:16.829> screen<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.700> completely

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
thinner and the screen just completely

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.230 
thinner and the screen just completely
outclasses<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.829> is<00:01:20.039> an<00:01:20.219> AMOLED<00:01:20.850> screen

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
outclasses it this is an AMOLED screen

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.120 
outclasses it this is an AMOLED screen
compared<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.899> traditional<00:01:22.049> LCD<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:23.039> we

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
compared to the traditional LCD that we

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.910 
compared to the traditional LCD that we
found<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.520> every<00:01:23.939> tablet<00:01:24.590> over<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> past

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
found on every tablet over the past

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.120 
found on every tablet over the past
years<00:01:26.399> this<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.990> be<00:01:28.140> definitely<00:01:28.530> a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
years this is going to be definitely a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.219 
years this is going to be definitely a
interesting<00:01:30.060> decision<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.810> make

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
interesting decision to make

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.349 
interesting decision to make
alright<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.039> let's<00:01:32.219> take<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> look<00:01:32.729> at<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> size

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
alright so let's take a look at the size

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.080 
alright so let's take a look at the size
comparison<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.469> when<00:01:34.829> we<00:01:34.950> put<00:01:35.159> these<00:01:35.280> side<00:01:35.880> by

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
comparison so when we put these side by

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.139 
comparison so when we put these side by
side<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:37.590> see<00:01:37.619> there<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.789> clear

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
side you can see there is a clear

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.039 
side you can see there is a clear
difference<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.810> size<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:41.399> 10.5<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.450> very<00:01:42.780> much

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
difference in size the 10.5 is very much

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.120 
difference in size the 10.5 is very much
more<00:01:43.380> compact<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.240> 12.2<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.530> 1p<00:01:46.950> much

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
more compact and the 12.2 is 1p much

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.450 
more compact and the 12.2 is 1p much
thicker<00:01:48.229> now<00:01:49.229> when<00:01:49.469> it<00:01:49.560> comes<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.979> thinness

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
thicker now when it comes to thinness

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.090 
thicker now when it comes to thinness
again<00:01:50.969> the<00:01:51.210> 10.5<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.679> to<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.799> thinner

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
again the 10.5 is going to be thinner

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.999 
again the 10.5 is going to be thinner
than<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.399> iPad<00:01:53.850> air<00:01:54.119> whereas<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.109> 12.2<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
than the iPad air whereas the 12.2 is a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.029 
than the iPad air whereas the 12.2 is a
little<00:01:56.520> thicker<00:01:56.789> in<00:01:57.149> comparison<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.710> just

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
little thicker in comparison and it just

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.980 
little thicker in comparison and it just
won't<00:01:59.189> give<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.609> that<00:01:59.789> same<00:02:00.119> slim<00:02:00.479> profile

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
won't give you that same slim profile

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.319 
won't give you that same slim profile
when<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.039> comes<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> backing<00:02:02.999> of<00:02:03.149> these

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
when it comes to the backing of these

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.560 
when it comes to the backing of these
two<00:02:03.600> tablets<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.729> note<00:02:06.270> style

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
two tablets we have the note style

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.380 
two tablets we have the note style
backing<00:02:07.200> found<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.369> 12.2<00:02:09.470> whereas<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
backing found on the 12.2 whereas the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.890 
backing found on the 12.2 whereas the
10.5<00:02:12.390> has<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.050> new<00:02:13.400> s5<00:02:14.400> style<00:02:14.819> backing<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
10.5 has the new s5 style backing with a
