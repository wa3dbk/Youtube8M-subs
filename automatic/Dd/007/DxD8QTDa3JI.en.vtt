I'm<00:04:59.090> using<00:04:59.330> this<00:04:59.570> a<00:04:59.870> tad<00:05:00.590> bit<00:05:00.889> of<00:05:00.919> lag<00:05:01.250> as<00:05:01.580> I'm

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
I'm using this a tad bit of lag as I'm

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.580 
I'm using this a tad bit of lag as I'm
switching<00:05:02.330> through<00:05:02.570> between<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:03.050> screens

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
switching through between the screens

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.159 
switching through between the screens
that's<00:05:04.250> to<00:05:04.490> be<00:05:04.610> expected<00:05:04.729> as<00:05:05.510> it<00:05:05.750> does<00:05:05.960> have

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
that's to be expected as it does have

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.379 
that's to be expected as it does have
TouchWiz<00:05:06.710> plus<00:05:07.520> it<00:05:07.789> doesn't<00:05:08.120> have<00:05:08.240> the

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
TouchWiz plus it doesn't have the

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.719 
TouchWiz plus it doesn't have the
highest<00:05:08.690> specs<00:05:09.169> inside<00:05:09.590> but<00:05:10.340> other<00:05:10.490> than<00:05:10.669> that

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
highest specs inside but other than that

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.420 
highest specs inside but other than that
I<00:05:11.150> think<00:05:11.870> it<00:05:12.050> was<00:05:12.229> fairly<00:05:12.800> smooth<00:05:13.160> in<00:05:13.400> the

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
I think it was fairly smooth in the

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.279 
I think it was fairly smooth in the
short<00:05:13.820> amount<00:05:14.210> of<00:05:14.300> time<00:05:14.360> that<00:05:14.780> I've<00:05:14.900> used<00:05:15.080> it

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
short amount of time that I've used it

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.740 
short amount of time that I've used it
of<00:05:15.410> course<00:05:16.400> wait<00:05:16.789> around<00:05:17.060> for<00:05:17.389> the<00:05:17.539> full
