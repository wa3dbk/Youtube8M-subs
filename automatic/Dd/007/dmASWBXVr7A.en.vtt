 their own history is made by their workers and 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.580

 proud of this collective arrived 25 of 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.070
 years of working here with them and all

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.899
 Factory took me 31 years of work 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.350

 outside the disassembly and assembly was 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.110
 made by their own workers and 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.600
 technicians with lines 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:13.210
 very old in the year 1942 we 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.040
 we try to keep active because it is 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.660
 a relic here I had the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.670
 privilege to work with mechanic and 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.410
 who has many years of experience that 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.270
 they have taught me a lot about everything we are 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.190
 talking about machines that are very good and 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.830
 that inventiveness is present day by day 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.479
 there and good I'm grateful for this 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.010
 opportunity that this company has given me 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.300
 I was not in the position to assume 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.130
 this mortal we did it and we believe it is 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.680
 a work prowess because we did it 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.410
 among a whole group of colleagues and 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.979
 lion 'we give a good amount of money in 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.979
 the montage 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.090
 including the boiler that you have today 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.510
 today efficient efficient we make a 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.990
 system that does not support the environment 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.420
 nothing polluting a Naomi woman a 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.520
 skilled worker in miguelito boilers and 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.259
 a young Ricardo engineer next to 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.690
 rest of the collective are the 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.539
 protagonists of the day to day of this 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.690
 Camaguey factory that is produced here 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.170
 in this combo with money sorbetos 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.670
 candies although mixtures and dry mixtures 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.700
 what are the instant sodas the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.230
 custard the gofio and chocolates I feel 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.870
 very proud I want to take advantage of it in 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.540
 every means because the end of all this 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.610
 is for children and we are imbued in 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.040
 that young people integrate into this 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.480
 innovative process and we even went back to 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.940
 create seven young people the center that 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.010
 had lost and we are involved in 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.650
 the whole process of this renew every 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.840
 individual factory has its plans not 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.390
 for example bread that makes up to 70 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.730
 tons of bread that thirty-something 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.250
 does sorbeto chocolates makes two texts 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.360
 nothing because it is a craft production 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.960
 candy is doing right now 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.030
 10 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.190
 20 tons of candies the sixth 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.650
 party congress called to be more 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.980
 efficient in your factory as concrete 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.510
 that call as he sees it with these 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.640
 innovators with these rational os 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.410
 rationalizers for example work 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.690
 in the boiler it is becoming more efficient 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.700
 improves the consumption rates of the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.720
 fuel from one month to another in the 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.800
 year we had to improve so we 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.630
 recovering the race for example in this 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.460
 candy production what we saw there 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.380
 as they introduced again rafa 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.170
 mass is recovered so we are more 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.670
 existing in camagÃ¼ey pink white bouquets 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.150
