00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
have the world in a small scale on Cal U

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.130 
have the world in a small scale on Cal U
campus<00:01:55.980> and<00:01:56.190> in<00:01:56.820> addition<00:01:57.150> to<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.750> have

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
campus and in addition to this I have

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.950 
campus and in addition to this I have
partner<00:01:58.980> universities<00:01:59.670> acquired<00:02:00.480> all<00:02:00.690> over

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
partner universities acquired all over

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.110 
partner universities acquired all over
the<00:02:01.080> world<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:02.040> every<00:02:02.430> continent<00:02:02.850> well

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
the world so on every continent well

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.360 
the world so on every continent well
except<00:02:03.600> from<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.870> Antarctica<00:02:04.410> on<00:02:05.070> every

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
except from the Antarctica on every

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.610
