the UFO experience is not is never as

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.740 
the UFO experience is not is never as
bad<00:00:03.540> as<00:00:03.600> they<00:00:03.990> think<00:00:04.200> it<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:05.330> the<00:00:06.330> ideal

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
bad as they think it is the ideal

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.230 
bad as they think it is the ideal
situation<00:00:07.109> would<00:00:08.010> be<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.580> person<00:00:08.820> never

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
situation would be that the person never

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.140 
situation would be that the person never
remember<00:00:09.900> anything<00:00:10.580> because<00:00:11.580> they<00:00:11.790> have<00:00:11.969> been

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
remember anything because they have been

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.419 
remember anything because they have been
coming<00:00:12.420> since<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.990> beginning<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.620> time<00:00:13.950> since

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
coming since the beginning of time since

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.099 
coming since the beginning of time since
the<00:00:14.610> beginning<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.150> Earth<00:00:15.389> they<00:00:15.780> have<00:00:15.900> been

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
the beginning of Earth they have been

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.680 
the beginning of Earth they have been
here<00:00:16.320> from<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> very<00:00:16.800> beginning<00:00:17.520> as<00:00:18.420> if<00:00:18.539> my

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
here from the very beginning as if my

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.240 
here from the very beginning as if my
books<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.230> talks<00:00:19.470> about<00:00:19.770> how<00:00:19.949> they<00:00:20.189> were

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
books it talks about how they were

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.759 
books it talks about how they were
responsible<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.449> creation<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.260> life<00:00:22.500> on

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
responsible for the creation of life on

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.340 
responsible for the creation of life on
Earth<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.430> they've<00:00:24.359> been<00:00:24.510> taking<00:00:24.660> care<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.140> us

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
Earth and they've been taking care of us

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.009 
Earth and they've been taking care of us
all<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.740> time<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.250> checking<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.849> us<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.869> they

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
all that time and checking on us so they

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.169 
all that time and checking on us so they
said<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.439> ideal<00:00:28.859> situation<00:00:29.789> would<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:30.029> that

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
said the ideal situation would be that

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.650 
said the ideal situation would be that
the<00:00:30.449> person<00:00:30.900> never<00:00:31.080> remember<00:00:31.830> anything<00:00:32.660> and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
the person never remember anything and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.220 
the person never remember anything and
go<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.050> their<00:00:34.320> life<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> problem<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
go on their life but the problem is the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.860 
go on their life but the problem is the
additives<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.980> our<00:00:38.100> food<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:39.180> pollutants<00:00:39.719> in

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
additives in our food the pollutants in

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.740 
additives in our food the pollutants in
our<00:00:40.050> atmosphere<00:00:40.579> if<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.790> person<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.570> any

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
our atmosphere if the person is on any

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.720 
our atmosphere if the person is on any
kind<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.110> medication<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.100> they're<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.460> any

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
kind of medication if they're on any

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.400 
kind of medication if they're on any
kind<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.059> drugs<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.719> alcohol

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
kind of drugs or alcohol

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.459 
kind of drugs or alcohol
this<00:00:47.370> changes<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.450> chemistry<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.440> brain

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
this changes the chemistry of the brain

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.569 
this changes the chemistry of the brain
and<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.969> colors<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.570> chemistry<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> brain

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
and it colors the chemistry of the brain

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.729 
and it colors the chemistry of the brain
so<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.699> they<00:00:53.940> had<00:00:54.210> an<00:00:54.360> experience<00:00:55.050> they<00:00:55.710> are

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
so if they had an experience they are

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.549 
so if they had an experience they are
remembering<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.059> distorted<00:00:57.629> fashion

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
remembering it in a distorted fashion

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.729 
remembering it in a distorted fashion
not<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> way<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.120> happened<00:01:00.739> sometimes

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
not in the way it happened sometimes

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.000 
not in the way it happened sometimes
they'll<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.219> dreams<00:01:02.690> or<00:01:03.690> they'll<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:04.710> bits

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
they'll have dreams or they'll have bits

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.399 
they'll have dreams or they'll have bits
and<00:01:05.220> pieces<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:06.090> remember<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.290> they

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
and pieces that they remember but they

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.770 
and pieces that they remember but they
remember<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.280> distorted<00:01:08.760> fashion<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
remember in a distorted fashion and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.590 
remember in a distorted fashion and
because<00:01:10.740> fear<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.729> strongest<00:01:12.240> emotion

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
because fear is the strongest emotion

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.740 
because fear is the strongest emotion
the<00:01:12.960> human<00:01:13.350> has<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:14.549> will<00:01:14.760> naturally<00:01:14.939> be

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the human has they will naturally be

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.600 
the human has they will naturally be
afraid<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.680> don't<00:01:17.009> understand

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
afraid of it you don't understand

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.950 
afraid of it you don't understand
something<00:01:17.909> you're<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.570> afraid<00:01:18.810> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
something you're going to be afraid of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.700 
something you're going to be afraid of
it<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.830> they<00:01:20.009> color<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.759> fear<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.710> this

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
it so they color it with fear and this

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.260 
it so they color it with fear and this
emotional<00:01:23.520> response

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
emotional response

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.539 
emotional response
so<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:25.049> naturally<00:01:25.710> they<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:26.159> something

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
so all naturally they think something

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.539 
so all naturally they think something
bad<00:01:26.790> has<00:01:27.090> happened<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.630> them<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.799> when<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.189> work

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
bad has happened to them but when I work

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.690 
bad has happened to them but when I work
with<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.880> person<00:01:30.119> I'm<00:01:30.540> able<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.079> remove<00:01:31.470> that

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
with the person I'm able to remove that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.630 
with the person I'm able to remove that
conscious<00:01:32.700> part<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.390> get<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> real<00:01:34.710> event

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
conscious part and get to the real event

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.819 
conscious part and get to the real event
the<00:01:35.850> real<00:01:36.060> circumstance<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.200> what<00:01:37.380> happened

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the real circumstance of what happened

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.160 
the real circumstance of what happened
and<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.640> never<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.450> think<00:01:39.780> really

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
and it's never what they think really

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.210 
and it's never what they think really
happen

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
happen

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.430 
happen
once<00:01:41.700> they<00:01:41.850> find<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.330> out<00:01:42.390> they'll<00:01:42.870> say<00:01:43.140> well

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
once they find that out they'll say well

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.770 
once they find that out they'll say well
that's<00:01:43.710> nothing<00:01:44.190> so<00:01:44.340> bad<00:01:44.550> I<00:01:44.940> can<00:01:45.330> live<00:01:45.540> with

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that's nothing so bad I can live with

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.970 
that's nothing so bad I can live with
that<00:01:46.040> so<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.190> my<00:01:47.370> job<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:48.150> to<00:01:48.420> make<00:01:48.630> people

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
that so that's my job is to make people

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.800 
that so that's my job is to make people
understand<00:01:49.980> these<00:01:50.250> things<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.780> first

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
understand these things so the first

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.410 
understand these things so the first
thing<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.380> would<00:01:52.440> say<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.130> don't<00:01:53.430> think<00:01:53.580> it<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
thing I would say is don't think it is a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.140 
thing I would say is don't think it is a
negative<00:01:54.690> experience<00:01:55.610> there's<00:01:56.610> always<00:01:56.880> an

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
negative experience there's always an

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.450 
negative experience there's always an
explanation<00:01:57.450> for<00:01:58.320> what's<00:01:58.590> happening<00:01:59.190> and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
explanation for what's happening and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.170 
explanation for what's happening and
it's<00:02:00.120> not<00:02:00.240> near<00:02:00.600> as<00:02:00.750> bad<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.290> think<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.680> is

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
it's not near as bad as you think it is

propulsion system to do where they live
what<00:03:46.959> it's<00:03:47.140> like<00:03:47.319> on<00:03:47.560> their<00:03:47.709> planets<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:49.120> why

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
what it's like on their planets to why

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.970 
what it's like on their planets to why
they<00:03:49.630> were<00:03:49.720> coming<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.380> what<00:03:50.650> they<00:03:50.830> are<00:03:50.860> doing

here<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:51.910> it's<00:03:52.330> amazing<00:03:53.290> as<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:54.099> theories<00:03:54.580> I

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
here and it's amazing as the theories I

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.309 
here and it's amazing as the theories I
found<00:03:55.090> are<00:03:55.420> not<00:03:55.599> like<00:03:55.810> any<00:03:56.019> other

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
found are not like any other

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.300 
found are not like any other
investigator<00:03:57.099> out<00:03:57.430> there<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.980> they<00:04:00.130> say

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
investigator out there and they say

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.059
