trucks<00:00:27.630> choose<00:00:28.260> from<00:00:30.320> thunder<00:00:31.320> mega<00:00:32.279> one

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440

thunder<00:00:34.440> bull<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.870> sunrise<00:00:36.870> which<00:00:37.290> looks

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
thunder bull and sunrise which looks

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.720 
thunder bull and sunrise which looks
like<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> fuckin<00:00:38.280> caravan<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.660> even<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.020> truck

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.090 
so you can go three bridges and your
opponent<00:01:39.789> doesn't<00:01:40.000> even<00:01:40.210> race<00:01:40.570> so<00:01:41.320> that's

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
opponent doesn't even race so that's

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.029 
opponent doesn't even race so that's
that's<00:01:42.969> good<00:01:43.329> game<00:01:43.600> good<00:01:44.380> game<00:01:44.439> play<00:01:44.860> right

great gameplay um if you're noticing
there's<00:01:52.960> no<00:01:53.110> sound<00:01:53.909> that's<00:01:54.909> not<00:01:55.090> because<00:01:55.390> the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
there's no sound that's not because the

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.719 
there's no sound that's not because the
audio<00:01:56.409> is<00:01:56.500> disabled<00:01:57.100> that's<00:01:57.219> because<00:01:57.490> there

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
audio is disabled that's because there

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.679 
audio is disabled that's because there
is<00:01:57.850> virtually<00:01:58.240> no<00:01:58.509> sound<00:01:58.869> in<00:01:59.049> this<00:01:59.170> game<00:02:03.689> so

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
review of this and I'm going to test

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.160 
review of this and I'm going to test
this<00:04:26.440> out<00:04:26.650> I'm<00:04:26.980> gonna<00:04:27.160> see<00:04:27.570> they<00:04:28.570> say<00:04:28.840> you<00:04:28.900> can

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
this out I'm gonna see they say you can

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.740 
this out I'm gonna see they say you can
reverse<00:04:29.500> infinite<00:04:30.160> speeds<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.940> let's<00:04:31.450> test

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
reverse infinite speeds and let's test

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.490 
reverse infinite speeds and let's test
that<00:04:31.990> out<00:04:32.020> okay<00:04:32.590> what<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:32.980> fuck<00:04:37.500> I'm

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
that out okay what the fuck I'm

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.370 
that out okay what the fuck I'm
reversing<00:04:39.490> faster<00:04:40.210> than<00:04:40.330> you<00:04:40.480> yes<00:04:40.690> then<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.200> can

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
reversing faster than you yes then I can

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.820 
reversing faster than you yes then I can
actually<00:04:41.530> go<00:04:42.430> forwards<00:04:44.940> so<00:04:45.940> I'm<00:04:46.030> going<00:04:46.300> at<00:04:47.140> the

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
actually go forwards so I'm going at the

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.680 
actually go forwards so I'm going at the
speed<00:04:48.010> things<00:04:48.520> have<00:04:48.790> around<00:04:49.090> 300<00:04:49.450> now<00:04:50.020> and

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
speed things have around 300 now and

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.570 
speed things have around 300 now and
this<00:04:52.690> is<00:04:52.930> just<00:04:52.960> messed<00:04:53.590> up<00:04:53.830> this<00:04:54.070> is<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.370> worst

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
this is just messed up this is the worst

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.060 
this is just messed up this is the worst
game<00:04:54.880> I've<00:04:55.120> ever<00:04:55.300> played<00:04:55.560> this<00:04:56.560> is<00:04:56.770> probably

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
game I've ever played this is probably

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.370 
game I've ever played this is probably
the<00:04:57.220> funnest<00:04:57.460> part<00:04:57.880> of<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.390> game<00:04:58.600> right<00:04:59.140> here

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
the funnest part of the game right here

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.130 
the funnest part of the game right here
just<00:04:59.620> reversing<00:05:02.790> well<00:05:03.790> why<00:05:04.420> am<00:05:04.450> I<00:05:04.750> doing<00:05:04.810> this

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
just reversing well why am I doing this

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:12.450 
just reversing well why am I doing this
and<00:05:06.330> now<00:05:07.330> I've<00:05:07.450> left<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:08.560> map<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:11.130> try<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.310> get

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
and now I've left the map so try and get

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.310 
and now I've left the map so try and get
back<00:05:12.670> to<00:05:12.790> the<00:05:12.910> map<00:05:13.120> not<00:05:13.390> that<00:05:13.570> I<00:05:13.600> really<00:05:14.050> want

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
back to the map not that I really want

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.580 
back to the map not that I really want
to<00:05:14.500> just<00:05:14.830> that<00:05:15.070> I<00:05:15.540> okay<00:05:16.540> yeah<00:05:17.140> and<00:05:17.350> you<00:05:17.440> can
