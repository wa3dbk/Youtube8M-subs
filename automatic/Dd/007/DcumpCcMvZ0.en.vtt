00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
do G and right there you'll see a little

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.660 
do G and right there you'll see a little
technique<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.710> did<00:00:22.890> there<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.189> pulled<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
technique I did there I pulled the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.960 
technique I did there I pulled the
creeps<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:25.279> what<00:00:26.279> that's<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:26.880> is

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
creeps in and what that's going to do is

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.790 
creeps in and what that's going to do is
actually<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.570> make<00:00:27.689> his<00:00:28.320> wave<00:00:28.529> push

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
actually going to make his wave push

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.339 
actually going to make his wave push
toward<00:00:29.039> me<00:00:29.269> and<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.929> kind<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.109> puts<00:00:31.260> me

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
toward me and that just kind of puts me

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.930 
toward me and that just kind of puts me
in<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> better<00:00:31.590> position<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.309> they<00:00:32.460> does

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
in a better position because they does

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.319 
in a better position because they does
have<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> Vye<00:00:33.300> jumbled<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.969> level<00:00:36.210> two

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
have a Vye jumbled and so the level two

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.729 
have a Vye jumbled and so the level two
gangs<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.750> her<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.140> Leasing<00:00:37.410> are<00:00:37.559> really

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
gangs with her and Leasing are really

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.319 
gangs with her and Leasing are really
really<00:00:37.920> strong<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:38.820> that's<00:00:39.000> not<00:00:39.120> what<00:00:39.239> I'm

and<00:01:45.630> chat<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:45.930> something<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.880> my

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and chat or something like that and my

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.030 
and chat or something like that and my
general<00:01:48.180> idea<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.799> take<00:01:49.979> a

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
general idea is that you can take a

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.280 
general idea is that you can take a
small<00:01:50.430> advantage<00:01:50.880> from<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.079> you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
small advantage from it as if like you

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.289 
small advantage from it as if like you
were<00:01:52.500> already<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.250> get<00:01:53.490> from<00:01:53.970> actually

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
were already going to get from actually

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.899 
were already going to get from actually
playing<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> game<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.229> um<00:01:55.470> I'm<00:01:56.100> pretty<00:01:56.369> sure

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
playing the game so um I'm pretty sure

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.670 
playing the game so um I'm pretty sure
we<00:01:57.329> would<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.630> still<00:01:58.049> gotten<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.469> kill<00:01:58.649> on

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
we would have still gotten the kill on

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.219 
we would have still gotten the kill on
lease<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.219> there<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.719> that's<00:02:00.930> when<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> was

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
lease in there and so that's when I was

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.399 
lease in there and so that's when I was
like<00:02:01.380> all<00:02:02.310> right<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.700> know<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.149> if<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.350> did

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
like all right you know and if I did

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.109 
like all right you know and if I did
have<00:02:04.770> double<00:02:05.009> buffs<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.340> she<00:02:05.579> was<00:02:05.790> over

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
have double buffs and she was over

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.180 
have double buffs and she was over
extending<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:06.990> those<00:02:07.469> were<00:02:07.680> her

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
extending so like those were her

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.070 
extending so like those were her
mistakes<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:09.149> know<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.420> she<00:02:09.599> was<00:02:09.690> pushed<00:02:09.989> to

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
mistakes you know if she was pushed to

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.479 
mistakes you know if she was pushed to
hurt<00:02:10.259> our<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:10.649> wouldn't<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:10.979> able<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.400> that

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
hurt our we wouldn't be able to get that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.630 
hurt our we wouldn't be able to get that
kill<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.090> didn't

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
kill so I didn't

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.160 
kill so I didn't
it's<00:02:12.819> bad<00:02:12.940> about<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.330> but<00:02:13.810> what<00:02:13.930> I'm<00:02:14.020> going
