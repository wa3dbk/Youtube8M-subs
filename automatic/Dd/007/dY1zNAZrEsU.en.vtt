hey guys it's Hank I'm again here
remember<00:00:03.240> back<00:00:03.449> in<00:00:03.480> 1.6<00:00:04.470> where<00:00:04.740> we<00:00:04.830> used<00:00:05.040> to

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
remember back in 1.6 where we used to

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.039 
remember back in 1.6 where we used to
have<00:00:05.310> those<00:00:05.520> water<00:00:05.940> elevators<00:00:06.720> where<00:00:06.990> you

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
have those water elevators where you

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.200 
have those water elevators where you
could<00:00:07.230> just<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.890> know<00:00:07.950> have<00:00:08.250> falling<00:00:08.849> water

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
could just you know have falling water

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.709 
could just you know have falling water
just<00:00:09.990> going<00:00:10.290> directly<00:00:10.710> down<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.480> boats<00:00:12.480> will

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
just going directly down and boats will

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.589 
just going directly down and boats will
float<00:00:13.080> up<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.590> well<00:00:14.519> guess<00:00:14.730> what<00:00:14.910> guys<00:00:15.179> they

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
float up in it well guess what guys they

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.920 
float up in it well guess what guys they
are<00:00:15.870> back<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:17.190> I'm<00:00:17.340> not<00:00:17.490> even<00:00:17.520> kidding<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
are back and I'm not even kidding have a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.150 
are back and I'm not even kidding have a
look<00:00:19.140> at<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:20.000> so<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.990> here<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.680> just

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
look at this so this here is just

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.519 
look at this so this here is just
falling<00:00:23.369> water<00:00:23.730> all<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:24.990> falling

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
falling water all of this is falling

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.720 
falling water all of this is falling
water<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:27.050> these<00:00:28.050> boats<00:00:28.439> are<00:00:28.830> actually<00:00:29.369> going

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
water and these boats are actually going

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.540 
water and these boats are actually going
up<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.449> water<00:00:30.750> if<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.800> look<00:00:31.980> at<00:00:32.130> them<00:00:32.309> they

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
up this water if you look at them they

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.470 
up this water if you look at them they
are<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.989> about<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:35.370> sort<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.760> clipping

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
are just about like sort of clipping

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.900 
are just about like sort of clipping
they're<00:00:36.780> not<00:00:36.899> even<00:00:37.140> clipping<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> water<00:00:38.010> but

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
they're not even clipping the water but

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.959 
they're not even clipping the water but
they<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.379> they're<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:41.070> water<00:00:41.640> source

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
they think that they're in water source

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
they think that they're in water source
blocks<00:00:42.270> they're<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.930> sort<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
blocks they're like sort of going to the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.720 
blocks they're like sort of going to the
nearest<00:00:43.950> air<00:00:44.250> pocket<00:00:45.320> but<00:00:46.320> their<00:00:46.590> hitbox<00:00:47.430> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
nearest air pocket but their hitbox is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.779 
nearest air pocket but their hitbox is
overlapping<00:00:48.570> into<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> water<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.010> that's

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
overlapping into the water and that's

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.939 
overlapping into the water and that's
why<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:51.239> actually<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.320> they're<00:00:52.800> in

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
why they actually think that they're in

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.459 
why they actually think that they're in
a<00:00:53.039> source<00:00:53.280> blog<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> fact<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.079> they

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
a source blog but the fact is they

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.799 
a source blog but the fact is they
aren't<00:00:55.980> they're<00:00:56.820> not<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.270> source<00:00:57.539> block

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
aren't they're not in a source block

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.279 
aren't they're not in a source block
tool<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.850> they<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.329> know<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.690> carry<00:01:01.140> on

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
tool and they can you know just carry on

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.700 
tool and they can you know just carry on
going<00:01:01.829> up<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.219> up<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.559> now<00:01:04.559> if

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
going up and up and up like this now if

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.940 
going up and up and up like this now if
we<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:05.070> hop<00:01:05.549> down<00:01:05.820> here<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.350> also<00:01:07.530> see

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
we just hop down here we can also see

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.660 
we just hop down here we can also see
that<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.820> also<00:01:09.210> write<00:01:10.140> these<00:01:11.299> up<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.670> we

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that we can also write these up so we

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.410 
that we can also write these up so we
are<00:01:14.820> currently<00:01:15.259> riding<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.920> boat<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
are currently riding this boat up and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.969 
are currently riding this boat up and
you'll<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> this

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you'll see when we get to this

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.820 
you'll see when we get to this
intersection<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.990> there<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.080> go<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.439> can

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
intersection here there we go I can

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.630 
intersection here there we go I can
destroy<00:01:23.460> these<00:01:24.000> blocks<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.140> well<00:01:25.640> won't

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
destroy these blocks here as well won't

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.999 
destroy these blocks here as well won't
cause<00:01:26.939> any<00:01:27.180> block<00:01:27.659> updates<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.920> would

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
cause any block updates as you would

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.620 
cause any block updates as you would
expect<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> water<00:01:30.299> source<00:01:30.689> blocks<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
expect with a water source blocks and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:40.880 
expect with a water source blocks and
well<00:01:35.720> that's<00:01:36.720> pretty<00:01:37.320> much<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:39.049> these<00:01:40.049> boats

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
well that's pretty much that these boats

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.499 
well that's pretty much that these boats
just<00:01:41.310> carry<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:41.909> round<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> round

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
just carry on going round and round

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.580 
just carry on going round and round
round<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:44.479> god<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.630> getting<00:01:45.750> dark<00:01:46.140> only<00:01:46.470> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
round and god it's getting dark only to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.139 
round and god it's getting dark only to
be<00:01:46.649> able<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.950> find<00:01:47.189> soon<00:01:49.970> actually<00:01:50.970> let<00:01:51.119> me

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
be able to find soon actually let me

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.679 
be able to find soon actually let me
just<00:01:51.869> show<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.140> guys<00:01:52.530> actually<00:01:52.890> how<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
just show you guys actually how you

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.749 
just show you guys actually how you
deploy<00:01:54.689> these<00:01:55.530> boats<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.369> very<00:01:56.520> simple

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
deploy these boats and it's very simple

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.230 
deploy these boats and it's very simple
really<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.270> go<00:01:57.659> one<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.130> then<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.000> waste

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
really just go one and then you waste

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.670 
really just go one and then you waste
bit<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.350> then<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:02.149> press<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.270> again

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
bit and then you just press it again

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.730 
bit and then you just press it again
wait<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> bit<00:02:05.000> press<00:02:06.000> at<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> end<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.469> these

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
wait a bit press at the end and these

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.880 
wait a bit press at the end and these
boats<00:02:08.039> will<00:02:08.899> automatically<00:02:09.899> set<00:02:10.679> themselves

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
boats will automatically set themselves

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.670 
boats will automatically set themselves
in<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> right<00:02:11.730> spot<00:02:12.090> against<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.720> water

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
in the right spot against this water

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.880 
in the right spot against this water
and<00:02:13.799> they'll<00:02:14.280> automatically<00:02:14.849> start<00:02:15.239> rising

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
and they'll automatically start rising

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.949 
and they'll automatically start rising
currently<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.920> admit<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.519> these<00:02:18.000> are<00:02:18.420> sore

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
currently I admit that these are sore

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.670 
currently I admit that these are sore
spots<00:02:19.379> but<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.219> insist<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.299> you<00:02:21.450> do<00:02:21.840> not<00:02:22.170> need

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
spots but I insist that you do not need

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.699 
spots but I insist that you do not need
these<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.519> be<00:02:23.609> soft<00:02:23.879> lots<00:02:24.269> at<00:02:24.450> all<00:02:24.659> even<00:02:25.439> if

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
these to be soft lots at all even if

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.580 
these to be soft lots at all even if
these<00:02:25.920> are<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.849> flowing<00:02:27.150> water<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:28.140> system

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
these are just flowing water the system

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.280 
these are just flowing water the system
will<00:02:28.709> work<00:02:28.739> perfectly<00:02:29.549> fine<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:31.109> this

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
will work perfectly fine I have this

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.729 
will work perfectly fine I have this
water<00:02:31.590> source<00:02:31.889> block<00:02:32.219> here<00:02:32.579> which<00:02:32.819> actually

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
water source block here which actually

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.080 
water source block here which actually
directs<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.859> boat<00:02:35.069> into<00:02:35.639> the<00:02:35.760> right<00:02:35.939> position

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
directs the boat into the right position

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.940 
directs the boat into the right position
and<00:02:36.510> pushes<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.019> into<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.439> column<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.920> water

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
and pushes it into this column of water

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.690 
and pushes it into this column of water
here<00:02:38.480> have<00:02:39.480> these<00:02:39.780> are<00:02:40.200> source<00:02:41.159> blocks<00:02:41.519> along

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
here have these are source blocks along

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.440 
here have these are source blocks along
here<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.659> actually<00:02:42.780> push<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.709> boat<00:02:44.459> into<00:02:45.120> this

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
here to actually push the boat into this

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.830 
here to actually push the boat into this
so<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:46.079> being<00:02:46.379> forced<00:02:46.919> into<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.370> corner

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
so it's being forced into that corner

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.899 
so it's being forced into that corner
nasty<00:02:48.840> beasts<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.500> basic<00:02:50.040> idea<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.579> what's

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
nasty beasts the basic idea of what's

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.099 
nasty beasts the basic idea of what's
actually<00:02:51.120> going<00:02:51.569> on<00:02:51.780> here<00:02:52.109> and<00:02:53.569> that's<00:02:54.569> when

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
actually going on here and that's when

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.309 
actually going on here and that's when
you<00:02:55.590> kind<00:02:55.889> of<00:02:56.010> stop<00:02:56.599> putting<00:02:57.599> your<00:02:57.720> boats<00:02:57.989> in

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
you kind of stop putting your boats in

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.159 
you kind of stop putting your boats in
and<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:58.919> see<00:02:59.129> I<00:02:59.159> had<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.819> load<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.359> big<00:03:00.629> gaps<00:03:00.930> in

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.169 
and you see I had a load of big gaps in

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.819 
and you see I had a load of big gaps in
the<00:03:01.260> middle<00:03:01.849> but<00:03:02.849> you<00:03:02.939> stop<00:03:03.209> when<00:03:03.480> one<00:03:04.469> splash

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
the middle but you stop when one splash

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.629 
the middle but you stop when one splash
is<00:03:05.040> right<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.489> front<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:07.639> basically

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
is right in front of you and basically

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.330 
is right in front of you and basically
guys<00:03:08.939> that<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.840> reason<00:03:10.200> why<00:03:10.409> I've<00:03:10.680> been<00:03:10.859> doing

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
guys that the reason why I've been doing

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.409 
guys that the reason why I've been doing
this<00:03:12.230> little<00:03:13.230> quick<00:03:13.469> video<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:14.129> because<00:03:15.060> I've

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
this little quick video is because I've

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.580 
this little quick video is because I've
got<00:03:15.719> some<00:03:16.319> too<00:03:17.239> kind<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.449> massive<00:03:19.019> projects

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
got some too kind of massive projects

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.099 
got some too kind of massive projects
going<00:03:19.799> on<00:03:20.069> one<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:21.060> can<00:03:21.239> just<00:03:21.449> see<00:03:21.659> a<00:03:21.690> dark

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
going on one you can just see a dark

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.629 
going on one you can just see a dark
shade<00:03:22.560> up<00:03:22.859> there<00:03:23.129> and<00:03:25.099> that's<00:03:26.099> a<00:03:26.280> really<00:03:26.519> big

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
shade up there and that's a really big

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.719 
shade up there and that's a really big
project<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.449> I'm<00:03:27.540> working<00:03:27.569> on<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:29.400> will

wiring<00:03:44.340> of<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.329> you'll<00:03:46.199> see<00:03:46.530> why<00:03:46.889> it's<00:03:47.220> there

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
wiring of it you'll see why it's there

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.129 
wiring of it you'll see why it's there
in<00:03:47.849> inverted<00:03:48.449> commas<00:03:49.069> later<00:03:50.659> but<00:03:51.659> the<00:03:51.780> wiring

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
in inverted commas later but the wiring

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.369 
in inverted commas later but the wiring
of<00:03:52.259> it<00:03:52.379> is<00:03:52.500> seventy-five<00:03:53.009> percent<00:03:53.159> done<00:03:54.379> the

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
of it is seventy-five percent done the

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:01.039 
of it is seventy-five percent done the
actual<00:03:57.979> the<00:03:58.979> all<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.579> ideas<00:04:00.090> are<00:04:00.449> one<00:04:00.900> hundred

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
actual the all the ideas are one hundred

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.409 
actual the all the ideas are one hundred
percent<00:04:01.229> done<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.799> then<00:04:02.459> it's<00:04:02.849> just<00:04:03.090> going<00:04:03.359> to

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
percent done and then it's just going to

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.059 
percent done and then it's just going to
go<00:04:03.569> through<00:04:03.599> a<00:04:03.930> process<00:04:04.169> where<00:04:04.739> it's<00:04:04.829> going<00:04:05.009> to

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
go through a process where it's going to

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.699 
go through a process where it's going to
be<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.759> know<00:04:05.879> made<00:04:06.060> prettier<00:04:06.530> I'm<00:04:07.530> also
