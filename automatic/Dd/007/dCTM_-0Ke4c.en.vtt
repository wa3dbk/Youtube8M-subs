00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.159
 some characters including one who lose 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.619

 different and suitable for children the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.590
 despite finding some form 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.610
 of violence that could scare 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.220
 very young children
