00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.290
 then we will get the first 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.290
 hour 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:26.670
 it will be ours was our only asset 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.670
 looking at the screen if I look but 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.029
 fast and in one hour 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.300
 what a scare every time someone writes 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.309
 On twitter 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.450
 If we turn on the ipad screen no 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.960
 it's nothing important 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.960
 and 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.140
 however in a letter to the cps you have to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.900
 we go to a letter 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.900
 in courts 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.520
 here we are 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.650

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.580

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.870

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.940
 little bit the ones of the fingers I fell and 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.960
