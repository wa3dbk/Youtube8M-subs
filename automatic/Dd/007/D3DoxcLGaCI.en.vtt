00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
 and since play is king and jester song 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 life patsansky shorter video footage all 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:18.750
 such a miracle frequency speak something this song 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.939
 will need to play bars shorter without 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.410
 bars 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.130
 well, the most necessary here is in any chord 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.560
 put on bars 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.630
 so those who can't chord 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.340
 on the bar without any pain 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.840
 it will just make a chord on 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.899
 barrel everything is clear but seriously you need 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.149
 will stand someone there defense so 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:46.020
 okay all such stupid jokes then I 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:56.010
 In short, now I play as I play 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:58.610
 what the fuck is going on I want 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.610
 children 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.640
 were also 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.640
 father 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.420
 important 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.420
 from glass 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.250
 karacheva such as this 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.710
 concerns shorter 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.170
 first we need a chord d em which is on 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.659
 barre on the fifth fret you need to play 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.189
 I pull as if because songs 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.229
 wildly electric 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.759
 and need to translate that guitar 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.170
 electric to this pace guitar 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:05.220
 acoustic she does not work like this 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:08.429
 you need an introduction like this yell 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.610
 Unit four times then play 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:35.340
 d of this chord of the couplet 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:37.260
 it turns out the chords get even 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.360
 team how could u stop our 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.730
 talk the rest is all by analogy here 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:48.359
 here are three chords and punk but 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:53.870
 go on anyway I try to play 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:58.750
 only here is a chord yes to him so offensive 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.750
 on similar earlier also children's circle 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:23.450
 only girl we are by the way about guitar 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.310
 the battle immediately and the package will be here 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.510
 hang those who still do not know me 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.290
 take a look 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.650
 about guitar fights all bullshit there is a lot for 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.349
 this song for other songs there everything 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.599
 awesome painted look it on 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.040
 prose then click then look later 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:46.250
 pause it and continue 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:48.139
 look well turned out push here these 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.540
 are we dm three chords 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:55.819
 this verse is on the chorus i play 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:59.329
 so the chord is not here 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:02.540
 life has spread like a shoe from the ceiling 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:07.010
 growing loop here it turns out we have 5 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.469
 chords well, as in general when singing the chorus 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.859
 consists of four lines there roughly 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:20.120
 4 shower calendars four more lines 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:23.330
 and every two lines need shoes with 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:28.139
 ceiling from the ceiling grow loop 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:32.320
 the hunt turns out life is carried 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:39.480
 in as a shoe c not from the ceiling burbot 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.480
 growing loop is easier 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:58.060
 Then again, it was not 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:58.060
 and experimental 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.009
 in short , the whole song is all you can 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:11.569
 they say further chase by analogy 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.550
 wherever you want and how you want it 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:19.909
 Generally peck any tandem there 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:22.190
 after the second chorus you can shorter 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:26.150
 all that you will have no fantasy 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.940
 fantasy this is your business I would show 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.680
 In short, as after that, you can play 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.349
 here the chords are correct and everything is juicy 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.979
 afferent that's why don't forget 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.800
 to like 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:40.069
 dizlike thread to write in the rooms 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.860
 want more analysis more than once more 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.180
 Or say analysis huyovy just write 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.750
 why is he fucking 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.639
 and all that, and that was simply written 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.639
 what am i why the fucking why 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:57.169
 dick knows don't forget to subscribe 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.839

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.120
 listened to songs from peacekeeping 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:04.699
 to understand that I am fucking all the same 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.650
