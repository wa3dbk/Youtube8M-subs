really kind of really really hard to see
on<00:01:21.490> this<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:23.080> there's<00:01:23.290> actually<00:01:23.680> a<00:01:23.710> path<00:01:24.300> you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
on this but there's actually a path you

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.690 
on this but there's actually a path you
can<00:01:25.330> tell<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.750> grid<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:27.040> really<00:01:27.280> can't<00:01:27.490> sell

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
can tell the grid you really can't sell

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.230 
can tell the grid you really can't sell
the<00:01:27.820> line<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:29.320> there's<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:29.830> grid<00:01:30.400> for<00:01:31.210> a

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
the line but there's a grid for a

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.840 
the line but there's a grid for a
pathway<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:31.990> goes<00:01:32.050> up<00:01:32.350> through<00:01:32.380> here<00:01:33.130> all

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
pathway that goes up through here all

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.310 
pathway that goes up through here all
along<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.780> back<00:01:35.070> around<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:37.720> way<00:01:37.869> around

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
along to the back around this way around

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.219 
along to the back around this way around
down<00:01:39.070> through<00:01:39.130> here<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.690> believe<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.110> not

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
down through here and believe it not

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.350 
down through here and believe it not
there's<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.530> big<00:01:41.770> empty<00:01:42.160> space<00:01:42.340> right<00:01:43.149> in<00:01:43.180> the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
there's a big empty space right in the

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.040 
there's a big empty space right in the
middle<00:01:43.539> of<00:01:43.750> all<00:01:43.960> this<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:47.520> well<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:49.450> about<00:01:49.869> a

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
middle of all this and well it's about a

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.490 
middle of all this and well it's about a
10<00:01:50.350> by<00:01:50.590> 20<00:01:50.950> area<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:51.820> I<00:01:52.360> mean<00:01:52.840> one<00:01:52.990> person<00:01:53.380> could

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
10 by 20 area so I mean one person could

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.210 
10 by 20 area so I mean one person could
probably<00:01:53.710> manage<00:01:54.100> it<00:01:54.490> too<00:01:55.179> would<00:01:55.390> help

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
probably manage it too would help

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.770 
probably manage it too would help
anywhere<00:01:57.220> from<00:01:57.399> that<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:57.970> can<00:01:58.330> move<00:01:58.479> this<00:01:58.630> stuff

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
anywhere from that I can move this stuff

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.120 
anywhere from that I can move this stuff
around<00:01:59.080> if<00:01:59.289> I<00:01:59.380> need<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.610> which<00:02:00.610> great<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.710> any

problem for me to grab 10 tons of
cardboard<00:02:57.400> at<00:02:57.549> one<00:02:57.700> time<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.329> no<00:02:58.720> one<00:02:58.870> seemed

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
cardboard at one time and no one seemed

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.240 
cardboard at one time and no one seemed
to<00:02:59.140> care<00:02:59.200> because<00:03:00.160> they<00:03:00.280> all<00:03:00.370> know<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.549> am<00:03:00.700> sold

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250

this<00:03:03.250> stuff<00:03:03.549> right<00:03:04.540> here<00:03:05.040> that's<00:03:06.040> cardboard

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
this stuff right here that's cardboard

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.440 
this stuff right here that's cardboard
it's<00:03:08.140> actually<00:03:08.320> compressed<00:03:08.890> cardboard<00:03:09.459> which

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
it's actually compressed cardboard which

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.490 
it's actually compressed cardboard which
if<00:03:11.320> I<00:03:11.500> put<00:03:11.769> all<00:03:11.799> my<00:03:11.920> weight<00:03:12.100> on<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:13.049> I<00:03:14.049> could

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
if I put all my weight on it I could

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.820 
if I put all my weight on it I could
barely<00:03:14.680> snap<00:03:14.980> us

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
barely snap us

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.490 
barely snap us
so<00:03:19.380> it's<00:03:20.380> actually<00:03:20.560> really<00:03:21.010> durable<00:03:21.400> I've<00:03:21.730> got

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
so it's actually really durable I've got

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.900 
so it's actually really durable I've got
probably<00:03:23.500> about<00:03:26.010> i've<00:03:27.010> got<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.400> graph<00:03:27.610> I've

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
probably about i've got the graph I've

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.700 
probably about i've got the graph I've
got<00:03:28.120> everything<00:03:28.360> I'll<00:03:28.630> figure<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.260> out<00:03:29.350> I

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
got everything I'll figure it out I

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.100 
got everything I'll figure it out I
probably<00:03:30.700> have<00:03:30.940> at<00:03:31.060> least<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.360> good<00:03:31.510> three

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
probably have at least a good three

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.580 
probably have at least a good three
thousand<00:03:32.590> feet<00:03:32.770> of<00:03:32.890> this<00:03:33.010> stuff<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:34.480> I've<00:03:35.380> got

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
thousand feet of this stuff and I've got

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.470 
thousand feet of this stuff and I've got
most<00:03:35.800> of<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.040> wall<00:03:36.220> framework<00:03:36.760> already<00:03:37.210> set

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
most of the wall framework already set

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.900 
most of the wall framework already set
up<00:03:37.660> I've<00:03:38.380> done<00:03:38.680> some<00:03:38.920> building<00:03:39.400> on<00:03:39.550> it<00:03:39.730> I've

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
up I've done some building on it I've

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.990 
up I've done some building on it I've
tested<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.450> out<00:03:40.600> this<00:03:40.840> stuff<00:03:41.080> is<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:42.130> it's

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
tested it out this stuff is just it's

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.760 
tested it out this stuff is just it's
almost<00:03:43.300> a<00:03:43.480> stroke<00:03:43.720> it's<00:03:43.990> probably<00:03:44.350> about<00:03:44.590> as

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
almost a stroke it's probably about as

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.370 
almost a stroke it's probably about as
strong<00:03:45.010> as<00:03:45.190> would<00:03:45.460> a<00:03:46.110> little<00:03:47.110> more<00:03:49.260> easier<00:03:50.260> to

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
strong as would a little more easier to

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.210 
strong as would a little more easier to
snap<00:03:50.710> when<00:03:51.040> it's<00:03:51.190> like<00:03:51.340> this<00:03:51.610> but<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.890> doesn't

snap when it's like this but it doesn't

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.740 
snap when it's like this but it doesn't
need<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.340> be<00:03:54.430> too<00:03:54.700> strong<00:03:55.090> it's<00:03:55.360> only<00:03:55.570> going<00:03:55.690> to

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
need to be too strong it's only going to

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.890
