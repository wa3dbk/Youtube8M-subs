00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
is just that scale walked and looking at

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.690 
is just that scale walked and looking at
you<00:01:41.259> know<00:01:41.380> just<00:01:41.619> isolating<00:01:42.189> both<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.490> them<00:01:42.609> in

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
you know just isolating both of them in

you know just isolating both of them in
the<00:01:42.759> cruiserweight<00:01:43.090> division<00:01:43.209> both<00:01:44.049> of<00:01:44.289> them

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
the cruiserweight division both of them

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.959 
the cruiserweight division both of them
had<00:01:44.560> for<00:01:44.799> two<00:01:44.979> fights<00:01:45.219> are<00:01:45.340> cruiserweight<00:01:45.819> but

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
had for two fights are cruiserweight but

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.209 
had for two fights are cruiserweight but
only<00:01:46.090> one<00:01:46.450> has<00:01:46.749> actually<00:01:47.560> went<00:01:47.919> the<00:01:48.039> distance

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
only one has actually went the distance

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.550 
only one has actually went the distance
which<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:48.759> uh<00:01:48.969> value<00:01:49.659> and<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.079> think<00:01:50.259> his<00:01:50.380> last

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
which is uh value and I think his last

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.749 
which is uh value and I think his last
fight<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.859> was<00:01:50.950> against<00:01:51.249> a<00:01:51.310> guy<00:01:51.459> by<00:01:51.639> the<00:01:51.669> name

wasn't honest even to fighting him but
he's<00:05:27.920> not<00:05:28.070> so<00:05:28.910> I<00:05:29.330> guess<00:05:30.170> what<00:05:30.320> I'm<00:05:30.410> saying<00:05:30.440> is

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
he's not so I guess what I'm saying is

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.290 
he's not so I guess what I'm saying is
I'm<00:05:31.070> giving<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.430> fight<00:05:31.610> to<00:05:31.730> Bell<00:05:31.910> you<00:05:32.090> and

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
I'm giving the fight to Bell you and

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.520 
I'm giving the fight to Bell you and
it's<00:05:32.420> not<00:05:32.540> because<00:05:32.690> he's<00:05:32.930> selling<00:05:33.230> the<00:05:33.320> fight

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
it's not because he's selling the fight

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.260 
it's not because he's selling the fight
for<00:05:34.190> some<00:05:34.370> reason<00:05:34.700> he<00:05:34.760> seems<00:05:34.970> a<00:05:35.090> lot<00:05:35.210> more

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
for some reason he seems a lot more

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.820 
for some reason he seems a lot more
