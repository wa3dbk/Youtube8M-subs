wants<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.710> use<00:01:19.830> his<00:01:19.979> ultimate<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.400> knock<00:01:20.670> you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
wants to use his ultimate to knock you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.760 
wants to use his ultimate to knock you
underneath<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.360> tower<00:01:21.570> notice<00:01:22.439> how<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.619> still

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
underneath the tower notice how we still

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.190 
underneath the tower notice how we still
have<00:01:22.950> meditated<00:01:23.610> meditate<00:01:24.180> reduces<00:01:24.930> damage

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
have meditated meditate reduces damage

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
have meditated meditate reduces damage
done<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.650> by<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> considerable<00:01:26.430> amount<00:01:26.700> so

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
done to you by a considerable amount so

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.260 
done to you by a considerable amount so
if<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.259> use<00:01:29.130> your<00:01:29.250> meditate<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.909> avoid

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
if you can use your meditate to avoid

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.569 
if you can use your meditate to avoid
damage<00:01:30.630> from<00:01:30.689> say<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.229> Gragas<00:01:31.829> ultimate<00:01:32.250> or<00:01:32.430> his

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
damage from say a Gragas ultimate or his

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.520 
damage from say a Gragas ultimate or his
body<00:01:32.729> slam<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.570> should<00:01:33.780> definitely<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.409> that

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
body slam you should definitely do that

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.130 
body slam you should definitely do that
so<00:01:34.860> play<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.390> look<00:01:36.540> at<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> meditates

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
so play it now look at the meditates

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.929 
so play it now look at the meditates
cool<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:37.799> effectively<00:01:38.340> use<00:01:38.490> meditate

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
cool down so we effectively use meditate

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.179 
cool down so we effectively use meditate
at<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> same<00:01:39.600> time<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.020> he<00:01:40.140> altered<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.740> this

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
at the same time that he altered so this

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.120 
at the same time that he altered so this
is<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> really<00:01:41.790> good<00:01:42.150> example<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.930> how<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.860> can

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
is a really good example of how you can

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.550 
is a really good example of how you can
use<00:01:44.250> mastery<00:01:44.700> at<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> higher<00:01:45.299> level<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.200> this

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
use mastery at a higher level so in this

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.260 
use mastery at a higher level so in this
particular<00:01:46.740> case<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.430> pretty<00:01:47.790> low<00:01:48.030> ping

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
particular case we have pretty low ping

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.030 
particular case we have pretty low ping
you<00:01:48.540> see<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:48.960> nine<00:01:49.200> pings<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.890> makes

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
you see we have nine pings so that makes

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.410 
you see we have nine pings so that makes
it<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> lot<00:01:50.250> easier<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.180> pretty<00:01:51.299> good

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it a lot easier and we have pretty good

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.230 
it a lot easier and we have pretty good
reaction<00:01:51.990> time<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.460> you<00:01:53.460> see<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.820> Gragas<00:01:54.119> has

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
reaction time so you see that Gragas has

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.780 
reaction time so you see that Gragas has
390<00:01:54.960> AP<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.740> his<00:01:56.040> ultimate<00:01:56.219> does<00:01:56.610> however

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
390 AP and his ultimate does however

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.090 
390 AP and his ultimate does however
much<00:01:57.119> damage<00:01:57.479> he<00:01:57.810> did<00:01:57.840> 300<00:01:58.290> damage<00:01:58.710> with<00:01:58.979> his

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
much damage he did 300 damage with his

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.889 
much damage he did 300 damage with his
ultimate<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.549> us<00:01:59.640> he<00:01:59.790> did<00:01:59.969> less<00:02:00.240> damage<00:02:00.689> than

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
ultimate to us he did less damage than

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.740 
ultimate to us he did less damage than
he<00:02:01.290> has<00:02:01.500> AP<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.460> know<00:02:02.610> his<00:02:03.270> ultimate<00:02:03.630> has

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
he has AP and you know his ultimate has

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.870 
he has AP and you know his ultimate has
a<00:02:03.780> decent<00:02:04.140> AP<00:02:04.500> ratio<00:02:04.799> or<00:02:05.009> did<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:05.700> he's

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
a decent AP ratio or did because he's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.059 
a decent AP ratio or did because he's
been<00:02:06.060> remade<00:02:06.299> recently<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.350> here<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.590> go<00:02:07.710> now

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
been remade recently so here we go now

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.619 
been remade recently so here we go now
notice<00:02:08.369> how<00:02:08.459> we<00:02:08.520> fly<00:02:08.789> under<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> tower<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.599> my

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
notice how we fly under the tower and my

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.300 
notice how we fly under the tower and my
screen<00:02:09.959> stays<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.410> place<00:02:10.619> now<00:02:11.069> there's<00:02:11.250> a

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
screen stays in place now there's a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.559 
screen stays in place now there's a
special<00:02:11.670> reason<00:02:11.760> for<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.450> that's

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
special reason for this and that's

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.610 
special reason for this and that's
because<00:02:12.900> when<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.230> get

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
because when you get

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.160 
because when you get
like<00:02:13.680> underneath<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.400> tower<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.750> screen

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
like underneath the tower and the screen

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.199 
like underneath the tower and the screen
is<00:02:16.200> still<00:02:16.440> here<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.459> don't<00:02:17.580> want<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.879> move

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
is still here and you don't want to move

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.270 
is still here and you don't want to move
until<00:02:18.870> you're<00:02:18.989> confident<00:02:19.500> enough<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.860> move<00:02:20.010> so

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
until you're confident enough to move so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.880 
until you're confident enough to move so
in<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:21.180> case<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.569> keep<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.110> screen<00:02:22.440> still

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
in this case I keep the screen still

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.250 
in this case I keep the screen still
until<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.670> see<00:02:24.030> Gragas<00:02:24.480> get<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.780> top<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.140> me<00:02:25.230> and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
until I see Gragas get on top of me and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.350 
until I see Gragas get on top of me and
I<00:02:25.560> start<00:02:25.830> Auto<00:02:25.950> attacking<00:02:26.280> him<00:02:26.549> again<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:27.150> is

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
I start Auto attacking him again this is

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.820 
I start Auto attacking him again this is
really<00:02:27.629> crucial<00:02:27.810> because<00:02:28.049> you<00:02:28.349> want<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.620> start

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
really crucial because you want to start

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.740 
really crucial because you want to start
Auto<00:02:29.040> detecting<00:02:29.459> immediately<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.420> get<00:02:30.599> your

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
Auto detecting immediately to get your

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.119 
Auto detecting immediately to get your
alpha<00:02:30.900> strike<00:02:31.200> off<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.409> cool-down<00:02:31.709> because

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
alpha strike off a cool-down because

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.410 
alpha strike off a cool-down because
without<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.549> strike<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.879> can<00:02:33.000> dodge<00:02:33.150> tower

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
without the strike you can dodge tower

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.330 
without the strike you can dodge tower
projectiles<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.140> do<00:02:34.290> more<00:02:34.440> damage<00:02:34.829> you<00:02:34.980> can

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
projectiles you do more damage you can

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.309 
projectiles you do more damage you can
get<00:02:35.489> out<00:02:35.579> of<00:02:35.610> life<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.090> now<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.840> am<00:02:37.110> hitting

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
get out of life so now that I am hitting

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.170 
get out of life so now that I am hitting
Gragas<00:02:37.890> again<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.340> can<00:02:38.579> move<00:02:38.730> my<00:02:38.940> camera

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
Gragas again I can move my camera

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.170 
Gragas again I can move my camera
because<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:40.049> know<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.129> can<00:02:41.340> hit<00:02:41.519> him<00:02:41.730> if<00:02:42.000> I

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
because I know that I can hit him if I

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.399 
because I know that I can hit him if I
move<00:02:42.329> my<00:02:42.360> camera<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.959> not<00:02:43.110> going<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.319> be

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
move my camera is not going to be

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.050 
move my camera is not going to be
sensitive<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.920> where<00:02:44.190> he<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.340> because<00:02:44.700> we're

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
sensitive to where he is because we're

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.119 
sensitive to where he is because we're
already<00:02:45.209> Auto<00:02:45.569> attacking<00:02:46.019> him<00:02:46.109> now<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.950> see

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
already Auto attacking him now you see

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.630 
already Auto attacking him now you see
