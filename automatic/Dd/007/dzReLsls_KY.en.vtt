00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.880 
want to do better than this okay so
let's<00:00:32.009> use<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.090> grid<00:00:33.360> system<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> grid

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
let's use a grid system and the grid

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.290 
let's use a grid system and the grid
system<00:00:35.190> we're<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.610> using<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.180> if

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
system we're going to be using and if

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.760 
system we're going to be using and if
you<00:00:36.420> remember<00:00:36.690> from<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.870> first<00:00:36.989> day<00:00:37.350> deal<00:00:37.559> is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you remember from the first day deal is

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.639 
you remember from the first day deal is
a<00:00:38.190> security<00:00:38.550> system<00:00:38.760> which<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.300> had<00:00:40.290> created

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
a security system which I had created

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.979 
a security system which I had created
myself<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.280> as<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.180> said<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.570> inspired<00:00:42.899> by

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
myself and as I said it was inspired by

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.600 
myself and as I said it was inspired by
Twitter<00:00:43.379> bootstrap<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.219> my<00:00:44.370> github

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
Twitter bootstrap and is that my github

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.020 
Twitter bootstrap and is that my github
page<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.360> we'll<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.570> go<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> github.com<00:00:47.030> for

how<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.520> great<00:00:56.820> system<00:00:57.149> works<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.760> is

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
how the great system works so this is

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.540 
how the great system works so this is
how<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.239> works<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.829> if<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.039> want<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.520> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
different columns in your grid allows

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.190 
different columns in your grid allows
you<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> resize<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> screen<00:01:29.960> items<00:01:30.960> get

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you to resize the screen items get

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.109 
you to resize the screen items get
smaller<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.340> say<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.549> don't<00:01:32.850> want<00:01:33.030> it

smaller and you can say I don't want it

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.319 
smaller and you can say I don't want it
to<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.950> whole<00:01:35.130> width<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.729> screen<00:01:35.850> even

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
to be the whole width of the screen even

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.940 
to be the whole width of the screen even
at<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.509> smaller<00:01:36.750> size<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.710> here

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
so so that's it we're going to use this

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.190 
so so that's it we're going to use this
system<00:01:45.010> now<00:01:45.910> to<00:01:45.970> show<00:01:46.210> you<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.840> different

system now to show you the different

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.790 
system now to show you the different
tags<00:01:48.190> as<00:01:48.460> we're<00:01:48.670> going<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.540> in<00:01:50.140> this<00:01:50.350> video<00:01:50.530> we

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
tags as we're going so in this video we

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.560 
tags as we're going so in this video we
all<00:01:51.010> we're<00:01:51.190> going<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.400> do<00:01:51.550> is<00:01:51.790> just<00:01:51.820> download

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
all we're going to do is just download

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.630 
all we're going to do is just download
the<00:01:52.750> grid<00:01:52.960> system<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.620> include<00:01:53.980> it<00:01:54.010> into<00:01:54.340> our

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
the grid system and include it into our
