00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.470
Eel BBQ! I am at a restaurant whose name is  'Eel BBQ restauraint' in Wangsimli, Seoul.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.420
The secret of this restaurant is that

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.970
the most popular menu is Kimchi jjigae(Kimchi soup), not Eel BBQ.(actually I've never seen people eating Eel BBQ)

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.120
And the Kimchi Jjigae here is one of the Best!

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:37.870
Let's take a look!

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.190
White rice, and Red Kimchi Jjigae!

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.900
It looks so delicious.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:01:01.130
It has lots of pork in the Jjigae

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:09.210
Put some kimchi on rice...

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.390
And the giant friend egg comes with the JJigae when you order Kimchi jjigae, and it's for free.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.110
'the giant friend egg'

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:28.950
with some Ketchup

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:40.930
It is actually more fantastic than I expected from a eel BBQ restaurant

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:53.940
The war is over....

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.600
It was great, and I'm sleepy because I had too much.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.900
I really enjoyed, visit sometimes to have it

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.700
Why don't you try Kimchi jjigae in an Eel BBQ restaurant?
