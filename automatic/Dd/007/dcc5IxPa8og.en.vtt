 the boys are still me at you owe food 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.660
 first I know such episode traditions 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.110
 but it does nothing 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.820
 however today I will show you a beautiful 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.230
 game of magic that is made with water e 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.750
 a glass 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.420
 let's go see my will boys 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.200
 we are here then you see what two 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.870
 glasses and then one empty and the other 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.090
 full of water 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.129
 then here they are immediately taken 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.309
 what of water and pouring into the water 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.309
 in the empty one without letting it fall 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.240
 we are doing it did it 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.350
 this is precisely because the glass of eyes 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.450
 perfect fact now want to see 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.340
 the water that filled the glass 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:27.240
 yet empty yet a magic gesture is enough 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.240
 that logically 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:45.310
 brings out a fact that can played ok 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.310
 a completely dry handkerchief 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.000

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.760
 and then I wanted to talk to you about another 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.780
 what you guys can do 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:15.200
 ask me if you wish if I want to do 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:19.489
