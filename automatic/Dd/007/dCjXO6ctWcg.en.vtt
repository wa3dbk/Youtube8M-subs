00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.289
 which make the eighth 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.329
 easy though 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.480
 save even more 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.529
 because what they are good at 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.529
 but about communicating 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.689
 I do not get it 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.119
 but left 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.289
 yes I know 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.289
 the project d 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.610
 but not good either 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.890
 wilders it is restless 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.890
 learn something 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.710
 for the spurters 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.250
 lesser-known reading 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.470
 because I read that in 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.290
 that would mean the unions coming 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.390
 how you dare to climb both animals 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 you see that in the swan lake 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 the reading makes it difficult to see the grasp 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.710
 and who is certain 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.960
 before you go 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.810
 starting with that i have worked 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.230
 the woman turned out to be a bit others 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.880
 good reason 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.790
 That's why you often see many more people at the bottom of the climbing wall, the son of others 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.790
 these are you must be satisfied with the wind 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.840
 the pee area 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.950
 After this, it will first be in the bank 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.000
 first on the couch 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.020
 find what 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.440
 for itching 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.259
 at the time 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.480
 you've got a point 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.140
 the man also suffered 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 I didn't because we give an example 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.950
 it's good here 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.670
 to underline 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.930
 then we actually go from 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.200
 also tries to end 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.040
 you put your character 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 they also gained a lot of ease 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.840
 get out yourself 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 with this 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.270
 well 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.180
 I am 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:09.669
 not all 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.669
 No 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.739
 exactly for that reason 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.089
 what they do for traffic 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:29.879
 were in space 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.319
 to continue too much 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.489
 it is a bit busy 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.399
 with both feet anp 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:37.539
 traffic to more 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.659
 I think neither of these camps are used either 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.429
 but if you do his job then 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:47.219
 you feel that his account 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.249
 down 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.249
 got his petting zoo to mountains 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.189
 it is all very well 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.469
 that's it too 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.469
 fallen beside the dead 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:03.779
 check check double check 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:04.769
 always recorded
