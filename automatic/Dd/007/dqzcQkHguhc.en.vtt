00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.320
 a rising his bikini weavers are making decorated stones 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.069
 I show them here that you but a chain linked 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.019
 but before it starts to knit, all the stones on the variety of 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.039
 threaded 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.179
 is the 3rd 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.099
 Many show there in many colors and fortified 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.519
 Make sure that you come to Lichtenstein 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 it lives a piece of special trucks cut off and threaded as well 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.730
 he reinforces the colors in the place where the quietest is hung 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.910
 now one half will be threaded 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.470
 before they fell back through the first stone 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.530
 and to finally fixate on this you have to be careful that 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.670
 enough time on both ends of the missing stones available 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 is 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.040
 after they have played back through the stone they start with the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.040
 Buttons knot 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.150
 Take a pair of tweezers to help you close the still open knot 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
 To pull stone 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
 Now they can make rocks 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.490
 back to the second stone around 70 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.020
 and make a knot again 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.410
 this is going on for so long now 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.410
 that no stones are more interesting 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.700
 If you want to refine your technique, take a sip 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 that his work already 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.279
 the closer they get to the knot at the stone block animals that the students and 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.189
 the chain becomes uniform so that it distances between the stones 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.189
 prevent 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.479
 if all the stones with the nodes 50 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:55.589
 many for the last three stones they left in the beginning 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.169
 again a piece of spiral track is cut off 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.169
 and with the second half of that he closes on the big bucks 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.739
 Now it goes back through the first stone 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.739
 make a knot 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.519
 then the second stone 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.469
 this is also knotted 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:15.469
 just go through the stairs and go through the rides 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.459
 a totally Madeja buy the last two knots and fix 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:30.489
