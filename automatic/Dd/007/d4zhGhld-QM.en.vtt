he's as strong as Optimus Prime x-brawn

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.780 
he's as strong as Optimus Prime x-brawn
well<00:02:09.490> probably<00:02:10.210> they<00:02:10.450> are<00:02:10.600> brothers<00:02:11.080> at<00:02:11.260> all<00:02:11.380> I

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
well probably they are brothers at all I

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.250 
well probably they are brothers at all I
still<00:02:12.790> find<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.540> little<00:02:13.630> hard<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:14.080> swallow

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260

let's<00:02:15.010> see<00:02:15.250> if<00:02:15.880> Prime<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.390> older<00:02:16.720> than<00:02:16.810> Magnus

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350

let's see if Prime is older than Magnus
then<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.710> guess<00:02:17.920> it's<00:02:18.160> true<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.460> little

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
then I guess it's true that little

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.640 
then I guess it's true that little
