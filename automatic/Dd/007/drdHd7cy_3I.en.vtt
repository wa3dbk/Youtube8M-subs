for<00:00:09.389> quite<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> few<00:00:09.929> days<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.650> tried<00:00:10.889> in

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
for quite a few days and I tried in

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.650 
for quite a few days and I tried in
different<00:00:11.099> situations<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.240> just<00:00:12.450> wanted

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
different situations and I just wanted

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.709 
different situations and I just wanted
to<00:00:12.809> give<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.080> my<00:00:13.110> feedback<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.969> here's

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
to give you my feedback on it so here's

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.990 
to give you my feedback on it so here's
the<00:00:15.780> case<00:00:16.070> which<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.190> really<00:00:17.460> liked

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
the case which I really liked

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.490 
the case which I really liked
it's<00:00:18.480> very<00:00:18.660> low<00:00:18.840> profile<00:00:19.230> what<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
it's very low profile what the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.960 
it's very low profile what the
headphones<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.010> there<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.460> makes<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.760> easy

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
headphones in there so it makes it easy

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.300 
headphones in there so it makes it easy
to<00:00:21.090> pack<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.750> backpack<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.189> don't

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
to pack it in a backpack and you don't

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.560 
to pack it in a backpack and you don't
have<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.460> worry<00:00:23.640> about<00:00:23.699> squishing<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.330> since

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
have to worry about squishing it since

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.349 
have to worry about squishing it since
the<00:00:24.720> headphones<00:00:25.140> actually<00:00:25.890> come<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.430> flat<00:00:26.670> you

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
the headphones actually come in flat you

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.370 
the headphones actually come in flat you
know<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:28.230> doesn't<00:00:28.470> bulge<00:00:28.830> out<00:00:29.010> inside<00:00:29.369> there

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
know it doesn't bulge out inside there

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.450 
know it doesn't bulge out inside there
one<00:00:31.380> thing<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.560> might<00:00:31.679> notice<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.250> I

one thing you might notice is that I

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.580 
one thing you might notice is that I

with<00:00:34.710> another<00:00:35.040> band<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.640> says<00:00:36.000> large<00:00:36.420> on

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
with another band and it says large on

the top of it right there the other one
that<00:00:39.239> comes<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.840> comes<00:00:40.020> already

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
that comes the one that comes already

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.729 
that comes the one that comes already
installed<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> size<00:00:41.309> small<00:00:42.379> it<00:00:43.379> fits<00:00:43.440> my

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
installed is a size small it fits my

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.440 
installed is a size small it fits my
head<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> larger<00:00:45.030> head<00:00:45.149> than<00:00:45.329> most

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
head but I have a larger head than most

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.569 
head but I have a larger head than most
people<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.079> tried<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> large<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
people so I tried the large one and I

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.970 
people so I tried the large one and I
feel<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:47.969> more<00:00:48.149> comfortable<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.980> so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
feel a little more comfortable in it so

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.630 
feel a little more comfortable in it so
you<00:00:50.070> could<00:00:50.190> see<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> size<00:00:50.610> difference

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you could see the size difference

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.590 
you could see the size difference
between<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.480> large<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.170> small<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.850> yeah

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
between the large and the small so yeah

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.680 
between the large and the small so yeah
that's<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> difference<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:56.690> okay

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
that's the difference right there okay

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.799 
that's the difference right there okay
so<00:00:58.020> first<00:00:58.289> off<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:59.340> test<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.180> right

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
so first off I test this in right

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.789 
so first off I test this in right
situations<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.800> uh<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:03.229> tried<00:01:04.229> about<00:01:04.350> working

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
situations and uh I tried about working

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.280 
situations and uh I tried about working
out<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.220> tried<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.850> at<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> party<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.020> tried<00:01:07.200> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
out I tried it at a party and I tried it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.830 
out I tried it at a party and I tried it
in<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.409> quiet<00:01:07.560> situation<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.210> all<00:01:09.330> three<00:01:09.570> I

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
in a quiet situation so in all three I

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.649 
in a quiet situation so in all three I
thought<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.860> sound<00:01:11.070> was<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.580> great<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
thought the sound was really great it

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.840 
thought the sound was really great it
doesn't<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.260> any<00:01:14.689> as<00:01:15.689> far<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.640> sound<00:01:17.640> out

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
doesn't have any as far as sound out

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.390 
doesn't have any as far as sound out
sound<00:01:18.330> isolating<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.799> they're<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.189> sound

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
sound isolating it they're not sound

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.190 
sound isolating it they're not sound
isolating<00:01:20.759> earphones<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.570> still<00:01:21.810> hear<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
isolating earphones I can still hear the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
isolating earphones I can still hear the
outside<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> got<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> party<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:23.970> not<00:01:24.150> bad<00:01:24.420> I

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
outside I got a party but it's not bad I

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.120 
outside I got a party but it's not bad I
mean<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.960> still<00:01:25.110> hear<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.710> music<00:01:25.799> very

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
mean I can still hear the music very

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.960 
mean I can still hear the music very
well<00:01:27.770> another<00:01:28.770> thing<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.490> point

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
well another thing that I have to point

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.330 
well another thing that I have to point
out<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.720> volume<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.650> these

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
out is that the volume on these

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.770 
out is that the volume on these
headphones<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:32.850> separate<00:01:33.240> from<00:01:33.329> your<00:01:33.509> phone

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
headphones are separate from your phone

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.410 
headphones are separate from your phone
so<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.280> max<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:35.790> phone's<00:01:36.000> volume

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
so you can max out your phone's volume

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.600 
so you can max out your phone's volume
and<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.409> max<00:01:37.680> out<00:01:37.799> these<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.159> well

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and you can max out these as well

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.149 
and you can max out these as well
so<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.990> actually<00:01:40.350> going<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.799> pumps<00:01:41.040> out

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
so this actually going to pumps out

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.889 
so this actually going to pumps out
louder<00:01:41.400> than<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.060> guess<00:01:42.570> some<00:01:42.750> other

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
louder than I guess some other

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.380 
louder than I guess some other
headphones<00:01:43.710> where<00:01:44.670> when<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> change<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
headphones where when you change the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.760 
headphones where when you change the
volume<00:01:45.479> here<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.930> actually<00:01:46.200> changes<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.649> your

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
volume here it actually changes on your

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.170 
volume here it actually changes on your
phone<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.280> no<00:01:47.460> these<00:01:47.700> are<00:01:47.820> two<00:01:48.000> different

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.400 
this and I was like oh my gosh it broke
it<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:19.239> can<00:03:19.390> see<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.720> speaker<00:03:20.050> inside

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
it and you can see the speaker inside

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.900 
it and you can see the speaker inside
there<00:03:20.650> but<00:03:20.890> these<00:03:21.489> are<00:03:21.640> actually

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
there but these are actually

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.340 
there but these are actually
magnetically<00:03:22.480> connected<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.110> just<00:03:23.230> go<00:03:23.320> like

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
magnetically connected so I just go like

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.120 
magnetically connected so I just go like
this<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:25.330> just<00:03:25.510> connects<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:26.769> thought

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
this and it just connects so I thought

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.350 
this and it just connects so I thought

that was pretty cool I'm not sure why

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.240 
that was pretty cool I'm not sure why

give it a 7 out of 10 only because

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.759 
give it a 7 out of 10 only because
these<00:04:19.790> button<00:04:20.150> placements<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:21.320> is<00:04:21.500> on<00:04:21.650> the

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
these button placements this is on the

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.760 
these button placements this is on the
left<00:04:21.950> side<00:04:22.190> of<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.639> of<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.360> headphone<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:23.990> it

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
left side of the of the headphone and it

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.410 
left side of the of the headphone and it
feels<00:04:25.040> kind<00:04:25.310> of<00:04:25.400> weird<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.820> reach<00:04:26.000> back<00:04:26.270> with

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
feels kind of weird to reach back with

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.030 
feels kind of weird to reach back with
your<00:04:26.480> left<00:04:26.780> hand<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.139> push<00:04:27.470> this<00:04:27.680> with<00:04:27.889> your

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
your left hand and push this with your

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.070 
your left hand and push this with your
thumb<00:04:28.070> behind<00:04:28.730> your<00:04:28.880> head<00:04:29.060> it's<00:04:29.840> kind<00:04:30.050> of

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
thumb behind your head it's kind of

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.570 
thumb behind your head it's kind of
awkward<00:04:30.320> placement<00:04:30.980> I<00:04:31.070> kind<00:04:31.280> of<00:04:31.370> wish<00:04:31.550> that

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
awkward placement I kind of wish that

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.790 
awkward placement I kind of wish that
these<00:04:32.030> buttons<00:04:32.270> were<00:04:32.630> on<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:32.990> other<00:04:33.139> side<00:04:33.470> on

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
these buttons were on the other side on

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800 
these buttons were on the other side on
the<00:04:34.220> front<00:04:34.490> here<00:04:34.669> so<00:04:35.210> if<00:04:35.300> you<00:04:35.360> want<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.570> solve

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
the front here so if you want to solve

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.060 
the front here so if you want to solve
this<00:04:35.900> problem<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.410> could<00:04:36.560> just<00:04:36.710> flip<00:04:36.889> it<00:04:36.950> like

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
this problem you could just flip it like

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.129 
this problem you could just flip it like
this<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.639> I<00:04:38.240> think<00:04:38.450> it'd<00:04:38.510> be<00:04:38.570> great<00:04:38.690> but<00:04:38.990> then

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
this and I think it'd be great but then

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.560 
this and I think it'd be great but then
your<00:04:39.260> microphone<00:04:39.620> will<00:04:39.740> be<00:04:39.830> on<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.010> back<00:04:40.190> so<00:04:41.180> I

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
your microphone will be on the back so I

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.570 
your microphone will be on the back so I
don't<00:04:41.960> know<00:04:42.200> maybe<00:04:42.740> it's<00:04:42.919> just<00:04:43.010> me<00:04:43.190> it's<00:04:43.400> like

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
don't know maybe it's just me it's like

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.860 
don't know maybe it's just me it's like
it<00:04:43.730> was<00:04:43.820> designed<00:04:44.120> for<00:04:44.240> a<00:04:44.330> left-handed<00:04:44.690> person

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
it was designed for a left-handed person

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.750 
it was designed for a left-handed person
but<00:04:45.350> I<00:04:45.590> think<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:46.040> point<00:04:46.220> is<00:04:46.250> she'd<00:04:46.460> be<00:04:46.550> on<00:04:46.639> the

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
but I think the point is she'd be on the

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.810 
but I think the point is she'd be on the
right<00:04:46.940> front<00:04:48.100> other<00:04:49.100> than<00:04:49.280> that<00:04:49.370> let's<00:04:49.669> see

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
right front other than that let's see

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.110 
right front other than that let's see
the<00:04:49.970> plain<00:04:50.450> pause<00:04:50.660> buttons<00:04:51.730> there's<00:04:52.730> a<00:04:52.790> slight

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
the plain pause buttons there's a slight

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.120 
the plain pause buttons there's a slight
increase<00:04:53.960> a<00:04:54.169> little<00:04:54.350> like<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:54.710> little<00:04:54.890> dimple

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
increase a little like a little dimple

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.770 
increase a little like a little dimple
of<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.520> button<00:04:55.850> so<00:04:55.970> you<00:04:56.060> can<00:04:56.120> kind<00:04:56.450> of<00:04:56.570> tell

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
of the button so you can kind of tell

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.080 
of the button so you can kind of tell
which<00:04:56.960> button<00:04:57.260> you're<00:04:57.350> pressing<00:04:57.740> but<00:04:58.030> for<00:04:59.030> the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
which button you're pressing but for the

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.550 
which button you're pressing but for the
most<00:04:59.270> of<00:04:59.390> time<00:04:59.540> when<00:05:00.050> I'm<00:05:00.140> reaching<00:05:00.290> back

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
most of time when I'm reaching back

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.690 
most of time when I'm reaching back
there<00:05:00.740> I<00:05:00.860> can't<00:05:01.100> tell<00:05:01.220> which<00:05:01.340> button<00:05:01.610> I'm

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
there I can't tell which button I'm

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.310 
there I can't tell which button I'm
pressing<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.210> only<00:05:02.330> way<00:05:02.480> I<00:05:02.510> know<00:05:02.630> is<00:05:03.020> that

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
pressing and the only way I know is that

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.320 
pressing and the only way I know is that
I<00:05:03.350> run<00:05:03.650> my<00:05:03.980> finger<00:05:04.280> from<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.460> top<00:05:04.669> and<00:05:04.940> the

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
I run my finger from the top and the

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.600 
I run my finger from the top and the
first<00:05:05.510> thing<00:05:05.720> I<00:05:05.780> hit<00:05:06.020> is<00:05:06.530> gonna<00:05:06.830> only<00:05:07.400> know

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
first thing I hit is gonna only know

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.550 
first thing I hit is gonna only know
that<00:05:07.760> that's<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.240> increase<00:05:08.930> in<00:05:09.050> volume<00:05:09.260> and

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
that that's the increase in volume and

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.409 
that that's the increase in volume and
the<00:05:09.980> one<00:05:10.100> after<00:05:10.220> that<00:05:10.340> will<00:05:10.610> be<00:05:10.729> my<00:05:10.880> play<00:05:11.150> or

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
the one after that will be my play or

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.469 
the one after that will be my play or
pause<00:05:11.750> or<00:05:12.229> change<00:05:12.680> track<00:05:12.970> but<00:05:13.970> in<00:05:14.090> that<00:05:14.210> I<00:05:14.240> can

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
pause or change track but in that I can

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:15.850 
pause or change track but in that I can
just<00:05:14.630> go<00:05:14.720> quickly<00:05:14.930> back<00:05:15.169> there<00:05:15.320> and<00:05:15.470> press<00:05:15.680> it

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
just go quickly back there and press it

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.320 
just go quickly back there and press it
it's<00:05:16.040> hard<00:05:16.220> to<00:05:16.280> tell<00:05:16.430> which<00:05:16.640> button<00:05:17.030> is<00:05:17.210> the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
it's hard to tell which button is the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.780 
it's hard to tell which button is the
one<00:05:17.360> you're<00:05:17.600> pressing<00:05:18.460> so<00:05:19.460> that's<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.669> only

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
one you're pressing so that's the only

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.879 
one you're pressing so that's the only
thing<00:05:19.940> like<00:05:19.970> my<00:05:20.419> one<00:05:20.600> of<00:05:20.630> my<00:05:20.720> gripes<00:05:20.990> about<00:05:21.139> the

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
thing like my one of my gripes about the

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.310 
thing like my one of my gripes about the
button<00:05:22.130> placement<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.850> how<00:05:23.750> you<00:05:24.020> can't

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
button placement and how you can't

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.580 
button placement and how you can't
really<00:05:24.500> tell<00:05:24.770> which<00:05:24.919> button<00:05:25.250> you're<00:05:25.370> pressing

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
really tell which button you're pressing

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.840 
really tell which button you're pressing
as<00:05:27.590> far<00:05:27.800> as<00:05:27.890> pairing<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.310> Bluetooth<00:05:28.669> I

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
as far as pairing the Bluetooth I

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.550 
as far as pairing the Bluetooth I
thought<00:05:29.120> it<00:05:29.330> was<00:05:29.419> very<00:05:29.479> easy<00:05:29.840> you<00:05:30.320> just<00:05:30.350> have

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
thought it was very easy you just have

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.590 
thought it was very easy you just have
to<00:05:30.650> turn<00:05:30.800> on<00:05:30.979> Bluetooth<00:05:31.940> button<00:05:32.210> which<00:05:32.479> is

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
to turn on Bluetooth button which is

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.990 
to turn on Bluetooth button which is
down<00:05:32.750> here<00:05:32.780> it<00:05:33.140> says<00:05:33.200> BT<00:05:33.770> it's<00:05:34.520> very<00:05:34.669> easy<00:05:34.850> to

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
down here it says BT it's very easy to

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.600 
down here it says BT it's very easy to
turn<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.270> on<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:35.630> it<00:05:36.260> pairs<00:05:36.470> very<00:05:36.590> easily<00:05:36.950> the

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
turn it on and it pairs very easily the

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.159 
turn it on and it pairs very easily the
only<00:05:37.760> thing<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.510> problem<00:05:38.750> with<00:05:38.870> this<00:05:38.990> is

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
only thing that the problem with this is

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:40.510 
only thing that the problem with this is
that<00:05:39.200> this<00:05:39.590> power<00:05:39.860> button<00:05:40.070> which<00:05:40.310> is<00:05:40.370> the

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
that this power button which is the

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.520 
that this power button which is the
Bluetooth<00:05:40.700> button<00:05:41.060> it<00:05:41.870> doesn't<00:05:42.229> tell<00:05:42.380> you

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
Bluetooth button it doesn't tell you

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
anywhere else that it's on so if I hold

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.210 
anywhere else that it's on so if I hold
my<00:05:44.450> finger<00:05:44.720> down<00:05:44.840> to<00:05:44.900> turn<00:05:45.140> it<00:05:45.260> on<00:05:45.380> it<00:05:46.070> actually

batteries which are talkative

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:34.770 
batteries which are talkative
the<00:06:29.240> number<00:06:29.479> one<00:06:29.570> reason<00:06:29.720> why<00:06:29.900> you<00:06:30.050> use<00:06:30.169> these

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.060 

oh<00:06:35.780> yeah<00:06:36.110> by<00:06:36.230> the<00:06:36.260> way<00:06:36.380> they<00:06:36.560> can<00:06:36.710> only<00:06:36.830> go<00:06:36.980> in

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
oh yeah by the way they can only go in

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.380 
oh yeah by the way they can only go in
one<00:06:37.100> way<00:06:37.280> these<00:06:37.580> two<00:06:37.790> auxiliaries<00:06:38.210> are

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
one way these two auxiliaries are

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.620 
one way these two auxiliaries are
different<00:06:38.930> size<00:06:39.140> you<00:06:39.530> can<00:06:39.710> see<00:06:40.210> one<00:06:41.210> goes<00:06:41.450> into

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
different size you can see one goes into

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.600 
different size you can see one goes into
here<00:06:41.840> it's<00:06:42.170> a<00:06:42.230> smaller<00:06:42.530> exhilarating<00:06:42.980> but<00:06:43.430> is

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
here it's a smaller exhilarating but is

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.820 
here it's a smaller exhilarating but is
that<00:06:43.760> if<00:06:44.450> you<00:06:44.600> decide<00:06:44.960> to<00:06:44.990> use<00:06:45.170> auxilary<00:06:45.530> and

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
that if you decide to use auxilary and

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.520 
that if you decide to use auxilary and
this<00:06:46.070> is<00:06:46.220> not<00:06:46.400> power<00:06:46.670> you<00:06:47.240> can't<00:06:47.510> use<00:06:47.840> the<00:06:48.260> play

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
this is not power you can't use the play

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.420 
this is not power you can't use the play
and<00:06:49.300> volume<00:06:50.300> buttons<00:06:50.740> they<00:06:51.740> no<00:06:51.890> longer<00:06:51.920> work

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
and volume buttons they no longer work

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.690 
and volume buttons they no longer work
so<00:06:53.410> yeah<00:06:54.410> and<00:06:54.680> you<00:06:54.830> also<00:06:54.980> can't<00:06:55.250> pick<00:06:55.400> up<00:06:55.460> calls

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
so yeah and you also can't pick up calls

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.360 
so yeah and you also can't pick up calls
when<00:06:55.910> you're<00:06:56.000> using<00:06:56.150> an<00:06:56.300> auxilary<00:06:56.600> too<00:06:57.370> so

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
when you're using an auxilary too so

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.590 
when you're using an auxilary too so
that's<00:06:58.640> one<00:06:58.790> of<00:06:58.820> the<00:06:58.910> what's<00:06:59.270> one<00:06:59.450> of<00:06:59.480> the

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600 
that's one of the what's one of the

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.790 
that's one of the what's one of the
things<00:06:59.780> you've<00:06:59.930> got<00:07:00.050> to<00:07:00.140> consider<00:07:00.260> that<00:07:00.530> if

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
things you've got to consider that if

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.470 
things you've got to consider that if
you<00:07:00.920> decide<00:07:01.070> to<00:07:01.220> use<00:07:01.430> this<00:07:01.550> only<00:07:01.760> for<00:07:02.270> the

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:02.480 
you decide to use this only for the

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.750 
you decide to use this only for the
facility<00:07:03.080> you<00:07:03.740> can't<00:07:04.010> change<00:07:04.280> the<00:07:04.430> volume<00:07:04.550> if

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:04.760 
facility you can't change the volume if

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.920 
facility you can't change the volume if
you<00:07:04.820> can't<00:07:05.030> change<00:07:05.210> tracks<00:07:07.780> some<00:07:08.780> of<00:07:08.870> the

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 
you can't change tracks some of the

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.970 
you can't change tracks some of the
things<00:07:09.140> that<00:07:09.230> were<00:07:09.650> pretty<00:07:09.800> cool<00:07:10.070> was<00:07:10.370> that

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:11.980 
things that were pretty cool was that

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.320 
things that were pretty cool was that
the<00:07:12.980> charging<00:07:13.340> cable<00:07:13.460> uses<00:07:14.000> the<00:07:14.090> same

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
the charging cable uses the same

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.440 
the charging cable uses the same
auxiliary<00:07:14.920> port<00:07:15.920> and<00:07:16.190> you<00:07:16.820> could<00:07:16.940> use<00:07:17.060> any<00:07:17.270> USB

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
auxiliary port and you could use any USB

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.170 
auxiliary port and you could use any USB
charger<00:07:18.020> I'm<00:07:18.110> using<00:07:18.290> this<00:07:18.440> Apple<00:07:18.830> plug<00:07:19.430> to

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
charger I'm using this Apple plug to

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.210 
charger I'm using this Apple plug to
connect<00:07:20.480> it<00:07:20.630> but<00:07:21.410> charging<00:07:21.830> takes<00:07:22.070> roughly

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:22.220 
connect it but charging takes roughly

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.640 
connect it but charging takes roughly
about<00:07:22.460> two<00:07:22.760> hours<00:07:23.120> but<00:07:23.450> in<00:07:23.600> my<00:07:23.750> testing<00:07:24.500> it

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 
about two hours but in my testing it

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.530 
about two hours but in my testing it
took<00:07:24.830> about<00:07:24.950> an<00:07:25.190> hour<00:07:25.220> and<00:07:25.790> a<00:07:25.850> half<00:07:26.000> at<00:07:26.300> most

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.540 
took about an hour and a half at most

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.780 
took about an hour and a half at most
and<00:07:26.900> the<00:07:27.830> battery<00:07:28.130> life<00:07:28.280> is<00:07:28.310> really<00:07:28.520> good<00:07:28.730> I

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:28.790 
and the battery life is really good I

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.180 
and the battery life is really good I
know<00:07:28.970> I<00:07:29.240> couldn't<00:07:29.480> use<00:07:30.440> it<00:07:30.470> long<00:07:30.710> enough<00:07:31.010> to

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.190 
know I couldn't use it long enough to

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.860 
know I couldn't use it long enough to
drain<00:07:31.670> the<00:07:31.790> battery<00:07:31.940> and<00:07:32.330> I<00:07:32.390> used<00:07:32.570> this<00:07:32.690> for

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:32.870 
drain the battery and I used this for

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.290 
drain the battery and I used this for
about<00:07:32.960> maybe<00:07:33.170> four<00:07:33.530> or<00:07:33.560> five<00:07:33.800> hours<00:07:34.070> straight

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
about maybe four or five hours straight

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.990 
about maybe four or five hours straight
while<00:07:35.300> studying<00:07:35.750> I<00:07:35.990> never<00:07:36.800> got<00:07:37.040> the<00:07:37.310> the<00:07:37.790> sound

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 
while studying I never got the the sound

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.220 
while studying I never got the the sound
effects<00:07:38.270> of<00:07:38.420> letting<00:07:38.660> me<00:07:38.720> know<00:07:38.750> that<00:07:38.900> it's

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:39.230 
effects of letting me know that it's

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.370 
effects of letting me know that it's
running<00:07:39.500> low<00:07:39.650> on<00:07:39.680> battery<00:07:40.240> but<00:07:41.240> yeah<00:07:42.080> overall

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.380 
running low on battery but yeah overall

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.590 
running low on battery but yeah overall
