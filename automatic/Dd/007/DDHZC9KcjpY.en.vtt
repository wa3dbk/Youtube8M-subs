00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.850
 Capture in ticks. 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.000
 The red ones are the soldiers of the Romans. 

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:15.201
 Blue - the soldiers of Hannibal. 

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:17.402
 When the Romans attack, 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.700
 Hannibal's cavalry gallop comes from behind. 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.600
 The Romans are completely surrounded. 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.800
 How can we use it? 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.900
 Landing behind the enemy ... 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.250
 attacking from the rear ... 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.900
 and destroy. 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.450
 Prepare to attack. 

00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:46.600
 You will kill us all! 

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:47.450
 These are my orders. 

00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:48.300
 I do not care. 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.000
 You ignored orders. 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.900
 This is just another accident, sir. 

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:57.801
 Unacceptable. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.050
 The Academy is an honor ... 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.850
 bravery... 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.000
 devotion. 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.900
 I... 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.800
 I am ... 

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:09.901
 Hey, bro! 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.750
 ... worthy. 

00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:11.300
 ... I miss you, buddy. 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.501
 I miss you, too. 

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:14.100
 You are nothing but this! 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.900
 Our account is no because of you. 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.901
 Many who stayed here for the first time hated this place. 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.200
 Let's go 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.850
 Do you want people to change? 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.350
 Then you need them to follow you. 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.300
 Inside you are a soldier, Thomas, 

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:34.501
 I see it. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.300
 And you need to see it. 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 What does it mean? 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.601
 Are you going? 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.900
 This is not a teaching! Alive! Alive! 

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:55.901
 We are attacked. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.400
 What the hell is this? 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.900
 Run! 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.350
 Mayday 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.902
 Stay close to me. 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.400
 I am your best chance for survival. 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.900
 I am a completely new war. 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.700
 Are you okay? 

00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:27.401
 Go! 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.800
 Chif! 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.300
 Ride 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.250
 THIS AUTUMN 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.150
 STORY 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.300
 HALO 4 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.250
 STARTING FROM DAWN 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.800
 GOING TO THE DAWN 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.600
 Mayday, mayday! 

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:48.901
 "Going to the dawn." 

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:49.702
 Immediate evacuation. 

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:50.750
 117. 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.650
 Play again please. 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.450
