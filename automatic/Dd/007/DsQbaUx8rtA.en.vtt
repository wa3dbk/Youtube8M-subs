off the links that makes it spend a
little<00:01:01.540> true<00:01:02.070> next<00:01:03.070> I<00:01:03.159> got<00:01:03.309> to<00:01:03.460> measure<00:01:03.640> the

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
little true next I got to measure the

out<00:01:05.890> at<00:01:06.070> nine<00:01:06.250> hundred<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.700> twenty<00:01:06.939> eight

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
out at nine hundred and twenty eight

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.600 
out at nine hundred and twenty eight
thousand<00:01:07.600> so<00:01:08.110> I'm<00:01:08.590> going<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.860> take<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.040> one<00:01:09.369> inch

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
thousand so I'm going to take a one inch

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.330 
thousand so I'm going to take a one inch
bit<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.330> modify<00:01:10.900> it<00:01:10.960> so<00:01:11.350> it<00:01:11.500> driller<00:01:11.860> nine

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
bit and modify it so it driller nine

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.070 
bit and modify it so it driller nine
hundred<00:01:12.729> twenty<00:01:12.850> eight<00:01:13.030> thousandths<00:01:13.689> hole

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
hundred twenty eight thousandths hole

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.440 
hundred twenty eight thousandths hole
and<00:01:14.439> I<00:01:15.009> want<00:01:15.250> to<00:01:15.340> drill<00:01:15.549> a<00:01:15.580> flat<00:01:15.880> bottom<00:01:16.119> hole

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
and I want to drill a flat bottom hole

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.720 
and I want to drill a flat bottom hole
so<00:01:16.990> I<00:01:17.020> grinding<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.650> points<00:01:18.070> off<00:01:18.220> that<00:01:18.430> spade

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
so I grinding the points off that spade

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.030 
so I grinding the points off that spade
bit<00:01:18.760> and<00:01:19.210> that'll<00:01:19.420> give<00:01:19.660> me<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:19.810> nice<00:01:20.620> flat

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
bit and that'll give me a nice flat

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.820 
bit and that'll give me a nice flat
bottom<00:01:21.220> hole<00:01:21.550> in<00:01:21.760> that<00:01:21.850> car<00:01:22.120> cream<00:01:22.360> I<00:01:22.830> modified

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
bottom hole in that car cream I modified

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.100 
bottom hole in that car cream I modified
these<00:01:24.010> bits<00:01:24.310> on<00:01:24.490> my<00:01:24.640> belt<00:01:24.880> sander<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.600> I'll

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
these bits on my belt sander and I'll

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.320 
these bits on my belt sander and I'll
tilt<00:01:26.470> my<00:01:26.650> table<00:01:27.160> so<00:01:27.640> that<00:01:27.820> it'll<00:01:27.970> give<00:01:28.180> me<00:01:28.270> the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
tilt my table so that it'll give me the
