00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.020
 I was in the previous film of the Q&amp;A unit, 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.160
 At the request of the audience, use the sticky board in the squatter (ゴキブリほいほい) to remove the hair.. 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.300
 Although only a little bit of hair was pulled up 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.780
 But this squatter (ゴキブリほいほい) is more than imagined. 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:08.560
 a lot of 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.020
 Then, when I was thinking about what I was going to do next, 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.040
 I thought that if I can't do it, I can use this adhesion. 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.220
 Like a spiderman 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.740
 Hang on the wall! 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.120
 This is the squatter house (ゴキブリほいほい) 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.060
 I will use tape 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.600
 Wrap it up with my hand in a circle 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.780
 Then start here 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.860
 One run 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.320
 Like this, the wall to the other side 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.920
 "啪" flies up! 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.340
 what! Because I can't get my other hand around 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.460
 So there are assistants! 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.620
 what! and also, 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.480
 Some people may have noticed, 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.520
 just now 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.780
 I am at my grandfather's house. 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.860
 .... can't take off the clothes.... 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.420
 Well... this is the index finger and the middle finger... (??) 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.380
 Very dexterous.. (?!) 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.420
 Do you want to touch it? Here! 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.780
 Super dangerous! This sticky! 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.720
 Hoi Hoi Kung Fu ㄟ~~ 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.820
 Already completely 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.180
 aims: 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 Hang it on for 1 minute! 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.560
 Then come as a pull-up 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.000
 Got it up? 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.820
 Got it! 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.800
 simple! 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.280
 (kick) 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.660
 Here is the card 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.540
 I want to leave 啰~~~ 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.220
 "Snapped" 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.720
 (seconds dead) 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.820
 It hurts~~ ww 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.560
 Rear. brain. Spoon. 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.220
 ("Hang up" combat) If you hang up, it will be fine. 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.740
 ("Hang up" combat) 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.340
 Can't get it all 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.460
 I can’t get it~ 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.800
 (Push) 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.440
 Can't you go any further? 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.140
 A~~~ 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.960
 well! Arrived 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.160
 Let's have a look. 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.960
 (0.5 second spider man) 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.160
 ("Snapped") 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.940
 (Exhaustion) 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.120
 (It seems that the replay is a big success...)
