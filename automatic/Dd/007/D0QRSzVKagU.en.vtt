answer the name of the knife Chicago
obviously<00:00:53.160> gives<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> clue<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.360> which

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
obviously gives you a clue as to which

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
obviously gives you a clue as to which
city<00:00:55.079> or<00:00:55.800> which<00:00:56.219> city's<00:00:56.550> laws<00:00:57.379> this<00:00:58.379> knife<00:00:58.620> was

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
city or which city's laws this knife was

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.720 
city or which city's laws this knife was
designed<00:00:59.219> after<00:00:59.660> but<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:02.190> Chicago

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
designed after but really the Chicago

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.630 
designed after but really the Chicago
laws<00:01:02.910> are<00:01:03.270> typical<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.140> many<00:01:04.589> major<00:01:04.860> cities<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
laws are typical of many major cities so

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.170 
laws are typical of many major cities so
it<00:01:06.049> not<00:01:07.049> necessarily<00:01:07.560> Chicago<00:01:08.490> specifically

it not necessarily Chicago specifically

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.590 
it not necessarily Chicago specifically
but<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.530> know<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:11.040> would<00:01:11.189> serve<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.880> any<00:01:12.060> in

but you know it would serve in in any in

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.890 
but you know it would serve in in any in
any<00:01:12.810> metropolitan<00:01:13.260> area<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.670> blade<00:01:15.600> length

is<00:01:16.610> 2<00:01:17.610> inches<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.590> legal

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
is 2 inches and that is the the legal

in the s30v and the 440c or really any
other<00:02:15.230> steel<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:15.950> might<00:02:16.130> be<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.819> might

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
other steel that you might be you might

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.610 
other steel that you might be you might
have<00:02:17.330> would<00:02:17.660> look<00:02:17.900> would<00:02:18.170> look<00:02:18.380> more<00:02:18.560> like

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
have would look would look more like

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.370 
have would look would look more like
this<00:02:19.220> here<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.750> know<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.350> just

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
this here and so you know that just

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.559 
this here and so you know that just
gives<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.860> visual<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:25.569> even

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
gives you a visual of the of the even

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.630

I<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.840> carbon<00:03:17.110> fiber<00:03:17.530> because<00:03:17.830> it<00:03:18.099> kind

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
I like the carbon fiber because it kind

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.420 
I like the carbon fiber because it kind
of<00:03:18.400> almost<00:03:18.580> has<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:19.050> 3d<00:03:20.050> look<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.709> it's

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
of almost has a 3d look to it it's

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.400 
of almost has a 3d look to it it's
almost<00:03:21.700> like<00:03:21.940> looking<00:03:22.120> at<00:03:22.360> one<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.540> those<00:03:22.720> one

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
almost like looking at one of those one

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.000 
almost like looking at one of those one
of<00:03:23.530> those<00:03:23.650> old<00:03:23.830> 3d<00:03:24.310> playing<00:03:24.850> cards<00:03:25.300> or

of those old 3d playing cards or
baseball<00:03:27.010> cards<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:28.150> know<00:03:28.270> I<00:03:28.300> mean<00:03:28.660> when<00:03:28.780> you

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
baseball cards you know I mean when you

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.210 
baseball cards you know I mean when you
when<00:03:29.110> you<00:03:29.200> sort<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.530> hold<00:03:29.830> it<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.040> different

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
when you sort of hold it to different

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.729 
when you sort of hold it to different
angles<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:30.760> see<00:03:31.000> different<00:03:31.300> things<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.739> it

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
angles you see different things that it

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.890 
angles you see different things that it
has<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.040> certain<00:03:33.760> depth<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.330> it<00:03:34.360> when<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:34.720> look

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
has a certain depth to it when you look

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.380 
has a certain depth to it when you look
at<00:03:35.080> it<00:03:36.269> it's<00:03:37.269> made<00:03:37.510> over<00:03:37.660> stainless<00:03:38.290> liners

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
and this is just one stout little knife

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.750 
and this is just one stout little knife
I<00:03:45.540> mean<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:47.080> knife<00:03:47.380> will<00:03:47.709> this<00:03:48.280> knife<00:03:48.519> will

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
I mean this knife will this knife will

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.960 
I mean this knife will this knife will
take<00:03:49.260> will<00:03:50.260> withstand<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:51.069> would<00:03:51.370> say<00:03:51.610> just

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
take will withstand I would say just

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.430 
take will withstand I would say just
about<00:03:52.120> anything
