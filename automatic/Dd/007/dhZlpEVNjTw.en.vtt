 hello sono ielmini arena lecturer dangerous gozzo ligure sonata in sol 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.789
 chance 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.089
 in this direction we will talk about how to identify a dangerous substance not 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:26.489
 listed 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.969
 annexation given to know and identify all without a doubt 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.280
 existing dangerous goods 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.070
 especially because many of them originally not dangerous can 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.870
 become it center accidentally in contact with other substances besides 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.760
 as you have chemistry continuously evolving dangerous substances 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.410
 unknown until recently I can go there continuously to add to 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.560
 this very special set 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.300
 in the difficult task of their combinatorial identification by law 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.040
 in order to properly prepare a shipment 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.620
 comes to the aid of manual dvr that publishes. the list of goods 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.140
 dangerous 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.730
 however, not all substances are listed on this list if you have to 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.340
 do with a substance that we do not find in this list what to do 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.890
 often shipper issuers will help you consult each other they have 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.890
 situations like this 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.430
 multicargo good morning I'm roberto in what I can be useful avio well

 climbing dangerously I can find it 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.030
 k beautiful doctor de even now let's solve her problem ho 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.170
 just did the update course 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.590
 discussing just such problems, I am waiting for a moment randomly in this face 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.210
 to face 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.700
 let's see this product could have such features that it cannot 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.079
 air transport must be allowed 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:13.650
 I understand why it is as faq faq we have to determine if the characteristics of the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.099
 product are such as to be susceptible to exclusion or combustion 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.079
 spontaneous or if it could put people that but skilled poison like that 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.389
 corrosive 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.009
 but what are you waiting for on horseback 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.009
 and tell me a single characteristic of danger 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:32.329
 chamakh there are no other characteristics of danger that I know 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.099
 poisonous corrosive 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.709

 so then i'm class 3eme also knows the generic chemical name by chance 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.830

 substance is auchan course a bone of the number one 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.400
 19 87 of course being an os in the declaration and on the next neck 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.490
 the psn will have to indicate in brackets in English also the technical name the one like 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.859
 he had told me to put them 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.859

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:20.879
 synth sure but attention not even necessary doctor even knows the 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.680
 packing group because I'm seeing 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.070
 after this manual the alcohols are given with packing group 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.360
 second third of course changing the parking then conditions change 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.570
 but over there and the quantities lie for neck xscore

 very planet. imagine you still don't forget that it sends you to follow 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.770
 courses on the transport of dangerous goods 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.840
 meanwhile health calls us when it wants without doubt coraca keeps lit in a 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.840
 day 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.779
 we quickly lose what roberto did to solve this problem 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.529
 he first asked the customer if the dangerous goods in question 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:14.690
 and could have characteristics that are trendy for air transport 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.729
 to establish this we need to refer to action 2 1 1 in the dgr manual 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.509
 where the gear characteristics are listed should not have to be 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.270
 transported by plane 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.259
 once it is established that the goods are allowed air transport is drunk 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.710
 assign a proper shipping name. the shipping them 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.449
 taking it from the list in table 4 1 year where names of are listed 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.540
 shipping attributable to the groups of henry substances identified by the name 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.539
 generic chemical or even only from the name of danger 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.159
 once the exact name to be assigned has been identified, the goods can be like 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.759
 you would normally make the updated list 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.340
 to verify 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.340
 under what conditions the goods must be sent 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.529
 this direction wiki term goodbye
