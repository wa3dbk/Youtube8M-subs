down shift on a Power Shift tractor or
on<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:19.070> CVT<00:01:20.070> we're<00:01:20.580> changing<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> set<00:01:21.479> points

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
on a CVT we're changing the set points

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.320 
on a CVT we're changing the set points
that<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.650> located<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.759> a-pillar

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
that are located on the a-pillar

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
f1 f2 f3 or r1 r2 r3 so it changes our

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.410 
f1 f2 f3 or r1 r2 r3 so it changes our
set<00:01:29.790> points<00:01:30.950> on<00:01:31.950> tractors<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.820> are<00:01:33.119> equipped

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
set points on tractors that are equipped

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420 
set points on tractors that are equipped
with<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> five<00:01:34.619> remotes<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.280> will

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
with up to five remotes this will

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.060 
with up to five remotes this will
control<00:01:35.729> number<00:01:36.060> five<00:01:36.360> remote<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.070> more

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
control number five remote or more

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.010 
control number five remote or more
commonly<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.820> will<00:01:38.970> control<00:01:39.270> number<00:01:39.659> one

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
commonly it will control number one

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.950 
commonly it will control number one
remote<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.770> tractors<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.850> not<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.360> five

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
remote on tractors that do not have five

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.030 
remote on tractors that do not have five
remotes<00:01:44.570> this<00:01:45.570> also<00:01:46.020> works<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.590> timer

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
remotes this also works with the timer

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.429 
remotes this also works with the timer
so<00:01:47.579> if<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.820> set<00:01:48.149> your<00:01:48.329> timer<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.990> your<00:01:49.170> tractor

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
so if you set your timer on your tractor

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.130 
so if you set your timer on your tractor
to<00:01:50.100> raise<00:01:50.520> or<00:01:50.850> lower<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:51.210> implement<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.720> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
to raise or lower your implement in a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.319 
to raise or lower your implement in a
certain<00:01:52.439> time<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:53.130> will<00:01:53.520> work<00:01:53.549> with<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.119> as

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
certain time it will work with that as

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.709 
certain time it will work with that as
well<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.310> your<00:01:56.790> quick<00:01:57.420> raise

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
well you have your quick raise

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.429
