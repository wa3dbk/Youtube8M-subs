now I'd like to show you some more of
the<00:00:04.779> updated<00:00:05.319> stuff<00:00:05.620> in<00:00:05.830> the<00:00:05.950> x10<00:00:06.479> so<00:00:07.479> to<00:00:07.539> begin

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:08.019 
the updated stuff in the x10 so to begin

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.259 
the updated stuff in the x10 so to begin
with<00:00:08.230> we<00:00:08.589> have<00:00:08.620> the<00:00:09.009> time<00:00:09.370> scape<00:00:09.639> application

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:10.269 
with we have the time scape application

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.650 
with we have the time scape application
which<00:00:11.049> basically<00:00:11.559> is<00:00:11.769> the<00:00:11.919> same<00:00:11.950> as<00:00:12.250> before

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
which basically is the same as before

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.239 
which basically is the same as before
for<00:00:13.660> me<00:00:13.750> personally<00:00:13.990> it<00:00:14.410> feels<00:00:14.679> like<00:00:14.950> it's<00:00:15.129> a

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:15.249 
for me personally it feels like it's a

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.759 
for me personally it feels like it's a
bit<00:00:15.459> more<00:00:15.669> responsive<00:00:16.240> than<00:00:16.299> before<00:00:16.750> it's<00:00:17.710> a

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:17.769 
bit more responsive than before it's a

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.040 
bit more responsive than before it's a
bit<00:00:17.920> quicker<00:00:18.279> I<00:00:18.460> would<00:00:18.609> say<00:00:18.789> that<00:00:19.449> might<00:00:19.689> be<00:00:19.869> my

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
bit quicker I would say that might be my

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.560 
bit quicker I would say that might be my
perception<00:00:20.590> only<00:00:20.890> but<00:00:21.130> I<00:00:21.400> think<00:00:21.699> so

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
perception only but I think so

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.689 
perception only but I think so
then<00:00:23.050> when<00:00:23.230> talking<00:00:23.560> about<00:00:23.769> time<00:00:24.160> scape<00:00:24.429> as

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
then when talking about time scape as

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.609 
then when talking about time scape as
such<00:00:25.000> you<00:00:25.210> can<00:00:25.269> see<00:00:25.420> that<00:00:25.779> if<00:00:25.960> I<00:00:26.109> click<00:00:26.140> this

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
such you can see that if I click this

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.439 
such you can see that if I click this
tile<00:00:26.920> the<00:00:27.640> text<00:00:27.970> will<00:00:28.119> actually

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
tile the text will actually

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.150 
tile the text will actually
automatically<00:00:28.990> start<00:00:29.380> scrolling<00:00:29.619> after<00:00:30.130> a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
automatically start scrolling after a

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.470 
automatically start scrolling after a
while<00:00:30.339> so<00:00:30.550> that<00:00:30.580> you<00:00:30.789> don't<00:00:30.970> have<00:00:31.150> to<00:00:31.300> click

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
while so that you don't have to click

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.750 
while so that you don't have to click
into<00:00:31.750> different<00:00:32.230> applications<00:00:32.829> to<00:00:33.040> read<00:00:33.219> the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
into different applications to read the

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.369 
into different applications to read the
full<00:00:33.940> messages<00:00:34.540> and<00:00:34.809> so<00:00:34.930> forth<00:00:35.200> because

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
full messages and so forth because

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.560 
full messages and so forth because
earlier<00:00:36.250> you<00:00:36.399> had<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.670> click<00:00:36.850> in<00:00:37.090> and<00:00:37.270> out<00:00:37.360> of

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
earlier you had to click in and out of

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.090 
earlier you had to click in and out of
times<00:00:37.809> different<00:00:38.200> applications<00:00:38.739> which<00:00:38.950> of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
times different applications which of

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.430 
times different applications which of
course<00:00:39.210> wasn't<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.300> best<00:00:40.510> usability<00:00:41.140> so<00:00:41.289> this

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
course wasn't the best usability so this

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.369 
course wasn't the best usability so this
is<00:00:41.559> a<00:00:41.590> good<00:00:41.860> improvement<00:00:42.100> I<00:00:42.460> would<00:00:42.610> say<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:43.379> as

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
is a good improvement I would say and as

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:45.959 
is a good improvement I would say and as
you<00:00:44.559> know<00:00:44.680> from<00:00:44.890> here<00:00:45.070> this<00:00:45.280> is<00:00:45.340> where<00:00:45.640> you<00:00:45.760> can

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
you know from here this is where you can

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.450 
you know from here this is where you can
actually<00:00:46.149> post<00:00:47.110> your<00:00:47.379> status<00:00:47.770> updates<00:00:48.129> and<00:00:48.280> so

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
actually post your status updates and so

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.840 
actually post your status updates and so
forth<00:00:48.789> and<00:00:49.000> without<00:00:49.750> having<00:00:50.170> now<00:00:50.289> to<00:00:50.850> check

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
forth and without having now to check

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.610 
forth and without having now to check
into<00:00:52.030> different<00:00:52.480> applications<00:00:53.079> from<00:00:53.230> time<00:00:53.469> to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
into different applications from time to

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.680 
into different applications from time to
time<00:00:53.649> so<00:00:54.640> that's<00:00:54.789> a<00:00:54.879> big<00:00:55.059> improvement<00:00:56.280> then

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
time so that's a big improvement then

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.420 
time so that's a big improvement then
