00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
investment of 1 million which means you

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.520 
investment of 1 million which means you
go<00:04:59.150> to<00:05:00.250> now<00:05:01.250> it<00:05:01.430> sounds<00:05:01.789> really<00:05:02.449> really<00:05:02.870> nice

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
go to now it sounds really really nice

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.629 
go to now it sounds really really nice
the<00:05:03.860> question<00:05:04.250> is

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.700 

okay<00:05:09.360> so<00:05:09.599> this<00:05:09.719> is<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:09.960> regrowth<00:05:10.319> into<00:05:10.590> the

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
okay so this is the regrowth into the

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.339 
okay so this is the regrowth into the
controls<00:05:11.159> for<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.580> minute<00:05:12.020> now<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.080> most

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
controls for a minute now the most

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.709 
controls for a minute now the most
focuses<00:05:14.069> specifically<00:05:14.759> on<00:05:14.879> just<00:05:15.210> eat<00:05:15.479> okay

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:15.719 
focuses specifically on just eat okay

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.320 
focuses specifically on just eat okay
the<00:05:16.530> reason<00:05:16.650> is<00:05:16.889> because<00:05:16.979> it<00:05:17.310> takes<00:05:17.430> only<00:05:17.610> 90

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
the reason is because it takes only 90

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.390 
the reason is because it takes only 90
days<00:05:18.569> for<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.050> weeds<00:05:19.229> to<00:05:19.409> ensure<00:05:19.680> okay<00:05:20.099> that's

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
days for the weeds to ensure okay that's

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.860 
days for the weeds to ensure okay that's
three<00:05:20.580> months<00:05:20.939> so<00:05:21.150> in<00:05:21.270> three<00:05:21.479> months<00:05:21.750> were

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
three months so in three months were

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.860 
three months so in three months were
able<00:05:22.169> to<00:05:22.610> plant<00:05:23.610> seeds<00:05:23.939> and<00:05:24.330> grow<00:05:24.659> some

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
able to plant seeds and grow some

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.219 
able to plant seeds and grow some
utensils<00:05:25.550> now<00:05:26.550> this<00:05:26.819> is<00:05:26.969> what<00:05:27.150> 100<00:05:27.840> acres

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
utensils now this is what 100 acres

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.890 
utensils now this is what 100 acres
brought<00:05:28.590> them<00:05:29.159> babies<00:05:29.669> a<00:05:29.909> little<00:05:30.180> more<00:05:30.330> a

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
brought them babies a little more a

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.170 
brought them babies a little more a
little<00:05:30.930> more<00:05:31.169> but<00:05:31.979> these<00:05:32.250> are<00:05:32.310> ten<00:05:32.669> everyone's

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
little more but these are ten everyone's

little more but these are ten everyone's
so<00:05:33.870> you<00:05:34.379> need<00:05:34.530> to<00:05:34.620> understand<00:05:34.919> when<00:05:35.069> you<00:05:35.189> pay

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
so you need to understand when you pay

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.209 
so you need to understand when you pay
