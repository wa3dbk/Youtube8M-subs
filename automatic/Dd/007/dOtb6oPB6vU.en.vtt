00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.390
 on the delegate's desk a stack with more 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.059
 of 100 cases concerning the adulteration of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.300
 receipt of vehicle transfer to 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.889
 police the criminalistics sector 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.560
 found that garagista c sellers 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.119
 individuals are fraudulating receipt of 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.430
 vehicle transfer 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.650
 the police are working on these crimes 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.170
 several people have already identified a 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.269
 until confessing the crime the penalty of 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.670
 falsification of public document worth 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.980
 there from two to five years 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.710
 the delegate explains that the fraudster 11 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.450
 solvents to erase the information and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.820
 puts new data 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.700
 this usually happens because 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.680
 missed the 30-day deadline to do 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.610
 transfer from vehicle to new 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.100
 owner 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.170
 failure to comply with the deadline 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.250
 fine of just over one hundred and twenty 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.980
 seven reais 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.440
 another possibility is that the vehicle already 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.440
 was sold to a second computer and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.280
 to omit the name of the first one is made 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.649
 fraud 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.329
 this is not paid the cent value and 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.470
 eighty-eight reais of the first 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.540
 transfer 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.909
 The first step is to try to buy the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.890
 suitable people with people from 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.409
 well-known ways to look for a 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.180
 dispatcher or even detain before 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.950
 close the deal 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.290
 the president of the union of 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.159
 said that he was aware of the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.860
 cheats 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.200
 he gives one more precious tip to those who 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.320
 sell the vehicle that is making the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.390
 communication of sale of the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.490
 so she sold the vehicle she 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.700
 filled in the receipt was in the notary's office and 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.130
 notarize that fed the DMV 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.500
 with the certified copy and make the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.450
 sales communication from that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.880
 moment that she was communicating 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.829
 sale has no way to defraud receipt and 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.210
 she has no more responsibility 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.759
 none with that vehicle 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.460
 the solvent destroys whether it shines co 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.860
 of the document that has technology 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.040
 identical to the one used in the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.200
 identity in the case of documents 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.570
 I suspect it's best to go to the police 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.220
 It's a bit tricky then so 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.020
 which is good to look for if you have any 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.660
 doubt to seek the police 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.030
 we're going to do an expert look at you 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.370
 Sun 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.459
 ment in the DMV proof of purchase and 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.050
 sale is subject to rigorous evaluation and 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.209
 some suspicion arises 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.709
 the document sent to the institute 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.410
 of criminalistics 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.990
 if there is any indication 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.459
 possible tampering or attempted 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.350
 the integrity of the document therein. 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.150
 server has autonomy to carry out the 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.680
 of this document and 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.580
 refer to the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.380
 Traffic 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.750
 the corregedoria by means of a

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.110
 actually made an adulteration in this 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.230
 document he sends to the police station 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.950
 of fraud and the investigation is under 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.950
 the police sphere
