00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
little features on the boots and then

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.450 
little features on the boots and then
won't<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.200> done<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.950> real<00:01:50.100> quick<00:01:50.220> review

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
won't be done just a real quick review

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.270 
won't be done just a real quick review
of<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.140> first<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.470> thing<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.799> does<00:01:53.009> make

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
of it first the thing that does make

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.980 
of it first the thing that does make
these<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.670> comfortable<00:01:54.180> one<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> things

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
these so comfortable one of the things

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.010 
these so comfortable one of the things
are<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> memory<00:01:56.700> foam<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
are there is a memory foam in the in the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.550 
are there is a memory foam in the in the
boot<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.950> forms<00:01:59.399> your<00:01:59.640> foot<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.229> that's<00:02:01.229> one

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
boot it forms your foot and that's one

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.469 
boot it forms your foot and that's one
thing<00:02:01.770> kicked<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.280> consideration<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.329> do

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
thing kicked a consideration if you do

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.469 
thing kicked a consideration if you do
buy<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.930> set<00:02:04.490> if<00:02:05.490> they've<00:02:05.729> been<00:02:05.909> worn<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.299> lot

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
buy you set if they've been worn a lot

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.279 
buy you set if they've been worn a lot
that<00:02:07.320> memory<00:02:07.740> foam<00:02:07.950> may<00:02:08.250> not<00:02:08.840> completely

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
that memory foam may not completely

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.350 
that memory foam may not completely
conform<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.129> your

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
conform to your

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.720 
conform to your
foot<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.780> mean<00:02:12.110> that's<00:02:12.350> I<00:02:12.800> don't<00:02:13.310> know<00:02:13.490> that<00:02:13.610> for

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
foot I mean that's I don't know that for

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.730 
foot I mean that's I don't know that for
sure<00:02:13.760> that's<00:02:14.150> just<00:02:14.300> my<00:02:14.540> assumption<00:02:14.900> since<00:02:15.590> it

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
sure that's just my assumption since it

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.800 
sure that's just my assumption since it
is<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:15.980> memory<00:02:16.340> foam<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.940> didn't<00:02:17.510> want<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.690> go

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
is a memory foam I didn't want to go

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.800 
is a memory foam I didn't want to go
with<00:02:18.020> used<00:02:18.650> because<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:20.000> know<00:02:20.090> in<00:02:20.360> fear<00:02:20.660> if

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
with used because I you know in fear if

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.380 
with used because I you know in fear if
I<00:02:20.960> might<00:02:21.500> get<00:02:21.680> them<00:02:21.830> they<00:02:22.490> may<00:02:22.670> not<00:02:22.820> work<00:02:23.270> as

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
I might get them they may not work as

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.930 
I might get them they may not work as
well<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.280> one<00:02:25.460> thing<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.790> makes

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
well so that is one thing that makes

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.910 
well so that is one thing that makes
them<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.240> comfortable<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:27.290> other<00:02:27.320> thing<00:02:27.650> is

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
them so comfortable the other thing is

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.250 
them so comfortable the other thing is
they<00:02:28.220> have<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.370> dual<00:02:28.640> pivoting<00:02:29.060> system<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:30.170> can

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
they have a dual pivoting system you can

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.320 
they have a dual pivoting system you can
see<00:02:30.470> here<00:02:30.740> there's<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.640> screw<00:02:31.850> on<00:02:31.970> this<00:02:32.090> side

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
see here there's a screw on this side

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.710 
see here there's a screw on this side
this<00:02:32.780> one's<00:02:32.960> actually<00:02:33.140> hidden<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:35.240> ankle

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
this one's actually hidden the ankle

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.360 
this one's actually hidden the ankle
move<00:02:36.260> independently<00:02:36.890> from<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.130> boot

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
move independently from the boot

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
move independently from the boot
probably<00:02:38.180> people<00:02:38.360> see<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.750> in<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:38.900> video

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
probably people see it in this video

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.850 
probably people see it in this video
yeah<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.480> can't<00:02:41.720> really<00:02:41.810> see<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.230> but<00:02:42.800> that

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
yeah you can't really see it but that

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.940 
yeah you can't really see it but that
makes<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:44.030> ankle<00:02:44.420> again<00:02:45.020> pivot<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:45.800> can

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
makes the ankle again pivot so you can

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.160 
makes the ankle again pivot so you can
virtually<00:02:46.670> no<00:02:47.030> break<00:02:47.570> in<00:02:47.720> time<00:02:47.750> for<00:02:48.080> these

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
virtually no break in time for these

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.979 
virtually no break in time for these
boots<00:02:48.410> at<00:02:48.590> all<00:02:48.709> which<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.430> pretty<00:02:49.580> nice<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.060> mean

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
boots at all which is pretty nice I mean

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.660 
boots at all which is pretty nice I mean
they<00:02:51.140> will<00:02:51.260> get<00:02:51.680> even<00:02:51.860> better<00:02:51.980> as<00:02:52.310> I've<00:02:52.459> broken

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
they will get even better as I've broken

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.270 
they will get even better as I've broken
in<00:02:53.000> from<00:02:53.660> everything<00:02:53.930> I've<00:02:54.050> read<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:54.560> out<00:02:55.250> of

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
in from everything I've read but out of

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.070 
in from everything I've read but out of
the<00:02:55.430> box<00:02:55.640> like<00:02:55.970> now<00:02:56.239> punch<00:02:56.510> storms<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:56.959> some

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
the box like now punch storms and some

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.020 
the box like now punch storms and some
of<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.230> other<00:02:57.380> ones<00:02:57.530> there's<00:02:58.340> no<00:02:58.459> breaking<00:02:58.730> I

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
of the other ones there's no breaking I

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.330 
of the other ones there's no breaking I
mean<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.360> just<00:02:59.390> you<00:03:00.260> know<00:03:00.380> put<00:03:00.920> them<00:03:01.040> on<00:03:01.160> and

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
mean you just you know put them on and

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.030 
mean you just you know put them on and
go<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.840> that's<00:03:03.020> to<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.620> things<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:03.860> make

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
go so that's to the things that make

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.250 
go so that's to the things that make
them<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:04.310> comfortable<00:03:04.989> some<00:03:05.989> of<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.140> other

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
them so comfortable some of the other

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.199 
them so comfortable some of the other
features<00:03:06.739> are<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:09.550> actual<00:03:10.550> adjustment<00:03:10.850> here

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
features are the actual adjustment here

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.170 
features are the actual adjustment here
if<00:03:11.270> you<00:03:11.360> have<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> bigger<00:03:12.130> calf<00:03:13.130> or<00:03:13.520> whatnot

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
if you have a bigger calf or whatnot

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.600 
if you have a bigger calf or whatnot
there's<00:03:15.140> actually<00:03:15.620> if<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.769> see<00:03:15.950> three<00:03:16.190> screws

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
there's actually if you see three screws

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.630 
there's actually if you see three screws
this<00:03:17.030> is<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.360> innermost<00:03:18.190> setting<00:03:19.190> there's

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
this is the innermost setting there's

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.479 
this is the innermost setting there's
actually<00:03:19.970> two<00:03:20.180> two<00:03:21.019> more<00:03:21.170> forwards<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:21.920> we've

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
actually two two more forwards so we've

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.600 
actually two two more forwards so we've
got<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.640> wide<00:03:22.850> leg<00:03:23.320> this<00:03:24.320> will<00:03:24.590> spread<00:03:25.220> out<00:03:25.370> even

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
got a wide leg this will spread out even

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.370 
got a wide leg this will spread out even
further<00:03:25.790> two<00:03:26.180> more<00:03:26.390> settings<00:03:26.840> I<00:03:26.989> think<00:03:27.200> it's

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
further two more settings I think it's

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.650 
further two more settings I think it's
inch<00:03:28.280> or<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:28.700> don't<00:03:28.910> know<00:03:29.120> what<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.390> exact

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
inch or so I don't know what the exact

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.720 
inch or so I don't know what the exact
measurement<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.799> this<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.130> as<00:03:31.310> far<00:03:31.489> as<00:03:31.610> then

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
measurement so this is as far as then

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.390 
measurement so this is as far as then
they<00:03:31.850> go<00:03:32.030> push<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.110> out<00:03:33.350> mix<00:03:33.860> it<00:03:34.010> all<00:03:34.070> wider

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
they go push that out mix it all wider

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.070 
they go push that out mix it all wider
so<00:03:35.060> that's<00:03:35.180> another<00:03:35.450> thing<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.780> makes<00:03:35.959> them

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
so that's another thing it makes them

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
there's probably a couple things I may

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.650 
there's probably a couple things I may
be<00:05:52.630> missing<00:05:53.110> on<00:05:53.199> the<00:05:53.320> boots<00:05:54.270> again<00:05:55.270> i<00:05:55.360> have<00:05:55.539> you

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
know i've worn him around and I can tell

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.390 
know i've worn him around and I can tell
there's<00:05:58.210> no<00:05:58.300> break<00:05:58.599> in<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:59.070> wore<00:06:00.070> them<00:06:00.160> on<00:06:00.280> the

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
there's no break in I wore them on the

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.800 
there's no break in I wore them on the
bike<00:06:00.550> once<00:06:00.880> I<00:06:01.060> haven't<00:06:01.270> really<00:06:01.449> ridden<00:06:01.660> the

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
bike once I haven't really ridden the

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.659 
bike once I haven't really ridden the
bike<00:06:01.960> yet<00:06:02.289> just<00:06:02.860> around<00:06:03.130> the<00:06:03.220> neighborhood

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
bike yet just around the neighborhood

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.240 
bike yet just around the neighborhood
and<00:06:04.349> so<00:06:05.349> I<00:06:05.410> only<00:06:05.530> got<00:06:05.710> a<00:06:05.770> chance<00:06:06.010> to<00:06:06.130> really

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
and so I only got a chance to really

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.500 
and so I only got a chance to really
test<00:06:06.520> them<00:06:06.639> out<00:06:06.760> on<00:06:06.849> the<00:06:06.940> track<00:06:07.210> or<00:06:07.389> anything

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
test them out on the track or anything

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.980 
test them out on the track or anything
like<00:06:07.690> that<00:06:07.919> but<00:06:10.050> see<00:06:11.050> inside<00:06:11.650> of<00:06:11.740> there

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
like that but see inside of there

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.540 
like that but see inside of there
everything<00:06:13.990> is<00:06:14.050> just<00:06:14.199> really<00:06:14.550> really

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
everything is just really really

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.270 
everything is just really really
independent<00:06:15.910> and<00:06:16.410> adjustable<00:06:17.410> so<00:06:18.130> that's

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
independent and adjustable so that's

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.460 
independent and adjustable so that's
really<00:06:18.460> about<00:06:18.699> it

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
really about it

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.050 
really about it
