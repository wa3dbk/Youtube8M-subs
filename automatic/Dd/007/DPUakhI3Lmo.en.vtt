00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
for G sharp a B flat chromatic B then C

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.439 
for G sharp a B flat chromatic B then C
that's<00:00:25.740> just<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> right<00:00:26.340> hand<00:00:26.670> ascending

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that's just the right hand ascending

that's just the right hand ascending
from<00:00:27.539> G<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.840> C<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.199> sounds<00:00:28.500> like<00:00:28.619> this

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940
