00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
stick out so I always start from the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.560

middle of my hair and that's where the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.780 
middle of my hair and that's where the
wave<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.990> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.380> start<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.610> there

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
wave is going to start so you see there

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.219 
wave is going to start so you see there
that<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.090> doesn't<00:01:18.450> start<00:01:18.689> all<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> way<00:01:19.080> from

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
that it doesn't start all the way from

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.710 
that it doesn't start all the way from
the<00:01:19.470> top<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.549> from<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.909> middle<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.600> I'm

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the top but from the middle and I'm

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.420 
the top but from the middle and I'm
going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.409> few<00:01:22.439> more<00:01:22.740> times<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.159> you

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and that's basically it we're going to

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.550 
and that's basically it we're going to
be<00:01:26.100> doing<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.210> same<00:01:27.630> curling

be doing all of them the same curling

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.620 
be doing all of them the same curling
out<00:01:28.710> words<00:01:29.070> because<00:01:29.640> at<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.060> end<00:01:30.090> I

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
out words because at the end I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.279 
out words because at the end I
them<00:01:30.990> all<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.530> come<00:01:31.740> together<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.960> here<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:33.990> was

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
them all to come together so here I was

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.319 
them all to come together so here I was
apparently<00:01:34.740> listening<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.460> something<00:01:35.759> really

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
apparently listening to something really

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.560 
apparently listening to something really
good<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.719> pandora<00:01:37.970> probably<00:01:38.970> something<00:01:39.479> in

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
good on pandora probably something in

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.270 
good on pandora probably something in
spanish<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.289> that's<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.890> only<00:01:40.950> thing

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
spanish because that's the only thing

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.880 
spanish because that's the only thing
that<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.579> get<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.030> move<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.360> way<00:01:42.890> so

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that can get you to move that way so

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.700 
that can get you to move that way so
yeah<00:01:44.039> I<00:01:44.070> basically<00:01:44.429> touch<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.439> leave<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.590> on

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
yeah I basically touch it leave it on

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.950 
yeah I basically touch it leave it on
there<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.130> about<00:01:47.220> 12<00:01:47.670> seconds<00:01:48.210> or<00:01:48.539> so

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
there for about 12 seconds or so

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.279 
there for about 12 seconds or so
depending<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.590> how<00:01:50.030> thick<00:01:51.030> your<00:01:51.329> hair<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.869> mine

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
