can<00:02:05.189> see<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.490> got<00:02:05.640> some<00:02:05.850> allergy<00:02:06.240> problems

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
can see we got some allergy problems

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.580 
can see we got some allergy problems
so<00:02:09.429> we're<00:02:09.580> going<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.759> get<00:02:09.879> some<00:02:10.000> snails<00:02:10.590> they

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
so we're going to get some snails they

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.110 
so we're going to get some snails they
should<00:02:11.800> be<00:02:11.860> able<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.069> take<00:02:12.160> care<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.489> it<00:02:12.580> the

this betta tank I think it's pretty
slick<00:04:01.919> so<00:04:02.919> we're<00:04:03.160> going<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.340> have<00:04:03.430> some<00:04:03.579> black

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
slick so we're going to have some black

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.550 
slick so we're going to have some black
substrate<00:04:04.359> not<00:04:04.569> completely<00:04:05.049> black<00:04:05.260> just<00:04:05.500> a

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
substrate not completely black just a

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.140 
substrate not completely black just a
dusting<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.160> make<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:06.459> look<00:04:06.519> more<00:04:06.579> natural<00:04:06.730> and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
dusting to make it look more natural and
