00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
you want volume like this you have to

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.959 
you want volume like this you have to
use<00:01:58.810> two<00:01:59.289> and<00:01:59.590> this<00:02:00.250> one's<00:02:00.459> much<00:02:00.640> better

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
use two and this one's much better

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.050 
use two and this one's much better
because<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.840> would<00:02:01.989> have<00:02:02.110> because<00:02:02.729> after<00:02:03.729> some

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
because it would have because after some

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.139 
because it would have because after some
uses<00:02:04.539> of<00:02:04.569> this<00:02:04.869> it<00:02:05.200> will<00:02:05.560> flatten<00:02:05.979> out<00:02:06.369> as<00:02:06.670> you

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
uses of this it will flatten out as you

uses of this it will flatten out as you
can<00:02:07.270> see<00:02:07.390> look<00:02:07.539> this<00:02:07.659> is<00:02:07.810> just<00:02:08.049> one<00:02:08.319> look<00:02:09.039> how

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
top and you put it on top like that so

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.819 
top and you put it on top like that so
make<00:02:34.269> sure<00:02:34.299> you<00:02:34.569> do<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.170> then<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.590> just

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
make sure you do this and then you just

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
you're left with something like this now

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.349 
you're left with something like this now
get<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.280> piece<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.180> elastic<00:02:49.389> and<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:52.120> one

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
get a piece of elastic and this one

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.940 
get a piece of elastic and this one
looks<00:02:52.540> quite<00:02:52.690> sure<00:02:53.079> because<00:02:53.410> I'm<00:02:53.620> ready<00:02:53.889> to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
looks quite sure because I'm ready to

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.670 
looks quite sure because I'm ready to
cut<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.849> size<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.389> want<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.870> but<00:02:56.470> if<00:02:56.560> I

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
cut it to the size I want it but if I

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.740 
cut it to the size I want it but if I
was<00:02:56.859> y'all<00:02:57.040> get<00:02:57.250> much<00:02:57.430> longer<00:02:57.790> one<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.150> you'll

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
was y'all get much longer one so you'll

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.479 
was y'all get much longer one so you'll
know<00:02:58.930> how<00:02:58.959> much<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.530> all<00:02:59.739> you<00:02:59.889> do<00:03:00.099> is<00:03:00.130> you<00:03:00.250> hold

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.530 
it from here
then<00:03:02.079> hold<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.739> from<00:03:02.919> this<00:03:03.069> side<00:03:03.340> as<00:03:03.519> well<00:03:03.669> so

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
then hold it from this side as well so

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.199 
then hold it from this side as well so
you're<00:03:04.690> holding<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.290> like<00:03:05.319> that<00:03:05.709> then<00:03:06.310> while

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
still holding onto both of them just

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.110 
still holding onto both of them just
pull<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.519> a<00:03:21.549> little<00:03:21.760> bit

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
pull it a little bit

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.380 
pull it a little bit
that<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:24.720> just<00:03:26.459> play<00:03:27.459> around<00:03:27.580> with<00:03:27.819> it<00:03:28.000> sort

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
that and just play around with it sort

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.100 
that and just play around with it sort
it<00:03:28.540> out<00:03:28.720> then<00:03:29.500> what<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:29.890> do<00:03:30.099> I<00:03:30.810> hose<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.959> can

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
it out then what you do I hose you can

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.170 
it out then what you do I hose you can
see<00:03:32.230> this<00:03:32.349> coming<00:03:32.650> out<00:03:32.860> or<00:03:32.980> cut<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.940> bit

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
see this coming out or cut that that bit

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.559 
see this coming out or cut that that bit
later<00:03:34.420> what<00:03:35.349> you<00:03:35.500> now<00:03:35.680> do<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:37.200> this<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.379> really

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
later what you now do is this is really

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.660 
later what you now do is this is really
tricky<00:03:40.569> bit<00:03:43.349> because<00:03:44.349> your<00:03:44.650> loafer<00:03:45.159> will<00:03:45.459> get

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
tricky bit because your loafer will get

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.589 
tricky bit because your loafer will get
in<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:45.970> way<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.900> now<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:47.170> just<00:03:47.620> tighten<00:03:48.190> it

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
in the way and now you just tighten it

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.860 
in the way and now you just tighten it
but<00:03:49.599> you<00:03:49.720> want<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.019> know<00:03:50.079> how<00:03:50.950> much<00:03:51.190> like<00:03:52.030> this

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
but you want to know how much like this

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:02.569 
but you want to know how much like this
bit<00:03:53.110> really<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.620> getting<00:03:53.890> in<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.099> way<00:03:54.220> and

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:10.410 

then<00:04:03.579> just<00:04:03.849> keep<00:04:05.190> pulling<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:09.030> it's<00:04:10.030> really

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
then just keep pulling it it's really

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.180 
then just keep pulling it it's really
fully<00:04:10.840> because<00:04:11.049> the<00:04:11.230> loafer<00:04:11.560> keeps<00:04:11.769> getting

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
fully because the loafer keeps getting

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.509 
fully because the loafer keeps getting
stuck<00:04:12.819> into<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.420> string<00:04:13.750> right<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:15.280> then<00:04:15.400> you

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
stuck into the string right and then you

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.610 
stuck into the string right and then you
just<00:04:15.730> check<00:04:16.060> because<00:04:16.870> I<00:04:17.079> know<00:04:17.139> how<00:04:17.380> big<00:04:17.590> my

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
just check because I know how big my

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.310 
just check because I know how big my
bobbin<00:04:18.160> is<00:04:18.310> rather<00:04:18.489> small<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.090> that<00:04:19.299> is<00:04:19.989> too

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
bobbin is rather small so that is too

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.680 
bobbin is rather small so that is too
loose<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.799> need<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:23.460> tighten<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.970> little<00:04:25.030> bit

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
loose I need to tighten it a little bit

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.210 
loose I need to tighten it a little bit
more<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:27.419> that's<00:04:28.419> too<00:04:28.810> tight<00:04:29.080> just<00:04:29.590> loosen<00:04:30.099> it

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
more and that's too tight just loosen it

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.320 
more and that's too tight just loosen it
up<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.910> then<00:04:31.690> just<00:04:32.139> tie<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.680> again

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
up and then just tie it again

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.469 
up and then just tie it again
what<00:04:34.330> I've<00:04:34.510> I'm<00:04:34.810> not<00:04:35.560> all<00:04:35.710> ago<00:04:36.010> far<00:04:36.370> I've<00:04:36.669> only

has<00:05:35.979> cost<00:05:36.280> me<00:05:36.550> way<00:05:36.880> less<00:05:37.150> than<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.419> pound<00:05:37.630> and

I think it's so much better because it's

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.830 
I think it's so much better because it's
better<00:05:41.500> than<00:05:41.680> the<00:05:41.830> clip<00:05:42.069> once<00:05:42.370> upon<00:05:42.910> I<00:05:43.150> just

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
better than the clip once upon I just

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.270 
better than the clip once upon I just
don't<00:05:44.050> like<00:05:44.139> the<00:05:44.349> clip<00:05:44.530> ones<00:05:44.740> and<00:05:44.949> I've<00:05:45.039> heard
