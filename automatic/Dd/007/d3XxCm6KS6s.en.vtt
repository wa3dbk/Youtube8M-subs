have the sprint but normally I you know
be<00:00:57.449> walking<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.500> fastest

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
be walking like this this is the fastest

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.729 
be walking like this this is the fastest
you<00:00:59.399> could<00:00:59.579> walk<00:00:59.730> but<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> sprint<00:01:00.620> you<00:01:01.620> know

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
you could walk but of sprint you know

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.590 
you could walk but of sprint you know
you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.190> walk<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.670> fast<00:01:02.969> really

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
you can actually walk this fast really

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.119 
you can actually walk this fast really
fast<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.049> actually<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.379> think<00:01:04.439> when<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.799> fly

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
fast and actually I think when you fly

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.000 
fast and actually I think when you fly
you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.150> move<00:01:06.659> faster<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.260> or<00:01:07.530> maybe<00:01:07.920> just

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
you can move faster to or maybe just

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.070 
you can move faster to or maybe just
give<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.369> perspective<00:01:08.670> or<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> wider

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
give this perspective or like a wider

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.250 
give this perspective or like a wider
screen<00:01:10.650> something<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.479> guys

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
simplest way you can just go to your

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.420 
simplest way you can just go to your
sources

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
and once the packet reload reloads you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.450 
and once the packet reload reloads you
can<00:02:05.720> return<00:02:05.960> to<00:02:06.020> cydia<00:02:06.230> and<00:02:06.530> just<00:02:07.040> click<00:02:07.190> done

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
can return to cydia and just click done

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.520 
can return to cydia and just click done
and<00:02:07.610> then<00:02:08.090> go<00:02:08.210> to<00:02:08.240> series<00:02:08.600> my<00:02:08.750> repo<00:02:08.990> space<00:02:09.200> the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740
