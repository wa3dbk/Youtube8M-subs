00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 welcome to another video of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.770
 me after seeing the samsonite now 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.599
 about two months have tested parts 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.920
 I have my experiences in this video 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.469
 and opinions about this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:23.699
 minimalist usb condenser microphone 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:25.289
 Have fun with you as I do that 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.820
 I have ordered it from my microphone 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.859
 went out a very bad 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.410
 processed and qualitatively her 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.390
 bad microphone to get that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.860
 especially because of the price which almost 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.489
 kept too small where the product 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.469
 even very different I me already 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.750
 when i get to see the packaging 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:48.450
 Everything worked high quality and very much 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.410
 well processed com who once to 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.539
 delivery 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.760
 if we remove the lid comes that 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.989
 Portable USB Condenser Microphone 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.789
 directly to the light 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.149
 We also find one below 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.559
 USB cable to the computer 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.710
 make a small ring around the microphone 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.850
 to mount a microphone stand 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.270
 pretty pretty interesting 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.950
 paperwork foot doing a software for 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.409
 the computer which is on a mac 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.720
 unfortunately did not let open and one 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.030
 pretty cool case around the global 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.560
 secured to transport unfortunately 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.880
 you will not find a pop in the scope of delivery 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.549
 protection but that is usually not the case 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.259
 once with the expensive mikros and if 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.240
 to connect the microphone to pc or mac 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.740
 You can join without complicated 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.630
 install directly 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.610
 or do what you do 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.890
 with the mike making the microphone has 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.630
 a kind of clamp which serves to is 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.100
 a laptop or somewhere else too 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.070
 attach and that really can 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.329
 practical on the side the product 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 turn it on and get three 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.020
 set different modes 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.840
 depending on the distance to the microphone 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.030
 to achieve best results 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.649
 that always very difficult to describe 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.170
 I do not want that much 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.390
 you can do it yourself 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.189
 you make a picture because this somewhere 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.180
 Of course, this is complete with this 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.189
 microphone recorded 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.659
 in my opinion he is amazing 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.390
 good and enough for more than just 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.770
 skype or facetime 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.869
 Of course you can not with his euro 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.069
 Compare micros 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.959
 or is not gone now 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.489
 so this portable usb microphone 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.799
 we come to the conclusion 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.930
 especially for the low price of 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.180
 usually less than 40 euros, I can 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.159
 yourself and roma given the choose 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.590
 a recording microphone would have quite a 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:30.049
 passable sound but still does not offer 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.700
 the purse pours course 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.799
 the microphone sounds a bit rusty though 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.079
 what can you expect at the price 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.599
 especially if many videochat it with 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.190
 Well served the palate I set 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.519
 Of course, also a link 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:49.480
 in the video description of course that 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.480
 you the video then give me one
