00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
this out and and just did a couple of

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.810 
this out and and just did a couple of
logs<00:00:33.930> as<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> test<00:00:34.559> I've<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.280> got<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.610> thing

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
logs as a test I've just got this thing

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.959 
logs as a test I've just got this thing
by<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.059> way<00:00:36.180> liked<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> lot<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.610> can

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
by the way liked it a lot and you can

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.290 
by the way liked it a lot and you can
see<00:00:39.739> that<00:00:40.739> does<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:40.980> come<00:00:41.160> off<00:00:41.250> very<00:00:41.520> easy<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
see that does not come off very easy and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.420 
see that does not come off very easy and
if<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.629> look<00:00:42.809> even<00:00:42.899> closer<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.340> over

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
if you look even closer you can see over

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.069 
if you look even closer you can see over
here<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.730> there's<00:00:45.090> some<00:00:45.360> some<00:00:45.840> brown<00:00:46.050> spots

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
here that there's some some brown spots

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.130 
here that there's some some brown spots
and<00:00:46.620> that's<00:00:46.739> from<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> bark<00:00:47.989> you<00:00:48.989> also

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
and that's from the bark you also

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.810 
and that's from the bark you also
probably<00:00:49.530> know<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.100> trying<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.399> clean<00:00:50.640> this

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
probably know that trying to clean this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.869 
probably know that trying to clean this
it's<00:00:51.329> not<00:00:51.629> exactly<00:00:52.079> easy<00:00:52.170> either<00:00:52.730> you<00:00:53.730> could

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
it's not exactly easy either you could

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.450 
it's not exactly easy either you could
sit<00:00:54.059> there<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.270> scrub<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:56.370> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
sit there and scrub it this and you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.010 
sit there and scrub it this and you
pretty<00:00:56.670> much<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.090> use<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.660> steel<00:00:57.989> wool

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
pretty much have to use like steel wool

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.290 
pretty much have to use like steel wool
and<00:00:58.820> I<00:00:59.820> don't<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.449> use<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:00.809> ASA<00:01:01.770> tone

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
and I don't like to use it but ASA tone

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.370 
and I don't like to use it but ASA tone
works<00:01:03.300> really<00:01:03.690> well<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.320> remove<00:01:05.930> SAP<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.200> bark

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
works really well to remove SAP and bark

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.609 
works really well to remove SAP and bark
and<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.710> kind<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.920> stuff<00:01:08.840> but<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.110> know<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and that kind of stuff but you know I

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.310 
and that kind of stuff but you know I
didn't<00:01:11.280> want<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.990> other<00:01:13.110> thing

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
didn't want to do that the other thing

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.350 
didn't want to do that the other thing
that<00:01:13.350> I've<00:01:13.560> seen<00:01:14.010> people<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.430> too

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
to find a solution to this that was

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.140 
to find a solution to this that was
environmentally<00:01:40.079> friendly<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.729> fact<00:01:41.939> I

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
like it was waxed that's because it was

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.960 
like it was waxed that's because it was
fact<00:02:16.110> there's<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.350> company<00:02:16.560> right<00:02:16.830> now<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.250> I

clothes that are meant to be greenland
waxed<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.440> neat<00:02:25.590> thing<00:02:25.770> about<00:02:25.800> this

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
waxed and so the neat thing about this

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.640 
waxed and so the neat thing about this
is<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.850> can<00:02:27.000> rub<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.360> as<00:02:28.200> much<00:02:28.440> or<00:02:28.620> as

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
is you can rub it on as much or as

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.020 
is you can rub it on as much or as
little<00:02:28.710> as<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.130> like<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.490> can<00:02:29.700> increase

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
little as you like so you can increase

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.420 
little as you like so you can increase
your<00:02:30.150> waterproofing<00:02:30.960> or<00:02:31.140> decrease<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.740> washes

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
your waterproofing or decrease it washes

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.330 
your waterproofing or decrease it washes
off<00:02:32.550> with<00:02:32.730> hot<00:02:32.880> water<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.590> beeswax<00:02:35.070> in

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
off with hot water and the beeswax in

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.060 
off with hot water and the beeswax in
this<00:02:35.700> wax<00:02:36.210> actually<00:02:36.900> makes<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.320> extremely

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
this wax actually makes it extremely

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.950 
this wax actually makes it extremely
tough<00:02:38.520> but<00:02:39.030> also<00:02:39.270> just<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.570> little<00:02:39.750> bit

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
tough but also just a little bit

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.460 
tough but also just a little bit
flexible<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.970> couldn't<00:02:42.750> break<00:02:42.990> this<00:02:43.200> if<00:02:43.350> I

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
flexible so I couldn't break this if I

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.030 
flexible so I couldn't break this if I
tried<00:02:44.120> where<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.410> just<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.470> normal<00:02:46.770> stick<00:02:46.950> of

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
tried where is just a normal stick of

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.430 
tried where is just a normal stick of
paraffin<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.730> could<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:49.020> other<00:02:49.140> thing

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
paraffin I think I could the other thing

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.730 
paraffin I think I could the other thing
is<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:50.150> rubberiness<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.720> will<00:02:52.440> keep<00:02:52.620> it

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
is that rubberiness to it will keep it

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.650 
is that rubberiness to it will keep it
from<00:02:52.860> from<00:02:53.250> flaking<00:02:53.550> off<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.030> breaking<00:02:54.390> so

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
from from flaking off and breaking so

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.150 
from from flaking off and breaking so
anyways<00:02:55.230> without<00:02:55.380> further<00:02:55.500> ado<00:02:55.950> I'm<00:02:56.070> gonna

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
anyways without further ado I'm gonna

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.270 
anyways without further ado I'm gonna
show<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.430> what<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.700> do<00:02:56.820> here<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.980> side<00:02:59.190> of

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
show you what you do here this side of

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.950 
show you what you do here this side of
the<00:02:59.340> blade<00:02:59.520> here<00:02:59.670> haven't<00:03:00.210> waxed<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.660> it's

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
the blade here haven't waxed it it's

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.610 
the blade here haven't waxed it it's
completely<00:03:01.920> virgin<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.990> simply<00:03:04.260> just

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
completely virgin so you simply just

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.490 
completely virgin so you simply just
take<00:03:04.860> your<00:03:05.280> stick<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.640> wax<00:03:05.850> like<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.410> rub<00:03:07.410> it

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
take your stick of wax like this rub it

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.670 
take your stick of wax like this rub it
on<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.950> then<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.540> bacon<00:03:09.870> into<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.170> finish<00:03:10.440> all

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
on and then to bacon into the finish all

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.310 
on and then to bacon into the finish all
I<00:03:10.770> do<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.280> apply<00:03:11.400> some<00:03:11.550> heat<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.150> now<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:13.080> any

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
I do is apply some heat to it now if any

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.770 
I do is apply some heat to it now if any
of<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.590> were<00:03:13.770> in<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.520> army<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.450> probably

of you were in the army you probably
know<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.290> was<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.770> cheap<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.670> quick

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
know that this was the cheap and quick

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.600 
know that this was the cheap and quick
way<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.060> get<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.480> shine<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:18.870> your<00:03:18.990> boots<00:03:19.610> without

having to do the hours and hours and
hours<00:03:22.050> of<00:03:22.230> rubbing<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.710> polishing<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:24.330> here

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
hours of rubbing and polishing so here

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.200 
hours of rubbing and polishing so here
we<00:03:25.320> go<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.680> can<00:03:26.190> see<00:03:26.370> it's<00:03:26.850> taking<00:03:27.000> the

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
we go you can see it's taking the

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.370 
we go you can see it's taking the
lighter<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.480> little<00:03:27.660> while<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.080> melt<00:03:28.260> it

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
lighter a little while to melt it

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.930 
lighter a little while to melt it
because<00:03:28.680> Greenland<00:03:29.310> wax<00:03:29.460> actually<00:03:29.820> has<00:03:29.910> a

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
because Greenland wax actually has a

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.480 
because Greenland wax actually has a
pretty<00:03:30.150> high<00:03:30.360> heat<00:03:30.750> tolerance<00:03:31.200> as<00:03:31.350> well<00:03:31.530> but

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
pretty high heat tolerance as well but

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.650 
pretty high heat tolerance as well but
once<00:03:32.700> it's<00:03:32.880> in<00:03:32.970> there<00:03:33.090> it's<00:03:33.270> gonna<00:03:33.390> be<00:03:33.540> on

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
once it's in there it's gonna be on

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.830 
once it's in there it's gonna be on
there<00:03:33.840> pretty<00:03:34.050> darn<00:03:34.260> good<00:03:35.630> now<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.690> other

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
there pretty darn good now the other

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.340 
there pretty darn good now the other
cool<00:03:37.050> thing<00:03:37.260> about<00:03:37.320> this<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:39.110> most<00:03:40.110> of<00:03:40.260> these

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
cool thing about this is most of these

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.870 
cool thing about this is most of these
blades<00:03:40.770> so<00:03:41.250> now<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.400> can<00:03:41.580> see<00:03:41.700> that's

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
blades so now you can see that's

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.660 
blades so now you can see that's
virtually<00:03:42.570> invisible

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
virtually invisible

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.270 
virtually invisible
most<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.790> these<00:03:44.880> blades<00:03:45.060> are<00:03:45.330> made<00:03:45.450> out<00:03:45.630> of

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
most of these blades are made out of

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.850 
most of these blades are made out of
steel<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:47.460> 1095<00:03:48.120> or<00:03:48.390> 1060<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.260> it's<00:03:49.620> not

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
steel like 1095 or 1060 and it's not

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.400 
steel like 1095 or 1060 and it's not
exactly<00:03:50.280> rust<00:03:50.820> resistant<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:51.570> I<00:03:51.780> think<00:03:52.170> by

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
exactly rust resistant so I think by

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.720 
exactly rust resistant so I think by
adding<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.770> little<00:03:52.890> bit<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.130> wax<00:03:53.250> here<00:03:53.520> you're

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
adding a little bit of wax here you're

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.830 
adding a little bit of wax here you're
going<00:03:53.820> to<00:03:53.910> be<00:03:54.030> increasing<00:03:54.510> your<00:03:54.600> rust

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
going to be increasing your rust

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.710 
going to be increasing your rust
resistance<00:03:55.790> if<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.940> ever<00:03:57.090> decide<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.570> you

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
resistance if you ever decide that you

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.290 
resistance if you ever decide that you
want<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.050> off<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:59.040> good<00:03:59.550> soaking<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.090> hot

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
want this off a good soaking and hot

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.880 
want this off a good soaking and hot
water<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.720> soap<00:04:00.930> will<00:04:01.080> take<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:01.380> straight<00:04:01.860> out

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
water and soap will take it straight out

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.750 
water and soap will take it straight out
but<00:04:03.170> nice<00:04:04.170> thing<00:04:04.380> is<00:04:04.500> if<00:04:04.710> it's<00:04:04.890> you<00:04:05.310> know<00:04:05.340> the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
but nice thing is if it's you know the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.180 
but nice thing is if it's you know the
least<00:04:05.970> bit<00:04:06.240> cold<00:04:06.450> outside<00:04:06.740> it's<00:04:07.740> gonna<00:04:07.950> stick

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
least bit cold outside it's gonna stick

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.260 
least bit cold outside it's gonna stick
on<00:04:08.310> here<00:04:08.520> like<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.820> wouldn't<00:04:09.030> believe

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
on here like you wouldn't believe

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.800 
on here like you wouldn't believe
so<00:04:09.600> anyways<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:11.190> is<00:04:11.370> how<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.210> keep<00:04:12.420> my<00:04:12.480> blade

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
so anyways that is how I keep my blade

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.710 
so anyways that is how I keep my blade
clean<00:04:13.350> without<00:04:13.530> using<00:04:13.650> any<00:04:13.980> solvents<00:04:14.720> nasty

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
clean without using any solvents nasty

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:24.100 
clean without using any solvents nasty
chemicals<00:04:16.140> things<00:04:16.350> like<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.859> hope

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.169 

you
