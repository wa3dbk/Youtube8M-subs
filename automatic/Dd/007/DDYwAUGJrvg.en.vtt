in<00:03:08.250> my<00:03:08.489> opinion<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.300> little<00:03:09.750> too<00:03:09.959> high<00:03:10.260> for<00:03:10.670> what

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
in my opinion a little too high for what

in my opinion a little too high for what
you're<00:03:11.910> getting<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.900> price<00:03:13.110> was<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.380> little

you're getting if the price was a little
bit<00:03:13.739> more<00:03:13.920> reasonable<00:03:14.269> for<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.840> package<00:03:16.110> that

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
bit more reasonable for the package that

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.130 
bit more reasonable for the package that
you<00:03:16.560> get<00:03:16.769> then<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.850> would<00:03:18.060> be<00:03:18.090> absolutely<00:03:18.600> fine
