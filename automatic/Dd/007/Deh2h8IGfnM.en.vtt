00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:10.730
 Ignore the standard values ​​for which integrity has been verified . 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.550
 It seems very useful to emphasize efficacy only 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.490
 As you saw earlier opened contractor will receive surgery 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:21.789
 Based on the anti-cancer drugs 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:26.080
 I'm talking about a dissertation from the University of Washington . 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:28.750
 In the paper, there is an effect on the performance of artemisin in the opening 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.440
 Clearly, I'm writing down. 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:36.610
 In other words, the cells need iron to function. 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.320
 One cell contains an adequate amount of it, and cancer cells have a lot of iron 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.059
 Will 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:48.270
 Artemis castle of opening labor acts of iron of cancer cell 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:53.039
 This article explains the fact that it has an anti-cancer effect 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.230
 So far, artemis is used as a major ingredient in the treatment of malaria 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.339
 The principle is picked 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.960
 If you get caught on the horse's day, you will get more iron , 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:07.510
 It works. 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.140
 If you look at this, you should definitely have antitumor effect. 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.140
 I wonder 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:21.450
 There are a lot of reds in this kind of products. 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.450
 I've searched for a component analysis of the agency. 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:35.240
 I think the room or the direction in which the people that opened the aqueous anti-cancer components 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.240
 It presents the labor of the University of Washington as a basis Tok 4 sc 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:46.220
 But what he said in the paper was different 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.200
 There are few papers that the cancer rumors Arte superstition can opening 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.310
 The same 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:58.250
 Arte US New'm something like the ingredients contained in Datong 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.530
 4 But the fact is that a team from this laboratory study where new look 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.960
 What effect does it have? 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.720
 Oh, to kill cancer cells in the 10-fold more choices Like this 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.290
 That's my enemy. 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:18.340
 Mr. Artemis said the cancer effect is about 10 times 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.340
 If so, is the anti-cancer effect of people 100 times more than 100 times that 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:31.510
 The multiethologists of this Artemis god have put together new materials together. 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:36.040
 New cargo schedule The new compound is now 100 times more 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:40.569
 Because it selectively kills many in the Hermitage in fact pro now 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:44.549
 When you eat dogwood mugwort in such a thread form, it's like 1600 won. 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.549
 It's not a person at all 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.980
 If so , do you have anticancer effects in the products of Gaek Dong-kyun ? 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.939
 Oh, we commissioned a detection test with Artemis. 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.269
 But the result is shocking 4 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:06.230
 Firefly wormwood Hay called the Tuesday did not come nearly 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:12.819
 I thought the component itself would detect it at all . 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.819
 Artemis ingredients that are not fenced in Datong products Ladies vu is Mr. Mo 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.530
 It is the only malaria treatment in Korea that extracts artemisin 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.520
 Find a business with 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.819
 Oh, but how can you see the crystal that is out there in Artemis 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.819
 I was there. 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.670
 Artemis , an anti-cancer gift in the opening , 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.709
 Weak in heat 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:44.080
 Problems will also become a problem if you open a topic . 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.799
 Anyway II not cry yet devised alcoholic extract is also kept in the morning 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.459
 It's not possible 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:57.940
 Hey hemorrhoids in the process gets to the black this, I now offer not served in the morning 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:04:02.739
 To extract the components that are acoustical, artemia cnn 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:07.239
 It was a reason why we could not detect it because there was an artemisia 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:09.409
 Simply saying that eating dogwood mugwort does not come out of the voice painted artemis 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.409
 Will 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.409
 Oo
