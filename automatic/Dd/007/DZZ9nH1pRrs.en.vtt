00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.319
 I have 2 little notes means one note 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.630
 brothers tell me how to read and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.210
 delve into the bible 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:15.150
 I try to read but then housework and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.259
 I can’t think about it 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:25.169
 I read that you can give advice as 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:29.189
 learn to delve study but the message 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:31.649
 Colossians 3 chapter written verse 16 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.890
 the word of Christ may dwell in you 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.980
 plentifully with all wisdom registered 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.630
 in mind find each other in psalms 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.670
 praise of spiritual songs by 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.240
 grace singing in your hearts 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.460
 lord first i wanted to say that 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.610
 sometimes a frustrated person appears 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.260
 I read and then I do not even remember what I read 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.620

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.160
 heard one shepherd once 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.280
 I gave up on this radio example 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.610

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.530

 throughout the year reads the new covenant and 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.580
 then as she speaks calmly once more 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.450

 two months young for how much for 2 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.110

 of these most pleasant moment was mine 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.750
 I remember when, but this is necessary somewhere 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.180
 at least 20 chapters read a day at least 20 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.000
 chapters up to this but it is necessary so to this 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.340
 time is true I remember the most pleasant 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.950
 moment it was dressed at two in the morning i 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.920
 read the book of Daniel the prophet of course 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.290
 somewhere a dream somewhere else something up 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.600
 tiredness if you look for reasons 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.580
 then everything is in horizontal 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.270
 position at the end of the day to be but already in my 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:41.270
 age before apple did not read daniel i 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.370

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.900

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.470

 Today I have an appetite. Yes, I 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.840
 I just look at my watch I think God 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:57.140
 Well, now I say, may I 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.180
 I’ll finish reading Daniel and I know myself 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.350
 it was necessary to get up early there further 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.720
 move in ministry 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.690
 I pray the game my God well you can 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.390

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.260
 stayed a few hours and know with 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:16.670
 I read a book of the prophet with a huge appetite 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.530
 Daniel, I will say this for example when I 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.810
 I am at home in the morning we 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.290
 meet there we have in the office 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.360
 our fraternity employees there are different 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.130
 what helps me 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.990
 you certainly prayerfully study the word 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.770
 god pray about it so god 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:38.180
 showed that but it helps me a lot when 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.760
 i share what i read i never 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.510
 I am preparing a special sermon for 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.340
 employees but happens as exceptions to 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.500
 in the morning I am now in our situation 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.380
 could everything in life be many different 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.440
 example brought here now our daughter 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:59.090

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:02.720

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:05.280
 I read what I read and I tell 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.860
 let me tell her 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.250
 I have a whole series of thoughts appearing like 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:15.780

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:18.750

 I read and didn’t see it, but we started 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.850

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.870
 when i come 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.419
 still telling it during the day sometimes 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.620
 It happens five times this text 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:40.650
 sharing someone 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.490

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:02.100

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.979
 by others
