I<00:01:06.270> don't<00:01:06.540> think<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.900> matter<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.280> might

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
I don't think this matter but it might

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.340 
I don't think this matter but it might
perform<00:01:08.729> better<00:01:09.180> weather<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.540> upright<00:01:10.170> or

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
perform better weather is upright or

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.760 
perform better weather is upright or
default<00:01:10.799> but<00:01:11.130> low<00:01:11.479> um<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.320> that's<00:01:13.530> how<00:01:13.680> you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
default but low um and that's how you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
default but low um and that's how you
need<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.549> really<00:01:14.790> don't<00:01:15.060> need<00:01:15.210> nothing<00:01:15.630> else

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
need you really don't need nothing else

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.920 
need you really don't need nothing else
so<00:01:17.210> you<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.450> hold<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.920> go<00:01:20.100> left<00:01:20.400> right

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
so you just hold on to and go left right

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.260 
so you just hold on to and go left right
left<00:01:21.930> right<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.220> normally<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.790> it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
left right and what normally they do it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.330 
left right and what normally they do it
allows<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:24.960> wide<00:01:25.229> open<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.920> your<00:01:26.130> shoot

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
allows you to be wide open on your shoot

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.249 
allows you to be wide open on your shoot
I<00:01:26.780> mean<00:01:28.460> but<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> thing<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.780> reason<00:01:31.140> I'm

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
I mean but the thing is the reason I'm

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.929 
I mean but the thing is the reason I'm
cool<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.950> because<00:01:32.310> when<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.579> come<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
cool with it is because when you come to

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.840 
cool with it is because when you come to
the<00:01:33.030> rec<00:01:33.240> center<00:01:34.159> most<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.610> dead
