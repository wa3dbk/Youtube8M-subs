00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
and all the buttons and new d-pad like

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.860 
and all the buttons and new d-pad like
on<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.250> previous<00:01:40.580> controllers<00:01:41.090> this<00:01:41.630> one

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
on the previous controllers this one

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.610 
on the previous controllers this one
it's<00:01:42.290> more<00:01:43.120> so<00:01:44.120> that<00:01:44.150> allows<00:01:44.600> more<00:01:45.170> precision

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
it's more so that allows more precision

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.580 
it's more so that allows more precision
precision<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:46.670> swim<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:47.630> when<00:01:47.960> playing<00:01:48.290> in

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
precision and swim this when playing in

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.690 
precision and swim this when playing in
game<00:01:49.210> and<00:01:50.210> then<00:01:51.140> lists<00:01:52.100> some<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.490> features

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.780 
game and then lists some of the features
for<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.540> controller<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:55.130> you've<00:01:55.550> got<00:01:55.580> your

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790
