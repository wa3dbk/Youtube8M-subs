00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440
 soon it is time microsoft lays down 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:14.040
 and presents the new windows 8.1 who 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.949
 Windows 8 already uses that can do that 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.220
 update for free in the app store download all 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.460
 others have to buy the version 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.080
 we take a look at windows 8.1 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.480
 We are looking at a few innovations 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.760
 right at the start presents the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480
 Tile surface that looks like 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.739
 before 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.480
 But you can customize some things like that 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.550
 For example, you can do it for the tiles 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.930
 the size determines there are now four 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.180
 sizes to choose from 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.250
 For example when the weather is longer 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.710
 then you want to have information 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.960
 I use the right mouse button on it and 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.940
 have down the menu the entry size 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.300
 to change 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.680
 and then I can choose big and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.739
 already becomes me in addition to the current 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.700
 temperature more information displayed 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.510
 in this case yes the prediction for the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.240
 next days 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.540
 The same applies to the calendar there 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.140
 then the dates for the complete 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.700
 I do not like things that week 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.710
 very much and only really 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.570
 Take away space unnecessarily 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.930
 in the cart surface I can in the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.220
 size to small and then take 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:39.840
 she only holds a small place 1 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.850
 Apps settle in the checkout surface 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.390
 Now I can group several 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.210
 click apps and in a slip 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.670
 move and up here a group 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.250
 to name 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:57.299
 for example games and there all my 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.780
 players cramming so I apps that 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.140
 they also belong together 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.890
 The background can also be changed 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.490
 microsoft has increased a bit 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.240
 and 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.420
 Several designs provided 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.690
 i can customize the color here 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.720
 to adjust 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.190
 Whom the whole thing a bit too abstract 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.050
 that is also the desktop motive so 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.800
 the background that I have on the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.650
 classic work surface for 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.890
 take over the tile screen 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.210
 I click in the desktop with the right one 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:46.830
 then mouse button on the taskbar below then 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:50.080
 on properties in the menu on navigation 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.060
 and can put a hook here 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.190
 desktop background on the home page 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.660
 Show 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:01.660
 take over and if I go back now 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.850
 in the tile surface then changed 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.690
 So I have the same motive in the 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.690
 background
