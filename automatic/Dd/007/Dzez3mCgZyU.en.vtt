 there is more geocache or we are going 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.450
 pretty much further with our world trip me 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.980
 I am tired so still not shaved me 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.029
 know that I should do that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.680
 it doesn't matter we are up anyway 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.020
 world trip and if you are already a world 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.700
 then that doesn't bother at all, but really 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.070
 not a single nut from what is a farmer 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.669

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.309
 have no idea 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.020
 I have this idea 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.850
 because if I look ugly look 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.670
 for a moment how la la la la 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.560
 no lines on the side of the road and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.050
 he had taught me that they were yellow 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.420
 lines on the side of the road 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.130
 south africa the this is a bit hard 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.900
 an african landscape, I thought so 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.360
 and south african landscape 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.000
 it's hot it's drier a bit 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.540
 sand, and plenty of water and are much colder 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.350
 it actually 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.450
 those wallpaper trees so I think citrox 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.559
 happens 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.559
 what's here it's this 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:15.640
 someone has forgotten the cap of the month 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.439
 car exploded here or there are things 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.240
 actually happens should think about it 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.729
 I think so, but we just go ourselves 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.649
 you say this is a south africa 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.539
 hoffschlag los I say cash with that 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.119
 that is not in south africa it is in 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.939
 botswana yes but on the border 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.549
 oh 7 it can be even closer to the limits 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.220
 that shit and the we are two meters outside 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.960
 well anyway 2405 where suck that point and 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.270
 which is good 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.850
 and if it is 4 of 75 I can do something with it 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.409
 how someone peeled all trees here 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.170
 or they are Christmas trees without being over the 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.049
 can also do tricks with those trees 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.000
 go check them will my trunks 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.520
 what they are doing with that tree and where 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.179
 we are still nice to know 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.100
