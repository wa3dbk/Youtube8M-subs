because the faster I move the fabric the

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.759 
because the faster I move the fabric the
faster<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.390> have<00:04:09.629> to<00:04:09.780> have<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.019> speed<00:04:10.319> going

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
faster I have to have the speed going

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.759 
faster I have to have the speed going
the<00:04:11.250> slower<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.910> move<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.989> slower<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.590> need

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
the slower you move the slower you need

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.060 
the slower you move the slower you need
to<00:04:13.920> move<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.280> fabric<00:04:15.200> so<00:04:16.200> take<00:04:16.680> your<00:04:16.859> fabric

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
to move the fabric so take your fabric

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.590 
to move the fabric so take your fabric
there's<00:04:17.549> lots<00:04:17.850> of<00:04:17.970> things<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:18.450> can

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
there's lots of things that you can

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.719 
there's lots of things that you can
purchase<00:04:18.810> like<00:04:19.200> gloves<00:04:19.620> quilting<00:04:20.280> gloves<00:04:20.549> and

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
purchase like gloves quilting gloves and

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:27.080 
purchase like gloves quilting gloves and
stuff<00:04:20.970> like<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.389> to<00:04:21.660> make<00:04:21.810> it<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.019> bit<00:04:22.169> easier

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.090 

so<00:04:28.090> I'm<00:04:28.330> actually<00:04:28.540> drawing<00:04:29.020> with<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.680> actual

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
so I'm actually drawing with the actual

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.510 
so I'm actually drawing with the actual
machine<00:04:33.750> as<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:34.960> can<00:04:35.140> see<00:04:35.350> I'm<00:04:35.590> creating<00:04:36.070> the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
machine as you can see I'm creating the

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.010 
machine as you can see I'm creating the
stitch<00:04:36.760> length<00:04:37.030> by<00:04:37.840> moving<00:04:38.170> it<00:04:42.690> so<00:04:43.690> you<00:04:43.780> can

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
stitch length by moving it so you can

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.290 
stitch length by moving it so you can
see<00:04:44.260> that<00:04:44.440> when<00:04:44.590> we<00:04:44.710> stop<00:04:45.070> that<00:04:45.910> my<00:04:46.090> needle

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
see that when we stop that my needle

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.450 
see that when we stop that my needle
staying<00:04:46.720> down<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.380> that's<00:04:47.830> where<00:04:48.040> we<00:04:48.160> want<00:04:48.370> it

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
staying down and that's where we want it

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.930 
staying down and that's where we want it
to<00:04:48.580> be<00:04:48.760> when<00:04:49.090> we're<00:04:49.240> doing<00:04:49.390> this<00:04:49.690> stippling

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
to be when we're doing this stippling

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.810 
to be when we're doing this stippling
press<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.120> needle<00:04:52.420> up<00:04:52.600> to<00:04:52.990> raise<00:04:53.200> your<00:04:53.410> needle

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
press the needle up to raise your needle

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.910 
press the needle up to raise your needle
lift<00:04:54.820> up<00:04:55.030> your<00:04:55.150> foot<00:04:55.360> and<00:04:55.690> release<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.500> fabric

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
lift up your foot and release the fabric

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.490 
lift up your foot and release the fabric
so<00:04:57.460> that's<00:04:58.000> what<00:04:58.150> we<00:04:58.240> call<00:04:58.420> stippling<00:04:58.960> but

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
so that's what we call stippling but

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.390 
so that's what we call stippling but
people<00:04:59.860> do<00:05:00.250> draw<00:05:00.640> with<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:01.470> and<00:05:02.470> paint<00:05:03.010> with<00:05:03.250> it

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
people do draw with it and paint with it

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.720 
people do draw with it and paint with it
like<00:05:03.610> it's<00:05:03.940> actually<00:05:04.560> artwork<00:05:05.560> so<00:05:06.460> now<00:05:06.610> I'm

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
like it's actually artwork so now I'm

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.980 
like it's actually artwork so now I'm
going<00:05:06.910> to<00:05:07.000> explain<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.450> other<00:05:07.570> foot<00:05:07.840> that

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
going to explain the other foot that

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.560 
going to explain the other foot that
comes<00:05:08.170> with<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.620> NX<00:05:08.980> 200<00:05:09.670> and<00:05:09.850> that's<00:05:10.360> the

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
comes with the NX 200 and that's the

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.450 
comes with the NX 200 and that's the
walking<00:05:10.960> foot<00:05:11.140> the<00:05:11.800> walking<00:05:12.160> foot<00:05:12.310> is

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
walking foot the walking foot is

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.640 
walking foot the walking foot is
designed<00:05:12.850> to<00:05:13.030> use<00:05:13.060> with<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.780> feed<00:05:14.020> dogs<00:05:14.350> in

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
designed to use with the feed dogs in

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.580 
designed to use with the feed dogs in
the<00:05:14.800> up<00:05:14.950> position<00:05:14.980> on<00:05:15.670> the<00:05:16.060> machine<00:05:16.450> and<00:05:16.780> then

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
the up position on the machine and then

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.370 
the up position on the machine and then
the<00:05:18.040> walking<00:05:18.490> foot<00:05:18.700> has<00:05:19.270> its<00:05:19.480> own<00:05:19.720> feed<00:05:20.080> dogs

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
the walking foot has its own feed dogs

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.860 
the walking foot has its own feed dogs
to<00:05:20.620> walk<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:21.040> top<00:05:21.280> of<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.490> fabric<00:05:21.940> this<00:05:22.660> is

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
to walk the top of the fabric this is

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.170 
to walk the top of the fabric this is
designed<00:05:23.320> so<00:05:23.650> that<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:24.010> top<00:05:24.250> fabric<00:05:24.760> and<00:05:24.970> the

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
designed so that the top fabric and the

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.720 
designed so that the top fabric and the
bottom<00:05:25.510> fabric<00:05:25.750> move<00:05:26.620> evenly<00:05:27.310> through<00:05:27.610> the

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
bottom fabric move evenly through the

bottom fabric move evenly through the
machine<00:05:28.150> as<00:05:28.360> its<00:05:28.690> stitching<00:05:29.170> so<00:05:29.650> we<00:05:29.770> need<00:05:29.950> to

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
machine as its stitching so we need to

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.890 
machine as its stitching so we need to
remove<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.700> quilting<00:05:31.120> foot<00:05:31.360> from<00:05:31.750> the

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
release the foot the walking foot gets

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.460 
release the foot the walking foot gets
screwed<00:05:43.600> onto<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.020> bar<00:05:44.200> exactly<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:44.980> same

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
screwed onto the bar exactly the same

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.720 
screwed onto the bar exactly the same
except<00:05:47.470> there's<00:05:47.680> a<00:05:47.740> little<00:05:48.010> bar<00:05:48.190> on<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.550> right

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.220 
hand side here that needs to be hooked
onto<00:05:51.400> the<00:05:51.670> needle<00:05:52.000> bar<00:05:52.150> so<00:05:52.480> make<00:05:52.780> sure<00:05:53.050> that's

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
onto the needle bar so make sure that's

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.950 
onto the needle bar so make sure that's
hooked<00:05:53.530> onto<00:05:53.740> there<00:05:54.040> and<00:05:54.360> then<00:05:55.360> slide<00:05:55.750> the

hooked onto there and then slide the

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.410 
hooked onto there and then slide the
walking<00:05:56.290> foot<00:05:56.470> onto<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:56.860> bar<00:05:57.210> take<00:05:58.210> your

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
walking foot onto the bar take your

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.440 
walking foot onto the bar take your
screwdriver<00:05:58.750> and<00:05:59.430> do<00:06:00.430> it<00:06:00.580> up<00:06:00.700> tight

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
screwdriver and do it up tight

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.660 
screwdriver and do it up tight
we'll<00:06:01.900> also<00:06:02.080> need<00:06:02.260> to<00:06:02.620> lift<00:06:02.800> up<00:06:02.980> the<00:06:03.130> feed<00:06:03.370> dogs

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
we'll also need to lift up the feed dogs

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.950 
we'll also need to lift up the feed dogs
so<00:06:04.420> turn<00:06:04.750> the<00:06:04.900> Machine<00:06:05.230> around

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.640 

and<00:06:09.520> slide<00:06:10.520> the<00:06:10.699> bar<00:06:10.910> back<00:06:11.320> to<00:06:12.320> the<00:06:12.410> right<00:06:12.620> hand

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
and slide the bar back to the right hand

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.700 
and slide the bar back to the right hand
side<00:06:13.300> so<00:06:14.300> that<00:06:14.509> it<00:06:14.660> lifts<00:06:14.930> up<00:06:15.050> the<00:06:15.110> feed<00:06:15.440> dogs

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
side so that it lifts up the feed dogs

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.029 
side so that it lifts up the feed dogs
so<00:06:16.610> all<00:06:16.880> I<00:06:16.910> need<00:06:17.030> to<00:06:17.330> do<00:06:17.509> is<00:06:17.840> needle<00:06:18.800> up<00:06:18.919> and

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
so all I need to do is needle up and

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.140 
so all I need to do is needle up and
down<00:06:19.160> once<00:06:19.840> and<00:06:21.430> that<00:06:22.430> will<00:06:22.580> actually<00:06:22.970> raise

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
down once and that will actually raise

would need to do is increase my stitch

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.460 
would need to do is increase my stitch
length<00:06:37.000> so<00:06:38.000> highlight<00:06:38.780> the<00:06:38.960> stitch<00:06:39.229> length

of my stitches

of my stitches
had<00:07:45.440> I<00:07:45.560> not<00:07:45.740> used<00:07:46.160> the<00:07:46.340> walking<00:07:46.730> foot<00:07:46.940> even

had I not used the walking foot even
though<00:07:47.810> we<00:07:47.960> have<00:07:48.200> three<00:07:48.650> different<00:07:49.040> stitch

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.310 
though we have three different stitch
lengths<00:07:49.700> here

lengths here

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.810

it may have puckered around the edge

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.820 
it may have puckered around the edge
because<00:07:53.360> the<00:07:53.510> top<00:07:53.720> fabric<00:07:53.990> would<00:07:54.290> not<00:07:54.530> have
