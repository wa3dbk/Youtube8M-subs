00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.150
 chocolate with chocolate case 70 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.560
 percent of chocolate we put it in a 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.660
 2 with a little milk and we take it 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.960
 to the microwave about 40 seconds 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.170
 once hot we stir it well until 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.480
 that is completely dissolved and what 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.090
 we let it rest until it cools in 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.530
 two goals we separated the whites from the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.860
 yolks three eggs 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.980
 and we will beat the egg yolks until first 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.920
 that we are very white by adding 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.760
 first two tablespoons of sugar and then 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.890
 three tablespoons of invert sugar 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.110
 we will see that little by little it is getting 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.780
 sparkling until you get this 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.260
 consistency in which you can make a 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.390
 8 and we'll leave that refreshing and then 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.600
 let's beat the whites about to 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.760
 snow as seen in the image once 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.930
 that are already about to snow we're going 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.220
 adding 5 tablespoons of sugar until 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.220
 that is well integrated 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.930
 in another bowl we are going to put 450 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:12.260
 milliliters of cream 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.250
 of cream to mount milk cream and the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.920
 we beat well until it is mounted on 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.170
 this consistency that is seen here with the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.540
 spatula of wet and it is to this mixture to 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.250
 which you will add chocolate 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.590
 I've put him without drama if you like more 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.030
 black because you'll see that it does not come out 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.070
 excessively black but he liked 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.050
 black for the addition of both chocolate 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.400
 as you want even if you prefer a 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.470
 white chocolate or a chocolate with 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.300
 milk also to the clear mounted 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.240
 we add the yolks mounted with the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.790
 sugar and sugar a little bit to 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.520
 little so that they integrate well and 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.610
 once they are integrated then we go 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.229
 to add the cream with the chocolate and 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.570
 we'll mix that with the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.700
 Spatula so that it is sparkling for 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.460
 that is almost like a mousse as you see 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.070
 in the image we will give you space 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.649
 and once integrated, we will add the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.080
 of chocolate I here have put half 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.500
 then I add another amount equal to 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.930
 this one so that there are many trips 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.010
 when we have mixed it we will fill 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.380
 the containers that will go to the refrigerator and 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.720
 they will be in them at least 24 hours 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.450
 It also depends on how your 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.720
 freezer there are freezers that freeze 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.160
 faster than others here you have it 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.200
 After that 24 hours, we already have 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.200
 here the ice cream that is very creamy
