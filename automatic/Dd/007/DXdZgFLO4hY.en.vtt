gray tank readings grace the water test
many<00:00:16.480> people<00:00:16.930> are<00:00:17.050> having<00:00:17.259> problems<00:00:17.920> getting

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
many people are having problems getting

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.640 
many people are having problems getting
correct<00:00:18.670> readings<00:00:19.150> of<00:00:19.509> the<00:00:19.900> levels<00:00:20.259> in<00:00:20.439> their

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
correct readings of the levels in their

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.700 
correct readings of the levels in their
tanks<00:00:21.390> what<00:00:22.390> is<00:00:22.539> the<00:00:22.660> cause<00:00:22.900> and<00:00:22.930> what<00:00:23.470> can<00:00:23.680> be

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
tanks what is the cause and what can be

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.040 
tanks what is the cause and what can be
done<00:00:23.859> about<00:00:24.039> it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
done about it

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.980 
done about it
usually<00:00:26.050> this<00:00:26.859> is<00:00:27.160> what<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.880> inside<00:00:28.449> of<00:00:28.750> your

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
usually this is what the inside of your

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.460 
usually this is what the inside of your
tank<00:00:29.349> looks<00:00:29.859> like<00:00:30.269> there<00:00:31.269> is<00:00:31.300> one<00:00:31.689> common<00:00:32.080> and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
tank looks like there is one common and

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.439 
tank looks like there is one common and
there<00:00:32.980> are<00:00:33.129> three<00:00:33.510> level<00:00:34.830> probes<00:00:35.830> are<00:00:36.449> also

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
there are three level probes are also

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.740 
there are three level probes are also
called<00:00:37.960> sensors<00:00:38.670> now<00:00:39.670> if<00:00:39.909> there<00:00:40.210> is<00:00:40.330> no<00:00:40.510> water

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
called sensors now if there is no water

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.710 
called sensors now if there is no water
in<00:00:41.080> your<00:00:41.470> tank<00:00:41.739> there<00:00:42.699> is<00:00:42.879> no<00:00:43.089> electrical

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
in your tank there is no electrical

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.140 
in your tank there is no electrical
communication<00:00:44.710> between<00:00:44.920> these<00:00:45.339> two<00:00:45.640> and<00:00:45.879> no

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
communication between these two and no

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.340 
communication between these two and no
LEDs<00:00:46.720> should<00:00:47.559> be<00:00:47.739> lightning<00:00:48.370> up<00:00:48.659> however<00:00:49.659> what

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
LEDs should be lightning up however what

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.229 
LEDs should be lightning up however what
if<00:00:50.559> the<00:00:50.769> level<00:00:51.100> increases<00:00:51.790> let's<00:00:52.000> say<00:00:52.180> two

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
if the level increases let's say two

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.590 
if the level increases let's say two
here<00:00:52.839> and<00:00:53.019> both<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:54.159> first<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.180> common

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
here and both the first and the common

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.930 
here and both the first and the common
are<00:00:55.809> covered<00:00:56.290> if<00:00:56.500> there<00:00:57.070> is<00:00:57.190> electrical

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
are covered if there is electrical

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.479 
are covered if there is electrical
communication<00:00:58.869> between<00:00:59.170> these<00:00:59.739> two<00:01:00.070> probes

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
communication between these two probes

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.630 
communication between these two probes
and<00:01:00.790> one<00:01:01.659> LED<00:01:02.140> should<00:01:02.440> light<00:01:02.650> up<00:01:02.680> until<00:01:03.339> you're

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
and one LED should light up until you're

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.719 
and one LED should light up until you're
one-third<00:01:04.180> full<00:01:04.479> as<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.590> level<00:01:05.920> increases

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
one-third full as the level increases

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.280 
one-third full as the level increases
and<00:01:07.000> another<00:01:08.700> probe<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:10.030> covered<00:01:10.570> now<00:01:11.080> we're

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
and another probe is covered now we're

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.500 
and another probe is covered now we're
getting<00:01:11.620> electrical<00:01:12.220> communication<00:01:13.180> this

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
getting electrical communication this

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.840 
getting electrical communication this
way<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:13.990> that<00:01:14.200> way<00:01:14.470> so<00:01:14.710> two<00:01:14.920> LEDs<00:01:15.520> light<00:01:15.820> up

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
way and that way so two LEDs light up

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.800 
way and that way so two LEDs light up
and<00:01:16.240> when<00:01:16.950> fall<00:01:17.950> three<00:01:18.370> LEDs<00:01:18.910> will<00:01:19.690> light<00:01:19.900> up

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and when fall three LEDs will light up

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.790 
and when fall three LEDs will light up
now<00:01:23.070> after<00:01:24.070> you<00:01:24.250> dump<00:01:25.050> very<00:01:26.050> often<00:01:26.530> you'll

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
now after you dump very often you'll

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.760 
now after you dump very often you'll
find<00:01:26.890> if<00:01:27.460> you<00:01:27.580> go<00:01:27.790> back<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.240> your<00:01:28.420> monitor<00:01:28.770> that

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
find if you go back to your monitor that

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.120 
find if you go back to your monitor that
it<00:01:30.730> will<00:01:31.030> tell<00:01:31.300> you<00:01:31.510> you're<00:01:31.870> still<00:01:32.170> full<00:01:32.770> or

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
it will tell you you're still full or

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.510 
it will tell you you're still full or
two-thirds<00:01:33.940> full<00:01:34.330> very<00:01:35.200> seldom<00:01:35.800> that<00:01:36.190> it

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
two-thirds full very seldom that it

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.670 
two-thirds full very seldom that it
actually<00:01:36.790> works<00:01:37.360> accurately<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:40.440> what<00:01:41.440> is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
actually works accurately and what is

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.720 
actually works accurately and what is
the<00:01:41.830> cause<00:01:42.100> of<00:01:42.130> it<00:01:42.460> it's<00:01:42.730> caused<00:01:43.150> by<00:01:43.710> sludge

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
the cause of it it's caused by sludge

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.760 
the cause of it it's caused by sludge
that<00:01:45.730> accumulates<00:01:46.510> on<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.140> wall<00:01:47.380> on<00:01:47.710> the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
that accumulates on the wall on the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.700 
that accumulates on the wall on the
inside<00:01:48.400> wall<00:01:48.700> of<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.330> tank<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.720> provides<00:01:53.350> a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
inside wall of the tank it provides a

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.860 
inside wall of the tank it provides a
false<00:01:54.630> electrical<00:01:55.630> path<00:01:57.150> horse<00:01:58.150> dynamics<00:01:58.690> has

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
false electrical path horse dynamics has

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.649 
false electrical path horse dynamics has
invented<00:01:59.260> probes<00:01:59.770> that<00:01:59.950> solve<00:02:00.550> this<00:02:00.970> problem

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
invented probes that solve this problem

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.810 
invented probes that solve this problem
I<00:02:03.270> will<00:02:04.270> demonstrate<00:02:04.540> this<00:02:05.440> by<00:02:06.040> duplicating

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
I will demonstrate this by duplicating

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.559 
I will demonstrate this by duplicating
the<00:02:07.270> sludge<00:02:07.630> on<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.379> walls

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.559 

here<00:02:12.379> you<00:02:12.499> see<00:02:12.709> a<00:02:12.739> regular<00:02:13.249> monitor<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:14.359> are

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
here you see a regular monitor we are

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.569 
here you see a regular monitor we are
hooked<00:02:14.780> up<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.290> black<00:02:15.530> tank<00:02:15.889> and<00:02:16.219> it<00:02:16.310> shows

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
hooked up to the black tank and it shows

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.800 
hooked up to the black tank and it shows
it<00:02:16.999> is<00:02:17.209> empty<00:02:17.530> now<00:02:18.530> here<00:02:19.310> we<00:02:19.519> have<00:02:19.549> probes<00:02:20.480> of

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
it is empty now here we have probes of

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.199 
it is empty now here we have probes of
the<00:02:21.079> regular<00:02:21.560> probes<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:22.219> is<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> common<00:02:22.969> and

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
the regular probes this is a common and

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.629 
the regular probes this is a common and
is<00:02:23.359> it<00:02:23.510> connected<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.109> the<00:02:24.230> plus<00:02:24.439> and<00:02:25.280> will

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:25.639 
is it connected to the plus and will

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.910 
is it connected to the plus and will
demonstrate<00:02:26.269> here<00:02:26.659> that<00:02:26.989> as<00:02:27.469> sludge

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
demonstrate here that as sludge

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.270 
demonstrate here that as sludge
accumulates<00:02:28.790> on<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.269> wall<00:02:29.480> yeah<00:02:30.409> we<00:02:31.010> get

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
accumulates on the wall yeah we get

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.259 
accumulates on the wall yeah we get
false<00:02:31.639> readings<00:02:32.480> from<00:02:33.409> on<00:02:33.769> our<00:02:34.310> monitor<00:02:34.819> I'm

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
false readings from on our monitor I'm

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.990 
false readings from on our monitor I'm
just<00:02:35.629> duplicating<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.620> type<00:02:37.099> of<00:02:37.129> sludge<00:02:37.639> that

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
just duplicating the type of sludge that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.789 
just duplicating the type of sludge that
you<00:02:38.269> might<00:02:38.540> receive<00:02:39.549> in<00:02:40.549> your<00:02:40.579> RV<00:02:41.439> you've<00:02:42.439> just

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
you might receive in your RV you've just

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.709 
you might receive in your RV you've just
done<00:02:43.069> and<00:02:43.400> this<00:02:43.579> is<00:02:43.790> what's<00:02:44.000> on<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.209> wall<00:02:44.480> and

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:44.719 
done and this is what's on the wall and

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.709 
done and this is what's on the wall and
now<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.900> check<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.650> shows<00:02:45.889> it's<00:02:46.250> full

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:46.719 
now you check and it shows it's full

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.920 
now you check and it shows it's full
well<00:02:47.719> you<00:02:48.079> know<00:02:48.290> darn<00:02:48.769> well<00:02:48.859> you're<00:02:49.669> empty<00:02:50.120> so

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
well you know darn well you're empty so

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.300 
well you know darn well you're empty so
what<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.769> wrong

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
what is wrong

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.659 
what is wrong
the<00:02:52.549> sludge<00:02:53.000> gives<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:54.019> false<00:02:54.469> electrical<00:02:55.400> path

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
the sludge gives a false electrical path

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.709 
the sludge gives a false electrical path
and<00:02:56.079> this<00:02:57.079> gives<00:02:57.409> you<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.980> false<00:02:58.489> reading<00:02:59.150> now

00:02:59.709 --> 00:02:59.719 
and this gives you the false reading now

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.599 
and this gives you the false reading now
we're<00:02:59.930> going<00:03:00.079> to<00:03:00.169> do<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.829> same<00:03:01.069> thing<00:03:01.370> with

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
we're going to do the same thing with

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.909 
we're going to do the same thing with
the<00:03:01.790> Horst<00:03:02.090> miracle<00:03:02.569> probes<00:03:02.840> you're<00:03:03.650> just

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
the Horst miracle probes you're just

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:07.569 
the Horst miracle probes you're just
covering<00:03:04.519> this<00:03:05.030> whole<00:03:05.090> area<00:03:06.010> just<00:03:07.010> as<00:03:07.219> we<00:03:07.400> did

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
covering this whole area just as we did

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.890 
covering this whole area just as we did
the<00:03:07.730> other<00:03:07.879> ones<00:03:09.099> with<00:03:10.099> sludge<00:03:10.819> and<00:03:11.209> we're

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
the other ones with sludge and we're

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.679 
the other ones with sludge and we're
going<00:03:12.199> all<00:03:12.469> the<00:03:12.500> way<00:03:12.709> over<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.639> Teflon<00:03:14.209> tubing

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
going all the way over the Teflon tubing

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.059 
going all the way over the Teflon tubing
let's<00:03:15.290> say<00:03:15.530> here<00:03:16.040> yeah<00:03:16.729> over<00:03:17.449> there<00:03:17.720> and

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
let's say here yeah over there and

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.360 
let's say here yeah over there and
around<00:03:19.069> here<00:03:19.609> you'll<00:03:20.650> Trevor<00:03:21.650> everything

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
around here you'll Trevor everything

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.899 
around here you'll Trevor everything
good<00:03:22.639> and<00:03:22.909> then<00:03:23.689> we'll<00:03:23.900> see<00:03:24.199> once<00:03:24.470> what<00:03:25.459> this

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
good and then we'll see once what this

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.539 
good and then we'll see once what this
were<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.870> unit<00:03:27.199> will<00:03:27.349> do<00:03:27.470> by<00:03:27.859> the<00:03:27.919> way<00:03:28.129> we<00:03:28.340> have

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
were the unit will do by the way we have

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.240 
were the unit will do by the way we have
to<00:03:28.699> change<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.239> wiring<00:03:29.479> to<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.709> other<00:03:30.889> side

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
to change the wiring to the other side

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.469 
to change the wiring to the other side
in<00:03:31.699> order<00:03:31.939> to<00:03:32.500> get<00:03:33.699> identical<00:03:34.699> conditions

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:35.479 
in order to get identical conditions

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.960 
in order to get identical conditions
you're<00:03:36.169> looking<00:03:36.530> again<00:03:36.889> and<00:03:37.159> here<00:03:37.729> we're

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
pushing on the black and we are on empty

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.280 
pushing on the black and we are on empty
