third time and so the South Face in the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.640 
third time and so the South Face in the
sanctuary<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.750> quite<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> bit<00:00:19.170> different<00:00:19.590> than

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
sanctuary is quite a bit different than

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.890 
sanctuary is quite a bit different than
the<00:00:19.920> North<00:00:20.130> Face<00:00:20.369> just<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.390> way<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.630> looks

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
the North Face just in the way it looks

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.740 
the North Face just in the way it looks
the<00:00:22.080> South<00:00:22.289> paces<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.949> lot<00:00:23.789> steeper<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.300> lot<00:00:24.570> more

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the South paces a lot steeper a lot more

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.640 
the South paces a lot steeper a lot more
sustained<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:26.400> doesn't<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.849> near<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
sustained and it doesn't have near the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.100 
sustained and it doesn't have near the
serac<00:00:28.910> broken<00:00:29.910> ice<00:00:30.240> ball<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:32.360> they<00:00:33.360> hang<00:00:33.719> saw

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
serac broken ice ball and they hang saw

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.560 
serac broken ice ball and they hang saw
rocks<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:35.579> much<00:00:35.880> as<00:00:36.030> here<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.390> north

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
rocks as as much as here on the north

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.840 
rocks as as much as here on the north
base<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.020> when<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.739> start<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.070> piece<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
base so when you start to piece the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.639 
base so when you start to piece the
north<00:00:39.200> together<00:00:40.200> really<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.460> not<00:00:41.700> all<00:00:41.940> that

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
north together really it's not all that

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.500 
north together really it's not all that
dangerous<00:00:43.649> as<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.040> thought<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> would<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.700> you

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
dangerous as I thought it would be you

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.290 
dangerous as I thought it would be you
can<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:46.050> weave<00:00:46.500> away<00:00:46.920> through<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.910> lot<00:00:48.270> of

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
can really weave away through a lot of

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.430 
can really weave away through a lot of
the<00:00:49.070> Avalanche<00:00:50.070> zones<00:00:50.989> unless<00:00:51.989> something

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the Avalanche zones unless something

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
the Avalanche zones unless something
catastrophic<00:00:52.620> happens<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> sheer

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
catastrophic happens but the sheer

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.380 
catastrophic happens but the sheer
beauty<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.829> views<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.760> vistas<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
beauty the the views that the vistas the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.240 
beauty the the views that the vistas the
fact<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.719> you're<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.109> huge<00:00:58.379> circle<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
fact that you're in this huge circle of

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.900 
fact that you're in this huge circle of
mountains<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.899> almost<00:01:01.590> surround<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.250> it's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
mountains that almost surround you it's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.479 
mountains that almost surround you it's
it's<00:01:03.510> really<00:01:03.690> glorious<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:04.979> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it's really glorious to be here but it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
it's really glorious to be here but it
is<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.330> little<00:01:06.659> safer<00:01:07.110> believe<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.470> or

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
is it is a little safer believe it or

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.040 
is it is a little safer believe it or
not<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.950> then<00:01:08.310> was<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.390> mind

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
not and then was in my mind

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.330 
not and then was in my mind

was hoping to retire in ten years or
something<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.890> now<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.549> bar<00:02:19.790> has<00:02:19.970> been

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
something and now the bar has been

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.690 
something and now the bar has been
raised<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.590> know<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.709> think<00:02:21.860> maybe<00:02:22.250> it

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
raised and so you know I think maybe it

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.340 
raised and so you know I think maybe it
might<00:02:22.730> be<00:02:23.000> impressive<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.720> other<00:02:23.870> people<00:02:24.200> but

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
might be impressive to other people but

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.810 
might be impressive to other people but
it's<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.530> little<00:02:24.739> intimidating<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.519> us<00:02:25.610> as

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
it's a little intimidating to us as

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.180 
it's a little intimidating to us as
professional<00:02:26.510> athletes<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.590> might<00:02:27.769> have<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.010> be

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
professional athletes I might have to be

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.430 
professional athletes I might have to be
at<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:28.580> for<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.850> while<00:02:29.030> now<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:30.350> not

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
at this for a while now so it's not

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.680 
at this for a while now so it's not
exactly<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.920> comfortable<00:02:31.370> feeling<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:32.540> in

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
exactly a comfortable feeling just in

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.539 
exactly a comfortable feeling just in
the<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.350> brief<00:02:33.470> conversations<00:02:34.220> we<00:02:34.340> have

and his respect for the mountains is is
something<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.340> think<00:02:40.640> we<00:02:40.940> appreciate

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
something that I I think we appreciate

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.120 
something that I I think we appreciate
in<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.780> conversations<00:02:42.440> that<00:02:42.470> we've<00:02:42.680> had<00:02:42.860> and

it seems that we have a similar approach

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.130 
it seems that we have a similar approach
a<00:02:45.260> very<00:02:45.950> conservative<00:02:46.340> very<00:02:46.880> patient<00:02:47.600> you

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
it and that kind of a relaxed

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.520 
it and that kind of a relaxed
perspective<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.340> laid-back<00:03:03.880> tranquil

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530

perspective and viewpoint towards the
mountains<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:07.970> think<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.270> really<00:03:08.420> important<00:03:08.959> if

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
mountains I think is really important if

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.810 
mountains I think is really important if
you<00:03:09.530> want<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.800> get<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.130> summit<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.580> come

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
you want to get to the summit and come

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.729 
you want to get to the summit and come
back<00:03:10.940> home<00:03:11.180> but<00:03:11.390> also<00:03:11.570> do<00:03:11.840> enjoy<00:03:12.140> yourself<00:03:12.560> not

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
back home but also do enjoy yourself not

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.890 
back home but also do enjoy yourself not
be<00:03:12.890> so<00:03:13.040> influenced<00:03:13.580> by<00:03:13.610> everybody<00:03:14.540> else<00:03:14.720> is

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
be so influenced by everybody else is

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.900 
be so influenced by everybody else is
around<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.380> make<00:03:15.920> your<00:03:16.100> own<00:03:16.220> decisions<00:03:16.670> based

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
around you make your own decisions based

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.330 
around you make your own decisions based
on<00:03:17.090> your<00:03:17.270> own<00:03:17.530> experiences<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.770> he<00:03:19.130> seems

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
on your own experiences and he seems

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.670 
on your own experiences and he seems
right<00:03:19.610> very<00:03:19.880> confident<00:03:20.450> in<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:20.989> I<00:03:21.230> think

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
right very confident in that so I think

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.040 
right very confident in that so I think
probably<00:03:22.100> we'll<00:03:22.580> we'll<00:03:23.060> go<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.630> summit<00:03:23.870> on

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
probably we'll we'll go to the summit on

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.510 
probably we'll we'll go to the summit on
the<00:03:24.170> same<00:03:24.380> gain<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:25.070> I<00:03:25.130> really<00:03:25.370> look<00:03:25.489> forward

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
the same gain and I really look forward

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.970 
the same gain and I really look forward
to<00:03:25.850> that
