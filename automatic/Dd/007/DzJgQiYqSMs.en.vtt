 we are working so much the prophet with 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.859
 this front hitting these two sides 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.230

 then then comes the top part 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.209
 let's move here that is this to which 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.750

 a little 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.239
 I have to be tight because always 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.150

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.360
 that not a little bit here 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.960
 these would be the little pieces 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.090

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.419
 this is where the clamp is right in the 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.960
 half then the little ears here towards 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:33.080
