great for you too however I think that
eating<00:01:09.060> soy<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.510> excess<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.260> probably<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.130> so

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
eating soy in excess is probably not so

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.730 
eating soy in excess is probably not so
good<00:01:11.400> for<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.170> unfortunately<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> studies

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
good for you unfortunately the studies

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.550 
good for you unfortunately the studies
on<00:01:13.950> soy<00:01:14.159> are<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.670> skewed<00:01:15.180> some<00:01:16.140> studies

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
on soy are really skewed some studies

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.440 
on soy are really skewed some studies
that<00:01:16.590> say<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.100> soy<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.520> bad<00:01:17.729> are<00:01:18.000> actually

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that say that soy are bad are actually

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.510 
that say that soy are bad are actually
backed<00:01:18.750> by<00:01:19.020> meat<00:01:19.320> companies<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:20.159> kind<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
backed by meat companies it's kind of a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060 
backed by meat companies it's kind of a
way<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.700> deter<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.450> from<00:01:21.479> eating<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.380> it's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
way to deter you from eating it so it's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
way to deter you from eating it so it's
really<00:01:23.340> hard<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.729> trust<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.330> sources<00:01:24.930> unless

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
really hard to trust the sources unless

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.050 
really hard to trust the sources unless
you<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:25.500> exactly<00:01:25.920> where<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.400> coming<00:01:26.670> from

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
you know exactly where it's coming from

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
you know exactly where it's coming from
personally<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.080> don't<00:01:28.259> eat<00:01:28.619> soy<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
personally I don't eat soy because it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.440 
personally I don't eat soy because it
upsets<00:01:29.759> my<00:01:30.000> stomach

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
upsets my stomach

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.840 
upsets my stomach
I<00:01:30.570> feel<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:31.049> gross<00:01:31.409> when<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.770> eat<00:01:31.920> soy<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
I feel really gross when I eat soy so I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.490 
I feel really gross when I eat soy so I
went<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.360> experiment<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.110> see<00:01:34.259> if<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
went on this experiment to see if I

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.530 
went on this experiment to see if I
could<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> healthy<00:01:35.520> vegan<00:01:35.700> without<00:01:35.939> soy<00:01:36.390> in

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
could be a healthy vegan without soy in

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.990 
could be a healthy vegan without soy in
