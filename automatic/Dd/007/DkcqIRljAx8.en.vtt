battlefield the sniping it's not a one
shot<00:01:18.810> kill<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.590> not<00:01:19.740> frustrating<00:01:20.240> when

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
shot kill so it's not frustrating when

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.899 
shot kill so it's not frustrating when
you<00:01:21.390> die<00:01:21.659> from<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.950> still<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.490> little<00:01:23.790> bit

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
you die from it it still is a little bit

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.300 
you die from it it still is a little bit
cuz<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.210> picked<00:01:24.450> off<00:01:24.630> across<00:01:24.900> math<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.890> is

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
cuz you picked off across math but it is

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.730 
cuz you picked off across math but it is
very<00:01:26.340> satisfying<00:01:27.180> when<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> head<00:01:28.710> shot

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
very satisfying when you get a head shot

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.609 
very satisfying when you get a head shot
because<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.820> reminds<00:01:30.509> me<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> dragon<00:01:31.500> off

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
because it reminds me of the dragon off

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.499 
because it reminds me of the dragon off
where<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.490> kind<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.790> aim<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.360> little

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
where you have to kind of aim a little

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.240 
where you have to kind of aim a little
bit<00:01:33.750> higher<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> head<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.890> did<00:01:35.070> right

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
bit higher on the head like I did right

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.179

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
there usually that would have been a one

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.600 
there usually that would have been a one
shot<00:01:42.000> kill<00:01:42.560> back<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> day<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.310> other

shot kill back in the day on other
first-person<00:01:45.420> shooters<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:47.070> like

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
first-person shooters but I really like

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.319 
first-person shooters but I really like
that<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.790> go<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.119> head<00:01:48.299> shot

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that you have to go for a head shot

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.240 
that you have to go for a head shot
because<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.229> not<00:01:49.290> frustrating<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
because it's not frustrating for the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.609 
because it's not frustrating for the
people<00:01:50.549> dying<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.840> another<00:01:52.320> games

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
people dying like it is another games

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.670 
people dying like it is another games
but<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.399> very<00:01:53.490> satisfying<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.960> battlefield

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
but it is very satisfying in battlefield

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.819 
but it is very satisfying in battlefield
and<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.930> like<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.829> game<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.610> lot<00:02:00.030> of

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
and I like this game it's a lot of

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.770 
and I like this game it's a lot of
action<00:02:01.829> fast<00:02:02.340> pace<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.270> cops<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
action fast pace I like the cops and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.740 
action fast pace I like the cops and
robbers<00:02:04.229> aspect<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.060> also<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
robbers aspect to it I also like the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.180 
robbers aspect to it I also like the
sniping<00:02:07.320> Aladdin<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.860> we're<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.129> to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
sniping Aladdin it we're going to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.889 
sniping Aladdin it we're going to
display<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> right<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.599> shot

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
display it right here in this shot

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.110 
display it right here in this shot
there's<00:02:10.410> not<00:02:10.679> too<00:02:11.129> much<00:02:11.580> bullet<00:02:12.420> drop

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
there's not too much bullet drop

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.690 
there's not too much bullet drop
in<00:02:13.420> previous<00:02:13.840> Battlefield<00:02:14.590> games<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.099> seems

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
in previous Battlefield games it seems

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.020 
in previous Battlefield games it seems
like<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:16.209> sniper<00:02:16.450> rifle<00:02:16.840> goal<00:02:17.019> is<00:02:17.200> relatively

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
like the sniper rifle goal is relatively

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.520 
like the sniper rifle goal is relatively
straight<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.180> politicals<00:02:19.629> relatively

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
straight the politicals relatively

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.800 
straight the politicals relatively
straight<00:02:20.860> now<00:02:21.340> if<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:21.640> go<00:02:21.730> at<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.030> bigger

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
straight now if you go at a bigger

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.170 
straight now if you go at a bigger
distance<00:02:23.440> yeah<00:02:24.069> there<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.519> some<00:02:24.670> bullet<00:02:24.970> drop

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
distance yeah there is some bullet drop

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.539 
distance yeah there is some bullet drop
which<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.659> like<00:02:25.870> but<00:02:26.440> there's<00:02:26.739> not<00:02:27.099> too<00:02:27.370> much

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
which I like but there's not too much

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.220 
which I like but there's not too much
bullet<00:02:27.940> drop<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:28.540> makes<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.110> little

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
bullet drop and that makes it a little

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.979 
bullet drop and that makes it a little
bit<00:02:29.409> more<00:02:29.590> predictable<00:02:30.280> for<00:02:30.909> me<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.390> makes

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
bit more predictable for me and makes

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.080 
bit more predictable for me and makes
the<00:02:32.200> sniping<00:02:32.650> even<00:02:33.250> more<00:02:33.489> fun<00:02:33.790> which

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
the sniping even more fun which

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.390 
the sniping even more fun which
everybody<00:02:34.569> loves<00:02:35.049> to<00:02:35.230> be<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.349> sniper<00:02:35.620> right<00:02:35.980> and
