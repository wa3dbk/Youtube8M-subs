00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.250
 my action to 17 plastic surgeon 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.010
 I don't think so 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.200
 tell a video consultation 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.109
 about 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.879
 taxi to go 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.849
 there are different types of techniques 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.719
 indicative of aging 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.749
 in the face 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:20.029
 if we are not embarrassed or accident four consultations 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.119
 see which then you can do 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:23.950
 the story 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.529
 that is actually going to convey essence 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.409
 van der sar of research upwards 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.850
 return of food the aex has disappeared 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.670
 those two aspects in particular make the face draw more sometimes draw more 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.790
 religions 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.930
 and if you then make a profit from below but also time 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.120
 and if that volume option is enough 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.460
 the volume of yourself 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.920
 do you have to pay appearance 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.200
 and 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.360
 i drew site year 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.560
 ranging from 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.640
 also extra there with soul jazz 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.300
 further away 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.810
 it is also clearly seen that our countryman does 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.140
 and tianjin dice greek or my love 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.870
 and those blogs that make it invisible 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.980
 paris afn also at least 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.540
 should pay attention to 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.200
 if you consider such an operation 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.220
 but I demand a second in the park and aspects 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.390
 it must get to know and 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.530
 to follow on it 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.500
 it's not smart 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.970
 which should take the first place 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.150
 in addition, the operating area 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.110
 only then are you able 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.500
 to find a point 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.990
 but dropped down to j 9 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.190
 hanging up the area to watch over 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.079
 you literally 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.319
 hard, as it were, pixels in the center of the coat rack 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.970
 a doctor does not always place it at the top of the operating area but 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.470
 we hope that the side one so literally with threads you pull on this 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.420
 circulation 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.510
 And I do not want that 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.830
 the headlines that of job 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.830
 so where 80 only one way from top to bottom 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.790
 That means good tractors to drive like traction 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.140
 something for placing from bottom to top 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.140
 and the anchor at the top of the operating area selligent 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.109
 that should only be expected 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.729
 greater challenge 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.029
 ap according to radar 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.029
 according to the ammunition officer with those actions on both sides 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.929
 thereby introducing the dragon more horizontally 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:24.169
 a little bit chilly when diesel was hung on cbs 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.309
 they don't 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.109
 what exactly was successful 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.239
 which I will use from the question 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.979
 you have to do that 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:35.529
 a target area that has fallen or whether it is the Amsterdammers to take over the king 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:36.359
 take anp 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:37.579
 a target area 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:38.979
 approach everywhere 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:40.779
 hook up with wires 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.149
 the 360 ​​degrees to develop 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:47.529
 and then with strict rules when my horse lifts that target area 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.430
 can tie two places 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.819
 in an area that does not move 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.600
 for correcting the eyebrow 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.819
 is that the attachment of the cabinet 4 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.979
 and if you have the fingers on the side so nice to sleep in and on the jaws 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.789
 you noticed that those muscles face it the bid 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.339
 has the knee 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:09.859
 on the lane direction on the bone 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.189
 I can't handle you 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.069
 for drawing for slumped couch or hamster cheeks here 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.899
 I'm above you 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.670
 when from above or down for the two and second 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.860
 Tarts brought in but a toe area 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.029
 We have to come to Amsterdam 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.359
 and also get that 2022 and endorsed 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.790
 on the same side you may be at a lower level but that is stuck here above it 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:35.499
 track 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.749
 eight years 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:39.499
 tarts in combination 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:41.329
 use the technician 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.579
 I give him a small cup 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.849
 but appearances 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:45.839
 improvement 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.789
 in comparison with, for example, an extensive party lift 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.759
 you have to know ec there 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.369
 powerful techniques 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.929
 specifically area-oriented on the eemplein 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:58.919
 that are primarily intended for people 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.679
 continues immediately 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:02.459
 on the outside 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.059
 but those two elements stand today 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:06.139
 and if it's about it 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.539
 area the bank 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:09.979
 going to Amsterdam 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.699
 then it really only makes sense to use this technique 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.209
 as the drawing in far beyond 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.879
 the jaw line well then the bottom 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.409
 I would also like to sit in the corner here 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.120
 then you choose an exit 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.210
 and watch and that video 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.900
 some more information 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.129
 or our team 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:31.610
 signs of weakness also need in the vertical part of the neck 61 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.539
 and the technique against it becomes the vertical 9 for use 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.240
 for morgan chase 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.240
 that gives there were more the result 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.520
 but that 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.999
 he has a taxi too low 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:47.340
 and preferably from the site with servers 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.940
 una improve 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.680
 yes, it turned out Tuesday 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.569
 from the no longer experimental 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:55.569
 renewal 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:56.580
 to operate 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.349
 but something that has been the last couple of years she says 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.389
 nestled as a reliable technique 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.389
 between the other somewhat large black spot 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.710
 are there any questions or ambiguities 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.279
 the road was hit 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.869
 the concert
