them they felt not as gentle as they

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.570 
them they felt not as gentle as they
claimed<00:03:58.210> to<00:03:58.390> be<00:03:58.650> but<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.710> persevered<00:04:00.160> because

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
claimed to be but I persevered because

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.870 
nothing out of ten because if they do
this<00:06:03.440> to<00:06:03.650> my<00:06:03.740> face<00:06:03.980> you<00:06:04.280> imagine<00:06:04.640> what<00:06:04.730> they're
