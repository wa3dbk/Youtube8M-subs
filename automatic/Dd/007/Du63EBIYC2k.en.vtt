you know in sectors wind ups and down a

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.839 
you know in sectors wind ups and down a
rabbit<00:06:15.349> and<00:06:16.629> did<00:06:17.629> I<00:06:17.659> really<00:06:17.930> just<00:06:18.050> say<00:06:18.259> that<00:06:18.849> in

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
rabbit and did I really just say that in

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.579 
rabbit and did I really just say that in
sectors<00:06:20.360> are<00:06:20.509> not<00:06:20.659> causing<00:06:20.930> as<00:06:21.139> many<00:06:21.349> problems

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:21.589

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:25.269 
sectors are not causing as many problems
as<00:06:21.830> people<00:06:22.099> think<00:06:22.310> but<00:06:23.210> I<00:06:23.620> think<00:06:24.620> they<00:06:24.740> will<00:06:24.919> so

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:25.279

as people think but I think they will so
I<00:06:26.229> really<00:06:27.229> wish<00:06:27.349> that<00:06:27.469> wasn't<00:06:27.650> the<00:06:27.830> big<00:06:27.949> three

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
I really wish that wasn't the big three

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.619 
I really wish that wasn't the big three

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.480 
I think there's still quite a few more
decks<00:06:29.870> out<00:06:30.080> there<00:06:30.289> that<00:06:30.440> can<00:06:30.680> take<00:06:31.159> on<00:06:31.339> those
