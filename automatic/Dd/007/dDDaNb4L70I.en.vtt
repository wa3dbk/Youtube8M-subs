we're<00:00:17.850> going<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.000> talk<00:00:18.180> about<00:00:18.330> snap<00:00:18.750> weights

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
we're going to talk about snap weights

we're going to talk about snap weights
we've<00:00:19.680> talked<00:00:19.980> about<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.189> couple<00:00:20.340> different

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
we've talked about a couple different

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.490 
we've talked about a couple different
diving<00:00:21.390> apparatus<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.230> maybe<00:00:22.380> you're

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
diving apparatus and maybe you're

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.200 
diving apparatus and maybe you're
getting<00:00:22.590> tired<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.100> those<00:00:23.189> but<00:00:23.490> spring

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210

walleye<00:00:24.420> fishing<00:00:24.750> really<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.260> about

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
walleye fishing really is about

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.740 
walleye fishing really is about
structure<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.369> those<00:00:26.880> walleye<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.449> gonna<00:00:27.570> be

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
structure and those walleye are gonna be

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.720 
structure and those walleye are gonna be
very<00:00:28.019> related<00:00:28.800> or<00:00:28.920> very<00:00:29.099> tight<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
very related or very tight to the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.179 
very related or very tight to the
structure<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.660> getting<00:00:30.990> tight<00:00:31.410> down<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.040> or

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
structure so getting tight down to it or

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.310 
structure so getting tight down to it or
close<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.850> very<00:00:33.059> important<00:00:33.600> jigging

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
close to it is very important jigging

the<00:00:36.750> torpedo<00:00:37.110> divers<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.620> talked<00:00:37.860> about<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the torpedo divers we talked about and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.130 
the torpedo divers we talked about and
these<00:00:38.850> snap<00:00:39.149> weights<00:00:39.390> are<00:00:39.600> again<00:00:39.840> another

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
these snap weights are again another

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.340 
these snap weights are again another
method<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.530> adding<00:00:41.100> some<00:00:41.129> depth<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.350> lure

method for adding some depth to a lure
in<00:00:43.739> our<00:00:44.160> other<00:00:44.309> tips<00:00:44.610> we've<00:00:44.789> talked<00:00:45.030> about

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
in our other tips we've talked about

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.970 
in our other tips we've talked about
torpedo<00:00:45.809> divers<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.500> they're<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> very

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
torpedo divers and they're a very

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.520 
torpedo divers and they're a very
aggressive<00:00:47.579> diving<00:00:48.090> curve<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:49.079> very<00:00:49.350> little

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
aggressive diving curve with very little

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.650 
aggressive diving curve with very little
line<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:49.920> they<00:00:50.039> die<00:00:50.219> very<00:00:50.280> quickly<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:51.539> what

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
line out they die very quickly but what

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.420 
line out they die very quickly but what
that<00:00:51.780> does<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.289> has<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> little<00:00:52.860> more<00:00:53.039> drag

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
that does is it has a little more drag

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.819 
that does is it has a little more drag
on<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.059> planer<00:00:54.329> board<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.590> want<00:00:55.739> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
on on a planer board and if you want to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
on on a planer board and if you want to
take<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> shallow<00:00:56.309> diving<00:00:56.610> crankbait<00:00:57.210> for

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
take a shallow diving crankbait for

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.209 
take a shallow diving crankbait for
instance<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:57.989> Rapala<00:00:58.680> scatter<00:00:58.949> wrapper

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
instance this Rapala scatter wrapper

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.740 
instance this Rapala scatter wrapper
here<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.760> take<00:01:00.420> it

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
here and take it

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.420 
here and take it
it<00:01:00.809> only<00:01:00.989> dives<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.440> eight<00:01:01.590> feet<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.070> its<00:01:02.250> own

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
it only dives to eight feet on its own

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.850 
it only dives to eight feet on its own
so<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.120> could<00:01:03.359> use<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> smaller<00:01:04.110> snap<00:01:04.589> weight

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
so you could use a smaller snap weight

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
so you could use a smaller snap weight
which<00:01:05.369> has<00:01:05.549> very<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:05.970> drag<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> water

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
which has very little drag in the water

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.380 
which has very little drag in the water
a<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:08.040> one<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> half<00:01:08.640> two<00:01:08.909> ounce<00:01:09.090> weight

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
a one one and a half two ounce weight

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.780 
a one one and a half two ounce weight
and<00:01:09.659> take<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.290> bait<00:01:10.950> would<00:01:11.159> normally<00:01:11.549> max

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and take this bait would normally max

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.640 
and take this bait would normally max
out<00:01:11.970> at<00:01:12.030> eight<00:01:12.299> foot<00:01:12.540> depth<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.049> take<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.530> a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
out at eight foot depth and take it a

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.800 
out at eight foot depth and take it a
little<00:01:13.860> bit<00:01:13.979> deeper<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.060> great<00:01:15.360> option

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
little bit deeper it's a great option

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.690 
little bit deeper it's a great option
for<00:01:16.110> taking<00:01:16.799> both<00:01:16.950> shallow<00:01:17.310> diving

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
for taking both shallow diving

between some of the other diving
apparatuses<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.790> talked<00:01:30.030> about<00:01:30.119> like

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
apparatuses that we talked about like

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.179

the torpedo divers and bottom bouncers

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.640 
the torpedo divers and bottom bouncers
is<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.850> those<00:01:33.030> primarily<00:01:33.720> care<00:01:34.079> keep<00:01:34.470> your

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
is that those primarily care keep your

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.950 
is that those primarily care keep your
bait<00:01:34.979> close<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> boat<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> snap

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
bait close to the boat with a snap

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140 
bait close to the boat with a snap
weight<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.829> add<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.640> get<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
weight we can add this and get it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.539 
weight we can add this and get it
farther<00:01:40.020> away<00:01:40.290> from<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.710> boat<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.460> had

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
farther away from the boat so we had

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.670 
farther away from the boat so we had
mentioned<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> torpedo<00:01:42.899> diver<00:01:43.200> that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
mentioned in in the torpedo diver that

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.370 
mentioned in in the torpedo diver that
it<00:01:43.920> was<00:01:44.070> 20<00:01:44.399> 20<00:01:44.970> some<00:01:45.149> feet<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.420> think<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:45.960> 15

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
it was 20 20 some feet I think to get 15

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.170 
it was 20 20 some feet I think to get 15
feet<00:01:46.619> down<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.340> you're<00:01:47.490> only<00:01:47.610> 20<00:01:47.880> feet<00:01:48.000> from

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
feet down so you're only 20 feet from

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.060 
feet down so you're only 20 feet from
the<00:01:48.299> boat<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.630> you're<00:01:48.840> 15<00:01:49.200> feet<00:01:49.380> down<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.829> some

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the boat and you're 15 feet down in some

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.440 
the boat and you're 15 feet down in some
applications<00:01:50.700> that's<00:01:50.909> great

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
applications that's great

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.840 
applications that's great
in<00:01:51.750> others<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.470> want<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.799> 15<00:01:53.220> 20<00:01:53.369> feet<00:01:53.670> down

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
in others you want to be 15 20 feet down

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.480 
in others you want to be 15 20 feet down
but<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.570> want<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.990> much<00:01:55.259> farther<00:01:55.770> from<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
but you want to be much farther from the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.730 
but you want to be much farther from the
boat<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.180> that's<00:01:57.360> where<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.750> snap<00:01:58.079> weight<00:01:58.500> is

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
boat so that's where a snap weight is

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.810 
boat so that's where a snap weight is
gonna<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:59.100> fantastic

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
gonna be fantastic

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.520 
gonna be fantastic
again<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.420> adjust<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.869> lead<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.469> is

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
again you can adjust the lead this is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.289 
again you can adjust the lead this is
actually<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> same<00:02:02.250> clip<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:02.909> use<00:02:03.090> with

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
actually the same clip that we use with

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.219 
actually the same clip that we use with
the<00:02:03.390> torpedo<00:02:03.780> diver

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
the torpedo diver

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.260 
the torpedo diver
so<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:04.740> very<00:02:04.860> similar<00:02:05.340> application<00:02:06.119> in

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
so it's very similar application in

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.059 
so it's very similar application in
terms<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.719> way<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.899> use<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:07.920> have

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
terms of the way you use it you can have

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.979 
terms of the way you use it you can have
whatever<00:02:08.520> lead<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.660> put<00:02:09.869> out

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
whatever lead you like you can put out

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.590 
whatever lead you like you can put out
25<00:02:10.800> feet<00:02:11.039> 50

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
25 feet 50

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.300 
25 feet 50
you<00:02:11.720> can<00:02:11.840> add<00:02:11.990> whatever<00:02:12.230> lead<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.680> want<00:02:12.890> he

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
you can add whatever lead you want he

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.670 
you can add whatever lead you want he
simply<00:02:13.670> snapped<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.210> on<00:02:14.420> your<00:02:14.600> line<00:02:14.750> snap

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
simply snapped this on your line snap

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.830 
simply snapped this on your line snap
that<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.130> line<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.490> then<00:02:16.580> put<00:02:16.850> out<00:02:16.970> some

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
that on the line and then put out some

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.750 
that on the line and then put out some
additional<00:02:18.140> line<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:19.250> that's<00:02:19.460> just<00:02:19.640> gonna

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
additional line and that's just gonna

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.850 
additional line and that's just gonna
increase<00:02:20.090> your<00:02:20.390> dive<00:02:20.720> curve<00:02:21.110> because<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.740> the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
increase your dive curve because of the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.220 
increase your dive curve because of the
weight<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.610> most<00:02:22.790> common<00:02:23.180> method<00:02:23.570> for<00:02:23.750> using

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
weight the most common method for using

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.410 
weight the most common method for using
snap<00:02:24.470> weights<00:02:24.740> is<00:02:25.160> what<00:02:25.400> we<00:02:25.490> call<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.790> 50/50

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
snap weights is what we call the 50/50

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.420 
snap weights is what we call the 50/50
system<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:27.290> with<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.920> take<00:02:28.100> your<00:02:28.250> lure

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
system so with that you take your lure

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.580 
system so with that you take your lure
you<00:02:28.730> put<00:02:28.940> out<00:02:29.060> 50<00:02:29.390> feet<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.720> line<00:02:29.870> then<00:02:30.500> you

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
you put out 50 feet of line then you

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.040 
you put out 50 feet of line then you
take<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.830> snap<00:02:31.130> weight<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:32.240> attach<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.570> to

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
take a snap weight you attach that to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.380 
take a snap weight you attach that to
the<00:02:33.140> line<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.650> then<00:02:33.800> put<00:02:33.950> another<00:02:33.980> 50<00:02:34.550> feet<00:02:34.910> to

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
the line and then put another 50 feet to

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.750 
the line and then put another 50 feet to
have<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:35.660> 50/50<00:02:36.350> system<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:37.460> achieve

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
have that 50/50 system to achieve

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.180 
have that 50/50 system to achieve
different<00:02:38.480> depths<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.470> can<00:02:39.620> use<00:02:39.770> a<00:02:39.800> small

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
different depths you can use a small

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.760 
different depths you can use a small
weight<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.730> little<00:02:41.510> heavier<00:02:41.810> weight<00:02:42.020> or<00:02:42.710> a

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
weight a little heavier weight or a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.620 
weight a little heavier weight or a
heavier<00:02:43.220> weight<00:02:43.370> yet<00:02:43.610> again<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.450> get<00:02:44.570> that

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
heavier weight yet again to get that

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.710 
heavier weight yet again to get that
same<00:02:45.140> bait<00:02:45.410> at<00:02:45.620> various<00:02:46.250> depths<00:02:46.460> now<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.150> don't

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
same bait at various depths now I don't

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.590 
same bait at various depths now I don't
often<00:02:48.110> make<00:02:48.500> mistakes<00:02:48.710> don't<00:02:49.580> don't<00:02:49.880> double

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
often make mistakes don't don't double

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
you want to make sure you don't do and I

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.130 
you want to make sure you don't do and I
obviously<00:02:55.160> have<00:02:55.520> done<00:02:55.880> this<00:02:56.030> many<00:02:56.270> times<00:02:56.660> is

obviously have done this many times is

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.480 
obviously have done this many times is
don't<00:02:57.470> get<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.770> rush<00:02:57.920> when<00:02:58.070> you<00:02:58.190> put<00:02:58.340> these

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
don't get in a rush when you put these

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.550 
don't get in a rush when you put these
on<00:02:58.550> make<00:02:59.000> sure<00:02:59.210> you<00:02:59.420> get<00:02:59.630> behind<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.320> pin

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
on make sure you get behind the pin

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.010 
on make sure you get behind the pin
these<00:03:00.770> little<00:03:01.010> red<00:03:01.220> snaps<00:03:01.610> have<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.360> pin<00:03:02.750> in<00:03:02.930> the

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
these little red snaps have a pin in the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.170 
these little red snaps have a pin in the
middle<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.530> it's<00:03:04.100> very<00:03:04.430> important<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.030> you

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
middle and it's very important that you

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.570 
middle and it's very important that you
get<00:03:05.360> below<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:05.840> pin<00:03:06.500> when<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.190> put<00:03:07.370> these<00:03:07.520> on

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
get below that pin when you put these on

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.430 
get below that pin when you put these on
so<00:03:08.060> when<00:03:08.210> you<00:03:08.330> put<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:08.660> snap<00:03:08.900> on<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:09.260> want<00:03:09.380> to

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
so when you put this snap on you want to

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.410 
so when you put this snap on you want to
be<00:03:09.530> below<00:03:09.710> that<00:03:09.980> pin<00:03:10.190> when<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.490> do<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.880> this

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
be below that pin when you do that this

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.230 
be below that pin when you do that this
will<00:03:11.480> not<00:03:11.990> come<00:03:12.290> off<00:03:12.350> if<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.430> miss<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:13.910> pin

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
will not come off if you miss that pin

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.360 
will not come off if you miss that pin
it's<00:03:14.900> gonna<00:03:15.050> look<00:03:15.290> like<00:03:15.470> it's<00:03:15.710> on<00:03:15.890> something
