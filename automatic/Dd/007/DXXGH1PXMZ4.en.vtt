00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.180

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.570
 I advise you to install the plugin 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.879

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.550

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.469
 broadcast that is, the plugin can be downloaded 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.300
 right on my twitch channel he 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.059
 called bender chat stream 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.890
 reference to it will be in the description and yes 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.750
 actually annotations too 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.700

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.400
 it's ok and here 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.530
 and if you want to be always up to date well 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.960
 and we must always be aware of and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.000
 broadcast or for example watch them not 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.979
 distracted by something without going over 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.080
 for example, specifically for this on twitch 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.299
 then you can download a special plugin 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.880
 the link to which I have first 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.750
 in general here from blocks to such 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.299
 registrations a little steamed so yes 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.860
 here is the link to the plugin click here and 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.400
 here we download the plugin for 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.440
 google chrome and later add for 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.960
 firefox and internet explorer will not 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.240
 you can not ask here you can 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.370
 put and type then you will appear 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.030
 just here here is such a small 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.700
 kitty 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.330
 in which you can first look 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.220
 streams 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.250
 secondly, when we start to stand by you 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.570
 there will be such a small 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.520
 notification that there is nothing we will direct in 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.590
 general little thing that will help 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.720
 before you actually help put friends 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.970
 it will also be easier for me to notify you 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.070
 do not release these endless announcements on 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.459
 channel so friends if you put 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.010
 it will be cool well, and the second news friends 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.830
 this is something that is also very important and 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.720
 friends and from after all simple more important 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.630
 or project in general friends 2 new 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.880
 the following, henceforth and forever most likely 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.700
 he will go on a live channel this 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.470
 There were many reasons One of the reasons is that 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.959
 on the main channel to a small people 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.510
 I like myself another reason for that 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.120
 band live channel is generally not enough 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.750
 the third reason is out there looking themselves 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.910
 OK 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.130
 on the live channel in general friends if you 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.380
