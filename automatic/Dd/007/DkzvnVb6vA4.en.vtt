the<00:00:44.190> left<00:00:44.370> side<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:45.180> way<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.750> my

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the left side that way you can see my

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.540 
the left side that way you can see my
connection<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> way<00:00:46.710> hooked<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.399> can

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
connection the way hooked up and I can

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.350 
connection the way hooked up and I can
test<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.059> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
I think our line hooked up on the right

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.590 
I think our line hooked up on the right
