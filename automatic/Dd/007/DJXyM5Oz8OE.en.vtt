and not the novel traditional SIM card

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.490 
and not the novel traditional SIM card
as<00:01:33.700> you<00:01:34.030> can<00:01:34.330> see<00:01:34.510> this<00:01:34.720> is<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.900> one<00:01:35.050> there's<00:01:35.440> a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
as you can see this is the one there's a

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.400 
as you can see this is the one there's a
traditional<00:01:35.920> SIM<00:01:36.100> card<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:37.540> I<00:01:37.660> try<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:37.900> put<00:01:38.290> in

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
traditional SIM card if I try to put in

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.749 
traditional SIM card if I try to put in
it<00:01:39.009> won't<00:01:39.280> code<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.920> can<00:01:42.040> see<00:01:42.190> that<00:01:42.400> it's

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
it won't code as you can see that it's

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.590 
it won't code as you can see that it's
not<00:01:43.210> going<00:01:43.479> in<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:45.070> you<00:01:45.160> need<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.430> get<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.030> micro

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
not going in so you need to get a micro

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.790 
not going in so you need to get a micro
SD<00:01:46.960> micro<00:01:47.229> SIM<00:01:47.830> card<00:01:48.149> which<00:01:49.149> is<00:01:49.180> this<00:01:49.720> one

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.240 

compare<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.950> size<00:01:54.190> with<00:01:54.940> a<00:01:54.970> normal<00:01:55.420> simple

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
compare the size with a normal simple

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.859 
compare the size with a normal simple
then

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.280 

you<00:02:00.320> can<00:02:00.500> see<00:02:00.680> that<00:02:00.860> almost<00:02:02.080> there's<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.140> good

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
you can see that almost there's a good

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.200 
you can see that almost there's a good
amount<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.619> difference<00:02:04.070> between<00:02:04.190> micro<00:02:04.760> SD
