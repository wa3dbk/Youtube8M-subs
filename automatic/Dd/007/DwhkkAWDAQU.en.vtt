00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.259
 hello guys let's find out how it 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.530
 moves and how the water changes in the 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.260
 nature water in nature 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.450
 it's never quiet, it's always moving 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.539
 and is changing state say 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.820
 changing from liquid to liquid solid 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.740
 gas and steam according to let 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.699
 discover how he does agree very 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.279
 attentive let's look at for example in 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.669
 the sea let's start putting the water 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.770
 is in the sea according and the sun is going 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.840
 heating the sea water in the rivers and 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.850
 of the lakes is easier than hot 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.660
 the sea because it is quiet according to 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.930
 with that heat the water evaporates 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.870
 that is, it becomes steam and goes 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.480
 going up you see how the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.820
 flechita is sea water 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:57.510
 warms up evaporates and goes up 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.840
 and part of that steam come together and it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.680
 they turn into clouds the clouds are 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.290
 small droplets of water that weigh very 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.130
 little and can stand there in the air 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.960
 okay just go up the water just go up 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.240
 the water that remains in our head does not 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.430
 you will see because the water of the sea 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.490
 warms becomes steam 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.030
 evaporate and rise in forming small 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.720
 droplets form the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.330
 we have that clear 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.130
 every time the clouds are becoming more 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.380
 bigger bigger bigger more 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.080
 large are gathering more water and 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.680
 when the clouds have a lot of water that 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.680
 do you think it happens 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.990
 can 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.540
 Yes sir 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.820
 when the clouds gather a lot of water that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.860
 Water 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.800
 and that's why 9 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.410
 and what happens if it rains in a 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.410
 very cold place what is going on 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.270
 when it is a site 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.630
 instead of raining it snows because the water 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.050
 It is freezing and becomes solid 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.050
 you truly remember that's why we created the snow 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.120
 agree that rain and that snow falls to 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.260
 the sides 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.110
 to lakes and rivers and goes down 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.750
 the mountains and along the way 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.760
 dragging minerals and within 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.849
 minerals is the salt 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.150
 the low low low river came down and where 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.150
 just 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:47.989
 yes sir the water of the rivers returns to 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.799
 stop at sea according and at sea the 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.470
 water evaporates again it recreates 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.049
 small clouds droplets the clouds sag 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.450
 create snow rain if it's in a very 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.239
 cold 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.150
 that the rivers fall low low low low 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.120
 low low again to the sea 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.810
 you remember that I told you before that 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.330
 sea water was healed 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.599
 because when the sea ​​water evaporates 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:20.130
 the salt stays in there but when 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:22.830
 The river goes down and takes more salt and that 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.550
 salt accumulates in sea ​​water 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.250
 state agree quick review the water 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.500
 from the sea the sun warms it evaporates and 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.690
 turns it into steam and creates 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.030
 clouds that are small droplets when 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.940
 the clouds get together 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.180
 drops starts water rain or snow 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.590
 it depends on how cold it is 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.900
 and that water falls into rivers and rivers 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.719
 returns to the sea is a whole cycle is a 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.099
 back four guys you can think a 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.879
 little bit the next time you see that 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.879
 it rains until soon
