internet LED now what you do is take

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.990 
internet LED now what you do is take
this<00:02:18.230> phone<00:02:18.890> jack<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:22.540> connected<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:25.310> this

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
this phone jack and connected to this

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.750 
this phone jack and connected to this
port<00:02:26.360> number<00:02:26.480> one<00:02:30.280> it's<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.430> other<00:02:31.550> way

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
port number one it's the other way

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.000 
port number one it's the other way
around

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
around

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.360
