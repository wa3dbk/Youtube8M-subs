going<00:02:14.810> but<00:02:15.280> keep<00:02:16.280> them<00:02:16.490> pretty<00:02:17.120> well<00:02:17.270> spaced

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.130 

okay

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
okay

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.120

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
now looked out and it's found on the bed

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.090 
now looked out and it's found on the bed
of<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.670> ocean

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
of the ocean

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.550 
of the ocean
seaweed<00:02:31.540> yeah<00:02:32.540> now<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.780> would<00:02:33.020> be<00:02:33.050> my<00:02:33.350> first

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
seaweed yeah now that would be my first

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.680 
seaweed yeah now that would be my first
guest<00:02:33.890> bro<00:02:34.280> guests<00:02:34.880> probably<00:02:36.010> yeah<00:02:37.010> he's<00:02:37.430> a

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
guest bro guests probably yeah he's a

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.440 
guest bro guests probably yeah he's a
guy's<00:02:38.690> garden<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.200> doors<00:02:40.030> not<00:02:41.030> really

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
guy's garden the doors not really

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.010 
guy's garden the doors not really
hardcore<00:02:41.780> enough<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:43.450> don't<00:02:44.450> know<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.540> hate<00:02:44.840> this

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
hardcore enough I don't know I hate this

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.540 
hardcore enough I don't know I hate this
one<00:02:45.260> okay<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.340> three

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
one okay so this is the three

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.470 
one okay so this is the three
dimensional<00:02:46.580> maze

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
dimensional maze

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.810 
dimensional maze
press<00:02:47.660> X<00:02:47.959> if<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.260> give<00:02:48.440> up<00:02:48.620> guess<00:02:49.250> what<00:02:49.520> we're

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
press X if you give up guess what we're

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.699 
press X if you give up guess what we're
not<00:02:49.940> pressing<00:02:50.270> X<00:02:51.489> all<00:02:52.489> right<00:02:52.610> okay<00:02:53.239> whoops

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
not pressing X all right okay whoops

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.520 
not pressing X all right okay whoops
yeah<00:02:54.709> I<00:02:54.920> just<00:02:55.190> pressed<00:02:55.430> X<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:57.200> they<00:02:57.320> have<00:02:57.410> to

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
yeah I just pressed X so they have to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.370 
yeah I just pressed X so they have to
really<00:02:57.739> explain<00:02:58.070> to<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.370> once<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.600> press<00:03:00.140> X

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
really explain to you once you press X

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.790 
really explain to you once you press X
that<00:03:00.920> it's<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.370> very<00:03:01.670> dimensional<00:03:01.940> maze<00:03:02.360> skin

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
that it's a very dimensional maze skin

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.860 
that it's a very dimensional maze skin
so<00:03:03.800> it's<00:03:03.920> pretty<00:03:04.040> much<00:03:04.160> is<00:03:04.430> guessing<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.750> know

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
so it's pretty much is guessing you know

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.600 
so it's pretty much is guessing you know
just<00:03:06.580> trial<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:07.610> error<00:03:07.730> again<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:10.130> go<00:03:10.280> left

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
just trial and error again you go left

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.880 
just trial and error again you go left
you<00:03:10.790> go<00:03:10.850> right<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.239> go<00:03:11.510> left<00:03:11.600> some<00:03:12.049> more<00:03:12.260> you

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
you go right you go left some more you

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.039 
you go right you go left some more you
wind<00:03:13.130> up<00:03:13.250> over<00:03:13.459> here<00:03:13.760> then<00:03:14.570> we<00:03:14.630> could<00:03:14.720> disable

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
wind up over here then we could disable

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.400 
wind up over here then we could disable
layers<00:03:15.500> see<00:03:15.980> what's<00:03:16.280> up

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
layers see what's up

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.750 
layers see what's up
yeah<00:03:18.410> it<00:03:18.500> doesn't<00:03:18.709> tell<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.070> much<00:03:19.100> just

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
yeah it doesn't tell you much just

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.340 
yeah it doesn't tell you much just
basically<00:03:20.450> that<00:03:21.910> Mario's<00:03:22.910> there<00:03:23.630> which<00:03:24.049> kind

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
basically that Mario's there which kind

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.780 
basically that Mario's there which kind
of<00:03:24.380> already<00:03:24.620> know<00:03:24.799> when<00:03:25.040> you're<00:03:25.190> doing<00:03:25.580> it<00:03:25.760> so

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
of already know when you're doing it so

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.410 
of already know when you're doing it so
that<00:03:27.370> that's<00:03:28.370> not<00:03:28.610> really<00:03:28.820> doing<00:03:29.060> anything

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
that that's not really doing anything

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.570 
that that's not really doing anything
for<00:03:29.570> us<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:32.350> did<00:03:33.350> not<00:03:33.500> mean<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.709> press<00:03:33.980> X<00:03:34.220> that

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
for us I did not mean to press X that

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.450 
for us I did not mean to press X that
time

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.870 

so<00:03:38.460> you<00:03:38.790> yeah<00:03:39.570> go<00:03:39.990> left<00:03:40.470> again<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:41.250> guess<00:03:41.670> you'll

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
so you yeah go left again I guess you'll

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.520 
so you yeah go left again I guess you'll
go<00:03:42.060> right<00:03:42.650> her<00:03:43.650> no<00:03:43.830> uppish<00:03:44.630> yeah<00:03:45.630> seemed<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.440> go

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
go right her no uppish yeah seemed to go

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.030 
go right her no uppish yeah seemed to go
up<00:03:46.740> it's<00:03:46.980> their<00:03:47.220> left<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.730> uppish<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:49.860> it's

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
up it's their left and uppish so it's

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.470 
up it's their left and uppish so it's
basically<00:03:50.370> just<00:03:50.610> guessing

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
basically just guessing

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.220 
basically just guessing
yeah<00:03:52.370> it's<00:03:53.370> mushroom<00:03:53.790> yeah<00:03:54.390> no<00:03:55.080> one<00:03:55.200> likes

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
yeah it's mushroom yeah no one likes

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.060 
yeah it's mushroom yeah no one likes
those<00:03:55.590> anymore

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
those anymore

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.500 
those anymore
I<00:03:56.220> take<00:03:56.550> royal<00:03:56.820> syrup<00:03:57.360> over<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.920> has<00:03:59.040> two

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
I take royal syrup over it has two

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.500 
I take royal syrup over it has two
vowels<00:04:00.510> as<00:04:01.020> an<00:04:01.320> S<00:04:01.470> two<00:04:01.980> vowels<00:04:02.550> and<00:04:02.760> it's<00:04:03.360> on

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
vowels as an S two vowels and it's on

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.420 
vowels as an S two vowels and it's on
the<00:04:03.600> bed<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.960> ocean<00:04:06.290> that's<00:04:07.290> coins<00:04:08.190> I

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
the bed of the ocean that's coins I

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.130 
the bed of the ocean that's coins I
think<00:04:08.730> but<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.150> know<00:04:09.240> that<00:04:09.480> guy<00:04:09.660> is<00:04:09.720> annoying

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
think but you know that guy is annoying

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.810 
think but you know that guy is annoying
I<00:04:10.500> don't<00:04:10.800> really<00:04:10.920> want<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.250> deal<00:04:11.400> with<00:04:11.430> him

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
I don't really want to deal with him

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.700 
I don't really want to deal with him
especially<00:04:12.690> since<00:04:12.990> we<00:04:13.260> can't<00:04:13.500> gain

especially since we can't gain

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
the same stuff he's sold in the sea so

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.650 
the same stuff he's sold in the sea so
no<00:04:23.730> point<00:04:24.000> in<00:04:24.120> getting<00:04:24.240> anything<00:04:24.630> here<00:04:24.960> oh<00:04:26.660> but

couldn't have figured that one out from
the<00:04:33.330> fact<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:33.720> it's<00:04:34.440> on<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.680> bed<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:34.890> the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
the fact that it's on the bed of the
