00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
my opponents and a lot of times I don't

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.020 
my opponents and a lot of times I don't
need<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.650> play<00:01:40.829> more<00:01:41.280> than<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.460> four<00:01:41.670> more<00:01:41.909> than

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
four lands because blood raydolph at

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010 
four lands because blood raydolph at
four<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> top<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.610> my<00:01:44.820> curve<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.869> for

this is basically the modern geun deck
in<00:02:56.650> legacy<00:02:57.129> but<00:02:57.459> it's<00:02:57.640> really<00:02:58.000> good<00:02:58.180> still<00:02:58.450> so

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
in legacy but it's really good still so

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.020

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
just dead delay line of sanctity but I

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.340 
just dead delay line of sanctity but I
don't<00:06:17.630> think<00:06:17.690> there's<00:06:17.870> really<00:06:17.990> anything<00:06:18.200> you

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
don't think there's really anything you

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.560 
don't think there's really anything you
can<00:06:18.470> do<00:06:18.560> about<00:06:18.590> that<00:06:18.950> so<00:06:19.370> you<00:06:20.090> just<00:06:20.360> have<00:06:20.510> to

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
can do about that so you just have to

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.260 
can do about that so you just have to
hope<00:06:20.750> they<00:06:20.870> don't<00:06:21.020> have<00:06:21.170> it<00:06:21.290> or<00:06:21.410> don't<00:06:21.440> draw<00:06:22.010> it

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
hope they don't have it or don't draw it

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.400 
hope they don't have it or don't draw it
so<00:06:23.270> open<00:06:23.420> library<00:06:23.780> is<00:06:23.840> like<00:06:23.930> a<00:06:23.990> really<00:06:24.260> good

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410
