00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
passed plate is 62 and I actually

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.780 
passed plate is 62 and I actually
studied<00:02:50.230> with<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.380> world<00:02:50.680> over<00:02:50.890> years<00:02:51.700> and

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.670 
studied with the world over years and
years<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.239> years<00:02:52.420> ago<00:02:52.569> but<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.140> like<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.470> sound

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
years and years ago but I like the sound

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.050 
years and years ago but I like the sound
of<00:02:53.739> this<00:02:53.830> guitar<00:02:53.890> better<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.489> really<00:02:54.670> do<00:02:54.970> I'm

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
of this guitar better I really do I'm

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.240 
of this guitar better I really do I'm
not<00:02:55.180> just<00:02:55.390> saying<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:55.900> has<00:02:56.019> more<00:02:56.260> has

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
not just saying that it has more has

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.330 
not just saying that it has more has
more<00:02:57.519> depth<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.650> but<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.680> guess<00:03:00.100> it's<00:03:00.250> a

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
more depth to it but I guess it's a

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.070 
more depth to it but I guess it's a
subjective<00:03:00.550> thing<00:03:00.910> but<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:01.209> do<00:03:01.360> love<00:03:01.750> an<00:03:01.900> old

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
subjective thing but I do love an old

the<00:03:36.040> bass<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.459> think<00:03:36.910> it's<00:03:37.000> because<00:03:37.209> what<00:03:37.390> Ivan

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
the bass I think it's because what Ivan

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.620 
the bass I think it's because what Ivan
has<00:03:37.810> does<00:03:38.049> like<00:03:38.890> some<00:03:39.549> of<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.700> Gibson<00:03:40.030> 175

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
has does like some of the Gibson 175

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.080 
has does like some of the Gibson 175
from<00:03:40.840> 88<00:03:41.290> 89<00:03:41.650> in<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.130> period<00:03:42.400> where<00:03:42.730> had

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
from 88 89 in that period where had

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.449 
from 88 89 in that period where had
really<00:03:43.390> nice<00:03:43.540> like<00:03:43.840> maple<00:03:44.410> fused<00:03:45.340> with

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459
