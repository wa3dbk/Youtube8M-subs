and there's the second assembly here now
if<00:01:32.860> you<00:01:33.010> are<00:01:33.130> having<00:01:33.340> any<00:01:33.520> problems<00:01:34.000> with<00:01:34.180> your

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
if you are having any problems with your

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.180 
if you are having any problems with your
remote<00:01:34.570> working<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.470> could<00:01:35.650> possibly<00:01:36.010> be<00:01:36.160> a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
remote working it could possibly be a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.010 
remote working it could possibly be a
contact<00:01:36.760> issue<00:01:37.030> so<00:01:37.270> these<00:01:37.360> little<00:01:37.480> contacts

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
contact issue so these little contacts

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.420 
contact issue so these little contacts
here<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.260> can<00:01:38.470> bend<00:01:38.770> them<00:01:38.920> up<00:01:39.040> ever<00:01:39.190> so

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
here you can bend them up ever so

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.220 
here you can bend them up ever so
slightly<00:01:39.790> I'll<00:01:40.450> just<00:01:40.690> be<00:01:40.810> careful<00:01:41.140> because

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
slightly I'll just be careful because

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.570 
slightly I'll just be careful because
they<00:01:41.410> are<00:01:41.470> very<00:01:41.680> fragile<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.310> they<00:01:42.400> will

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
they are very fragile and they will

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.990 
they are very fragile and they will
crack<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.660> then<00:01:43.900> break<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:45.610> for<00:01:45.940> the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
crack and then break as for the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.420 
crack and then break as for the
batteries<00:01:46.360> now<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:47.320> negative<00:01:47.470> side<00:01:47.950> which<00:01:48.250> is

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
batteries now the negative side which is

batteries now the negative side which is
that<00:01:48.610> side<00:01:48.820> right<00:01:48.850> there<00:01:49.030> actually<00:01:49.660> faces

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
that side right there actually faces

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.080 
that side right there actually faces
downward<00:01:50.350> against<00:01:50.710> these<00:01:50.860> contacts<00:01:53.460> now<00:01:54.460> for

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
downward against these contacts now for

pop<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.840> apart<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:19.060> there<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.270> have<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.540> now<00:02:19.860> to

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
pop it apart so there you have it now to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.500 
pop it apart so there you have it now to
remove<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.130> circuit<00:02:21.400> board<00:02:21.880> itself<00:02:22.240> from<00:02:22.360> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
remove the circuit board itself from the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.380 
remove the circuit board itself from the
button<00:02:22.750> assembly<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.200> rubber<00:02:23.380> assembly<00:02:24.390> let

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
button assembly the rubber assembly let

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.310 
button assembly the rubber assembly let
me<00:02:25.480> pop<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.840> out<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:29.230> your

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
buttons here and you will have a clear

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.410 
buttons here and you will have a clear
plastic<00:02:36.250> here<00:02:36.700> which<00:02:36.850> actually<00:02:37.239> these<00:02:37.360> little

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
plastic here which actually these little

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.870 
plastic here which actually these little
spots<00:02:38.110> here<00:02:38.530> are<00:02:39.070> for<00:02:39.310> what<00:02:39.430> they<00:02:39.520> push<00:02:39.700> down

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
spots here are for what they push down

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.940 
spots here are for what they push down
in<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.030> circle<00:02:40.180> board<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.660> make<00:02:40.750> those

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
black side you can actually see the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.260 
black side you can actually see the
outlines<00:02:47.650> on<00:02:47.890> there<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.340> they<00:02:48.910> do<00:02:49.570> they<00:02:50.290> are

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
outlines on there and they do they are

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.150 
outlines on there and they do they are
indented<00:02:52.270> from<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.600> surface<00:02:53.020> that<00:02:53.620> actually

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
indented from the surface that actually

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.740 
indented from the surface that actually
touches<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.640> circuit<00:02:54.970> board<00:02:55.120> itself<00:02:57.750> there

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
touches the circuit board itself there

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.660 
touches the circuit board itself there
you<00:02:58.840> have<00:02:59.020> it<00:02:59.170> now<00:02:59.430> what<00:03:00.430> we'll<00:03:00.520> do<00:03:00.640> is
