00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.849
 skype make nuclear in my graphic 

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:07.669
 industrial reactor 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:10.669
 loved to krakow 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.069
 I will use the client Dragan Ajax 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:15.849
 for import 1 2 5 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.659
 by the way link to it 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.659
 I have already laid out the inanimate writing of the limit 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.989
 so that they can easily download it from 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.210
 poet aykraft muz.ru 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.039
 Krivenko I was just divine e when 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.180
 Anyone make a salary client 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.180
 can be here a lot of moldova and 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.850
 describe them all the more recount 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 very very difficult 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.410
 Well let's get started 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.010
 first we need 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.030
 fortified how to make 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.240
 defense 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.920
 to react with 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.750
 that is, others of all those who remember 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.540
 usual forgot to change what it is 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.830
 fount elements so he 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.210
 not badly damaged by the explosion 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.310
 nearby buildings but if they 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.310
 will certainly stand there but oh well 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.590
 I don't want them now 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.690
 don't really be i just do 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.800
 primitive reactor 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.350
 got the upper hand 6 court order 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.900
 Now 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.510
 if possible 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.050
 such accounting 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.050
 4 st 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.580
 will become a court 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.250
 and then take the device under 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.650
 name m 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.140
 his way for some reason in the fog on this estimate 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.490
 in general, therefore, it is better to use samples 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.280
 with their copyright place to find 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.479
 PC 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.660
 it is so 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.720
 battery 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.530
 keep fresh 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.530
 there is a project 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.990
 now in the warehouses tes 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.590
 a draw word to her 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.590
 there is 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.289
 building in this way 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.300
 so they all had their own actions 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.370
 I do not know 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.450
 the fourth is not involved 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.560
 so we donâ€™t need kwhh at all 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.809
 works and now 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:26.310
 worked out 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.069
 hurry from here you can 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.239
 simply 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.149
 connect some tea 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.239
 with 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.949
 any items 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:38.629
 in the sense of pumps 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.689
 or their were technically 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.689
 in this way 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.009
