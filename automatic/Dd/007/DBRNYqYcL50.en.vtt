00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.309
 Today we have the World Dental Championship 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.230
 brushes and man in the panel of judges 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.980
 Dr. Shubin Doctor I will continue the doctor 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.869
 dumbbell man 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.869
 leave the judges dear 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.660
 no, too, will be checked and so three 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.910
 varieties of toothbrushes today are 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.250
 On the market 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.780
 simple 1 electric 2 and 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.370
 ultrasound 3 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.370
 bring their studio 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.239
 but 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.110
 so simple 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.239
 electric and ultrasound you have 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.160
 different species each have 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.949
 simple and let's start with simplicity 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.409
 use simplicity and speed jar 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.000
 that he is a simple no use is not necessary 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:14.090
 charge the battery charge vodka yet 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.219
 that brushed my teeth panel threw her 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.130
 they will not become completely aware 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.649
 each one is recommended -1 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.960
 brush your teeth a simple brush 2 minutes 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.740
 of course almost no one 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.560
 stand it 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.390
 at least 2 I preferably 5 we him nutria 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.939
 It is desirable to not only clean and 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.100
 in a special way of movement yes yes yes then 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:38.149
 there is this complete madness true 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.429
 the simplest brush -1 degas fashionable and 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.500
 long use so the first thing 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.240
 was invented 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.619
 electric toothbrush let's her 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.979
 included predicted 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.319
 and that it facilitates firms it allows 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.649
 we do not move your arm to move but 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.649
 extremely 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.300
 just applying here amoled us 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.090
 begin to be felt gradually 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:11.820
 despite the fact that it is a highly efficient device 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.550
 here of course it's harder here I have to 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.130
 So here we clean out 7 movements, not all 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.640
 do not yet go crazy well frieze 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.670
 against the simple brush we are the treatment here 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:29.340
 such an amazing brush and gave the first 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.430
 advantage for us lazy cuts 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.680
 brushing time and makes a huge 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.380
 the number of rotational and all sorts of different 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.750
 movements that clean up much better 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.680
 teeth than our hands is the first 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.970
 advantage of the second we will discuss Andrei 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.970
 Petrovich with you here these brushes we usually 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.020
 use as long as they make holes 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.310
 we do not talk about it, so the worse 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.360
 here are the fibers 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.360
 the greater the risk of damage to the gums 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.640
 especially if a person has gingivitis or 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.830
 defeat and so there is bleeding and 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.590
 there is then of course damage yet 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.510
 more likely to have an electric for 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.470
 the electric is much smaller 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:21.360
 the gum itself strikes 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.150
 that is, you can press her tightly 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.459
 the effect on such a delicate fabric even 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.860
 as the skin of a tomato is such that it is its 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.750
 does not destroy and our gums will not 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.120
 decay but plaque to the teeth will 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.690
 effectively filmed here you know what 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.960
 speed 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.860
 these heads rotate 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.050
 up to 40 thousand times per minute + 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.740
 electric toothbrush is that it 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.680
 much less damage dish well it 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.200
 also a fact she has less head for 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.720
 so as not to damage our gums and enamel 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.230
 so the degree of security 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.850
 electric brush 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:02.090
 higher than normal and finally lowered with 8 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.920
 without movement this ultrasonic tooth 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.650
 Does anyone have a brush in the hall 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.990
 ultrasonic toothbrush I've got 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.530
 I was not presented to you 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.780
 near me ultrasound you have me 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:19.040
 pimple and you train 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.900
 See 40 thousand revolutions here and here 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.120
 know how much they take 6 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.840
 tens of times more then 2 million times a 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.210
 peaceful 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.960
 should n't of course the ultrasound fluctuates 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.430
 shoulder 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:41.210
 bristles excellent cleansing action and 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:45.470
 almost do not damage the surrounding tissue 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:48.889
 second ultrasonic oscillations from 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.919
 cheeks make plaque and if you brush 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.560
 teeth ultrasonic brush of 1 1 and then 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.780
 just when you rinse your mouth out 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.570
 here are these plaque and with surprise it 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.660
 see therefore this is another plus 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.600
 ultrasonic toothbrush there is still 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.000
 one amount of earthly posts which 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.470
 must use the minimum equals 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.229
 not even a drop 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.180
 and even less because you can clean 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.600
 even without toothpaste 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.979
 I want 4 + let's add 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.729
 physiotherapy for gums 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:26.530
 that is, one stimulation of blood flow by one 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:31.789
 just a word plus a first place 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:34.580
 electric ultrasonic brush 3 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:37.760
 simple it does not mean that some 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:42.039
 bad some good of course you 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:45.500
 choose for yourself but fundamentally it 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:48.110
 just like that i will give you 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.169
 I don't want you to be on record 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.630
 ultrasound did not buy somehow I 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:57.320
 electric world on electric self 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.660
 stands in the place of honor in the closet you in 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.710
 gives me back 6 you can suppress it 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.710
 ok we are for 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.160
 let friends in fact 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.770
 ultrasonic electric dental 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.500
 brushes this is also a gadget scientific truth 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.680
 someone was brushing his teeth slowly and sadly 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.290
 thought to what time I will we ends 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.540
 came up with started electric and then 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.610
 ultrasonic brush i sieve and people 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.310
 who come up with such household trifles 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.380
 they are absolutely absolute genius 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.930
 because for that the nobel prize is not 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.660
 will give and only some thankful 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.800
 the city person will say to the site 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.680
 reproducing the altruist perfectly 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.770
 just can not hate people and think of 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:48.000
 for them, here too, choose such things 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:48.000
 any ultrasonic brush simplifies
