00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.660
 what kind of jade jade injury has a snack bar design project 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.620
 which is one of the bones of the top hat made once a month degenerative 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:12.149
 in this course and this causes pain 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.599
 this was diagnosed ten recent years 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.039
 - this michela has exams of two months ago and has new exams now of 15 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.220
 days ago 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.710
 who confirmed the injury to the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.810
 did not evolve 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.819
 nor evolved in that time 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.980
 they will be kept she clinically is much better without pain 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.930
 little turning only at the extreme ends 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.830
 more radio logically the reaction 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.930
 which caused strangeness 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.490
 can not say what caused her to have an orgy with the streets beautiful bounties 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.640
 planned 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.210
 I know I will find a repetitive divorce or until asked to pet begin 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.130
 we knew 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.420
 because of that 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.670
 calcium mashai which may cause selection 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.300
 she listened to the Olympic games 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.519
 I do not know how to say her 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.519
 I was in pain at the Olympic Games. 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.890
 I only saw her after the Olympics. 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.380
 So I just ask the diagnosis, can I joke? 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.990
 through this diagnosis she can return to the training to compete soon 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.930
 she now 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.270
 It's not too painful. 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.300
 it's alan 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.630
 is released 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.550
 to return to physical activity more is possible due to the injury that beats 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.980
 feeling pain again 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.810
 so she is being 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.810
 reevaluate the date being assessed by hand clinic group 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.550
 and we will ask the opinion of a colleague from outside the country too 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.920
 every opinion about her case for us traces a more definitive conduct 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.740
 home 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.060
 in this case her 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.510
 with the deadline for curing the selection 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.210
 do not have a deadline to cure it is possible until you do not care 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.960
 of this lesion 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 This is not how we say medicine is not a mathematics that 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.480
 there are objective answers right 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.800
 It may be that she does not even care 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.480
 We'll see through time. 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.540
 I'm back in competition 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.239
 can once again compete for injured podiums 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.860
 she is little pain now 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.160
 and this is what will limit it competes or not 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.719
 so even with the selection the supporter can buy with the pt 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.329
 then it may be a decision 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.029
 irreversible 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.029
 can be one of the novelties 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.949
 surgery will be needed 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.869
 I climbed people going she's being evaluated 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.619
 the hand surgeons here in rio de janeiro 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:41.549
 and we are directing her case procon claims from outside the country to give 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.200
 an opinion also that people 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.279
 it was so much to have the maximum of positive opinions 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.279
 we draw a more definitive course 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.169
 in her frame 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.289
 being the specialist 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:57.250
 my dreams on the hand what kind of move that kind of 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.570
 physical activity training have competed 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.179
 could have caused this jade injury 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.290
 but you can not tell that case 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.629
 in case she has a rare lesion 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.540
 but peeling were described from the selection I think it uses today shows to 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.379
 people with the blue party 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.079
 she has a necrosis 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.709
 of one of the bones of the kart 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.689
 that is the capeta rats is right in the middle of the hand in the big pocket that have in the meira 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.199
 in hand 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.009
 are there any 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.399
 cases up to 100 in known cause 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:31.029
 selection 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:34.029
 is that it may be more common in athletes 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.419
 overexertion 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.039
 more than it is possible that in her case it has been because of this 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.679
 but they're concerned they say they have no explanation why it happened 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.719
 our experience with the forecast that is made 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.819
 of the return of the arts 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.549
 I can not give a prediction 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.069
 definitive 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.419
 she is very well and clinically has little pain 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:03.009
 and she's even free to start doing some training 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.729
 part of it 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.940
 We gave it to you again. 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.369
 no result in terms of pain and 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:10.749
 in response 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.309
 to useless effort 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.129
 But before that, we 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.489
 you have their case with other colleagues from here in each hand 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:19.379
 and is being 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:21.019
 will be re-evaluated 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.080
 and will be forwarded to colleagues 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.840
 more experience 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.620
 the injury being cured irreversible as lord said that there is the possibility 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.719
 at what point 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.629
 can be this year played art 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.210
 can not give a prognosis 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.689
 in relation to performance has as such 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.259
 a good definitive answer may come back 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.729
 to compete in high style level 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.509
 the robbery by hand of this has no way to say 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:49.240
 mid-next
