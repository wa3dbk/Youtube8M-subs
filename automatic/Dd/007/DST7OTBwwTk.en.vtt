to<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> crown<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.010> then<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.210> cut<00:00:42.450> away<00:00:42.980> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
to the crown and then just cut away and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.100 
to the crown and then just cut away and
it<00:00:44.969> will<00:00:45.120> come<00:00:45.360> off<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.170> clump<00:00:47.899> once<00:00:48.899> it's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
it will come off of the clump once it's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.740 
it will come off of the clump once it's
off<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> clump<00:00:49.710> take<00:00:50.610> off<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.030> end<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.660> the

off the clump take off the end of the
tuber<00:00:52.140> called<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> rat<00:00:53.039> tail<00:00:53.340> because<00:00:53.789> these

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
tuber called the rat tail because these

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.330

can<00:00:54.239> rot<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:54.989> storage<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.690> then<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.050> have

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
can rot in storage and then if you have

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.729 
can rot in storage and then if you have
two<00:00:59.340> tubers<00:00:59.760> connected<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.559> can

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
two tubers connected like this you can

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.880 
two tubers connected like this you can
separate<00:01:02.190> these<00:01:02.570> by<00:01:03.570> leaving<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.350> eye<00:01:04.589> on

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
separate these by leaving one eye on

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.609 
separate these by leaving one eye on
each<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> tubers<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.720> separate

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.830 

once<00:01:13.619> you've<00:01:13.799> divided<00:01:14.580> your<00:01:14.790> tubers<00:01:15.240> put<00:01:15.689> them

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
once you've divided your tubers put them

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
once you've divided your tubers put them
into<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.140> water<00:01:16.650> bath<00:01:16.920> or<00:01:17.280> wash<00:01:17.580> them<00:01:17.850> carefully

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
into a water bath or wash them carefully

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.690 
into a water bath or wash them carefully
to<00:01:18.540> get<00:01:19.049> any<00:01:19.200> remaining<00:01:19.500> dirt<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:20.040> debris<00:01:20.280> off

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
to get any remaining dirt or debris off

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.660 
to get any remaining dirt or debris off
the<00:01:20.729> tubers<00:01:21.409> then<00:01:22.409> dry<00:01:22.770> them<00:01:22.950> thoroughly<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the tubers then dry them thoroughly and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.240 
the tubers then dry them thoroughly and
then<00:01:24.150> put<00:01:24.750> them<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.020> plastic<00:01:25.560> bags<00:01:25.799> for

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
then put them in plastic bags for

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.020 
then put them in plastic bags for
storage<00:01:29.420> continue<00:01:30.420> dividing<00:01:30.689> your<00:01:30.990> clump

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
storage continue dividing your clump

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.160 
storage continue dividing your clump
remove<00:01:33.030> all<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> tubers<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.340> have<00:01:35.340> eyes

removed and should be removed because

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.060 
removed and should be removed because
they<00:01:45.640> could<00:01:45.850> rot<00:01:46.570> in<00:01:46.780> storage<00:01:49.620> trim<00:01:50.620> the<00:01:50.740> ends

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
they could rot in storage trim the ends

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.550 
they could rot in storage trim the ends
again<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.880> you<00:01:55.300> find<00:01:55.570> small<00:01:55.900> tubers<00:01:56.320> with

again if you find small tubers with
broken<00:01:56.979> necks<00:01:57.250> those<00:01:57.610> should<00:01:57.850> be<00:01:58.000> removed

that has been really broken during

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:25.800 
that has been really broken during
digging<00:02:11.380> should<00:02:11.709> be<00:02:11.800> taken<00:02:12.130> off<00:02:24.630> what<00:02:25.630> you'll

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
digging should be taken off what you'll

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.479 
digging should be taken off what you'll
be<00:02:25.900> left<00:02:26.110> with<00:02:26.350> is<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.680> original<00:02:27.070> tuber<00:02:27.459> that

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
be left with is the original tuber that

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.090 
be left with is the original tuber that
you<00:02:27.730> planted<00:02:28.120> from<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:29.290> can<00:02:29.530> tell<00:02:29.739> what<00:02:29.920> this

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
you planted from you can tell what this

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.800 
you planted from you can tell what this
is<00:02:30.340> because<00:02:30.730> it'll<00:02:30.940> usually<00:02:31.090> be<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.390> darker

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
is because it'll usually be a darker

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.660 
is because it'll usually be a darker
color<00:02:32.080> than<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.680> other<00:02:32.830> tubers<00:02:33.280> look<00:02:33.580> a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
color than the other tubers look a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.840 
color than the other tubers look a
little<00:02:33.910> bit<00:02:34.030> older<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.720> we'll<00:02:35.350> have<00:02:35.560> a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
little bit older and we'll have a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.760 
little bit older and we'll have a
roundish<00:02:36.850> spot<00:02:37.209> where<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.959> original<00:02:38.200> tuber

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
roundish spot where the original tuber

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.900
