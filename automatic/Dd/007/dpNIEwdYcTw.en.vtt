00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.340
 let's come to my favorite toy 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.250
 next to ipad we have so thanks firmware 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.739
 update for the baby face 2 face 2 face 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.630
 tour fix the possibility the ipad im 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.710
 glass completely mode directly with these 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.710
 devices to connect 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.250
 that is the ipad is with the hartz 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.750
 these devices are quasi equipped and 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.020
 if you have a recording software on 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.629
 to run this ipad according to or what 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.530
 always this can just be the analog 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.150
 input output but also art or just 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.140
 use accordingly 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.300
 that has many customers 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.769
 is excited is strange fix is that 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.960
 the bang ever because I can 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.430
 the ipad records and at the same time with 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.530
 our through functionality on the 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.510
 usb-stick because you know my security 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.110
 run backup if then the ipad 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.110
 support no matter the recording is there 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.360
 but good the only one open the only one 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.430
 open point now is that we are the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.270
 overall bsp effects of the detour unfortunately 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.770
 can not use 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.049
 nikolai a dynamic compressor limiter and 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.969
 also echo reverb you can do it though 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.399
 use but it is awkward too 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.450
 no possibility to adjust it 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.899
 that's going to change now 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.789
 comes the dead xfx and this one is 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.039
 actually the usual dead mix of 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.630
 windows or mac on the ipad 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.270
 since we are in the glass combined to run this 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.340
 also directly to the devices and 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.289
 then check it 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.020
 all the possibilities that I have of mine 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.280
 I also know that from computers 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.570
 By the way, this is the overview of the mode 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.000
 no one pulled his finger here now 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.280
 to handle so little feathers rom 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.159
 no the normal mode is natural 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.429
 this and here you can already see that is 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.469
 it will also second supported all 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.599
 usual things that one so from one 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.580
 ipad intuitively expected you can enter here 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.110
 make channel small or longer 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.790
 can also push all channels small 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.989
 make up 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.129
 you can also be in here 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.160
 enter a canal 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.950
 Let's take an equalizer up here 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.630
 and create here a few buttons 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.680
 and then I quickly doubled 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.560
 reset to zero 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.120
 So these are some very nice things 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.310
 built the optimal operation 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.819
 Of course, all modes support support 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.980
 also goes horizontally or vertically 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.060
 just everything here in overview mode 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.519
 You can now again see it 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.400
 also gives besides the snapshots of course 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.489
 also the channel the layout letter law 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.610
 here we would have such an ice or no 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.519
 playback channel all or only the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.980
 analog channels and can then here 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.420
 Correspondingly back in the net shot 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.250
 choose his corresponding one 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.889
 everything is supported right down to the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.510
 usb record of the time I will also 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.370
 can control directly over the ipad 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.930
 that means we do not take that on now 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.609
 ipad out but here on the usb-stick 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.200
 But check which channels 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.060
 recorded or played back 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.859
 comfortable over this surface 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.750
 Of course , this usually goes in this one 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.359
 attitude because then you see something 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.720
 and has no fingers here too 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.720
 problem
