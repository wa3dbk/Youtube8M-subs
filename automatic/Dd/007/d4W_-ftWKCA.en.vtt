00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
would would not be as tiring a lot of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.760 
would would not be as tiring a lot of
times<00:01:50.360> when<00:01:50.540> you<00:01:50.690> change<00:01:50.960> lanes<00:01:51.230> in<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:51.560> rig

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
times when you change lanes in a rig

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.010 
times when you change lanes in a rig
this<00:01:51.950> size<00:01:52.010> it<00:01:52.430> feels<00:01:52.670> like<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.180> know<00:01:53.270> you

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
this size it feels like you know you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.650 
this size it feels like you know you
want<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.260> keep<00:01:54.410> going<00:01:54.710> if<00:01:55.040> you<00:01:55.190> don't<00:01:55.660> the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
want to keep going if you don't the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.270 
want to keep going if you don't the
coach<00:01:56.960> gets<00:01:57.230> momentum<00:01:57.440> going<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.130> direction

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
coach gets momentum going that direction

believe<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.680> steering<00:02:19.070> was<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.370> fantastic

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580

I<00:02:20.120> mean<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.570> corrected<00:02:20.960> itself<00:02:21.170> all<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:21.980> time

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
I mean it corrected itself all the time

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.370 
I mean it corrected itself all the time
I<00:02:22.550> mean<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:23.060> don't<00:02:23.240> have<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.570> correct<00:02:24.170> the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
I mean you don't have to correct the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.650 
I mean you don't have to correct the
steering<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:25.340> bring<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.670> back<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:26.060> true<00:02:26.510> the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
steering to bring it back to true the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.260 
steering to bring it back to true the
wheels<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.230> does<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.680> for<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.240> you<00:02:29.240> just

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
wheels it does that for you and you just

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.550 
wheels it does that for you and you just
as<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.500> driving<00:02:30.770> condition<00:02:31.370> changes<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.900> 400

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
as the driving condition changes so 400

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.680 
as the driving condition changes so 400
