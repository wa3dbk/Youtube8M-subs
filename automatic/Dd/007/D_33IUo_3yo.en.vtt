00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
now a lot of the examples might seem a

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.600 
now a lot of the examples might seem a
bit<00:02:26.060> corny<00:02:26.540> as<00:02:26.810> well<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.319> go<00:02:27.470> oh<00:02:27.500> god<00:02:28.040> do<00:02:28.580> I

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610

really want to do this but if you work
your<00:02:30.440> way<00:02:30.590> through<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.129> practice<00:02:32.890> you'll

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
your way through it and practice you'll

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.050 
your way through it and practice you'll
find<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.310> when<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.489> want<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.730> do<00:02:34.849> something

particular<00:02:48.380> layer<00:02:48.860> let<00:02:49.400> me<00:02:49.459> show<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.640> how<00:02:49.790> to

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
particular layer let me show you how to

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.910 
particular layer let me show you how to
do<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:50.239> some<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.540> examples<00:02:50.780> are<00:02:51.110> extreme

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
do so some of the examples are extreme

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.650 
do so some of the examples are extreme
and<00:02:51.950> something<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:52.790> wouldn't<00:02:53.030> normally<00:02:53.390> do

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
and something you wouldn't normally do

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.030 
and something you wouldn't normally do

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
but the practice of doing them and going

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.050 
but the practice of doing them and going
into<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.870> is<00:03:00.400> what<00:03:01.400> will<00:03:01.519> definitely<00:03:01.879> help<00:03:02.000> you

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
into it is what will definitely help you

type at all but going through some of
these<00:03:07.010> examples<00:03:07.220> really<00:03:07.910> showed<00:03:08.150> me<00:03:08.180> who<00:03:08.629> know

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
these examples really showed me who know
