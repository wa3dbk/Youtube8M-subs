00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.940
 the helmet is and remains the most important protective equipment for cyclists all over 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.289
 especially for children 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.099
 The ADAC has current hands from specialty stores and retailers 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.489
 Mail order companies tested that the models had a service 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:24.529
 Lea Korte has the test head circumference of 52 to 56 centimeters 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.720
 corresponds to the statistically most vulnerable age group from 6 to 13 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.699
 years 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.000
 important is that when choosing the try on when shopping the child with 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.749
 this is the child must 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:39.429
 The helmet is pleasant to feel must be able to put it on and off 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.780
 also the attitude on the head size there is my cap under it in the 

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:46.739
 Hair a bit longer or shorter must be created by the children 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.930
 The child must be there 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.300
 were tested next to the August Junior is here 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.770
 the Alpine Rocci 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.250
 he congratulates Erper 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.020
 the RK idea swing low 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.610
 a helmet from Lidl 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.200
 her author ideal 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 the profits about 170 27 10 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.820
 and the uvex or skates York 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.580
 Anyway he thinks everyone is doing better than no helmet 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.980
 even one who is already a bit older 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.060
 is more protection than he is after the evades 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.100
 In addition, but also very important that the helmet is good on the head 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.300
 is set 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.230
 that means he has to sit on his head not pulled that far in the forehead though 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.750
 Also not too far on the back of the King lives must be so adapted 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.510
 which, of course, Ortmann is able to repeat 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.770
 what does she rule as a rule of thumb two fingers should still be between chin children's band 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.220
 fit if everything is set optimally then the child has 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.930
 optimal protection increased 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.140
 the warband band exam showed 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.440
 that even small weaknesses in the bright 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.440
 be forgiven 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.600
 the test was carried out with standardized load basis acceleration values 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.430
 ideally that's what it looks like 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.470
 but not all candidates could meet the standards 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:20.400
 At the Charities Twingo Opel, the castle is here again in slow motion 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.769
 only a few buses already rather quieter Rothstein the building authority from the deep sea 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.709
 indication 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.469
 also this plant before the so-called from strips of m 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.179
 with the fourth force pulled behind the helmet 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.670
 Almost all models have existed on the World Network Power 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.799
 and the authors ideal 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:51.449
 The most important test criterion for how shock-resistant is their fall 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.779
 at the city Toowoomba for that 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.599
 maximum acceleration as a measure of injury risk 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:03:01.149
 The markup point is determined by laser 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.359
 All models fell below the norm and achieved good and very good 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.309
 the Arbo Studer Racer satisfactory 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.110
 in the standings got well 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.310
 the Alpina Rock are with Motel one point 7 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.379
 followed by Uvex Uwe Scheuch Junior with 1 point 8

 The test showed Hartmann for little money Beckmann good protection 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:02.719
 Percent, if you spend more money you have a child no more protective effect 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.710
 but above all, has more durability because a higher quality 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.559
 Manufacturing process is used 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:12.929
 In addition, better handling a bit more comfort on the whole
