of our fog effects except try control

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.120 
of our fog effects except try control
and<00:00:27.599> gives<00:00:27.840> us<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> first<00:00:28.260> turn<00:00:28.590> white<00:00:28.980> we

the second best we need these to get of
course<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.309> which<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.730> most<00:00:41.940> cases<00:00:42.090> just

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
course to this which in most cases just

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.880 
course to this which in most cases just
saves<00:00:42.840> our<00:00:42.989> life<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.920> an<00:00:44.820> ayat<00:00:45.559> aggro<00:00:46.559> I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890

rainbow<00:01:16.340> Banda<00:01:17.340> skittles<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.799> guess<00:01:19.799> that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
rainbow Banda skittles I guess that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.050 
rainbow Banda skittles I guess that
would<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.070> BS<00:01:22.310> alright<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.430> enough<00:01:23.790> fog

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
would be BS alright we have enough fog

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.530 
would be BS alright we have enough fog
effects<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.630> last<00:01:24.840> us<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.110> lifetime<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.770> let's

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
effects to last us a lifetime so let's

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.600 
effects to last us a lifetime so let's
let's<00:01:27.540> take<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> beat<00:01:28.409> or<00:01:28.439> two<00:01:28.590> let's<00:01:29.250> really

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
let's take a beat or two let's really

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.380 
let's take a beat or two let's really
really<00:01:30.270> make<00:01:30.420> them<00:01:30.540> overextend<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:32.390> that's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
really make them overextend here that's

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.340 
really make them overextend here that's
