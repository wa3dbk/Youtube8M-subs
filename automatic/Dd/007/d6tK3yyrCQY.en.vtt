00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:08.550
 Cassio watch 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.790
 x did not want to go down in thrash and 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.179
 buy very cheap Chinese 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.270
 watches have 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:22.490
 brand cue cue perfect at all in the store 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.500
 Watch where the brand saw their missing 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.470
 the company wrote sports just 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.859
 hours and sufficient species were many 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.370
 inexpensive wanted to take something from more 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.140
 less good firms well-it its not 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.350
 just less good firm it 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.899
 good company with her close I think 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.710
 price category of enough 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.710
 famous hurry and 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.980
 I caught on the electronic clock but 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.309
 believe in your hand and read reviews on one 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.710
 brand low cost 1208 there are many 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.500
 she was commented on in negative 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.880
 moments this strap because through 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.590
 a year or two later some strap 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.860
 cracked by the impact apparently some 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.900
 aggressive media and 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.070
 it was necessary to replace him and he is very 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.780
 tricky so rare designs and 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.450
 the strap itself was half a watch 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.420
 Many wrote therefore they already without 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.640
 strap used so you can say 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.560
 he lay somewhere in the dressers or not 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.210
 fastened can be on the car on 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.850
 front panel but far shorter 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.070
 saying not a pity well, an electronic clock 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.810
 thought of course there are some things 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 alarm clock but decided to take with the dial 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.060
 It is safir blat not digital but how 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.790
 it is customary to speak analog again 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.450
 I will say that it is purely inexpensive and myself 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.610
 the goal was to work in them 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:02.260
 some 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:06.840
 everyday may not be completely clean 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:10.840
 work to do somewhere in the area somewhere 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.870
 associated with any dirty work 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.160
 something like that was therefore chosen 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.740
 watch and still want to say what I thought in 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.500
 currently it is the most accessible 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.250
 option at the company checkout 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.950
 of something less connected with such 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.290
 Designed where they bought them they cost 1100 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.900
 rubles 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:40.030
 such prices for such watches which are as 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.360
 manufacturer report with rubber 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.850
 strap rubber strap has 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:54.000
 inscriptions 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:03:00.910
 cassiana caviar also cassiana holders 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.300
 strap strap rubber strap also 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.030
 body enough 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:11.400
 not cheap plastic plastic nice on 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:15.030
 touch the same light is available at the arrows 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.130
 + date image 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:22.180
 also to the advantages of this model for 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.130
 1100 rubles the fact that the strap is attached 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.489
 so it will be possible the case of 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:35.019
 change and it is soft rubber they are plastic 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:38.739
 of some kind this is what watch has 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:42.190
 there is still water resistance 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:46.180
 division of water resistance 50 m 100 m if 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.080
 they are wrong so here 50 m it seems to be 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.870
 refers to the fact that 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.200
 if the moisture gets on the watch is nothing 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.890
 there is no scary first step moisture 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.970
 protection nastya these 2 100 m you can me 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.660
 swim outfit without problems for 1100 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.370
 rubles 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:10.490
 I don't know the watch model 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:15.110
 decree option who tortured such 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.840
 specifications for watches are basically all 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.880
 already more expensive of course more expensive than dozens 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.620
 thousand for 100 rubles for 200 rubles but 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.500
 if we talk about a thousand 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.740
 rubles that is, they are more expensive by 15 to 20 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.010
 percent so here's a clock like with 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.640
 which if something happens at work 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:38.120
 will you be on a summer cottage on vacation 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:41.540
 smash very well and design 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.270
 This is considered for certain 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.410
 categories that include data 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.770
 watches it is relatively good 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.770
 Hello
