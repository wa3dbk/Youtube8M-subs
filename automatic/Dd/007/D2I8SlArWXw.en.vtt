00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.850
 direct to Miami there is 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.730
 silvina moschini who accompanies us in 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.410
 direct to technology to silvina taste 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.330
 green again we start talking the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.980
 last week we talked about google and how 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.289
 you want to get into homes through 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.789
 the thermostats now google and the 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.789
 contact lenses for diabetics 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.850
 everywhere they go carlos and if it seems 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.010
 that the internet of things is 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.349
 coming also from feet with firm foot to 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.790
 the technology for health in this 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.860
 occasion is a study that is leading 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.110
 go ahead the google group that is the 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.600
 same that has developed the projects 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.300
 if you remember well from google inc for the 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.489
 globe to connect internet tries 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.290
 make through this technology a 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.269
 alternative solution for people 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.269
 do not have to stick with needles 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.160
 fingers to measure your glucose level in 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.110
 this case is not in the blood if it is not in 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.360
 the lacrimal and what they are looking for is 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.940
 announce this project to be able to 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.190
 invite allies to other companies to 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.989
 that develop applications to be able 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.970
 give you a better solution and a 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.250
 alternative for so many people sick of 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.500
 this terrible disease that is much 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.659
 less painful and much more practical 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.720
 'google everywhere, let's talk 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.040
 about something that surprises is supposed to 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.350
 when one follows an operating system 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.610
 it replaces the other one because the new one is the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.580
 what people like most but in the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.250
 If Windows seems not so 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.270
 and this is not the first time 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.160
 microsoft juan carlos and remember 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.350
 also happened with the view with the 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.900
 launch of the operating system of 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.120
 view that many people chose to go back to 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.880
 old windows xp operating system 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.460
 this time it is with windows 7 not 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.040
 it had such good acceptance and it seems that 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.440
 many people when they launched the system 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.810
 of windows 8 decided to go back to the system 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.060
 original to windows 7 as one of the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.670
 favorite options and a company 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.710
 hewlett packard is supporting this 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.630
 movement so that people can have 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.580
 the operating system that they want that is 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.830
 a system older than the last 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.380
 version that they launched back to the past and 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.390
 now let's finish with a list we have 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.550
 talked about the oscar awards of the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.399
 Golden balloons this is a list of about 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.590
 prizes of the worst keys used by the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.020
 people to access networks in their 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.630
 company on your personal computer in your 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.880
 phone came out this list again 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.680
 in the USA and keys in English but I think 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.370
 Silvina that this phenomenon should be repeated 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.980
 in English in Spanish in French in Chinese 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.260
 is universal and the carelessness of people to 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.510
 when choosing passwords is a 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.030
 massive phenomenon that has no limits of 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.010
 no culture of countries Juan Carlos Este 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.290
 listing shows the keys the worst 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.690
 keys of the year that people choose to 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.150
 protect your computers your accounts 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.549
 bank your devices and by 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.220
 course also explains why so much 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.319
 hacking so many vulnerabilities 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.810
 happen on the internet between the keys that 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:58.069
 they came out as the worst elected this 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.859
 fourth and 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.390
 abc 1 2 3 and it's amazing but this 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.819
 happens Juan Carlos many of the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.799
 vulnerabilities in the networks 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.260
 social in smartphones 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.720
 it's because people do not take care 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.450
 Enough to protect your devices 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.519
 and your information by choosing passwords 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.200
 smart the study of the test 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.629
 but it sure is not a surprise for 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.430
 a lot of people are not surprised and maybe it's 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.370
 complicated when one has so many 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.700
 remember the keys but 1 2 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.900
 3 4 5 and 6 is not a key that costs 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.850
 a lot of work to decipher 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.430
 thank you silvina silvina 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.930
 and accompanying us from miami live 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.930
