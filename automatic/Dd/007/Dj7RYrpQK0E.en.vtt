00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.850 
well I'm going to help you real quick
there's<00:01:41.850> 39<00:01:42.270> books<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> Old<00:01:43.530> Testament

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
there's 39 books in the Old Testament

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.139 
there's 39 books in the Old Testament
tell<00:01:44.430> your<00:01:44.549> neighbor<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.850> right<00:01:45.090> now<00:01:47.149> now

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
tell your neighbor that right now now

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.620 
tell your neighbor that right now now
that<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.570> significant<00:01:49.350> because<00:01:49.460> 39<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.149> one

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that is significant because 39 is is one

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.510 
that is significant because 39 is is one
is<00:01:51.930> 40<00:01:52.770> minus<00:01:52.950> 1<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:54.119> 39<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.380> short<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:56.040> 40

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
is 40 minus 1 so 39 is just short of 40

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.149 
is 40 minus 1 so 39 is just short of 40
which<00:01:57.299> I'm<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.930> show<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> Bible

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
which I'm going to show you in the Bible

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.030 
which I'm going to show you in the Bible
is<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.460> number<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.000> represents<00:02:01.040> fulfillment

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
is a number that represents fulfillment

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.140 
is a number that represents fulfillment
so<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> Old<00:02:02.880> Testament<00:02:03.630> only<00:02:03.960> has<00:02:04.549> 39

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
so the Old Testament only has 39

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.960 
so the Old Testament only has 39
now<00:02:06.330> is<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.930> coincidence<00:02:07.050> did<00:02:07.950> God<00:02:08.220> on

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
now is that a coincidence did God on

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.360 
now is that a coincidence did God on
purpose

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370
