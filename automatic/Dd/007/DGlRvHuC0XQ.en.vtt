00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.590 
and for the fishtail braid it really you
don't<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.490> some<00:01:26.640> effects<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.420> not

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
don't get this some effects if it's not

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.359 
don't get this some effects if it's not
really<00:01:27.930> long<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> looks<00:01:29.040> really

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
really long like it looks really

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.210 
really long like it looks really
striking<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.810> kind<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.200> cool<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.189> a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
striking but kind of cool if it's like a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.850 
striking but kind of cool if it's like a
really<00:01:32.610> long<00:01:33.030> fishtail<00:01:33.570> braid<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.380> that's<00:01:34.770> why

really long fishtail braid so that's why

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.200 
really long fishtail braid so that's why
we<00:01:34.890> do<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> extension<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.909> I'm<00:01:35.970> gonna<00:01:36.060> go

you would enjoy a video with me so I'm

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.600 
you would enjoy a video with me so I'm
going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.020> go<00:01:46.110> ahead<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.259> get<00:01:46.380> started<00:01:46.610> okay

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
going to go ahead and get started okay

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.399 
going to go ahead and get started okay
so<00:01:47.670> first<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.390> gonna<00:01:48.509> take<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> hair<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
so first I'm gonna take the hair and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.749 
so first I'm gonna take the hair and
then<00:01:49.500> each<00:01:49.619> side<00:01:50.600> click<00:01:51.600> ponytail<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.759> I'm

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
then each side click ponytail and I'm

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.609 
then each side click ponytail and I'm
going<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.939> side<00:01:54.210> ponytail<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.110> because<00:01:55.380> this

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
going to side ponytail it because this

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.499 
going to side ponytail it because this
way<00:01:55.799> they'll<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.939> tad<00:01:57.240> bit

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
way they'll get it just a tad bit

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.319 
way they'll get it just a tad bit
tighter<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.880> more<00:01:59.880> at<00:01:59.939> least<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
tighter as a on more at least with the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.969 
tighter as a on more at least with the
extensions<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> think<00:02:01.469> you're<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.829> going

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
extensions but I think you're just going

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.380 
extensions but I think you're just going
to<00:02:02.040> start<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.520> down<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:03.119> you'll<00:02:03.240> get

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
to start going down because you'll get

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.569 
to start going down because you'll get
like<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:04.500> section<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.040> hair<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.189> won't

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
like a this section of hair that won't

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.600 
like a this section of hair that won't
be<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.590> braid<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.860> like<00:02:08.009> doing<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.399> way

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
be in the braid so I like doing this way

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.740 
be in the braid so I like doing this way
because<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.849> get<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.060> little<00:02:09.330> bit<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.599> a

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
because you get a little bit of a

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.510 
because you get a little bit of a
tighter<00:02:10.020> one<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.800> obviously<00:02:11.190> I'm<00:02:11.310> not<00:02:11.340> going

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
tighter one but obviously I'm not going

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.330 
tighter one but obviously I'm not going
to<00:02:11.580> do<00:02:11.640> it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
to do it

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.309 
to do it
because<00:02:12.519> I<00:02:12.610> want<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:12.879> slightly<00:02:13.150> loose<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.170> they

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
because I want it slightly loose so they

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.750 
because I want it slightly loose so they
don't<00:02:14.500> want<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.709> do<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.129> I'm<00:02:15.250> going<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.489> take<00:02:15.580> it

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
don't want to do is I'm going to take it

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.000 
don't want to do is I'm going to take it
into<00:02:16.090> separate<00:02:17.250> sections<00:02:19.530> make<00:02:20.530> sure<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.860> can

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
into separate sections make sure you can

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.729 
into separate sections make sure you can
get<00:02:21.160> them<00:02:21.310> nice<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.140> separated<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.530> want

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
get them nice and separated you want

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.570 
get them nice and separated you want
them<00:02:23.920> somewhat<00:02:24.340> even<00:02:24.700> as<00:02:24.879> well<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:26.340> then<00:02:27.340> you

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
them somewhat even as well and then you

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.369 
them somewhat even as well and then you
can<00:02:27.760> do<00:02:28.000> either<00:02:28.239> side<00:02:28.599> I'm<00:02:28.930> going<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.200> take

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
can do either side I'm going to take

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.520 
can do either side I'm going to take
about<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:30.299> guess<00:02:31.299> about<00:02:31.569> an<00:02:31.720> inch<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:32.049> hair<00:02:32.260> and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
about I guess about an inch of hair and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.160 
about I guess about an inch of hair and
then<00:02:33.220> you're<00:02:33.310> going<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.459> cross<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:34.000> over<00:02:34.170> like

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
then you're going to cross it over like

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.970 
then you're going to cross it over like
this<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.830> can<00:02:36.640> tuck<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.910> behind<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.830> then<00:02:38.830> you

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
this I can tuck it behind and then you

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.860 
this I can tuck it behind and then you
do<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.220> same<00:02:39.400> for<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.760> other<00:02:39.879> side<00:02:42.269> okay<00:02:43.269> and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
do the same for the other side okay and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.259 
do the same for the other side okay and
you<00:02:43.959> just<00:02:44.080> keep<00:02:44.290> adding<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:45.010> hair<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.940> your

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
you just keep adding that hair to your

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.610 
you just keep adding that hair to your
other<00:02:46.540> section<00:02:47.019> so<00:02:47.260> you're<00:02:47.380> going<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.530> take

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
other section so you're going to take

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.420 
other section so you're going to take
again<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.069> piece<00:02:48.370> from<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.670> other<00:02:48.819> side<00:02:50.430> pull

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
again a piece from the other side pull

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:07.339 
again a piece from the other side pull
it<00:02:51.519> over<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:57.930> keep<00:02:58.930> doing<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.440> as<00:02:59.799> you<00:03:00.220> down

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
basic school so this is roughly how it
