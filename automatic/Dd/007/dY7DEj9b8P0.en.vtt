hello guys this is just an informal

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.220 
hello guys this is just an informal
video<00:00:03.210> on<00:00:03.419> how<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.570> play<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.080> game<00:00:04.290> power<00:00:04.830> grid

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
video on how to play the game power grid

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.140 
video on how to play the game power grid
basically<00:00:07.230> there<00:00:07.440> are<00:00:07.470> four<00:00:07.799> teams<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.370> there

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
basically there are four teams and there

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.870 
basically there are four teams and there
is<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> tower<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.840> center<00:00:10.550> the<00:00:11.550> aim<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
is a tower in the center the aim of the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.640 
is a tower in the center the aim of the
game<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.620> to<00:00:14.210> pump<00:00:15.210> as<00:00:15.420> much<00:00:15.450> power<00:00:15.900> into<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
game is to pump as much power into the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.700 
game is to pump as much power into the
tower<00:00:16.920> which<00:00:17.100> possibly<00:00:17.340> can<00:00:17.750> via<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.170> MF<00:00:19.590> s

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
tower which possibly can via the MF s

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.460 
tower which possibly can via the MF s
you<00:00:19.980> at<00:00:20.520> your<00:00:20.699> best<00:00:20.910> base<00:00:21.240> point<00:00:21.539> each<00:00:22.170> team

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
you at your best base point each team

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.920 
you at your best base point each team
has<00:00:22.650> one<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.920> these<00:00:23.449> you're<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.630> going<00:00:24.810> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
has one of these you're just going to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.509 
has one of these you're just going to
keep<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.230> get<00:00:25.410> as<00:00:25.500> much<00:00:25.619> power<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:25.980> there<00:00:26.099> as

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
keep on get as much power in there as

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.750 
keep on get as much power in there as
you<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.880> by<00:00:27.180> whatever<00:00:27.599> means<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.050> can<00:00:28.230> so

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
you can by whatever means you can so

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.820 
you can by whatever means you can so
generators<00:00:29.760> solar<00:00:30.060> water<00:00:30.929> mills<00:00:31.230> whatever

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
generators solar water mills whatever

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.380 
generators solar water mills whatever
you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:31.980> think<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.399> nuclear<00:00:33.059> power<00:00:33.180> if<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
you can think of nuclear power if you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.270 
you can think of nuclear power if you
want<00:00:35.210> then<00:00:36.210> there<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.980> scoreboard<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
want then there is the scoreboard on the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.240 
want then there is the scoreboard on the
tower<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.140> you're<00:00:40.379> pumping<00:00:40.800> power<00:00:40.980> in

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
tower and so as you're pumping power in

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.630 
tower and so as you're pumping power in
and<00:00:41.540> it's<00:00:42.540> split<00:00:42.899> into<00:00:42.930> three<00:00:43.320> stages<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.040> once

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and it's split into three stages so once

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.250 
and it's split into three stages so once
you're<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> third<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.329> way<00:00:45.629> there<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:46.230> of

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
you're a third of the way there one of

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.470 
you're a third of the way there one of
your<00:00:46.469> lights<00:00:46.649> will<00:00:46.860> come<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.390> two-thirds<00:00:48.390> of

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
your lights will come on two-thirds of

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.779 
your lights will come on two-thirds of
the<00:00:48.570> way<00:00:48.690> under<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.079> light<00:00:49.260> will<00:00:49.410> come<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.789> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
the way under the light will come on and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.810 
the way under the light will come on and
at<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> very<00:00:51.239> end<00:00:51.480> there<00:00:52.289> will<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.469> no<00:00:52.949> warning

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
at the very end there will be no warning

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.610 
at the very end there will be no warning
it'll<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.329> you've<00:00:54.870> won<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> game<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it'll just be you've won the game and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.819 
it'll just be you've won the game and
once<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:57.020> what<00:00:58.020> happens<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
once you have one what happens is the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.799 
once you have one what happens is the
other<00:00:58.980> three<00:00:59.190> teams<00:00:59.430> their<00:01:00.180> bases<00:01:00.539> will

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
other three teams their bases will

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.670 
other three teams their bases will
explode<00:01:01.770> completely<00:01:02.989> annihilating<00:01:03.989> them<00:01:04.140> so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
explode completely annihilating them so

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.800 
explode completely annihilating them so
it's<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.070> race<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.700> finish<00:01:05.790> line<00:01:06.150> first

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
it's a race to the finish line first

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.390 
it's a race to the finish line first
person<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:09.020> as<00:01:10.020> much<00:01:10.680> power<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.040> they<00:01:11.220> can

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
person to get as much power as they can

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.060 
person to get as much power as they can
in<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> tower<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.150> possible<00:01:12.990> there's<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
in to the tower as possible there's a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.219 
in to the tower as possible there's a
point<00:01:15.030> you've<00:01:15.299> got<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.110> then

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
point you've got to get to and then

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.340 
point you've got to get to and then
that's<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:17.250> win<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.750> main<00:01:18.930> aim<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.259> to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that's it you win so the main aim is to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.780 
that's it you win so the main aim is to
get<00:01:19.470> as<00:01:19.560> much<00:01:19.650> power<00:01:19.890> into<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.310> thing<00:01:20.549> as<00:01:20.700> you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
get as much power into this thing as you

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.460 
get as much power into this thing as you
possibly<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.869> fast<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.259> can

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
possibly can and as fast as you can

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.950 
possibly can and as fast as you can
before<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.009> other<00:01:23.100> teams<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.840> just

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
before the other teams do so you just

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.690 
before the other teams do so you just
keep<00:01:25.170> an<00:01:25.320> eye<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> scoreboard<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.520> light

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
keep an eye on the scoreboard if a light

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.100 
keep an eye on the scoreboard if a light
goes<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.090> before<00:01:27.299> yours<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.900> know<00:01:27.990> you're

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
goes on before yours you know you're

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.460 
goes on before yours you know you're
falling<00:01:28.380> behind<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.810> teams<00:01:31.200> are<00:01:31.380> at

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
falling behind and if all teams are at

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.590 
falling behind and if all teams are at
the<00:01:31.590> end<00:01:31.740> then<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.820> might<00:01:32.970> want<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> grow<00:01:33.540> up

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the end then you might want to grow up

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.899 
the end then you might want to grow up
all<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> pumps<00:01:34.229> because<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:35.400> could<00:01:35.549> go<00:01:35.700> boom

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
all the pumps because it could go boom

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.210 
all the pumps because it could go boom
at<00:01:36.090> any<00:01:36.180> moment<00:01:36.560> there's<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> star<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.979> chest

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
at any moment there's a star in chest

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.609 
at any moment there's a star in chest
here<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.610> some<00:01:38.820> basic<00:01:39.270> materials<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.290> so

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
here with some basic materials in so

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.950 
here with some basic materials in so
where<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.369> think<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.939> build<00:01:42.810> from

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
where you can think of to build from

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.660 
where you can think of to build from
that<00:01:43.020> sort<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.380> stuff<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:46.670> that's

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
that sort of stuff and then that's

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.749 
that sort of stuff and then that's
pretty<00:01:48.090> much<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.329> add<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.409> little

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
pretty much it add this is just a little

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.819 
pretty much it add this is just a little
informal<00:01:50.930> chat<00:01:51.930> sort<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.259> describing<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
informal chat sort of describing the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.209 
informal chat sort of describing the
