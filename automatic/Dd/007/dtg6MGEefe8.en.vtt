video is going to show you how to split
your<00:00:13.019> clip<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.590> add<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> transition<00:00:14.880> in

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
between the split clips so you can get a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.960 
between the split clips so you can get a
nice<00:00:18.449> merge<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.230> between<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.279> two<00:00:20.520> parts<00:00:20.910> that

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
nice merge in between the two parts that

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.080 
nice merge in between the two parts that
you<00:00:21.180> want<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.600> select<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:23.100> here<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.820> are<00:00:23.850> back

minute
eight<00:00:56.550> seconds<00:00:56.879> whatever<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.239> end<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.510> doing<00:00:57.980> so

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
eight seconds whatever I end up doing so

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.830 
eight seconds whatever I end up doing so
this<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.460> how<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> do<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.910> there's<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> split

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
this is how you do it there's a split

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.349 
this is how you do it there's a split
clip<00:01:01.289> feature<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.760> go<00:01:02.910> all<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> way

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
clip feature so if you go all the way

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.560 
clip feature so if you go all the way
back<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:03.870> 50<00:01:04.140> seconds<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.090> if<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.299> go

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
back to there 50 seconds and if you go

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.570 
back to there 50 seconds and if you go
to<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.350> tool<00:01:07.590> bar<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.310> square

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
to the tool bar which is the square

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.530 
to the tool bar which is the square
button<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.320> select<00:01:10.320> split<00:01:10.799> clip<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:12.150> will

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
button and select split clip this will

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.620 
button and select split clip this will
pretty<00:01:13.439> much<00:01:13.530> draw<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> line<00:01:14.430> right<00:01:14.970> where<00:01:15.270> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
pretty much draw a line right where you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.289 
pretty much draw a line right where you
where<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.530> want<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.159> it'll<00:01:17.310> cut<00:01:17.610> your

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
where you want it to and it'll cut your

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.130 
where you want it to and it'll cut your
entire<00:01:18.720> content<00:01:19.350> into<00:01:19.799> two<00:01:20.040> pieces<00:01:20.930> but<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
entire content into two pieces but the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.260 
entire content into two pieces but the
the<00:01:22.680> trick<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.790> split<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the trick here is that you can split the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.350 
the trick here is that you can split the
clip<00:01:24.479> again<00:01:25.340> fast<00:01:26.340> forward<00:01:26.820> from<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.119> point

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
clip again fast forward from this point

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.760 
clip again fast forward from this point
on<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.290> point<00:01:28.530> where<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.610> want<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.090> -<00:01:30.770> to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
on to the point where you want to - to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.950 
on to the point where you want to - to
cut<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.060> whole<00:01:33.240> section<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.869> want

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
cut out so that whole section you want

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.660 
cut out so that whole section you want
to<00:01:34.110> cut<00:01:34.790> which<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.000> round<00:01:36.390> about<00:01:37.460> round<00:01:38.460> about

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
to cut which is round about round about

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.539 
to cut which is round about round about
here<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:40.320> hit<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> same<00:01:41.009> button<00:01:41.460> you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
here and you hit the same button you

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.370 
here and you hit the same button you
press<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> X<00:01:42.060> button<00:01:42.390> again<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.810> split<00:01:43.200> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
press the X button again to split that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.800 
press the X button again to split that
clip<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.920> second<00:01:44.310> time<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.820> you'll<00:01:45.479> notice

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
clip the second time and you'll notice

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.649 
clip the second time and you'll notice
as<00:01:46.590> soon<00:01:46.710> as<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.240> confirm

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
into pretty much three pieces that

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.940 
into pretty much three pieces that
middle<00:01:54.270> section<00:01:54.479> there<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.409> part<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.770> we

between the two it's it's all they're
all<00:03:37.239> really<00:03:37.450> cool<00:03:37.570> they<00:03:37.900> all<00:03:38.049> look<00:03:38.200> really

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350

all really cool they all look really
good<00:03:38.560> on<00:03:38.620> screen<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.670> can<00:03:39.820> choose

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
good on screen and you can choose

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.789 
good on screen and you can choose
whatever<00:03:40.359> you<00:03:40.600> like<00:03:40.780> play<00:03:41.079> around<00:03:41.350> remember

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
whatever you like play around remember

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.650 
whatever you like play around remember
you<00:03:41.890> can<00:03:42.040> press<00:03:42.250> r2<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.820> play<00:03:43.120> through<00:03:43.420> each

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
you can press r2 to play through each

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.039 
you can press r2 to play through each
one<00:03:43.959> just<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.410> see<00:03:44.590> what<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:44.859> would<00:03:45.070> look<00:03:45.280> like

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
one just to see what it would look like

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.599 
one just to see what it would look like
but<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.140> one<00:03:47.290> I'm<00:03:47.410> going<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.650> go<00:03:47.739> for<00:03:48.010> is<00:03:48.280> a

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
but the one I'm going to go for is a

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.660 
but the one I'm going to go for is a
pretty<00:03:49.510> simple<00:03:49.989> one<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.350> think<00:03:50.609> personally<00:03:51.609> I

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
pretty simple one I think personally I

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.440 
pretty simple one I think personally I
think<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:52.000> looks<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.420> most<00:03:52.600> clean<00:03:53.880> but<00:03:54.880> it<00:03:55.359> all

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
think it looks the most clean but it all

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.880 
think it looks the most clean but it all
depends<00:03:55.750> on<00:03:55.900> what<00:03:56.019> kind<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.230> video<00:03:56.350> trying<00:03:56.769> to

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
depends on what kind of video trying to

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.289 
depends on what kind of video trying to
make<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:57.190> might<00:03:57.340> be<00:03:57.459> making<00:03:57.609> a<00:03:57.790> montage<00:03:58.150> you

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
make you might be making a montage you

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.759 
make you might be making a montage you
want<00:03:58.450> something<00:03:58.660> more<00:03:58.810> explosive<00:03:59.319> in<00:03:59.440> between

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
want something more explosive in between

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.860 
want something more explosive in between
the<00:03:59.889> two<00:04:00.100> actually<00:04:00.850> we'll<00:04:01.180> come<00:04:01.299> back<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.569> some

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
the two actually we'll come back to some

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.039 
the two actually we'll come back to some
effects<00:04:02.139> later<00:04:02.380> but<00:04:02.650> this<00:04:02.739> one<00:04:02.950> here<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.340> the

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
effects later but this one here the the

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.009 
effects later but this one here the the
crossfade<00:04:05.049> is<00:04:06.269> that's<00:04:07.269> my<00:04:07.540> favorite<00:04:07.900> at<00:04:07.959> the

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
crossfade is that's my favorite at the

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.750 
crossfade is that's my favorite at the
moment<00:04:08.109> I<00:04:08.470> quite<00:04:08.769> like<00:04:08.980> it<00:04:09.160> it's<00:04:09.310> simple

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
moment I quite like it it's simple

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.940 
moment I quite like it it's simple
yet<00:04:11.150> effective<00:04:11.780> so<00:04:12.050> have<00:04:12.260> fun<00:04:12.470> with<00:04:12.530> these

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
yet effective so have fun with these

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.530 
yet effective so have fun with these
transitions<00:04:13.550> there<00:04:13.760> are<00:04:13.909> so<00:04:14.090> many<00:04:14.239> to<00:04:14.420> pick

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
transitions there are so many to pick

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.210 
transitions there are so many to pick
from<00:04:14.599> and<00:04:15.019> they<00:04:15.140> all<00:04:15.319> look<00:04:15.500> good<00:04:15.650> they<00:04:16.100> all

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
from and they all look good they all

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.030 
from and they all look good they all
look<00:04:16.370> great<00:04:16.750> here<00:04:17.750> we<00:04:17.930> just<00:04:18.079> press<00:04:18.320> r2<00:04:18.560> again

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
look great here we just press r2 again

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.140 
look great here we just press r2 again
just<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.370> play<00:04:19.519> through<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.850> clip<00:04:20.030> with

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
just to play through the clip with

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.729 
just to play through the clip with
normal<00:04:20.479> speed<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.750> this<00:04:20.989> shows<00:04:21.169> you<00:04:21.350> exactly

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
normal speed and this shows you exactly

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.620 
normal speed and this shows you exactly
how<00:04:21.979> that<00:04:22.190> transition<00:04:22.550> works<00:04:22.940> fading<00:04:23.510> from

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
how that transition works fading from

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.260 
how that transition works fading from
one<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.199> other<00:04:24.940> personally<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:25.970> think<00:04:26.090> it

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
one to the other personally I think it

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.719 
one to the other personally I think it
