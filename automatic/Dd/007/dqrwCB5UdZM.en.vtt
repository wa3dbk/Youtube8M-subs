up here is not warm to the touch it's
just<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.379> think<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:59.629> protect<00:01:00.800> your<00:01:01.800> eyelid<00:01:02.359> for

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
just I think to protect your eyelid for

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.260 
just I think to protect your eyelid for
when<00:01:03.480> you're<00:01:03.600> getting<00:01:03.719> close<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:05.270> actually

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
when you're getting close to actually

when you're getting close to actually
curl<00:01:06.600> your<00:01:06.810> eyelashes<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.400> there's<00:01:08.850> really

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
curl your eyelashes so there's really

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.020 
curl your eyelashes so there's really
very<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.540> danger<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.520> burning<00:01:11.520> yourself<00:01:11.729> I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
very little danger in burning yourself I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.580 
very little danger in burning yourself I
think<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.510> work<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:12.930> hard<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
think you have to work really hard to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.850 
think you have to work really hard to
burn<00:01:14.430> yourself<00:01:15.229> that's<00:01:16.229> something<00:01:16.740> you're

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
burn yourself that's something you're

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.450 
burn yourself that's something you're
concerned<00:01:17.189> about<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:19.220> flips<00:01:20.220> on

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
concerned about but it just flips on

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.410 
concerned about but it just flips on

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
and come in a little bit closer so that

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.310 
and come in a little bit closer so that
you<00:02:36.310> can<00:02:37.680> see<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.710> process<00:02:40.050> i'm<00:02:41.050> going<00:02:41.230> to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
you can see that process i'm going to

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.410 
you can see that process i'm going to
start<00:02:41.620> off<00:02:41.770> by<00:02:42.130> just<00:02:42.160> taking<00:02:42.580> this<00:02:42.940> i<00:02:43.150> have<00:02:43.270> not

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
start off by just taking this i have not

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.220 
start off by just taking this i have not
applied<00:02:43.690> any<00:02:44.020> mascara<00:02:44.500> yet<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:45.070> just<00:02:47.700> pulling

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
applied any mascara yet and just pulling

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.680 
applied any mascara yet and just pulling
it<00:02:50.230> through<00:02:50.290> my<00:02:50.830> lashes

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.480 

like<00:02:57.290> this

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
like this

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:17.570 
like this
slowly

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:42.470 

so<00:03:18.580> then<00:03:18.790> I'm<00:03:18.970> going<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.390> apply<00:03:20.200> some<00:03:20.800> mascara

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.080 

let<00:03:43.230> sit<00:03:43.530> for<00:03:43.560> like<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.069> minute<00:03:44.370> or<00:03:44.550> so<00:03:44.760> I'm

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
let sit for like a minute or so I'm

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.630 
let sit for like a minute or so I'm
going<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.300> go<00:03:45.540> back<00:03:45.750> in<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.819> curl<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:48.269> lashes

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
going to go back in and curl the lashes

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.850 
going to go back in and curl the lashes
again<00:03:50.640> with<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.569> mascara<00:03:52.019> on<00:03:54.140> so<00:03:55.140> I'm<00:03:55.379> just

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
again with the mascara on so I'm just

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.550 
again with the mascara on so I'm just
running<00:04:00.170> this

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
running this

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:12.670 
running this
through<00:04:03.250> my<00:04:03.430> lashes<00:04:03.700> slowly

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.320 

and<00:04:13.680> then<00:04:13.830> once<00:04:14.040> i'm<00:04:14.280> done<00:04:14.310> with<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.760> i<00:04:15.210> do

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
and then once i'm done with that i do

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.790 
and then once i'm done with that i do
like<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.720> go<00:04:16.020> back<00:04:16.230> and<00:04:18.470> put<00:04:19.470> another<00:04:19.770> coat<00:04:20.160> on

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.800 
like to go back and put another coat on

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.590 
like to go back and put another coat on
so<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:22.830> think<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.250> gives<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.610> lash<00:04:23.790> is<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.060> really

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
so I think it gives the lash is a really

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.640 
so I think it gives the lash is a really
beautiful<00:04:25.130> natural<00:04:26.130> curled<00:04:26.790> look<00:04:27.090> without

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
beautiful natural curled look without

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.260 
beautiful natural curled look without
getting<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:28.800> kind<00:04:28.980> of<00:04:29.100> crimp<00:04:29.460> in<00:04:29.610> there<00:04:29.820> from

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
getting that kind of crimp in there from

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.740 
getting that kind of crimp in there from
a<00:04:31.520> traditional<00:04:32.520> eyelash<00:04:33.030> curler<00:04:33.450> so<00:04:33.660> it

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
a traditional eyelash curler so it

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.040 
a traditional eyelash curler so it
certainly<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:34.320> an<00:04:34.500> option<00:04:34.950> I<00:04:35.840> think<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.900> does<00:04:36.990> a

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
certainly is an option I think it does a

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.760 
certainly is an option I think it does a
beautiful<00:04:37.260> job<00:04:38.210> so<00:04:39.210> this<00:04:39.780> also<00:04:40.050> comes<00:04:40.440> with<00:04:40.620> a

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
beautiful job so this also comes with a

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.700 
beautiful job so this also comes with a
little<00:04:41.010> little<00:04:41.910> brush<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.720> can<00:04:46.110> use<00:04:46.680> to

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
little little brush that you can use to

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.710 
little little brush that you can use to
clean<00:04:47.640> off<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:49.500> wand<00:04:49.740> but<00:04:50.190> I<00:04:50.250> just

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.340 

running<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:55.050> brush<00:04:56.060> through<00:04:57.060> here<00:04:57.480> like<00:04:58.380> that

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
running the brush through here like that

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.410 
running the brush through here like that
and<00:05:01.350> then<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.430> do<00:05:02.580> want<00:05:02.790> to<00:05:02.850> wait<00:05:03.000> until<00:05:03.150> it's

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
and then you do want to wait until it's

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.100 
and then you do want to wait until it's
fully<00:05:03.630> cooled<00:05:03.960> before<00:05:04.440> you<00:05:05.660> put<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:06.780> cap<00:05:07.080> back

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
fully cooled before you put the cap back

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.560 
fully cooled before you put the cap back
on<00:05:07.320> I<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:10.980> it's<00:05:11.130> really<00:05:11.280> portable<00:05:11.760> it

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
on I like it it's really portable it

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.850 
on I like it it's really portable it
adds<00:05:13.140> a<00:05:13.500> sense<00:05:13.920> of<00:05:14.070> glamour<00:05:14.370> to<00:05:14.520> your<00:05:14.700> look<00:05:15.030> and

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.980 
adds a sense of glamour to your look and
it's<00:05:16.860> really<00:05:17.490> pretty<00:05:17.760> easy<00:05:18.090> to<00:05:18.390> use<00:05:18.600> there<00:05:18.870> is

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
it's really pretty easy to use there is

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.470 
it's really pretty easy to use there is
a<00:05:19.020> small<00:05:19.380> learning<00:05:19.590> curve<00:05:20.010> but<00:05:20.340> once<00:05:21.180> you<00:05:21.300> play

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
a small learning curve but once you play

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.970 
a small learning curve but once you play
around<00:05:21.660> with<00:05:21.870> a<00:05:21.900> little<00:05:22.200> bit<00:05:22.320> i<00:05:22.350> think<00:05:22.680> you<00:05:22.770> get
