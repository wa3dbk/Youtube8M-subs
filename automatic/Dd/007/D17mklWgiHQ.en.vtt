00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
been spending a lot of time on using

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.559 
been spending a lot of time on using
keyframes<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:04.580> transitions<00:00:05.580> well<00:00:06.029> what<00:00:06.480> if

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
keyframes and transitions well what if

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.120 
keyframes and transitions well what if
we<00:00:06.690> want<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.899> keep<00:00:07.049> using<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.440> same<00:00:07.680> effects

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
we want to keep using the same effects

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.890 
we want to keep using the same effects
we've<00:00:08.429> already<00:00:08.610> created<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.570> we<00:00:09.660> don't<00:00:09.809> have

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
we've already created so we don't have

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.990 
we've already created so we don't have
to<00:00:10.050> keep<00:00:10.200> adding<00:00:10.710> them<00:00:10.830> over<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.519> over<00:00:11.670> and

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
to keep adding them over and over and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.200 
to keep adding them over and over and
over<00:00:12.179> again<00:00:12.420> with<00:00:12.719> keyframes<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:14.059> in<00:00:15.059> this

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
over again with keyframes so in this

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.560 
over again with keyframes so in this
video<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.929> clip<00:00:16.139> right<00:00:16.170> here<00:00:17.150> we<00:00:18.150> got<00:00:18.270> some

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
video this clip right here we got some

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.519 
video this clip right here we got some
zoom<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:20.130> got<00:00:20.520> some<00:00:21.180> image<00:00:21.900> effects<00:00:22.260> you

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
zoom and we got some image effects you

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.240 
zoom and we got some image effects you
could<00:00:22.740> play

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
could play

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.070 
could play
okay<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:23.640> we're<00:00:23.970> increasing<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.869> saturation

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
okay so we're increasing the saturation

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.060 
okay so we're increasing the saturation
and<00:00:25.920> we're<00:00:26.130> gonna<00:00:26.250> add<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:26.490> eight<00:00:26.849> zoom<00:00:28.070> okay

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
and we're gonna add some eight zoom okay

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.710 
and we're gonna add some eight zoom okay
so<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.340> want<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.550> use<00:00:29.760> these<00:00:29.939> effects<00:00:30.390> for

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
so I want to use these effects for

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720 
so I want to use these effects for
another<00:00:30.929> clip<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.830> don't<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.489> don't

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
another clip so I don't have to I don't

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.310 
another clip so I don't have to I don't
have<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.000> keep<00:00:33.149> adding<00:00:33.390> these<00:00:33.570> keyframes<00:00:33.840> all

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
have to keep adding these keyframes all

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.770 
have to keep adding these keyframes all
over<00:00:34.649> again<00:00:34.829> now<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.579> don't<00:00:36.000> need<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> match

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
over again now you don't need to match

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.440 
over again now you don't need to match
the<00:00:36.809> size<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.950> clips<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.520> length<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.239> this

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
the size of the clips in length so this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.479 
the size of the clips in length so this
video<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:44.090> 14<00:00:45.090> seconds<00:00:45.719> if<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.890> use<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> shorter

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
video is 14 seconds if you use a shorter

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.340 
video is 14 seconds if you use a shorter
clip<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.000> transition<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.570> gonna<00:00:48.750> speed<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
clip the transition is gonna speed up a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
clip the transition is gonna speed up a
lot<00:00:49.500> faster<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.399> use<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> longer<00:00:50.820> clip

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
lot faster and if you use a longer clip

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.939 
lot faster and if you use a longer clip
it's<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.690> gonna<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> lot<00:00:52.199> slower<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
it's just gonna be a lot slower for the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.650 
it's just gonna be a lot slower for the
effects<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.430> perform<00:00:53.879> let<00:00:54.270> me<00:00:54.329> show<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.480> I'm

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
effects to perform let me show what I'm

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.869

gonna do command C if you're on a PC do

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.969 
gonna do command C if you're on a PC do
control<00:01:20.880> C<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.390> I'm<00:01:22.049> gonna<00:01:22.140> paste<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.770> all

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
control C and I'm gonna paste it to all

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.890 
control C and I'm gonna paste it to all
of<00:01:23.460> these<00:01:24.920> video<00:01:25.920> clips<00:01:29.180> command<00:01:30.180> V<00:01:30.360> okay<00:01:30.840> so

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
of these video clips command V okay so

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.870 
of these video clips command V okay so
let's<00:01:31.110> go<00:01:31.229> ahead<00:01:31.259> here's<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> original<00:01:32.700> clip

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
let's go ahead here's the original clip

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.120 
let's go ahead here's the original clip
right<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.780> think<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> effects<00:01:34.500> happen<00:01:34.950> in

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
right here I think the effects happen in

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.710 
right here I think the effects happen in
about<00:01:35.220> 3<00:01:35.640> seconds<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.299> let's<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.689> what

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
about 3 seconds in let's see what

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.640 
about 3 seconds in let's see what
happens<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:38.060> our<00:01:39.060> original<00:01:39.600> 14<00:01:40.110> second<00:01:40.470> clip

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
happens to a our original 14 second clip

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.100 
happens to a our original 14 second clip
our<00:01:41.720> 3<00:01:42.720> second<00:01:43.110> clip<00:01:43.290> 8<00:01:43.560> second<00:01:43.979> clip<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:45.110> 21

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
our 3 second clip 8 second clip and 21

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.910 
our 3 second clip 8 second clip and 21
second<00:01:46.439> clip

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
second clip

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.249 
second clip
so<00:01:47.909> transcriptions<00:01:48.450> kick<00:01:48.630> off<00:01:48.780> right<00:01:49.020> about

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
so transcriptions kick off right about

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.330 
so transcriptions kick off right about
there<00:01:49.470> that's<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:49.920> want<00:01:50.130> high

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
there that's what we want high

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.690 
there that's what we want high
saturation<00:01:50.880> looks<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.540> predator<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.770> for

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
saturation looks like predator and for

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.780 
saturation looks like predator and for
red<00:01:53.880> bump<00:01:54.090> see<00:01:54.240> cat<00:01:55.280> getting<00:01:56.280> ready<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.579> seek

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
red bump see cat getting ready to seek

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.709 
red bump see cat getting ready to seek
and<00:01:56.939> destroy<00:01:58.399> now<00:01:59.399> let's<00:01:59.700> go<00:01:59.909> into<00:02:02.600> sorry<00:02:03.600> this

here's<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.440> three-second<00:02:11.039> clip<00:02:11.220> that's<00:02:11.520> I'm

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
here's a three-second clip that's I'm

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.760 
here's a three-second clip that's I'm
talking<00:02:11.970> about<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:13.170> went<00:02:13.380> from<00:02:13.560> an

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
talking about so we went from an

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.220 
talking about so we went from an
original<00:02:14.090> copying<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.330> 14<00:02:15.690> second<00:02:15.959> clip<00:02:16.110> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
original copying of a 14 second clip to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.140 
original copying of a 14 second clip to
pasting<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.740> three<00:02:17.010> second<00:02:17.370> clip<00:02:17.520> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
pasting on a three second clip the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.940 
pasting on a three second clip the
transition<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.810> speed<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.410> they<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:19.800> get

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
transition just speed up they just get

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.340 
transition just speed up they just get
right<00:02:20.100> into<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:21.480> here's<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.780> longer

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
right into it and now here's a longer

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.830 
right into it and now here's a longer
clip<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.790> transition<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.420> going<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.630> take

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
clip so the transition is going to take

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.230 
clip so the transition is going to take
like<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> second<00:02:25.470> or<00:02:25.560> two<00:02:25.590> longer<00:02:26.130> because<00:02:27.090> this

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
like a second or two longer because this

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.680 
like a second or two longer because this
is<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.560> twenty-one<00:02:28.560> second<00:02:28.920> clip<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
is a twenty-one second clip and the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.360 
is a twenty-one second clip and the
original<00:02:31.110> clip<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:31.530> we<00:02:31.590> copied<00:02:31.950> from<00:02:31.980> was<00:02:32.340> a

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
original clip that we copied from was a

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.610 
original clip that we copied from was a
14<00:02:32.760> second<00:02:33.120> clip<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.540> transitions<00:02:34.530> are

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
14 second clip so the transitions are

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.990 
14 second clip so the transitions are
gonna<00:02:34.709> start<00:02:35.010> about<00:02:35.850> now<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:41.459> there<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.790> and

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000

if you just want to use these clips as a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.110 
if you just want to use these clips as a
template<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.550> don't<00:02:44.670> want<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.850> use<00:02:44.940> the

template say for our last clip we didn't
want<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.650> saturation<00:03:17.130> on<00:03:17.489> full-blast<00:03:17.940> let's

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
want the saturation on full-blast let's

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.050 
want the saturation on full-blast let's
go<00:03:18.840> add<00:03:18.930> another<00:03:19.140> keyframe<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.950> one<00:03:20.160> and

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
go add another keyframe to this one and

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.660 
go add another keyframe to this one and
we'll<00:03:21.330> drop<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.690> down<00:03:21.780> we'll<00:03:22.380> just<00:03:22.590> get<00:03:23.519> it

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
we'll drop it down we'll just get it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.840 
we'll drop it down we'll just get it
somewhat<00:03:24.390> back<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.750> normal<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:26.100> we'll<00:03:26.489> grab

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
somewhat back to normal and we'll grab

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.870 
somewhat back to normal and we'll grab
the<00:03:27.090> saturation<00:03:27.720> just<00:03:27.750> like<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.519> so<00:03:29.519> whether

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
the saturation just like that so whether

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.490 
the saturation just like that so whether
you<00:03:30.030> want<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.239> use<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.450> exact<00:03:30.810> same<00:03:30.900> effects

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
you want to use the exact same effects

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.199 
you want to use the exact same effects
copy<00:03:31.829> paste<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.310> or<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.670> just<00:03:32.700> want<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.090> use

copy paste it or you just want to use

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.729 
copy paste it or you just want to use
the<00:03:33.360> effects<00:03:33.660> as<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> template<00:03:34.290> hopefully<00:03:34.620> this

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
the effects as a template hopefully this

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.350 
the effects as a template hopefully this
video<00:03:34.890> video<00:03:35.459> made<00:03:35.670> sense<00:03:35.910> good<00:03:36.090> luck<00:03:36.209> with
