00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.149
 hello I'm adolf hours from there I want 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.160
 present my book to the end 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.290
 analyzing some situations I gave 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.570
 Sadly, we all start 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.970
 something but very few people end it 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.490
 always renounces many things in the 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.170
 life some totally achievable as 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.690
 the university some kind of business or 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.180
 company but also renounce causes 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.560
 more transcendental more important as 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.380
 for example fight for your marriage 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.930
 family for their dreams projects for the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.579
 work and service to god I think if 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.530
 we abandon this what really 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.800
 we are doing is to give up life 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.530
 same the bible says in juan 1010 the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.149
 thief does not come but to steal kill and 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.329
 destroy I have come for you to have 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.160
 life and to have it in abundance 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.829
 here Christ warns us that satan 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.950
 Vienna stripping everything to kill everything 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.890
 and destroy what is left look like the 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.809
 enemy was subtly stripping us 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.610
 of our very lives putting 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.189
 obstacles in them situations 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.810
 problems that forced us between 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.210
 quotes to abandon what 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.150
 we longed for and for which we were born 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.159
 was stealing our hope by killing 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.610
 our dreams and destroying the 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.650
 God's purpose in our lives 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.900
 Jesus Christ came denounce of that evil 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.570
 plan and do the opposite of nothing 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.369
 ask us for abundant life not only in the 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.649
 heaven but also to live it here in 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.450
 the earth this book was born with the 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.729
 intention to give you the keys and the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.409
 I encourage you to help and encourage 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.110
 achieve what God put in your heart 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.750
 to continue despite the difficulties 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.240
 and get to the end of any 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.670
 challenge that is present the bible says 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.280
 that he is with us every day 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.310
 until the end of the world so no 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.080
 we fear we are not alone in this that God 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.289
 bless you and enjoy this 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.289
 material
