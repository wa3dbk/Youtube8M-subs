looks like from the side and I can't
really<00:05:37.030> do<00:05:37.240> back<00:05:37.420> because<00:05:37.690> that's<00:05:37.810> kind<00:05:38.020> of

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
really do back because that's kind of

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.760 
now
but<00:05:40.240> I<00:05:40.270> have<00:05:40.570> a<00:05:40.630> feeling<00:05:40.840> that<00:05:41.200> I'm<00:05:41.380> going<00:05:41.650> to

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
but I have a feeling that I'm going to

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.500 
but I have a feeling that I'm going to
have<00:05:41.950> to<00:05:42.100> invest<00:05:42.460> in<00:05:42.700> a<00:05:42.790> straightener<00:05:43.330> now

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
have to invest in a straightener now

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.810 
have to invest in a straightener now
because<00:05:44.350> I<00:05:44.650> don't<00:05:44.710> have<00:05:45.130> one<00:05:45.190> currently

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
because I don't have one currently

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.130 
because I don't have one currently
because<00:05:46.270> I<00:05:46.390> just<00:05:46.570> never<00:05:46.690> straightened<00:05:47.080> my

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
because I just never straightened my

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.630 
because I just never straightened my
hair<00:05:47.170> and<00:05:47.620> now<00:05:47.890> I<00:05:47.920> think<00:05:48.220> I'm<00:05:48.310> going<00:05:48.460> to<00:05:48.550> have
