00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello everyone here the new video that is 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.529
 the continuation of the previous mutants 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.790
 and the anti ai 3 if you do not know 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.790
 because I'm on the other screen 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.369
 I'm already a fight from the token reactor and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.369
 what I'm going to do is this video 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.670
 of this fight and the five runs and 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.260
 then I go up next day or the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.590
 next hour I do not know when 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.000
 of those who remain of the event an event 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.220
 event of the moon 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.920
 and nothing come let's start now with this 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.810
 fight green and red elements predominate 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.860
 and then there is or look for your asshole that 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.210
 There are some works, there are leftovers, green and red 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.379
 putting up 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:53.360
 putting zoomorphic beast or brown this 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:55.820
 be here and another element let's go and 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.620
 another element that is mythical better the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.920
 you ruin the ruin but everything 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.670
 if you put I do not know to see if I have any 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.799
 that is beast and mythical I think not 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.840
 but well, some beast other 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.580
 mythical for example 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.250
 I'm going to cure him 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.550
 I have enough cures now of 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550
 cali 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.229
 Mermaid is not recommended to put it now 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.470
 I 'm not going to put it, I'm going to put another 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.060
 because if it is galactic it is that it 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.090
 they give with two green ones although probably 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.009
 he will kill these two before but he does not give 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.860
 I do not risk myself, I do not want to 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.549
 die nobody but never tempisque too 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.549
 I have left over that I have two 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.399
 and well let's go there then horus of 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.939
 first I will not kill him in one fell swoop 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.750
 I think I think not because a thousand of 8,900 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.330
 novelty to kill them with shapes 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.790
 I did not say I have mutants at level 31 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.170
 I did not say I did not say it I forgot I did not say it 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.660
 no previous video I say an extension 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.770
 suddenly 2 on the 31st because one 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.810
 30 percent offer 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.609
 to upload the one that is always with 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.060
 many 20 I already knew that some 30 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:13.310
 said they would raise it'll wait could 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.090
 have saved 404 million but 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.519
 I prefer to wait for 30 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.530
 and nothing we are going to kill here bugs do not know 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.730
 I do not care which 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.629
 does not attack horus I also do not care 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.629
 I will kill 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.580
 by the spot because with one attack more than 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.430
 combat killed this one so I do not care 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.150
 as well 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.150
 OK 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.300
 captures peas the bust logically 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.070
 because it 's slow 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.110
 and it does not show much difference with the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.300
 mutants the 31 good and in the pvp 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.910
 in the pvp yes I noticed some difference 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.350
 because I win enough now shit me 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.010
 they have just attacked 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.490
 they just attacked me 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.900
 who does not 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.550
 Gonzalo Gonzales the less methods 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.550
 gonzÃ¡lez los no menos 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.890
 good good, good, I have the reactor 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.890
 token I think 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.680
 If I already have 5 here I could wait 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.560
 one more and make chuck of mister 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.050
 marvelous but no no I do not want 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.150
 because surely you bring me some 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.760
 repeated and lose three more and good 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.190
 here if they touch me repeated I lose 13 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.710
 least 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.870

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.580

 I have another chance because it touches me and 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.840
 I was just a shot all right well there 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.509

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.280
 if I get the fucking alien is already worth 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:25.759

 to touch the first 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.870
 what I say is that surely you have 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.370
 more opportunities to have these 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.050

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:47.319
