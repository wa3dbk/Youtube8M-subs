 we cooked with silicone 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.250
 forms by adding a transparent soap base 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.230
 red pigment applicant 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.850

 we will fill this composition 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.680
 transparent soap base in order 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.680
 so that our hearts are supposed to be 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.770
 recessed inside but in order for our 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.300
 the pigment has not gone beyond the boundaries of hearts and we 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.810
 on the basis of spread 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.440
 we should put this blank 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.190
 for about 15-20 minutes in the fridge and so we 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.070
 Once again 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.040
 melted our soap base add 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.680

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.760
 stir thoroughly and quickly 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.520
 fill our stock and so our soap 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.470
 froze we got it out of shape and here 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.720
 what have we got in the end and 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.180
