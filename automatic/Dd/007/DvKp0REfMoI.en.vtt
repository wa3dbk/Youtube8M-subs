00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.130
 tutorial today let's see how to delete the 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:14.519
 his visits to our photos of monuments 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:17.250
 or of tourism how many times it has happened to us 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.660
 in short, to go on vacation and have to 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.490
 photographing a certain type of emolument 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.410
 but this is always very crowded 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.090
 there are always tourists who walk 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.970
 in front behind left right in short 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.279
 there is no way to take one 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.489
 photograph with zero tourists in front of that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.649
 in short, he manages to capture the best 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.329
 way of the monument that interests us 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.489
 today I show you how to solve 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.480
 this problem in particular before 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.190
 to start 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.510
 I invite you to subscribe to the channel as well as a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.640
 like the facebook page 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.770
 manuel ebrille photoshop is a photographer 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.559
 to stay up to date on videos 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.660
 and career to do this kind of 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.320
 tutorial there would obviously be photoshop 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.739
 but also a good shooting phase ie 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.670
 we need a tripod and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.550
 lots of patience 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.989
 in particular I show you things 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.769
 I managed to do with two simple 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.450
 photos 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.760
 this is a fountain of vienna e 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.380
 basically to take a picture 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.000
 with few tourists ahead in the result 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.130
 very difficult I had to wait 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.210
 about 15 20 minutes 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.350
 in particular we see how in this 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.750
 first photo of tourists a 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.460
 right as well as tourists left in 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.700
 this other second picture instead the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.439
 left and right area of ​​the fountain 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.630
 they are empty while they are there 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.860
 the tourists the center thanks to the help 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.520
 of the maximum levels we will solve 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.890
 this problem 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.140
 in particular it will be enough to load our own 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.000
 file rouge photoshop will open room 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.009
 raw and we'll make the changes on a single one 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.620
 photograph then we will modify 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.960
 contrast display 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.300
 the colors as I did in this photo e 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.390
 that is, the sky will suffice later 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.490
 select the select all button 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.660
 then syncs and changes made 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.370
 to the first photo that will be 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.260
 synchronized to all photos 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.410
 select on the left side of 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.240
 cameron in our case we are all ok and 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.360
 all options will be synchronized 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.420
 they come out so we could include 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.270
 exclude some changes done this 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.170
 we open the images and from camera roma in 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.910
 photoshop 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.580
 in particular in this type of 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.830
 process photoshop will open our two 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.990
 photos processed in raw camera on two 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.690
 different documents so we will have to 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.570
 take these two documents align them 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.790
 in a single then working on this e 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.590
 lime to eliminate tourists 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.410
 so in this case photoshop opened 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.140
 the first the first document with the first 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.730
 image and now the second is opening 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.100
 document with the second image that 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.380
 we're going to realign with the first 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.180
 document 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.650
 ok we tend a moment and we have the 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.110
 our only photo so let's take it 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.150
 tool move or award key v 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.970
 from the keyboard 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.970
 we carry this second photo on 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.980
 first and let's go to true see the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.530
 two photos this way thanks to 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.810
 photoshop cc last generation in short 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.700
 we also see the help of the lines 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.590
 guide these fucsia centers 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.209
 align the photos we can close 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.500
 this level and we don't need it anymore 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.890
 we find with a document with two 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.860
 for simplicity we call 1 the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.020
 first level and 2 the second level 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.110
 mind you this kind of change can 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.540
 be done with 5 6 7 10 15 photos not 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.110
 in short, how many photos matter 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.519
 at this point we see that anyway 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.709
 we need to see the two align 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.359
 photographs because despite him used 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.760
 a tripod though maybe some 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.739
 gusts of wind or mine 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.109
 carelessness led to take two 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.659
 photographs see with alignments 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.109
 different then we select both 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.049
 levels 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.150
 that way if you do n't know how to do it 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.650
 just select level 2 by holding 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.480
 press the shift key to go to the level 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.450
 1 and see them select both 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.519
 let's go on alignment modification 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.650
 automatic levels opened 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.040
 windows will be enough to leave the check on 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.620
 automatic give ok and the levels will come 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.930
 automatically aligned by photoshop 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.519
 there is the possibility that when we do 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.470
 this level alignment comes 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.660
 lost information in the areas of 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.599
 photography as precisely in this case 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.360
 if we go to zoom we see that in the 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:24.310
 top has been lost job 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.830
 information however already problems 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.349
 take the cutter tool 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.639
 cut out this picture and there are none 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.080
 no kind of there are not some 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.810
 problems 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.340
 ok done this we simply have to 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.599
 work with layer masks 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.820
 meanwhile we see that the levels are 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.970
 aligned there is no longer that slope 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.990
 between the first fountain is that of now 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.820
 take the brush so let's go here 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.229
 on the tool on the toolbar 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.120
 tools we take the brush and the 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.070
 black in the foreground 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.990
 let's go to work on level 2 creating 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.210
 a layer mask and we have to 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.449
 simply eliminate these tourists 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.830
 which are in the middle then with the 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.190
 black in the foreground 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.960
 let's go to brush and see that i 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.650
 tourists have disappeared from the fountain 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.449
 turns out to be basically vote if 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.270
 instead I use black in the part 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.849
 right you see that they come to introduce themselves 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.780
 the tourists who are immortalized in the 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.770
 photo below then we take the white and 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.539
 let's make these tourists disappear 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.490
 here is also explained the concept of 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.430
 layer masks the black does 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.259
 disappear what we have 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.289
 substantially colored 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.330
 sorry black makes disappear what 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.190
 we have coloring in level 2 and then 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.889
 make the level appear 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.599
 1 of white will make it appear what it is 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.560
 of level 2 hiding the one of the 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:46.789
 Of their 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.669
 just a little practice then take us 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.860
 the man quietly ok we see in the 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.539
 part behind if we can also eliminate 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.569
 the tourists and the back part we take the 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.440
 black always 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.759
 let's start working with ours 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.069
 mask level in particular these 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:06.229
 we also diminish these tourists 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:08.900
 we remove and still see in the part 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:12.229
 right which we remove but one remains 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.110
 girl or the pink shirt and we take off 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.490
 also these tourists on the right side 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.990
 in particular he didn't pick me up 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.360
 we lost it too 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.469
 here making it automatic alignment 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.440
 of the levels so let's go to cut out 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:28.909
 the picture in this way these two 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.979
 tourists who remained that is the girl 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.750
 with the pink shirt as well as the ladies 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.849
 on the left they can be eliminated with lo 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.380
 tool a clone stamp given people 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:40.460
 small accounts then create a new one 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:42.349
 level above all we press the s key 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.270
 from the keyboard or select the 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:49.250
 clone stamp and let's go to sample one 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:53.569
 area and to brush the part 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:55.849
 superior to eliminate the tourists who 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.180
 turned out to be immortalized in the 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:59.090
 photo 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.569
 in this way remember to 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:05.889
 select in high league at 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:08.080
 below or all the same 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:13.560
 let's do in the left side of the 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.560
 our photo with these tourists 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.120
 in this way very simply and 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.120
 quickly 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.510
 here it is 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.390
 et voila 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:34.760
 obviously try to be more precise 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.760
 of me that I was very fast and 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.750
 educational in short ok 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:47.700
 that way if the tablet is me 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.320
 allows here perfect 

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.030
 the industrial ends here thanks for 

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.440
