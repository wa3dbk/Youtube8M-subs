00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.170
 the contest is composed of six semesters 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.380
 in then the student has three years 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.320
 paid in at 1340 hours 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.980
 of these he has 150 hours in activities 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.020
 complementary courses and 180 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.859
 hours in complementary subjects of 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.330
 this graduation so he can is 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.119
 complement his training with something 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.460
 that is of interest to him and that comes to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.500
 also meeting what is developed 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.090
 in course activities 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.239
 what are the areas of activity 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.370
 professional our return he will 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.190
 work in network administration 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.410
 infrastructure management the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.539
 design of computer networks to 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.180
 data center management 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.670
 finally item has a very wide range and 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.530
 of options in the market, which is the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.360
 expected profile of the academics of the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.390
 course 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.280
 the good has to be someone who likes 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.100
 Exact area is not this will include 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.860
 mathematics and physics is because we have 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:15.360
 in not so directly but we have a 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:18.210
 a deformity load of activities 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.700
 involving logical reasoning equations 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.460
 anyway this has to be something that the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.439
 student can develop with with some 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.689
 Tranquility of course it's going to have 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.259
 a basis here to develop this more 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.240
 It's good that he comes with a certain one 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.710
 a certain amount of knowledge in these 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.970
 areas 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.100
 which are the main 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.409
 changes that occurred in structuring 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.189
 the course since implementation so far 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.500
 it's good or we do not have any change 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.600
 in the pedagogical structure of the course because 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.619
 We had the first graduation now. 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.540
 in July is then at that time that 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.850
 right now we are studying a 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.560
 curricular restructuring but we 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.229
 we have had a significant change in 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.049
 to the physical structure, we started the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.780
 activities there in the building of skepticism 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.770
 where you hear them staggering 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.940
 classrooms so we could 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.980
 put our students studying there 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.019
 while this building is built 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.569
 the building was built to house the 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.310
 meetings are allocated to the 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.420
 skepticism that there are courses in networks 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.739
 computers and manufacturing courses 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.720
 mechanics 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.459
 then the great change even though we 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.440
 we have as to the physical structure that 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.670
 provided us with a laboratory of 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.110
 electronics we'll see later 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.180
 has a network laboratory of 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.940
 computers and two more laboratories 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.370
 with computers even though it's where the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.799
 develop activities that do not 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.500
 do not need equipment 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.209
 specific to the area and today 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.970
 job market where people 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.510
 can find these professionals 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.060
 Good, our return, he must get 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.769
 placement by administering networks 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.920
 managing computer networks 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:04.799
 evaluating our profile is regional here 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.329
 we would have medium-sized companies that already have 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.420
 a demand for this kind of 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.489
 professional and if we go a little 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.680
 further on we have the Southern Caxias line 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.629
 porto alegre florianópolis and são paulo 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.389
 which are major markets in the area of 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:22.139
 that we have big companies that 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:24.180
 they need a lot of professionals 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.669
 qualified to work in the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.459
 communication infrastructure then this 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.650
 and it is indispensable nowadays there is someone 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.200
 able to work from 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.639
 appropriate manner both the questions of the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.510
 communication on the issues of 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:43.790
 security that is is basically so are 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.790
 focus of our course
