00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.670 
Google BMR calculator you can obviously
do<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> equation<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.300> yourself<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:33.930> since

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
do the equation of yourself but since

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
do the equation of yourself but since
everyone<00:00:35.160> has<00:00:35.309> internet<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.870> easy

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
everyone has internet now this is easy

everyone has internet now this is easy
but<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.950> BMR<00:00:38.280> calculator<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:40.079> you're

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
but a BMR calculator and what you're

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.799 
but a BMR calculator and what you're
going<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.579> put<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.059> 5<00:00:42.420> 11

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
going to do is you can see I put in 5 11

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.440 
going to do is you can see I put in 5 11
and<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> half<00:00:42.989> which<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.500> my<00:00:43.620> height<00:00:44.300> 213<00:00:45.300> which

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and a half which is my height 213 which

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.889 
and a half which is my height 213 which
is<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.690> weight<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.559> 23<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.300> calculated

alright<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.470> you're<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.890> put<00:01:17.070> activity

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
alright so you're going to put activity

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.969 
alright so you're going to put activity
factor<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:22.670> Harris<00:01:23.670> phonetic<00:01:24.090> equation

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
factor in and Harris phonetic equation

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.200 
factor in and Harris phonetic equation
so<00:01:25.979> we're<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.400> basically<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.970> this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
so we're going to do basically is this

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.420 
so we're going to do basically is this
is<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.530> activity<00:01:28.530> factor<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.009> multiply

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
is a activity factor that you multiply

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.490 
is a activity factor that you multiply
your<00:01:29.490> BMR<00:01:29.909> by<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.360> get<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.960> daily

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
your BMR by to get your daily

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.830 
your BMR by to get your daily
maintenance<00:01:32.009> calories<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.420> extra

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
maintenance calories so it's extra

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.330 
maintenance calories so it's extra
active<00:01:34.140> very<00:01:34.320> active<00:01:34.590> moderately<00:01:35.159> active

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
going to take 3700 i need to multiply it

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.090 
going to take 3700 i need to multiply it
by<00:03:17.070> point<00:03:17.700> for<00:03:18.060> forty<00:03:18.840> percent<00:03:19.110> that's<00:03:19.800> going

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
by point for forty percent that's going

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.550 
by point for forty percent that's going
to<00:03:20.160> give<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.310> 40<00:03:20.820> e<00:03:21.230> 1480<00:03:27.140> please<00:03:28.140> excuse<00:03:28.440> my

to give you 40 e 1480 please excuse my
handwriting<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:30.470> 1480<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.650> forty<00:03:31.950> percent

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
handwriting and so 1480 is forty percent

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.150 
handwriting and so 1480 is forty percent
protein<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.390> carbs<00:03:33.840> both<00:03:34.140> have<00:03:34.440> four

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
protein and carbs both have four

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.610 
protein and carbs both have four
calories<00:03:35.489> per<00:03:36.090> per<00:03:36.660> gram<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.380> you're<00:03:37.470> going<00:03:37.560> to

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
calories per per gram so you're going to

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.600 
calories per per gram so you're going to
do<00:03:37.739> is<00:03:37.830> you're<00:03:37.890> going<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.100> divide<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.550> by

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
do is you're going to divide this by

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.340 
do is you're going to divide this by
four<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:41.130> cut<00:03:41.310> off<00:03:41.600> cut<00:03:42.600> off<00:03:42.750> cus<00:03:42.989> almost

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
four and the cut off cut off cus almost

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.410 
four and the cut off cut off cus almost
calling<00:03:43.560> me<00:03:43.739> this<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.280> fourteen<00:03:45.120> eighty

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
calling me this is a fourteen eighty

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.080 
calling me this is a fourteen eighty
divided<00:03:46.260> by<00:03:46.440> 4<00:03:46.910> which<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.000> going<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.180> give<00:03:48.239> you

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
divided by 4 which is going to give you

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.440 
divided by 4 which is going to give you
370<00:03:51.090> grams<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:52.850> know<00:03:53.850> this<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.360> high<00:03:55.100> 370<00:03:56.100> grams

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
370 grams I know this is high 370 grams

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.100 
370 grams I know this is high 370 grams
so<00:03:57.450> literally<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.930> have<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.560> take<00:03:59.400> in<00:04:00.080> 370<00:04:01.080> grams

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
so literally I have to take in 370 grams

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.290 
so literally I have to take in 370 grams
of<00:04:01.470> protein<00:04:01.730> 370<00:04:02.730> grams<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:03.120> carbs<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:05.300> the

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
of protein 370 grams of carbs and the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.050 
of protein 370 grams of carbs and the
difference<00:04:06.780> which<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:08.250> can<00:04:08.430> find<00:04:08.459> pretty

difference which you can find pretty

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.600 
difference which you can find pretty
easily<00:04:09.269> which<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.900> 3700<00:04:10.850> times<00:04:11.850> point<00:04:12.330> to<00:04:13.610> 740

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
easily which is 3700 times point to 740

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.199 
easily which is 3700 times point to 740
and<00:04:14.730> your<00:04:15.030> /<00:04:15.630> 9<00:04:16.200> because<00:04:16.560> 9<00:04:16.979> calories<00:04:17.310> per<00:04:17.940> gram

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
and your / 9 because 9 calories per gram

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.060 
and your / 9 because 9 calories per gram
of<00:04:18.690> fat<00:04:19.080> that's<00:04:19.859> 82<00:04:20.400> grams<00:04:20.729> of<00:04:21.180> fat

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.680 

so<00:04:25.070> 37<00:04:25.760> me<00:04:26.560> so<00:04:27.560> this<00:04:27.680> is<00:04:27.710> protein<00:04:28.250> carbs<00:04:28.850> in<00:04:29.060> fat

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
so 37 me so this is protein carbs in fat

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.930 
so 37 me so this is protein carbs in fat

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.970 
so there is your macros guys for
maintenance<00:04:32.350> for<00:04:33.350> maintenance<00:04:33.590> for

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
maintenance for maintenance for

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.030 
maintenance for maintenance for
maintaining<00:04:34.370> that's<00:04:34.910> what<00:04:35.150> you<00:04:35.270> need<00:04:35.860> for<00:04:36.860> me

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
maintaining that's what you need for me

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.390 
maintaining that's what you need for me
and<00:04:37.280> that's<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.820> rough<00:04:38.780> estimate<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:40.190> most

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
and that's a rough estimate the most

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.730 
and that's a rough estimate the most
important<00:04:40.790> part<00:04:40.970> of<00:04:41.030> this<00:04:41.120> whole<00:04:41.270> spiel<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:41.870> a

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
important part of this whole spiel is a

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.080 
important part of this whole spiel is a
lot<00:04:42.920> of<00:04:42.980> people<00:04:43.160> calculate<00:04:43.340> their<00:04:43.730> macros<00:04:44.060> and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
lot of people calculate their macros and

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.880 
lot of people calculate their macros and
think<00:04:44.390> it's<00:04:44.510> like<00:04:44.600> an<00:04:44.720> absolute<00:04:45.050> science<00:04:45.680> and

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
think it's like an absolute science and

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.400 
think it's like an absolute science and
then<00:04:45.980> that's<00:04:46.280> that's<00:04:47.030> what<00:04:47.270> it<00:04:47.360> is<00:04:47.390> what<00:04:48.200> I<00:04:48.230> do

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
then that's that's what it is what I do

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.000 
then that's that's what it is what I do
is<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.710> weigh<00:04:48.860> myself<00:04:49.010> once<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.730> week<00:04:49.910> and<00:04:50.620> if<00:04:51.620> I'm

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
is I weigh myself once a week and if I'm

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.950 
is I weigh myself once a week and if I'm
trying<00:04:52.370> to<00:04:52.460> bulk<00:04:52.700> for<00:04:53.030> example<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:53.660> add

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
trying to bulk for example I add

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.290 
trying to bulk for example I add
calories<00:04:54.350> to<00:04:54.770> this<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.220> I<00:04:55.370> do<00:04:55.430> this<00:04:55.670> equation

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
calories to this and I do this equation

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.540 
calories to this and I do this equation
all<00:04:56.420> over<00:04:56.720> again<00:04:56.960> like<00:04:57.620> if<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:58.160> just<00:04:58.310> want<00:04:58.490> to

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
all over again like if you just want to

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.950 
all over again like if you just want to
maintain<00:04:58.670> this<00:04:59.030> is<00:04:59.150> what<00:04:59.300> you<00:04:59.390> do<00:04:59.570> but<00:04:59.810> if<00:04:59.870> you

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
maintain this is what you do but if you

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.990 
maintain this is what you do but if you
want<00:05:00.140> bulk<00:05:00.410> at<00:05:00.590> 200<00:05:01.280> calories<00:05:01.610> if<00:05:01.700> you<00:05:01.790> want<00:05:01.940> to

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
want bulk at 200 calories if you want to

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.390 
want bulk at 200 calories if you want to
do<00:05:02.060> a<00:05:02.090> slow<00:05:02.360> boat<00:05:02.570> in<00:05:02.840> and<00:05:03.740> what<00:05:03.920> you<00:05:04.040> do<00:05:04.190> is<00:05:04.220> you

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
do a slow boat in and what you do is you

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.250 
do a slow boat in and what you do is you
add<00:05:04.520> 200<00:05:04.910> calories<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:05.390> do<00:05:05.540> this<00:05:05.690> equation

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
add 200 calories you do this equation

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.110 
add 200 calories you do this equation
again<00:05:06.380> now<00:05:06.740> you<00:05:06.800> get<00:05:07.040> your<00:05:07.190> bulking<00:05:07.700> macros

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
again now you get your bulking macros

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.740 
again now you get your bulking macros
then<00:05:08.990> you<00:05:09.940> don't<00:05:10.940> weigh<00:05:11.030> yourself<00:05:11.120> every<00:05:11.570> week

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
then you don't weigh yourself every week

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.340 
then you don't weigh yourself every week
and<00:05:11.990> then<00:05:12.740> if<00:05:12.920> you<00:05:13.040> haven't<00:05:13.430> gained<00:05:13.700> a<00:05:14.030> pound

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
and then if you haven't gained a pound

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.710 
and then if you haven't gained a pound
within<00:05:15.350> two<00:05:15.560> weeks<00:05:16.000> then<00:05:17.000> you<00:05:17.240> need<00:05:17.450> to

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
within two weeks then you need to

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.170 
within two weeks then you need to
increase<00:05:18.200> your<00:05:18.980> map<00:05:19.580> you<00:05:19.790> need<00:05:19.940> to<00:05:20.030> increase

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
increase your map you need to increase

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.380 
increase your map you need to increase
your<00:05:20.360> calories<00:05:20.870> because<00:05:21.680> obviously<00:05:22.370> what<00:05:23.180> the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
your calories because obviously what the

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.790 
your calories because obviously what the
equation<00:05:23.810> has<00:05:23.900> done<00:05:24.140> is<00:05:24.290> not<00:05:24.410> an<00:05:24.530> exact

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
equation has done is not an exact

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.390 
equation has done is not an exact
science<00:05:24.830> you<00:05:25.490> haven't<00:05:26.390> hit<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:28.250> have<00:05:28.370> a

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
science you haven't hit you have a

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.900 
science you haven't hit you have a
targeted<00:05:28.940> your<00:05:29.060> macros<00:05:29.330> correctly<00:05:30.730> which<00:05:31.730> is

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
targeted your macros correctly which is

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.940 
targeted your macros correctly which is
fine<00:05:32.090> this<00:05:32.300> is<00:05:32.480> a<00:05:32.510> game<00:05:32.780> of<00:05:32.810> finding<00:05:33.350> out<00:05:33.410> what

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
fine this is a game of finding out what

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.580 
fine this is a game of finding out what
you<00:05:34.220> need<00:05:34.490> same<00:05:35.210> thing<00:05:35.390> with<00:05:35.480> cutting<00:05:35.840> you<00:05:36.260> cut

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
you need same thing with cutting you cut

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.620 
you need same thing with cutting you cut
200<00:05:37.100> calories<00:05:37.400> from<00:05:37.490> your<00:05:37.670> maintenance<00:05:37.880> you

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
200 calories from your maintenance you

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.990 
200 calories from your maintenance you
give<00:05:38.780> it<00:05:38.870> two<00:05:38.990> weeks<00:05:39.020> and<00:05:39.500> I'll<00:05:40.010> give<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.700> I'll

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
give it two weeks and I'll give you I'll

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.240 
give it two weeks and I'll give you I'll
give<00:05:41.060> you<00:05:41.240> this<00:05:41.390> right<00:05:41.690> off<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:41.960> bat<00:05:42.250> bulking

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
give you this right off the bat bulking

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.010 
give you this right off the bat bulking
or<00:05:43.280> cutting<00:05:43.400> the<00:05:43.700> first<00:05:44.150> two<00:05:44.600> weeks<00:05:44.630> you're

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
right off the bat it's just how it works

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.150 
right off the bat it's just how it works
water<00:05:50.570> weight<00:05:50.810> and<00:05:51.170> obviously<00:05:51.680> change<00:05:52.010> and

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
water weight and obviously change and

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.940 
water weight and obviously change and
dieting<00:05:52.550> and<00:05:52.700> macros<00:05:53.270> like<00:05:53.630> so<00:05:54.020> I<00:05:54.290> would<00:05:54.770> give

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
dieting and macros like so I would give

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.970 
dieting and macros like so I would give
the<00:05:55.070> first<00:05:55.280> two<00:05:55.520> weeks<00:05:55.810> I<00:05:56.810> just<00:05:57.650> don't<00:05:57.800> I<00:05:57.950> just

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
the first two weeks I just don't I just

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.110 
the first two weeks I just don't I just
don't<00:05:58.160> pay<00:05:58.370> attention<00:05:58.460> to<00:05:58.760> him<00:05:58.910> because

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
don't pay attention to him because

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.420 
don't pay attention to him because
that's<00:05:59.240> a<00:05:59.710> generally<00:06:00.710> that<00:06:00.890> that<00:06:01.130> throws

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
that's a generally that that throws

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.330 
that's a generally that that throws
that's<00:06:02.060> just<00:06:02.330> thrown<00:06:02.510> off<00:06:02.660> it's<00:06:02.900> a<00:06:03.050> spikes<00:06:03.650> so

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
that's just thrown off it's a spikes so

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.630 
that's just thrown off it's a spikes so
from<00:06:05.180> there<00:06:05.450> cutting<00:06:06.350> or<00:06:06.530> bulking<00:06:07.070> you<00:06:07.370> look

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
from there cutting or bulking you look

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.400 
from there cutting or bulking you look
at<00:06:07.730> your<00:06:07.850> way<00:06:08.000> if<00:06:08.270> it<00:06:08.420> has<00:06:08.600> isn't<00:06:09.020> going<00:06:09.230> down<00:06:09.260> a

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
at your way if it has isn't going down a

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.520 
at your way if it has isn't going down a
pound<00:06:09.770> or<00:06:10.070> two<00:06:10.490> pounds<00:06:11.090> but<00:06:11.390> don't<00:06:11.660> if<00:06:12.320> it's

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
pound or two pounds but don't if it's

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.050 
pound or two pounds but don't if it's
too<00:06:12.650> crazy<00:06:12.890> then<00:06:13.250> you<00:06:13.310> have<00:06:13.430> to<00:06:13.520> back<00:06:13.700> off<00:06:13.730> on

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
too crazy then you have to back off on

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.820 
too crazy then you have to back off on
your<00:06:14.150> calories<00:06:14.570> or<00:06:14.780> add<00:06:15.080> a<00:06:15.470> little<00:06:15.680> more

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
your calories or add a little more

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.110 
your calories or add a little more
calories<00:06:16.220> depending<00:06:16.400> on<00:06:16.670> what<00:06:16.790> you're<00:06:16.880> doing

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
calories depending on what you're doing
