00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
see this giant influx and just better

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
blocks so secret to clear ice is

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.000 
blocks so secret to clear ice is
agitating<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.300> water<00:01:16.540> it<00:01:16.900> releases<00:01:17.590> two<00:01:17.860> air

once<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> ice<00:01:47.820> arrived<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.420> headed<00:01:48.659> down<00:01:48.750> into

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
once the ice arrived we headed down into

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.469 
once the ice arrived we headed down into
roughly<00:01:49.140> two<00:01:49.920> inch<00:01:50.130> by<00:01:50.340> two<00:01:50.399> inch<00:01:50.610> blocks<00:01:51.119> the
