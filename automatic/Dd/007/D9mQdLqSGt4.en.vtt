00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.100 

that<00:00:53.380> blue<00:00:53.620> one<00:00:53.650> isn't<00:00:54.310> the<00:00:54.490> line<00:00:57.810> and<00:00:58.810> I<00:00:58.870> just

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
that blue one isn't the line and I just

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.930 
that blue one isn't the line and I just
noticed<00:00:59.410> another<00:00:59.620> thing<00:00:59.980> this<00:01:00.400> other<00:01:00.640> blue

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
noticed another thing this other blue

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.000 
noticed another thing this other blue
one<00:01:00.970> right<00:01:01.330> here<00:01:01.480> is<00:01:01.570> melted<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.260> these<00:01:02.590> off<00:01:02.890> I

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
one right here is melted to these off I

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.300 
one right here is melted to these off I
don't<00:01:06.010> have<00:01:06.160> a<00:01:06.190> clue<00:01:06.640> where<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.210> just

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
don't have a clue where that is just

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:24.010

so<00:01:26.390> p1<00:01:30.410> it's<00:01:31.410> melted<00:01:35.000> feels<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.180> it's

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
so p1 it's melted feels like it's

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.150 

mistake<00:04:11.990> I<00:04:12.350> need<00:04:13.100> it<00:04:13.190> all<00:04:13.340> new<00:04:13.520> hoses<00:04:13.910> anyways

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
mistake I need it all new hoses anyways

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:25.390 
mistake I need it all new hoses anyways
cuz<00:04:16.160> it's<00:04:16.340> shot<00:04:17.019> and<00:04:21.760> yeah<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:24.010> think<00:04:25.010> that's

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
cuz it's shot and yeah I think that's

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.060 
cuz it's shot and yeah I think that's
about<00:04:25.640> it<00:04:25.700> I<00:04:26.410> don't<00:04:27.410> think<00:04:27.500> there's<00:04:27.830> anything

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
about it I don't think there's anything

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.650 
about it I don't think there's anything
else<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.900> hopefully<00:04:30.380> maybe<00:04:31.300> so<00:04:32.300> number<00:04:32.600> one

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
else so hopefully maybe so number one

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.250 
else so hopefully maybe so number one
number<00:04:35.660> two

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
number two

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260 
number two
so<00:04:37.070> if<00:04:37.160> number<00:04:37.340> one<00:04:37.550> is<00:04:37.700> supposed<00:04:37.940> to<00:04:38.000> be<00:04:38.060> going

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
so if number one is supposed to be going
