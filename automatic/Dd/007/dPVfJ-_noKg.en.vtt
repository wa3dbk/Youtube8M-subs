00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.200
 hello good today I'm going to record a plate of 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.500
 how the Cuban rice is the 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:22.180
 ingredients is an egg 2 teeth of 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.590
 garlic tomato olive oil salt and rice 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.140
 I have already boiled it that I already 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.349
 I've been before for the Arab world elvira 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.349
 rice 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.370
 it's okay then we'll start as usual 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.570
 when we have the warm oil 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.570
 we throw the garlic 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.800
 and we move it a little bit 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.470
 until golden brown enough to brown 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.470
 fragile 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.140
 now that begins 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.880
 a little bit and to brown 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.050
 we take 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.050
 the tomato writer 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.939
 focus 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.329
 a pinch of salt 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.280
 and I'm going to put a teaspoon 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.280
 little sugar 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.270
 and now we move it for a little while 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.060
 Well, after a couple of minutes they have 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.300
 past nothing two more minutes and we throw the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.300
 rice 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.000
 and we move it well we are moving it well 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.360
 After a while the rice will be ready 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.940
 we'll get them out of here and I'll put it in 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.850
 a cup to shape it and now 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.530
 I'll put the oil on heating 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.530
 after the pan to make the egg 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.000
 so now we will fry the egg and 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.069
 when we have the fried egg already 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.069
 we will put on top of the rice 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.999
 Well, once the egg is fried and everything 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.700
 We put rice on top of him and I 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:50.680
 I throw a pinch of salt up 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.249
 over the egg and we'll have it 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.249
