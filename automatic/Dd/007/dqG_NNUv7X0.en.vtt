 and within that context a team won 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.270
 greater prominence that was the Torino 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.429

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.910
 unexpected delay and looking for news 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.520
 about this delay happened that the airplane 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.540
 had fallen and is descending in torino in 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.190
 in the case 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.620
 the plane had to pass through the basilica

 superga that stood on the top of a 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.980
 hill 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.220
 inside this basilica there was a priest who 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.110
 heard the noise too loud too loud 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.360
 of an engine but he thought it was a 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.340
 normal thing as a lot of airplanes were 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.900
 over there 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.660
 but soon after he heard a 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.880
 and the whole church trembled and when 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.280
 he went to see the plane would have been shocked 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.470
 the wall of the church and that was a 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.510
 very big shock to the city of 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.140
 because the population had become 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.780
 his greatest stars did not do 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.570
 more part of that world after football 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.240
 they were ordinary people that the city 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.090
 the largest palace for 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.360
 funeral ceremonies and about 500 thousand 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.970
 people attended this funeral and 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.220
 throughout Italy had paid tribute to those 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.860
 heroes and the Italian federation for 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.260
 noble gesture for a gesture of honor she 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.570
 gave the title the penta-championship to the 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.690
 torino who in the case was four 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.390
 title points after that tragedy 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.700
 torino ceases to be power in Italy and 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:20.420
 with that opened space for events 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:23.450
 grow and become one of the largest if not 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:26.240
 the biggest team in Italy and in 49 was the 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.390
 tragedy and a year later Italy was 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.250
 for the cup in Brazil and 50 but I was 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.440
 completely devastated to dispute the 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.570
 world went out in the first phase in addition 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.520
 she was already leaving a disaster that 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.160
 was ag the second world war 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.780
 Torino helped Italy win a 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.870
 little of this joy of self-esteem 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.420
 was the joy of the nation and had to 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:51.740
 with this tragedy that shook again 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:54.470
 to the country and that glorious past 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.240
 that past and Torino was a great 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.820
 world power 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.440
 He missed the 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.990
 torino supporters 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.180
 at that time of that generation and that 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.110
 I miss this for all the 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.480
 generations 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.060
 the world can sometimes seem unfair and 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.390
 fate would eternally be the heart 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:17.120
 of those fans but these 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.569
 fans never left the torino a 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.729
 abandoned car a club 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:24.910

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:26.889
 which was before and today the torino fight for 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:30.250
 these supporters so that these 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:33.690
 fans can smile again 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:37.740
 with this brand dreamed with the family 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:40.759
 when I played with sled 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:46.370

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:46.370
 general and torino dream urine
