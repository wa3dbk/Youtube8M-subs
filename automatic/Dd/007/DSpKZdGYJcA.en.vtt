00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
so I was just I guess it's just making

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.770 
so I was just I guess it's just making
sure<00:00:02.399> you<00:00:02.790> know<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.879> good<00:00:03.060> pairing<00:00:03.419> these<00:00:03.510> games

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
sure you know a good pairing these games

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.450 
sure you know a good pairing these games
that<00:00:04.020> aren't<00:00:04.170> as<00:00:04.319> close<00:00:04.500> really<00:00:05.100> just<00:00:05.250> making

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
that aren't as close really just making

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.340 
that aren't as close really just making
sure<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:05.640> we<00:00:05.940> don't<00:00:06.060> get<00:00:06.629> complacent<00:00:06.750> during

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
sure that we don't get complacent during

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.350 
sure that we don't get complacent during
them<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.529> think<00:00:07.680> making<00:00:08.550> sure<00:00:08.760> do<00:00:08.970> work<00:00:09.179> on<00:00:09.269> the

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
them I think making sure do work on the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.700 
them I think making sure do work on the
things<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.690> can't<00:00:09.929> improve<00:00:10.170> on<00:00:10.320> during<00:00:10.620> these

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710

improving<00:00:14.099> as<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> team<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.730> ways<00:00:14.849> we<00:00:15.030> can

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
know what are the keys at keeping this

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.530 
know what are the keys at keeping this
program<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.489> such<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> high<00:00:32.880> level<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.360> mean<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
program in such a high level I mean you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.600 
program in such a high level I mean you
need<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:34.170> know<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> program<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:35.010> just

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
need you know the program just just

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.790 
need you know the program just just
keeps<00:00:35.790> marching<00:00:36.030> right<00:00:36.390> along<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:37.559> know<00:00:37.680> it's

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800

keeps marching right along you know it's
good<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.670> part<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
good I think it's just a part of the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.510 
good I think it's just a part of the
coaching<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.719> course<00:00:40.050> coaches<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> great

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520

coaching of course coaches have a great
job<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.790> developing<00:00:42.030> players<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.440> putting<00:00:43.680> in

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
job of developing players and putting in

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.290 
job of developing players and putting in
a<00:00:43.829> system<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.399> uses<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.789> talents<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
a system that uses the talents and the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.900 
a system that uses the talents and the
skills<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> players<00:00:45.870> are<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.079> best<00:00:46.910> views

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
skills the players are the best views

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.270 
skills the players are the best views
are<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.090> best<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> best<00:00:48.570> way<00:00:48.780> possible

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
are the best the best way possible

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.959 
are the best the best way possible
assistant<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.340> put<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.670> year<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
assistant we put in this year as a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:51.889 
assistant we put in this year as a
little<00:00:51.120> different<00:00:51.390> from<00:00:51.449> last<00:00:51.629> year's

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
little different from last year's

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.810 
little different from last year's
because<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.739> skills<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> players<00:00:53.640> we

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
because the skills of the players we

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.860 
because the skills of the players we
have<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.059> year<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.270> little<00:00:54.420> bit<00:00:54.510> different

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
have this year a little bit different

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930 
have this year a little bit different
than<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.170> had<00:00:55.289> last<00:00:55.469> year<00:00:55.699> and<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.820> we've

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
than that we had last year and so we've

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.250 
than that we had last year and so we've
just<00:00:57.090> put<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> little<00:00:57.420> different<00:00:57.780> system<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
just put in a little different system a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.990 
just put in a little different system a
little<00:00:58.410> bit<00:00:58.500> more<00:00:58.649> open<00:00:58.920> play<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.340> think<00:00:59.879> it's

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
little bit more open play I think it's

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
little bit more open play I think it's
just<00:01:00.120> women<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.629> mean<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.899> show<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.379> uh

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
just women I mean I show that it's uh

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.680 
just women I mean I show that it's uh
it's<00:01:01.859> worked<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.520> mean<00:01:02.640> score<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> long<00:01:03.329> points

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it's worked I mean score a long points

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.390 
it's worked I mean score a long points
lately<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> think<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.280> people

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
lately and so I think it's just people

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.310 
lately and so I think it's just people
buy<00:01:05.610> into<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> system<00:01:06.270> working<00:01:06.450> hard<00:01:06.750> I'm

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
buy into the system working hard I'm

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.870 
buy into the system working hard I'm
seeing<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> successful<00:01:08.280> comic<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:08.760> work

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
seeing the successful comic we do work

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.200 
seeing the successful comic we do work
hard<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.900> happens<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:11.150> how<00:01:12.150> many

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
hard and it just it happens so how many

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.700 
hard and it just it happens so how many
of<00:01:12.360> these<00:01:12.420> teams<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.020> think<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.409> beat

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
of these teams do you think you beat

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.050 
of these teams do you think you beat
before<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.159> even<00:01:14.220> step<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> field

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
before you even step on the field

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.300 
before you even step on the field
because<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.630> blue<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.960> didn't<00:01:16.229> bang<00:01:16.409> you

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
because of the blue I didn't bang you

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.700 
because of the blue I didn't bang you
know<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> think<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.909> every<00:01:18.180> viga<00:01:18.509> does<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.590> know

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
know I think it every viga does you know

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.770
