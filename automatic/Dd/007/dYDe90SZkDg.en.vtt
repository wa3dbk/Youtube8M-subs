00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.570
 good 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.320
 l 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.660
 at least 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.350
 hello welcome to a new video of 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.920
 good today what we are going to present 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.470
 is the new addition of the line 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.990
 Cuba 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:40.080
 and in this case we have the cube 10 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.080
 well it's typically a normal qb 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.150
 but I put some variations that I think 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.860
 the most important are interesting and that 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.010
 he lived in this amplifier even more 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.339
 relevant 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.970
 roland has created an application for 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.070
 this amplifier 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.670
 which is that you can 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.840
 exchange the types of amplifiers 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.730
 or are purchased with three amplifiers 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.460
 but you can download from the page 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.560
 of romÃ¡n in its application because 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.000
 example put in front yesterday from a 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.010
 buggy a marshall and you can place it in 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.970
 time of the three that someone 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.850
 this would perhaps be the most relevant of 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.280
 this amplifier and good those present 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.290
 that how small it is in a dream with 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.200
 a lot of body 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:34.460
 8-inch and good effects 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.860
 Well done and effective voice physicists 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.150
 well this is a little explanation 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.150
 General this day Amplifier 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.430
 the three applied the ones that come standard 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.770
 that are the green that I am the clean orange 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.200
 the crunch and network that would be the 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.940
 distortions of the leaf simply for 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.060
 change between them this little button 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.020
 foot that changes color when color 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.790
 corresponds to the amplifier then 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.500
 we go to what are the equalizations 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:12.470
 and game and button volumes the game more 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.590
 or less distortion the overall volume 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.209
 of the amplifier 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.830
 and the three bands of update 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.780
 serious means and outs and finally 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.420
 we will go to the effects section takes 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.900
 to the amplifier 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.690
 you see here that comes with a jet this 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.920
 part of here 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.849
 delays 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.650
 and reverse good with all the Thursdays 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:44.310
 you will see this kind of meaning of good 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.420
 of drawing that what you want to say is that 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:52.930
 it's less effects more effect 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.620
 it would be less of law more of law and with everything 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.940
 the secret is the same 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.310
 - river and more amount of rules 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.490
 and here you have the two types of revel one 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.680
 spring of a normal rever 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.080
 then with the connection part 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.900
 rear 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.520
 here you have the auxiliary entrance that 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.560
 It would be to put your back in tracks 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.290
 your rhythm bases so they are 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.840
 Attach mind with your guitar in 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.120
 this roland cube of 10 x 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.340
 the headphone output to play on 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.069
 silence without disturbing anyone to our 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.900
 roll and that is also a way out of 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.849
 straight this collection means that 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.860
 it is also a recording output that 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.569
 You can comment to your card 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.489
 audio to send the signal directly 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.500
 from your club to any kind of 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.980
 sequencer to record what 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.980
 you want 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.780
 well let's start the clean the 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.690
 clean classic white 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.830
 It is super clean and with body to me 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.830
 I personally like it a lot 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.560
 do not 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.200
 we are finished 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.610
 dispersion is of intermediate type because 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.610
 They can be very short 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.140
 plus 

00:04:56.299 --> 00:05:04.070
 the red and not 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.070
 specifies who motivates you the most 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.490
 no no no no no no 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.930
 yes 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.590
 m 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:52.050
 Well now under making functions , a 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.650
 little bit about the effects we are going to 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.770
 make a sound as well as solo 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:02.940
 in the red channel half gain without happening 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:06.230
 a lot and a little bit of delay is worth 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:09.970
 also the effects as they are 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.970
 a kind solo sound 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.110
 but no 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.729
 all right 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.470
 do not 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.170
 t 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.790
 m 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.490
 look 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.470
 in front of 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.940
 m
