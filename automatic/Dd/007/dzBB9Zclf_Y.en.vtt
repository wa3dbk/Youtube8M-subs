00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
leaves and then he finds out that

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.580 
leaves and then he finds out that
everything's<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.850> float<00:01:24.119> ok<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.750> he<00:01:25.049> goes<00:01:25.290> over

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

everything's a float ok so he goes over
there<00:01:25.979> goes<00:01:26.430> through<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> couple<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.150> hundred

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
