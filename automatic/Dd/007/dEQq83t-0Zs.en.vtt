00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.279
 So here I am starting the blog 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:20.290
 for nothing because I confess clip to put in 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.590
 vain to film post but thomert is 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.440
 lit but no more yes it's a little 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.330
 with at least 2000 city ​​buses 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.750
 our video there on the premises of a 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.490
 accident it's nice it's true 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.010
 that he is really working the editing 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.090
 it's great fun before on the island 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.290
 of an accident and video that had the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.080
 cheaper it was valentine's day 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.700
 single biker this interaction 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.800
 really surprised that it actually 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.360
 please as much because I'm going to 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.640
 say what it is to do the editing 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.579
 I had 12h10 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.710
 and I was going close to 300 pips and to 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.610
 devices have all served not even ten 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.370
 minutes 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.230
 editing 2010 minutes not even 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.760
 and when I saw that everyone that 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.190
 to ask you is where 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.390
 it's recently certified so I 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.940
 deduce that without making you videos 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.040
 shit what are you going to do you 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.390
 So enjoy these videos from 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.120
 now you will make videos of 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.990
 shit here I hope you'll be 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.100
 happy 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.540
 there we are on a small forest road 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.280
 so our lady where you put it is called 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.280
 it's pretty nice as a road 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.940
 a small camp by the biker 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.940
 their ancestors 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.930
 I know some of them are rolling 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.340
 under there under the snow on the snow 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.460
 rather because the news is on the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.460
 road 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.480
 here you have understood 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.910
 months can watch 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.470
 it's raw gorgeous sun I do not 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.370
 criticize not jan this video I 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.690
 believe we are the march 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.170
 yes I have not said the day not to be wary 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.170
 not what day 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.140
 I do not know why they could 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.970
 ask to be asked at least 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.350
 once in the comments of 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.520
 videos 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.040
 I live in the south near Toulon 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.040
 you do not need to ask me 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.870
 which makes this red in the south is 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.370
 toulouse 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.420
 obviously here it's not all the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.700
 world 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.930
 there are buildings no it's a friend 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.930
 the top 6 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.850
 and if we are not good and we are not 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.750
 far ahead and there the view with the sea I 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.640
 know that maybe gives you desire for 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.250
 who lived in the dark or yellow 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.800
 season 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.310
 this desire because I am there I want 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.310
 see it every day 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.460
 then there in the middle closed the rocks 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.150
 believe it's called the two brothers so 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.150
 are rather known 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.700
 because people like they say they 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.090
 if it's rather known 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.560
 by far it looks like these two hills 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.370
 separately makes sense and that one who gets 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.620
 joined toulouse 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.040
 here I know you have none 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.040
 to fuck 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.270
 I am so a good driver 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.290
 take no evidence 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:32.950
 with my game to put gas in there 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.300
 flat then society totally I know 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.560
 not 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.120
 so what is a little bit boring 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.610
 since I changed my mirrors 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.020
 is when I put myself like that so 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.430
 I do not remember saying no impediment more 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.720
 of nothing royame fraïsse gust of wind 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.890
 in front of the troops 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.660
 so honestly it's rather annoying 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.730
 because I like members 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.380
 but apart from that, those who are 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.710
 ask frankly I see super good 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.790
 in the backside behind that's it's 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.790
 this head of the red road bike 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.930
 and that's how I did it and I 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.290
 cut I did everything I needed 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.290
 now his party I'm going great 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.680
 do not know why but I love myself 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.989
 scratch the nose when I shut up self anymore 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.280
 with the camp there with the fabric that's it 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.280
 do good I like 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:30.070
 theo is at stake thanks to buy 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.870
 it's not a place to talk more 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.530
 interesting serious people it's going to shit 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.009
 bubbles 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.029
 michael j 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.029
 so who to believe 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.910
 shithead 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.710
 not like that 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.730
 I like to double people then have 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.730
 gently rolled 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.060
 as well as it's a big asshole he rolls 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.060
 even more slowly 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.169
 how it will be sporty 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.580
 I know I'm an asshole 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.939
 but on one side he does not have to do this 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.939
 that he has done 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.180
 Here its 8 pm 50 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.170
 the bike does not beat at more than 45 it's a 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.170
 fifty cubic centimeters 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.159
