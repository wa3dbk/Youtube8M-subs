jacks

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.339 

the<00:03:28.970> jacks<00:03:29.239> have<00:03:29.390> an<00:03:29.510> ACME<00:03:29.810> threaded<00:03:30.170> rod

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
the jacks have an ACME threaded rod

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:42.240 
the jacks have an ACME threaded rod
which<00:03:30.739> can<00:03:30.980> be<00:03:31.180> adjusted<00:03:32.180> even<00:03:33.079> under<00:03:33.290> load

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.130 

so<00:03:43.250> we'll<00:03:43.370> repeat<00:03:43.640> that<00:03:43.700> same<00:03:44.120> process<00:03:44.750> on<00:03:45.050> the

so we'll repeat that same process on the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:04:04.960 
so we'll repeat that same process on the
other<00:03:45.170> side

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.330 

and<00:04:05.330> adjust<00:04:05.930> both<00:04:06.200> sides<00:04:06.530> so<00:04:06.860> that<00:04:07.040> they're

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
and adjust both sides so that they're

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:15.670 
and adjust both sides so that they're
about<00:04:07.550> equal<00:04:13.870> you'll<00:04:14.870> notice<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.500> boat
