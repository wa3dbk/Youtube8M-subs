00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.940

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.620
 with a government to another old z 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 I know I have nothing left for a long time 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.130
 that's why I'm doing 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.500
 now a double the rest will come too 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.420
 an old one back up there but one 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.100
 moment on my mock work yes there will 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.400
 but also something else takes but on 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.900
 every case the next days come like that 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.650
 Here we have the ex gefreiten 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.779
 from the year 2006 has cost 60 euros 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.780
 with six mini figures and the shows 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.469
 Well, we have Luke 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.899
 skywalker with silver lightsaber 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.260
 skin from the head and this his red five 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.030
 helmet 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.760
 then we have 600 again 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.190
 interviews with his helmet and one 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.920
 normal life face then princess 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.000
 ruth design chewbacca and so limbourg 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.500
 to be and still as a police so that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.719
 were already the figures we come to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.300
 main body images so really 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.300
 one of my favorite it's easy 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.769
 I think so, too 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.400
 times the computer game are lego star 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.930
 wars 2 and losses from 1 I was as 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.450
 little boy want to be totally excited 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.159
 that everything was lego and lego star 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.229
 wars 2 would have faked me as well 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.369
 anyway and the city by that 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:24.540
 We had there was this included 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.740
 so all now actually there already 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.409
 Can anyone be pure is one of these 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.710
 Target computer slightly shift the light 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.250
 says you see this computer in dead 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.829
 a dig on and make 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.680
 here is this interface for the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:45.329
 first man can, of course, too 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.619
 adjust necessary so there can be 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.189
 even here I have to like this 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:55.320
 sleek shape a country where you can 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.780
 that also works so you can almost see it 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.850
 not I have that now because of that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.630
 about the extreme lets stand straight 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.280
 and of course you can do it that way 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.530
 put down but I think 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.490
 nose is a little too far above are something 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.890
 more precisely 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.170
 I know it a very small detail though 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.240
 that bothers him against general impression so 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.319
 that it 's always so natural 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.700
 wings but very important behind there 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:30.000
 It's a gear when you turn it on 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:35.489
 could happen this part of the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.100
 away that slowly turns up and 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.930
 then it looks like that already 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.360
 lande werk yes that wanted me of it 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.300
 that he is here to peace we so now 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:54.750
 but it is great that is derrick swing 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:03:00.870
 it just looks eerily eternal to me 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:03.780
 find it right speed and as I said 60 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.670
 â‚¬ I find absolutely appropriate and 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.160
 here on the wing you also get lux 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.630
 and red marks on it 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.120
 I have both now which hello 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.610
 here is my faithful kuka i know 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.100
 hate it if something because the pattern 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.690
 lying next to it can be stowed me 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.070
 can stow away 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:27.630
 down here is another cargo hatch 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.430
 for laser sword and everything I think 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.780
 Also great there I can the lightsaber 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.459
 namely, to do it clean and above all things 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.810
 you can also say other there so 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.730
 Now how, for example, the light is 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.530
 envelope or I never I 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.810
 mentioned twice 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.880
 otherwise it was that's different 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.780
 cool that was derrick swing me 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.780
 say goodbye bye
