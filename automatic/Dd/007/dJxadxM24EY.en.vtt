00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
728 skins in the first real not bug fix

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.689 
728 skins in the first real not bug fix
0.9<00:00:57.629> point

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
0.9 point

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.840 
0.9 point
whetstone<00:00:59.699> before<00:01:00.239> or<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.989> 1.0<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.579> basically

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
whetstone before or for 1.0 so basically

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.429 
whetstone before or for 1.0 so basically
what<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.180> means<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.690> will<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.870> skins

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
what this means we will have skins

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.980 
what this means we will have skins
before<00:01:04.979> 1.0<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.450> might<00:01:06.630> actually<00:01:06.780> have

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
before 1.0 so we might actually have

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.899 
before 1.0 so we might actually have
skins<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.590> 1.9<00:01:08.280> point<00:01:08.580> 2<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:10.619> that's<00:01:11.549> basically

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
skins in 1.9 point 2 so that's basically

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670 
skins in 1.9 point 2 so that's basically
yeah<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.180> also<00:01:12.420> redstone<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:13.290> come<00:01:13.530> before

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
yeah and also redstone will come before

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
yeah and also redstone will come before
or<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> one-point<00:01:15.030> no<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:15.960> gonna

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
or for a one-point no I think it's gonna

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.960 
or for a one-point no I think it's gonna
come<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.439> 1<00:01:16.590> point<00:01:16.799> no<00:01:16.979> because<00:01:17.280> redstone<00:01:17.759> is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
come in 1 point no because redstone is

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.390 
come in 1 point no because redstone is
obviously<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> huge<00:01:19.110> factor<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.650> Minecraft<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
obviously a huge factor in Minecraft and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.730 
obviously a huge factor in Minecraft and
it<00:01:20.520> takes<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.790> lot<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:20.970> programming<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.530> lot

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
it takes a lot of programming and a lot

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
it takes a lot of programming and a lot
of<00:01:22.770> time<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.280> put<00:01:23.460> into<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.479> my<00:01:24.630> opinion

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
of time to put into so in my opinion

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.260 
of time to put into so in my opinion
this<00:01:25.350> won't<00:01:25.619> come<00:01:25.799> before<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.280> 1.0<00:01:26.759> updates

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this won't come before the 1.0 updates

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.420 
this won't come before the 1.0 updates
and<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:28.320> guess<00:01:28.590> we'll<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.100> wait<00:01:29.400> for

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and I guess we'll just have to wait for

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.520 
and I guess we'll just have to wait for
it<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:30.270> anyways<00:01:30.600> we're<00:01:30.900> actually<00:01:31.140> really

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
