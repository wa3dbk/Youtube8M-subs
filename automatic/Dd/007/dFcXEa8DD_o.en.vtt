00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Full six whole position yukata of Pokemon battle this time is special rate 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.000
 I will challenge the battle 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.960
 There is no weakness here and you can receive special skills numerically 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.960
 I'm lucky 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.540
 It is an advantageous meeting 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.540
 Let's put in poison 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:47.620
 If this rule is used to strike electromagnetic waves, even Gabriela will be effective 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.949
 It is less damage from Lucky's natural recovery 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:55.230
 It became possible from xy 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.230
 I will scrape with the earth throw 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:11.450
 Charlem or certainly fighting type is very strong, but with this rule each party is lucky 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.450
 It's halved 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.870
 It's coming to early also certainly mega evolution 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.870
 How old was quickness ? 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:40.960
 Psycho cutter or physical technique is tight I now of the scene wonder if was good sprouting was cut by throwing Earth 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.439
 Because Lucky has to receive a later 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:50.000
 I have no choice but to sacrifice one of the reserve 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:53.750
 Gabu hath I like Lati glasses so I sacrifice Lati 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.850
 I thought when I was editing 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.850
 In practice, I just misunderstood it as a normal rule 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.040
 But it is possible to put this in to the Gab Rias 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.390
 The problem is the enemy's quickness and sub weapon 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:26.690
 Certainly I think I could use the three-color punch 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:33.050
 I can usually do it with frozen punches but this time the biting punches are scary 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:37.690
 Low of mother than Gaburiasu is quickness is gonna be Barrett punch 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.690
 There is a possibility of attack correction though 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.740
 I'm lucky I 'm lucky because the lanterns came out 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.110
 I wonder if I have read 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:16.630
 The rest of here since the imperial wrath's Gab Rias confident I'm half in each other rock skills at the same magnification is a preeminent 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:19.069
 If you're not a headband that you can't take out, if you're lucky one shot will endure 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.159
 There is no choice but to set up a luck game 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.159
 eh 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.739
 I 've been addicted to it and I've got nothing but Gabriels 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:41.680
 As you can see, this Gabrielas earthquake 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:49.120
 It is a template construction of a rock seal against scarves on the dance of the sword . 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:51.790
 In the Gab mirror of the upside-down battle also excellent 0.00 to take the reliable first move in the next turn 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:04:00.969
 I can do it 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:04:03.329
 The power is confident in the match correction 150 and the rock seal is discordant 120 so it is better on its own 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.329
 You 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.180
 Luckily I pulled over a point and broke through Gabriels 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:18.949
 I can not beat the lantern 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:27.229
 I'm using it for entertainers as well as for the lanterns 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:31.910
 The defense is low but hp is so high that even physical techniques can not defeat without correction 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:34.200
 Although it is done with a frozen beam, it is 100,000 volts this time 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.740
 Pokemon introduction corner 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:42.570
 This time the club has a long nickname 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:45.660
 Steamed and then at bw'm overseas mosquito Ross 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:54.950
 I have stealth lock This is 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:54.950
 It seems to be Karos double It is an endangered individual , and I use it with a scarf or hachimaki .
