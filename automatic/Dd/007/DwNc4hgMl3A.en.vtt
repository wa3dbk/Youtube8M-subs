00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.069
 the new from the 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:14.329
 indeed let 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.329
 for both of us 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.619
 and again what does it do 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.619
 here always 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 There, the construction industry offered quarterly 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.699
 relieved George 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.699
 Olpe Blum should stand ratio 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.590
 The game is supposed to be the game 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.100
 with accomplices 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.780
 Reilly l 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.300
 the whole percent is a netbook also in conjunction with a box 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.989
 4 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.260
 the iPhone works 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.470
 and percent 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.470
 then again and again to new challenge 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
 as a man 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.870
 instead of 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.350
 where exactly 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.130
 Hogans was allowed to 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.130
 the land 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.670
 that justifies it 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.670
 I'm doing the role 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.130
 right on the 4th I was stronger 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.210
 4 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.210
 not that one 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.270
 there are still here 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.160
 I do not have to delete this regulation immediately 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.370
 percent 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.370
 the director Decker 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.880
 hours 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.880
 in conjunction with the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.870
 you can play it all now if you try the system and 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.289
 Google is but a second video 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.319
