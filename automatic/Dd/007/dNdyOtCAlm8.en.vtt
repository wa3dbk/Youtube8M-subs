ones or under 20 they're the ones you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.740 
ones or under 20 they're the ones you
have<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.310> be<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.550> little<00:01:25.790> bit<00:01:25.880> careful<00:01:26.060> number<00:01:26.540> I

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
have to be a little bit careful number I

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.810 
have to be a little bit careful number I
think<00:01:27.140> on<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:27.530> we<00:01:27.710> have<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.070> adjust<00:01:28.190> on<00:01:28.550> that<00:01:28.700> as

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
think on so we have to adjust on that as

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.790 
think on so we have to adjust on that as
well<00:01:29.000> because<00:01:29.360> I<00:01:29.479> think<00:01:29.509> you<00:01:29.810> high<00:01:30.350> level

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
well because I think you high level

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.530 
well because I think you high level
higher<00:01:31.070> age<00:01:31.280> group<00:01:31.610> but<00:01:32.090> then<00:01:32.240> they<00:01:32.360> go<00:01:32.509> down

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
higher age group but then they go down

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.420 
higher age group but then they go down
and<00:01:33.050> they<00:01:33.110> they<00:01:33.740> just<00:01:33.770> get<00:01:34.070> on<00:01:34.190> with<00:01:34.310> it

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
and they they just get on with it

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.480 
and they they just get on with it
whether<00:01:34.700> we<00:01:35.270> but<00:01:35.540> we<00:01:35.720> don't<00:01:36.020> maybe<00:01:36.530> there's

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
whether we but we don't maybe there's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.800 
whether we but we don't maybe there's
something<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.759> we<00:01:37.940> might<00:01:38.090> have

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
something that we might have

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.219 
something that we might have
