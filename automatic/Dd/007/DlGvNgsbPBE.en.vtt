00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
blue version to the purple version

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.770 
blue version to the purple version
you'll<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:14.880> there<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.240> one<00:01:15.420> has<00:01:15.570> about

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
you'll see there that one has about

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.130 
you'll see there that one has about
2,500<00:01:16.640> damage<00:01:17.640> per<00:01:17.850> shot<00:01:17.990> before<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
2,500 damage per shot before the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.280 
2,500 damage per shot before the
multiplier<00:01:19.680> my<00:01:20.369> purple<00:01:21.090> version<00:01:21.509> with<00:01:21.900> no

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
multiplier my purple version with no

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.730 
multiplier my purple version with no
lunar<00:01:22.650> shine<00:01:22.890> has<00:01:23.369> about<00:01:24.259> 3000<00:01:25.259> before<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
lunar shine has about 3000 before the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.370 
lunar shine has about 3000 before the
multiplier<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> mean<00:01:27.299> there<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> big

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

multiplier so I mean there is a big
difference<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:29.240> but<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.630> know<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:31.140> if

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
difference there but you know really if

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.520 
difference there but you know really if
you<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.979> see<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.579> green<00:01:33.060> or<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> white<00:01:34.259> one

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
you do see a green or like a white one

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.380

this gun in my opinion is better against
for<00:02:39.989> mobbing<00:02:40.440> simply<00:02:41.430> because<00:02:41.760> against

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
for mobbing simply because against

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.259 
for mobbing simply because against
bosses<00:02:42.480> while<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.380> crit<00:02:43.590> damage<00:02:43.769> is<00:02:44.130> high<00:02:44.310> you

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
bosses while the crit damage is high you

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.330 
bosses while the crit damage is high you
can't<00:02:45.540> have<00:02:45.720> some<00:02:45.959> issues<00:02:46.350> with<00:02:46.530> reloading<00:02:47.130> it

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
can't have some issues with reloading it

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.340 
can't have some issues with reloading it
can<00:02:47.489> take<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> while<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.780> could<00:02:48.930> be<00:02:49.019> kind<00:02:49.260> of

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
can take a while and it could be kind of

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.900 
can take a while and it could be kind of
a<00:02:49.440> pain<00:02:49.620> in<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.890> butt<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.400> what<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.790> just

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
a pain in the butt so what I just

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.600 
a pain in the butt so what I just
recommend<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.140> use<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:52.799> mobbing<00:02:53.250> or

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
recommend is you use this for mobbing or

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.460 
recommend is you use this for mobbing or
if<00:02:54.060> you've<00:02:54.299> got<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.540> character<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.290> can

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
if you've got a character that can

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.530 
if you've got a character that can
really<00:02:56.069> boost<00:02:56.310> mountain<00:02:56.850> elemental<00:02:57.390> damage

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
really boost mountain elemental damage

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150
