 I'm in the ice cave that you see 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.090
 here and there you have to be in this frame 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:30.779
 this big ice block is in the middle 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:33.500

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.500

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.040

 his body is no longer that way and if you are 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:46.880

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:53.799
 this place time and him now 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:57.579
 then it would turn out 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:00.110
 develop by chance after worker 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:03.140

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:13.370

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.340

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.359

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.970
