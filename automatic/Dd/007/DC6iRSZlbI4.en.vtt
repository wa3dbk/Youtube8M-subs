let's select both sets of text let's go
over<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.760> create<00:01:09.210> v<00:01:09.450> car<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.950> will<00:01:11.130> use

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
over to the create v car and we will use

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.679 
over to the create v car and we will use
a<00:01:11.670> 90-degree<00:01:12.450> tool<00:01:12.659> path<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.979> goes<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.689> one

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
a 90-degree tool path that goes out one

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.850 
a 90-degree tool path that goes out one
speed<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.710> turn<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> paths<00:01:18.619> now<00:01:19.619> let's

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
speed and turn on the paths now let's

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.969 
speed and turn on the paths now let's
see<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.130> happens<00:01:20.520> when<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.850> turn<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
see what happens when we turn on the

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.330 
see what happens when we turn on the
rotary<00:01:22.979> axis<00:01:23.220> tool<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.390> go<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> view<00:01:25.340> turn

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
rotary axis tool so we go to view turn

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.420 
rotary axis tool so we go to view turn
on<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> material<00:01:27.030> block<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:28.110> view<00:01:28.500> tool

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430

axis notice that the tool shows up to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.200 
axis notice that the tool shows up to
make<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.979> little<00:01:38.189> easier<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.790> let's

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
make this a little easier to see let's

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.990 
make this a little easier to see let's
look<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> isometric<00:01:40.380> view<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:41.759> see

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
look at the isometric view and we see

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.609 
look at the isometric view and we see
that<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.689> letter<00:01:42.899> A<00:01:42.990> B<00:01:43.829> C<00:01:44.399> wraps<00:01:45.270> around

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
that the letter A B C wraps around

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.310 
that the letter A B C wraps around
clockwise<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> letter<00:01:47.610> j<00:01:48.049> likewise<00:01:49.049> on
