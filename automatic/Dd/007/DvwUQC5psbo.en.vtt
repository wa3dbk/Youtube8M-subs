alright don't try this at work I've got
a<00:00:15.889> glass<00:00:17.110> attemping<00:00:18.110> milk<00:00:18.440> glass<00:00:18.770> wine<00:00:19.760> bottle

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.830 

really<00:00:24.830> pull<00:00:25.370> it<00:00:25.580> in<00:00:27.940> get<00:00:28.940> a<00:00:28.970> vacuum<00:00:29.210> pump<00:00:29.480> set

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
really pull it in get a vacuum pump set

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.360 
really pull it in get a vacuum pump set
up<00:00:31.000> hopefully<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.570> vacuum<00:00:33.410> won't<00:00:33.650> they

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
up hopefully the vacuum won't they

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.280 
up hopefully the vacuum won't they
browse<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:35.590> alcohol<00:00:36.590> that<00:00:37.280> was<00:00:37.579> in<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.290> wine

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
browse the alcohol that was in the wine

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.370 
browse the alcohol that was in the wine
glass<00:00:40.660> going<00:00:41.660> to<00:00:43.720> cut<00:00:44.720> on<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:44.989> vacuum<00:00:45.350> pump

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
glass going to cut on the vacuum pump

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.889 
glass going to cut on the vacuum pump
now<00:00:46.000> hopefully<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.120> glass<00:00:47.360> has<00:00:47.660> reached

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
now hopefully the glass has reached

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.920 
now hopefully the glass has reached
equilibrium<00:00:48.260> temperature<00:00:49.540> try<00:00:50.540> to<00:00:50.600> get<00:00:50.780> us

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
equilibrium temperature try to get us

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.270 
equilibrium temperature try to get us
good<00:00:51.470> shot<00:00:51.770> at<00:00:51.950> this<00:00:52.190> oh<00:00:53.530> yeah<00:00:54.530> got<00:00:54.920> safety

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
good shot at this oh yeah got safety

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:09.010 
good shot at this oh yeah got safety
glasses<00:00:55.489> on<00:01:04.000> that's<00:01:05.000> about<00:01:05.239> 5<00:01:05.600> psi

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.890 

and<00:01:09.619> it's<00:01:09.799> pulling<00:01:10.220> in<00:01:10.450> slowly

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.560 

but<00:01:17.470> uh<00:01:17.500> crank<00:01:18.250> up<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.990> vacuum<00:01:19.990> on<00:01:20.380> it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:34.910 

you<00:01:23.170> go<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.440> about<00:01:23.650> 10

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.340 

Karen<00:01:35.920> -<00:01:35.979> pull<00:01:36.159> it<00:01:36.189> in<00:01:36.460> nicely

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.490 

any<00:01:41.530> second<00:01:42.220> now<00:01:42.250> it<00:01:42.369> should<00:01:42.909> rupture

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.510 

we'll<00:01:47.830> crank<00:01:48.070> it<00:01:48.250> on<00:01:48.370> up<00:01:48.550> to<00:01:48.580> search<00:01:49.240> things

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.830 

as<00:01:53.060> definitely<00:01:53.840> pulling<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.470> in<00:01:54.619> now

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.910 

there<00:01:59.840> we<00:02:00.350> go

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.059 

so<00:02:07.920> hopefully<00:02:09.350> idea<00:02:10.350> is<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.459> will<00:02:12.890> say<00:02:13.890> it

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
so hopefully idea is that it will say it

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.000 
so hopefully idea is that it will say it
really<00:02:14.970> sucks<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.420> flying<00:02:15.840> there

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.970 

little<00:02:20.010> world<00:02:20.870> Galba<00:02:21.870> fling<00:02:22.170> down<00:02:22.500> just<00:02:22.830> a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
little world Galba fling down just a

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.750 
little world Galba fling down just a
little<00:02:23.010> bit

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.070 

try<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.330> slowly<00:02:27.780> cool<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.950> that

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
try to slowly cool it so that

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.570 
try to slowly cool it so that
hopefully<00:02:31.920> doesn't<00:02:32.340> shatter

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.370 

shattered<00:02:40.980> no<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:43.480> experiment<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:44.110> over

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
shattered no that experiment is over

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.530 
shattered no that experiment is over
