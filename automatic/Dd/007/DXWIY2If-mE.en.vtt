00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.559
 been completely crazy it's the least 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.490
 we can say 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.320
 I do not walk I usually prefer 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.300
 take a boat when it comes to 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.830
 float but if you want to do the 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.440
 smart and move on the water in 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.539
 motorcycle car you'd do well to hold 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.189
 account of the science you will end up without 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.739
 doubt under water but listen to that when 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.090
 even 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.290
 it is vital to arrive on the water at 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.059
 horizontally 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.760
 if you are too inclined you will take 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.260
 a good bath to stay on the surface of 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.600
 water you have to create a force 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.130
 ascent to do this it takes 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.280
 push enough water down 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.540
 to balance the weight of the vehicle 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.320
 the amount of water push back down 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.210
 increase with speed and wheels 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.980
 wider have a larger area of 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.600
 contact with water which helps the 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.170
 repel and created strength 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.170
 upward 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.480
 ping being biker at my hours 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.160
 I like this thing but no researchers 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.320
 are they going to live up to the 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.450
 science i hope well let's start with 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.909
 the arrival angle entry 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.780
 so a motorcycle ran right but 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.780
 light and powerful 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.840
 his exit from the first step made 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.600
 to jump and to change his angle of arrival 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.880
 on the second it started well but 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.649
 very badly finished 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.799
 to a quad 4 big wheels that could 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.799
 walk 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.210
 I told you he was going to be 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.840
 ejected it could have worked if he had 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.840
 not jumped to the water 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.900
 finally the least we can say is 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:04.200
 that he is proud of him a bike really 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.060
 and not this slope will give him the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.630
 necessary speed but the bikes do not 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.830
 are not made to ride on the water I 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.900
 had it said to a snowmobile a 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.590
 large contact area but also 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.590
 extremely heavy 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.950
 yes yes yes no once the back has 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.530
 started to sink 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.900
 the rest could only follow is the 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.190
 ice and we say that a good captain 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.880
 never give up his future here 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.660
 some numbers 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.300
 a 200 kg quad should move more 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.120
 from 200 liters of water per second to 32 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.960
 kilometers an hour to float this 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.030
 Stadium 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.690
 and well believe it or not it's possible 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.690
 finally real pros 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.910
 wide wheels running like 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.450
 paddle wheels we will be able to admire his 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.450
 exploits 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.420
 why did I speak too early sorry
