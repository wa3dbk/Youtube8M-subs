 [Music] 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.970
 ah 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.350
 Y 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.230
 the birth is today a strange mixture 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.350
 of nature and technology 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.000
 a normal calving in cattle is planned 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.820
 in all its details 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.210
 from the service with a bull and female 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.110
 healthy and evaluated by veterinarians 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.110
 experienced 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.900
 this cow is about to give birth and is 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.660
 part of a synchronization program 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.600
 of births 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.350
 the greatest fetal growth has occurred 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.129
 in the last trimester of pregnancy 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.759
 the imminence of childbirth is insinuated 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:12.140
 externally by changes in the pelvis 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:15.500
 perineum vulva and udder 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.920
 the next birth is announced with 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.850
 Enlarged genitals and of matt bears and 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.850
 something flabby 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.600
 a growing development and edema in the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.220
 udder has been expressed from 2 to 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.960
 Last 4 weeks observe these photos 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.890
 how the appearance of 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:47.950
 the udder during the premiere 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:50.270
 [Music] 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.570
 ah 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.689
 close to labor the mammary secretion has 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.070
 passed from slightly transparent to 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:03.770
 become similar to a viscous honey 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.869
 yellowish precursor of colostrum two 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.479
 days before childbirth can be warned 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.789
 the drop of up to one degree centigrade 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.789
 in the rectal temperature 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.620
 other changes also appear in the 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.319
 pulse 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.190
 24 hours before delivery the rhythm 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.750
 heart rate accelerates until reaching 80 a 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.750
 90 beats per minute 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.970
 from the seventh month of gestation it 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.970
 You can check downloads by the vulva 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.970
 called slimes mu coi des or mucous plug 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.330
 there are almost constant changes in the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.540
 general behavior of the animal appear 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:00.600
 still with the spine arched the tail 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.600
 raised and often unappetizing 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.030
 the blonde has become irregular 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.040
 finally the mucous plug liquefies and 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.769
 detached abroad 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.189
 inside the cow has been brewing 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.439
 a true hormonal revolution 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:22.620
 detectable by blood tests and that 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.620
 is the cause of many phenomena 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.620
 perceptible 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.210
 and we recognize that the fetus is responsible 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.030
 of his own birth 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:39.850
 because inside the fetus they are happening 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.850
 situations that will trigger the birth 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.480
 it's actually the fetus who starts everything 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.329
 the birth process but they are the 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.850
 changes in the mother that will determine 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:59.180
 the precise moment when it happens 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.240
 the weight of the fetus the aging of the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.390
 placenta and the accumulation of nitrites 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.880
 residuals in the amniotic fluid and 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.530
 alan toi of or stimulate the shaft 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:15.610
 hypothalamus adrenal hypophysis of the calf 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.610
 immediately before birth 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.079
 in the mother there have also been great 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.079
 changes 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.560
 already in the beginning of gestation a 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.090
 rapid increase in progesterone 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.490
 produced by an endocrine gland of 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.940
 the cow originated from the 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.830
 ovulation the corpus luteum that 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.830
 maintains until the end of pregnancy 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.409
 The function of progesterone is to avoid 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:49.499
 the appearance of ovulation is and jealousy 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:51.599
 during the premiere but also the 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:55.150
 progesterone blocks contractions 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:58.240
 of the uterus in pregnancy 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.730
 and also progesterone favors the 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.260
 formation of a mucous plug that closes 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.140
 the cervix 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.280
 this mucous plug prevents the entry of 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.280
 germs in the pregnant uterus 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.370
 if that were not enough under the influence of 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.230
 progesterone glands 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.230
 endometrial is from the uterus in the stages 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.420
 very early pregnancies have produced 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.150
 a nutritious substance for the embryo 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.860
 called uterine milk see how 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.860
 important has been progesterone 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.310
 but the elevated plateau levels of 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.260
 this hormone falls pretty quickly 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.480
 from the seventh month to reach 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.480
 basal levels at the time of delivery 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.400
 when the action of the 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.710
 progesterone grow estrogens that 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.230
 make the uterus sensitive to activity 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.780
 of oxytocin hormone that as we will see 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.850
 will play a key role in the 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.330
 expulsive phase of calf birth 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.370
 when contractions are needed 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.130
 'truly energetic 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.370
 We have seen that in many of the 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.919
 changes the calf even before birth has 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.419
 had an admirable participation a 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.090
 infinite lesson of strength and 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:18.580
 cooperation with the mother the synergy 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.580
 perfect between the cow and the fetus
