00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 to fall down to this two frames with 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:11.280
 brood I sent on top here turned 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:16.020
 on the contrary, bribes are still going on 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:23.210
 this top frame with brood I 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.210
 leave not pumped it in the middle of the nest 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.150
 here they are frames 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.540
 there were free frames after pumping the top 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:44.480
 the uterus came out of the top beginning of the worm 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:45.620
 did not pump open brood he 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.019
 goes in the middle 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:56.390
 This is a frame from under the curl which 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:58.540
 left they also open 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.540
 brood 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.949
 it was yours 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.570
 that is campo new in the middle of the nest 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.770
 one question is why am i not siphoning off and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.770
 framework 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.910
 formed us blades back perhaps 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:42.620
 let them blow with the edge if they want something 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:47.050
 and push the water side stand here 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.050
 diaphragm wistful as usual 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:33.360
 in this nest and here i grow pumped out 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.030
 4 frames of the top there is brood but 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.959
 they were at the bottom and on top of poison in a frame 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.959
 I pulled out weavers 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.640
 are open 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.530
 here 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.450
 But in a long time, the links did not download the alignment 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.450
 difference from the previous nest
