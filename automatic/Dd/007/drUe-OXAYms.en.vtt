00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 every year for jean-paul farmers it's the same 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.650
 finding 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.000
 hundreds of feet of maize bed and ears of corn partially nibble the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.690
 guilty they all know him here these boars bedtime it's already at 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.469
 least 15 days or three weeks I counted a dozen or so 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:16.730
 did not take pandora 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.310
 to note the Loiret b 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.880
 the delegates the moment gamers fight period it's in the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.039
 sector same place 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.769
 on corn growing 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.769
 according to culture that are quite expensive to put in place 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.609
 and to make sure that link a little bit annoying 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.409
 m to judge the extent of the damage an expert estimator is then contacted 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.740
 with the farmer he tries to assess the amount of damage even if they 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.400
 know that the wild boar will come back to boar the food the 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.620
 tranquility 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.840
 he will not want because of his sector in any case perfectly trained 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.930
 and damage records 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.000
 usually we prepare a recurrence in the next culture 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.490
 because in the meadows 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.830
 it's a little different 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.560
 for returns actually to find worms and in cultures and type 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.030
 malice they know very well that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.600
 so even if their 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.560
 of the parcel was returned they will find for food 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.030
 behind it must be said that for several years now the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.680
 wild boars have become acclimated to a new environment 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.390
 wooded areas to get closer to the agglomerations 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.500
 the losses in the crops that compose it are expensive they must 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.080
 fully be supported by the damage compensation fund 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.040
 which is incumbent on the federations of hunters it is besides one is not 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.470
 a hundred and fifty thousand euros of damage pretty much 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.620
 for a billboard last season of 900 in tickets 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.850
 so obviously we are to have a boar that is expensive in the vendee 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.540
 date for the simple reason is that our forest areas are 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.760
 so much our goal 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.640
 and is additionally count two areas of intense culture that boars not 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.400
 now spend more time in corn fields as we've just 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.990
 see for this acoustic comfort this result is however far 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.450
 it was 4-2 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.030
 and yet it is not for lack of hunting them regularly beaten are 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.189
 organized in the department to regulate wild boar populations 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.510
 this day about forty hunters are deployed after that 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.829
 one of them is seen the same morning a specimen 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.019
 after three hours of tracking the pig like donkeys the wound is already 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.739
 more than a hunting trophy 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.159
 for farmers and hunters it is one less certainly but it 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.079
 do not forget that we put three to wear every two years and that the 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.519
 phenomenon is therefore not about to stop
