00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone with you maracasi you are watching 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.220
 transfer the best tanks in nominations 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.830
 part 10 in patch 095 and developers 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.900
 lead new british fri-sau and 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.839
 one of them has an unusual 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.340
 ability she very quickly goes back 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.880
 and slowly forward 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.550
 I say of course Fri-Sau level 5 archer 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.910
 the speed of this car forward is only 12 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.119
 kilometers per hour even at t95 maximum 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.180
 speed more than 13 comment but to us 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.820
 given an elegant speed back 31 km per hour 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.170
 So it turns out that much faster 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.489
 drive in reverse 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.860
 which of course looks ridiculous and funny 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.160
 funny that in one of my fights I was driving 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.969
 back up quickly and the other archer was driving 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.489
 as usual 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.410
 and seeing me he began to turn around 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.010
 do you understand what other way to get 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.590
 faster for his position he doesn't have 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.899
 of course archer has no armor he 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.699
 completely cardboard and all its essence 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.369
 is to drive faster 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.010
 set up your position and there just 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.890
 become bushes somewhere and sniper 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.409
 but it's funny when you get exposed to light 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.930
 cancer, you're so fast at thirty 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.720
 one kilometer an hour ago already 5 of 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.290
 gaga broth for you can not get into 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.860
 Generally unusual and fun car 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.890
 Of course the gameplay is not so rosy 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.110
 it is this feature that is signed 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.750
 wins the highest nomination 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.820
 speed back among all tanks also 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.250
 interesting feature of this fri sau 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.280
 is a high chassis turning speed 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.380
 46 degrees per second for comparison y 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.409
 E25 44 degrees 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.950
 gun to its level at archer is quite 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.740
 powerful precise and penetrative so i would 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.860
 did not say that this fri-sau are weak 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.790
 it is too empty and on it 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.030
 play neatly next tank with us 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.580
 kv-220 he wins the most 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.590
 strong sides among heavy medium and 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.009
 light tanks from first to seventh 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.380
 apt-220 level would have won and signed everything 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.340
 and this level if the baths are British 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.400
 branch of such machine as AT-2 AT-7 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.850
 at-8 have in board 101 millimeters 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.459
 armor 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.750
 just one millimeter more than that 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.690
 kV-220 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.280
 that is, the difference is minor but 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.640
 worth noting that in my opinion 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.700
 KV-220 armor boards still stronger 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.360
 most likely due to thicker gusli 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.790
 when I have not played on the Q-220 and I'm everywhere 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.290
 heard about his incredibly strong sides 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.900
 for your level 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.000
 I didn't quite believe it, but when I 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.070
 I played on this tank, I realized that this 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.250
 really smart car for you 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.989
 boarding is so chic and 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.470
 which is much more profitable to substitute 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.720
 the enemy board at an angle than the forehead sometimes 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.209
 the tank is very surprised when you board 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.100
 can not penetrate several 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.860
 opponents from their calm 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.430
 dismantle the same tank is 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.560
 gun with a very weak penetration of just 99 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.900
 bb and 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.299
 121 gold of course it's a bit but 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.269
 It is worth noting that the tank is preferential 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.510
 level of battles and he hits the maximum to 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.360
 six so what is breaking through let's say 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.010
 so still acceptable this tank is very 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.810
 shows itself well against 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.810
 classmates with not high penetration 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.330
 there is enough to substitute the enemy board 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.549
 tilt and catch dozens of no penetrations 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.860
 field enemies with fire from his 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.280
 quick gun with average damage in 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.790
 110 at a rate of fire of 14 shots 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.010
 a minute at the cafe it turns out dpm 540 more 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.049
 which is not so bad considering the preferential 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.510
 level fights and good circular 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.230
 booking a tank will be to your taste 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.750
 lovers of tank and bend in the sand to 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.450
 Sorry to get this tanchik complicated 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.010
 as far as I know it is rarely sold and in 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.720
 basically you can get it by 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.110
 any action 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.810
 I personally liked to play on apt-220 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.500
 quite curious car though with 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.019
 their shortcomings are not only Germans 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.030
 lovers build yourself comfortable 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.340
 houses on tracks but also soviet 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.000
 engineers are also marked by creating this 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.120
 unit 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.880
 Meet Su-100 y huge shed on 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.370
 tracks inconsistent machine with one 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.950
 hand good dynamics with very powerful 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.230
 tool and a large alpha strike at 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.660
 this is huge and absolutely 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.420
 cardboard armor with a terrible disguise 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.420
 This signed many who not likes but under 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.370
 This there are those who liked it play 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.040
 I'll tell you on it is not so easy 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.160
 if you play as usual signed something 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.680
 You can shine and get very 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.500
 quickly if you go to the attack then 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.050
 disassemble even faster but still shooting 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.150
 on the enemy with the maximum distance 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.360
 is for this machine the most 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.580
 suitable tactics and so feeling y 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.550
 wins the biggest nomination 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.160
 cardboard pt-sau from first to 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.930
 level eight it's just really 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.850
 very big signed with bad 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.500
 booking any mistake on her 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.430
 instantly leads to loss of strength 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.860
 only 60 millimeters in the forehead of the case 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.880
 Of course difficult to break through the art although 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.700
 can punish 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.240
 almost all enemies easily pierce armor 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:36.050
 wait y is compensated by this extremely powerful 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.330
 tool with a ruler 196 alfa 440 this 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.060
 very much for the sixth level 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.510
 besides this car there is an interesting 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.130
 Gold breakthrough is the weakest 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.340
 171 but alpha more 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.310
 510 I do not even remember the car with the same 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.010
 an interesting feature sorry for the new 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.220
 su-100 y no fit level fights 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:01.370
 it costs three thousand 250 gold 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.720
 massively this whopper 65 tons more 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.210
 than u of 4 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.250
 given the good mobility possible 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.919
 effectively ram enemies though not 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.810
 I advise you to do it interesting that in 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.620
 rows of su-100 games to really 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.310
 only one thing was released 1940 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.800
 year 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.490
 and drying was even occasionally applied in 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.990
 the battle for Moscow in 1941 forty second 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.600
 years in winter 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.440
 overall rather unusual car on 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.390
 amateur 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.580
 well and on it all friends thanks for 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.160
 view don't forget to subscribe to 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:38.350
 channel and put likes I wish you all

 best see you soon
