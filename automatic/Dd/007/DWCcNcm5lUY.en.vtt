00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:12.849
 spirit itself with his hands 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:17.980
 you first need to shut off the valve which 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:20.260
 There is not only one hot mixer 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.480
 hot water tap can or 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:28.650
 cold switch but we 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:32.169
 hurt now we won't be after that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.010
 unscrew the crane itself for this 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:40.079
 we will need the following tools 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:44.229
 legs 2 adjustable wrench I took a screwdriver 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.069
 Phillips screwdriver flat pliers 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.440
 just in case 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:51.010
 Ours is interesting how to approve this 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:58.359
 plug checked by the way yes all the water 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:01:01.719
 no water no stub is supposed to 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:04.239
 turn away macy she boiled and you 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:11.850
 you can not and turn away you can take 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.850
 knife and in this way 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.490
 this way to get to volta 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:25.530
 which is inside 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.530
 Yes, we need a flat screwdriver 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:39.219
 unscrew the crane bush here we removed 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:42.520
 valve must now be removed itself 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.240
 crane should be careful not to 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.350
 break down 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.409
 fixture crane buksyu come in different forms 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.859
 different devices but this crane box 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:02:00.329
 such on with a stopper this stopper breaks 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:02:00.329
 very often so be careful 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:09.190
 and so here on to supporters 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.910
 trying not to turn away from 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.560
 is grown 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:35.470
 try to remove 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:38.800
 lock nut efforts the lock-nut and on all 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.930
 angles or frame nuts are far from 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.930
 at all now turn away 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:57.880
 like a sure crane and go to the store 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:03:01.569
 bathe exactly the same crane 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:06.930
 the store checked cranes it 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.930
 certainly not the best way 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.549
 I always come to the store and blow up 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.510
 repair kits I do not advise buying better 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:34.290
 buy the whole crane box especially as 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:34.290
 worth and not so expensive too expensive 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:49.099
 if the screen goose principle is normal i its 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:52.120
 now just sort out 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.120
 I put in place 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.699
 man store and checks crane 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:44.169
 not the best on the only 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:49.360
 possible way to say without checking 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:52.440
 pressure just come closes 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.440
 walk and out i'm blowing 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:01.300
 if blown take another soul tap 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:06.030
 if not blown then you can take on 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:09.940
 my husband and hid shop produits this 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:18.509
 for sure, and at your home will also be 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:23.849
 dig in where the crane has moved 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:31.500
 then everything is changing in the reverse order 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:35.169
 we are not with all our strength not with all our strength 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:40.050
 dragging out with all your strength 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.050
 because something can be broken 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:49.710
 pull up but always have time and something 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:52.710
 bury on control this too we 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.710
 delaying 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:04.750
 also not with all the power and the opposite 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:11.370
 okay insert the flywheel twist 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:15.539

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.539
