 third holstein kiel trainer horst 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.120
 Steffen and his boys made it 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.210
 unfortunately not the direct competitor 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.280
 to push deeply from the relegation place 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.589
 however, they could talk about one 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.650
 powerful season and the 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.480
 qualify for the dfb cup 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.790

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.040
 failures , the blue still wanted 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.739
 present one last time sovereign 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.059

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.909
 season to take home 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.909
 the first big chance for around 9,100 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.880
 spectators have our boys in the 22 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.760
 minute fabian gerster gets the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.790
 ball hung up and pulls out directly 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.010
 about 25 meters away 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:26.930
 Unfortunately, the game device sails a few 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:29.150
 meter at the gate over seven minutes 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.150
 later, the Degerlocher back on the ball 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.640
 through a misspeak by vincenzo 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.030
 marchese in a double pass with daniel kaiser 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.610

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.920
 kronholm fishes the leather out of the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.870
 air 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.850
 renewed misconduct of the host daniel 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.270

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.970
 missed the gate just very close 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.380
 besa hdmi has the eye playing sovereign 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.260
 through the defensive line 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.890
 unfortunately the chance did not come 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.890
 recycled 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.860
 five minutes before half-time break 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.170
 launches randy bonzo again 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.900

 daniel engelbrecht can demand the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.420
 But the bells bounce off 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.690

 exploits storks keeper kronholm can 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.560
 that clears up the first shot 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.840
 leather but right in front of the feet of 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.850

 zero to one shoots out of just under 20 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.090
 meters flat and dangerous yet kenneth 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:46.450
