lick<00:00:05.650> number<00:00:05.680> 49<00:00:06.340> is<00:00:06.580> called<00:00:07.000> more<00:00:07.420> faster<00:00:08.410> and

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
lick number 49 is called more faster and

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.470 
lick number 49 is called more faster and
one<00:00:09.520> of<00:00:09.610> the<00:00:09.700> things<00:00:09.879> that<00:00:10.000> you<00:00:10.090> learn<00:00:10.270> about

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
one of the things that you learn about

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.730 
one of the things that you learn about
Stevie<00:00:10.870> Ray<00:00:10.990> Vaughan's<00:00:11.230> playing<00:00:11.530> is<00:00:11.710> that

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
Stevie Ray Vaughan's playing is that

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.220 
Stevie Ray Vaughan's playing is that
while<00:00:12.309> he<00:00:12.340> possessed<00:00:13.000> a<00:00:13.150> lot<00:00:13.480> of<00:00:13.719> technical

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
while he possessed a lot of technical

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.820 
while he possessed a lot of technical
skill<00:00:15.040> for<00:00:15.280> playing<00:00:15.519> fast<00:00:15.820> he<00:00:16.090> didn't<00:00:16.390> really

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
skill for playing fast he didn't really

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.350 
skill for playing fast he didn't really
abuse<00:00:17.830> that<00:00:18.040> he<00:00:18.189> didn't<00:00:18.430> play<00:00:18.550> fast<00:00:19.060> for

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
abuse that he didn't play fast for

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.030 
abuse that he didn't play fast for
really<00:00:19.750> long<00:00:19.930> extended<00:00:20.349> periods<00:00:20.649> of<00:00:20.680> time<00:00:20.739> he

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
really long extended periods of time he

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.679 
really long extended periods of time he
had<00:00:21.220> restraint<00:00:21.790> and<00:00:22.029> so<00:00:22.480> we're<00:00:22.599> gonna

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
had restraint and so we're gonna

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.479 
had restraint and so we're gonna
exercise<00:00:23.230> some<00:00:23.439> of<00:00:23.560> that<00:00:23.649> restraint<00:00:24.160> and<00:00:24.310> this

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:24.489 
exercise some of that restraint and this

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:26.850 
exercise some of that restraint and this
lick<00:00:24.730> we're<00:00:24.880> gonna<00:00:24.970> have<00:00:25.239> some<00:00:25.480> slow<00:00:26.320> lead-in

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
lick we're gonna have some slow lead-in

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.220 
lick we're gonna have some slow lead-in
licks<00:00:27.130> to<00:00:27.369> build<00:00:27.610> some<00:00:27.790> anticipation<00:00:28.230> but

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
licks to build some anticipation but

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.019 
licks to build some anticipation but
when<00:00:29.410> we<00:00:29.529> do<00:00:29.829> really<00:00:30.130> get<00:00:30.369> into<00:00:30.730> it<00:00:30.880> we're

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
when we do really get into it we're

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.000 
when we do really get into it we're
slowly<00:00:31.540> going<00:00:31.930> to<00:00:31.989> build<00:00:32.259> the<00:00:32.410> speed<00:00:32.710> to<00:00:32.890> the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
slowly going to build the speed to the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.620 
slowly going to build the speed to the
point<00:00:33.250> where<00:00:33.399> we're<00:00:33.550> playing<00:00:33.820> as<00:00:34.000> fast<00:00:34.270> as<00:00:34.480> we

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
point where we're playing as fast as we

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.130 
point where we're playing as fast as we
can<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.649> so<00:00:36.280> it's<00:00:36.489> a<00:00:36.550> good<00:00:36.790> test<00:00:37.060> of<00:00:37.330> your

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
can and so it's a good test of your

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.070 
can and so it's a good test of your
ability<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.560> mix<00:00:38.950> different<00:00:39.420> speeds<00:00:40.420> of<00:00:40.720> licks

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
ability to mix different speeds of licks

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.870 
ability to mix different speeds of licks
all<00:00:41.380> together<00:00:41.620> in<00:00:41.950> one<00:00:41.980> sequence<00:00:42.400> we're<00:00:42.760> going

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
all together in one sequence we're going

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.210 
all together in one sequence we're going
to<00:00:42.940> be<00:00:43.000> playing<00:00:43.210> in<00:00:43.330> the<00:00:43.390> key<00:00:43.570> of<00:00:43.690> B<00:00:43.720> and<00:00:44.230> this

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
to be playing in the key of B and this

00:00:45.220 --> 00:01:52.090 
to be playing in the key of B and this
fits<00:00:45.430> over<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.700> one<00:00:45.910> chord

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.050 

one<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:53.250> things<00:01:53.400> that<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.580> feel<00:01:53.760> strongly

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
one of the things that I feel strongly

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.610 
one of the things that I feel strongly
about<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.870> you're<00:01:55.080> gonna<00:01:55.170> use<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.500> lot

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
about is that if you're gonna use a lot

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.380 
about is that if you're gonna use a lot
of<00:01:55.770> speed<00:01:56.190> you<00:01:56.220> oughta<00:01:56.580> learn<00:01:56.790> how<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.030> use<00:01:57.240> it

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
of speed you oughta learn how to use it

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.350 
of speed you oughta learn how to use it
responsibly<00:01:58.160> and<00:01:59.160> by<00:01:59.730> that<00:01:59.940> I<00:01:59.970> just<00:02:00.120> mean

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
responsibly and by that I just mean

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.600 
responsibly and by that I just mean
don't<00:02:01.230> make<00:02:01.410> it<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> only<00:02:01.860> thing<00:02:01.980> that<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.369> do

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
don't make it the only thing that you do

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.670 
don't make it the only thing that you do
so<00:02:02.940> for<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.630> lick<00:02:03.869> we're<00:02:04.080> gonna<00:02:04.229> exercise<00:02:04.650> a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
so for this lick we're gonna exercise a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.080 
so for this lick we're gonna exercise a
little<00:02:04.979> restraint<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.550> we're<00:02:05.640> gonna<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:06.060> a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
little restraint and we're gonna have a

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.449 
little restraint and we're gonna have a
couple<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.630> easy<00:02:06.990> lead-in<00:02:07.470> licks<00:02:10.190> now<00:02:11.190> we<00:02:11.280> wait

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
couple of easy lead-in licks now we wait

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.350 
couple of easy lead-in licks now we wait
another<00:02:11.670> bar<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.500> then<00:02:17.370> we<00:02:17.520> get<00:02:17.640> into<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
another bar and then we get into the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.600 
another bar and then we get into the
main<00:02:18.660> thing<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.680> we're<00:02:19.980> learning<00:02:20.130> here<00:02:20.430> and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
main thing that we're learning here and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.790 
main thing that we're learning here and
this<00:02:21.150> lick<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.390> divided<00:02:21.959> into<00:02:22.080> three<00:02:22.500> phases

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
this lick is divided into three phases

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.910 
this lick is divided into three phases
kind<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.550> slow<00:02:23.880> medium<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.900> then<00:02:25.230> super<00:02:25.680> fast

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
kind of slow medium and then super fast

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.340 
kind of slow medium and then super fast
so<00:02:26.490> let's<00:02:26.640> go<00:02:26.820> with<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> slow<00:02:27.300> part<00:02:27.570> first<00:02:27.810> we're

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
so let's go with a slow part first we're

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.620 
so let's go with a slow part first we're
gonna<00:02:28.410> do<00:02:28.650> three<00:02:28.980> repetitions<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.910> our<00:02:30.209> loop

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
gonna do three repetitions of our loop

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.000 
gonna do three repetitions of our loop
lick<00:02:31.110> number<00:02:31.260> two<00:02:31.590> loop

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.410 

then<00:02:38.010> we're<00:02:38.160> going<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.430> do<00:02:38.790> lick<00:02:39.360> one<00:02:41.420> but

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
then we're going to do lick one but

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.850 
then we're going to do lick one but
you're<00:02:42.540> gonna<00:02:42.660> do<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.870> slowly<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.650> very

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
you're gonna do it slowly and very

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.350 
you're gonna do it slowly and very
deliberately<00:02:44.400> trying<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.820> pick<00:02:45.060> all<00:02:45.210> those

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
deliberately trying to pick all those

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.670 
deliberately trying to pick all those
notes<00:02:47.660> then<00:02:48.660> we're<00:02:48.780> gonna<00:02:48.900> pick<00:02:49.140> up<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.410> speed

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
notes then we're gonna pick up the speed

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.200 
notes then we're gonna pick up the speed
a<00:02:49.740> little<00:02:49.830> bit<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.310> we're<00:02:50.460> gonna<00:02:50.580> do<00:02:50.790> lick<00:02:51.030> one

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
a little bit and we're gonna do lick one

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.640 
a little bit and we're gonna do lick one
into<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.720> hammer<00:02:51.960> ons<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:54.530> then<00:02:55.530> you're

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
into the hammer ons and then you're

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.200 
into the hammer ons and then you're
gonna<00:02:55.740> start<00:02:56.100> our<00:02:56.280> top<00:02:56.550> down<00:02:58.520> okay<00:02:59.520> so<00:03:00.000> that

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
gonna start our top down okay so that

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.690 
gonna start our top down okay so that
part<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.570> played<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.840> little<00:03:01.020> bit<00:03:01.170> faster<00:03:03.230> and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
part is played a little bit faster and

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.340 
part is played a little bit faster and
then<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:05.910> into<00:03:06.210> our<00:03:06.240> super<00:03:06.810> fast<00:03:07.080> part

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
then we get into our super fast part

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.740 
then we get into our super fast part
we're<00:03:07.530> gonna<00:03:07.680> play<00:03:07.860> lick<00:03:08.100> one<00:03:08.280> into<00:03:08.730> our<00:03:08.910> upper

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
we're gonna play lick one into our upper

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.010

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:45.370 
our way right back up to that g-string
there<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:44.420> then<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:44.630> just<00:03:44.810> tag<00:03:45.020> it<00:03:45.050> with<00:03:45.260> that

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
four chord at bar number five so we're

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.980

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
right so that's a lot going on not much

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.230 
right so that's a lot going on not much
of<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:02.240> is<00:04:02.480> new<00:04:03.010> but<00:04:04.010> it<00:04:04.130> is<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:04.850> know<00:04:04.880> it
