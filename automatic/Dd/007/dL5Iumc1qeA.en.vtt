00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
powerup now it is pretty random it you

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.050 
powerup now it is pretty random it you
know<00:00:39.340> it's<00:00:39.460> not<00:00:39.520> something<00:00:39.820> where<00:00:39.970> you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
know it's not something where you

know it's not something where you
automatically<00:00:40.600> set<00:00:40.870> it<00:00:40.960> up<00:00:41.079> and<00:00:41.230> it<00:00:41.320> changes

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
automatically set it up and it changes

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.430 
automatically set it up and it changes
it<00:00:41.770> to<00:00:41.800> something<00:00:42.240> that<00:00:43.240> you<00:00:43.660> want<00:00:43.960> so<00:00:44.260> it

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
could be double points it could be a

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.270 
could be double points it could be a
nuke<00:00:46.450> it<00:00:46.690> could<00:00:46.840> be<00:00:47.020> you<00:00:47.470> know<00:00:47.620> carpenter

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
nuke it could be you know carpenter

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.820 
nuke it could be you know carpenter
could<00:00:48.460> be<00:00:48.550> whatever<00:00:48.750> he<00:00:49.750> decides<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.350> use<00:00:50.650> at

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
could be whatever he decides to use at

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.600 
could be whatever he decides to use at
the<00:00:50.920> moment<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.360> it's<00:00:52.840> a<00:00:52.930> really<00:00:53.080> cool<00:00:53.320> way<00:00:53.530> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the moment so it's a really cool way to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.710 
the moment so it's a really cool way to
to<00:00:54.610> you<00:00:54.910> know<00:00:55.000> kind<00:00:55.210> of<00:00:55.270> have<00:00:55.360> fun<00:00:55.510> with<00:00:55.630> the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
to you know kind of have fun with the

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.180 
to you know kind of have fun with the
map<00:00:55.900> obviously<00:00:56.380> this<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:56.590> something<00:00:56.740> that<00:00:56.980> is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
map obviously this is something that is

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.650 
map obviously this is something that is
not<00:00:57.400> at<00:00:57.610> first<00:00:57.790> I<00:00:57.970> thought<00:00:58.120> it<00:00:58.270> would<00:00:58.360> be<00:00:58.540> like

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
not at first I thought it would be like

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.330 
not at first I thought it would be like
a<00:00:58.720> game-breaking<00:00:59.200> thing<00:00:59.500> you<00:00:59.650> can<00:01:00.010> get<00:01:00.130> a<00:01:00.160> nuke

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
a game-breaking thing you can get a nuke

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.480 
a game-breaking thing you can get a nuke
whenever<00:01:00.580> you<00:01:00.670> want<00:01:00.910> but<00:01:01.120> honestly<00:01:02.490> you're

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
whenever you want but honestly you're

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.490 
whenever you want but honestly you're
not<00:01:03.640> going<00:01:03.790> to<00:01:03.850> be<00:01:03.940> able<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.269> you<00:01:05.110> need<00:01:05.229> to<00:01:05.290> have

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
not going to be able to you need to have

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.929 
not going to be able to you need to have
time<00:01:05.799> and<00:01:06.040> you<00:01:06.100> need<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.310> be<00:01:06.400> able<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.700> do<00:01:06.820> this

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
time and you need to be able to do this

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.340 
time and you need to be able to do this
with<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.390> clear<00:01:07.420> head<00:01:07.659> and<00:01:07.869> not<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.140> lot<00:01:08.320> of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
with a clear head and not a lot of

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.170 
with a clear head and not a lot of
zombies<00:01:08.530> swarming<00:01:09.159> you<00:01:09.250> at<00:01:09.369> the<00:01:09.460> same<00:01:09.640> time<00:01:09.939> so

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
zombies swarming you at the same time so

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.300 
zombies swarming you at the same time so
it's<00:01:10.330> not<00:01:10.479> something<00:01:10.689> where<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.890> can<00:01:12.009> be<00:01:12.130> in<00:01:12.220> a

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
it's not something where you can be in a

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.130 
it's not something where you can be in a
pack<00:01:12.549> of<00:01:12.729> horde<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.119> zombies<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.780> then<00:01:13.899> give

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
pack of horde of zombies and then give

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.899 
pack of horde of zombies and then give
it<00:01:14.259> to<00:01:14.380> Leroy<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:14.979> then<00:01:15.100> use<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.490> nuke<00:01:15.700> you

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
it to Leroy and then use the nuke you

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:16.950 
it to Leroy and then use the nuke you
know<00:01:16.030> maybe<00:01:16.210> you<00:01:16.359> could<00:01:16.450> have<00:01:16.719> all<00:01:16.840> the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
know maybe you could have all the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.630 
know maybe you could have all the
zombies<00:01:17.079> training<00:01:17.619> somewhere<00:01:17.979> and<00:01:18.249> you<00:01:18.520> can

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
zombies training somewhere and you can

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.669 
zombies training somewhere and you can
have<00:01:18.789> Leroy<00:01:19.090> doing<00:01:19.420> this<00:01:19.539> but<00:01:20.049> in<00:01:20.320> terms<00:01:20.499> of

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
have Leroy doing this but in terms of

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.590 
have Leroy doing this but in terms of
playing<00:01:20.920> solo<00:01:21.429> you<00:01:22.060> know<00:01:22.149> you'd<00:01:22.299> be<00:01:22.359> getting

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
playing solo you know you'd be getting

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.389 
playing solo you know you'd be getting
the<00:01:22.899> power<00:01:23.229> up<00:01:23.499> towards<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.829> end<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:24.130> a<00:01:24.219> round

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399
