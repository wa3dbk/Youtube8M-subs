go<00:00:26.339> about<00:00:26.519> answering<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:27.000> question<00:00:27.210> well

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
go about answering that question well

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.839 
go about answering that question well
it's<00:00:28.349> complicated<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:29.009> this<00:00:29.130> much<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.519> useful

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
it's complicated but this much is useful

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.849 
it's complicated but this much is useful
for<00:00:29.970> us<00:00:30.089> laypeople<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.660> know<00:00:30.869> if<00:00:31.320> two<00:00:31.650> things

for us laypeople to know if two things

for us laypeople to know if two things
are<00:00:32.009> correlated<00:00:32.310> but<00:00:32.790> scientists<00:00:33.210> can't<00:00:33.420> find

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
are correlated but scientists can't find

are correlated but scientists can't find
a<00:00:33.690> way<00:00:33.810> to<00:00:33.870> feasibly<00:00:34.320> explain<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> mechanism

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
a way to feasibly explain the mechanism

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.430 
a way to feasibly explain the mechanism
by<00:00:35.579> which<00:00:35.610> one<00:00:35.940> influences<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.840> other<00:00:36.870> that

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
by which one influences the other that

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.080 
by which one influences the other that
is<00:00:37.590> they<00:00:37.740> can't<00:00:37.980> explain<00:00:38.340> why<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:38.940> would

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
is they can't explain why one would

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.670 
is they can't explain why one would
cause<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> other<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:40.440> are<00:00:40.530> not

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
cause the other then they are not

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.740 
cause the other then they are not
considered<00:00:41.190> cause-and-effect<00:00:41.510> that<00:00:42.510> doesn't

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
considered cause-and-effect that doesn't

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.850 
considered cause-and-effect that doesn't
mean<00:00:42.840> science<00:00:43.200> says<00:00:43.410> they<00:00:43.590> aren't

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
mean science says they aren't

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.690 
mean science says they aren't
cause-and-effect

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
cause-and-effect

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.640 
cause-and-effect
it<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.360> means<00:00:45.480> science<00:00:45.870> says<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.320> don't<00:00:46.500> have

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
it just means science says we don't have

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.810 
it just means science says we don't have
any<00:00:46.830> reason<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.190> believe<00:00:47.310> that<00:00:47.490> they<00:00:47.700> are

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
any reason to believe that they are

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.550 
any reason to believe that they are
causing<00:00:48.090> effect<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.960> they<00:00:49.080> are<00:00:49.170> always<00:00:49.350> open

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
causing effect but they are always open

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.920 
causing effect but they are always open
to<00:00:49.740> future<00:00:50.040> ideas<00:00:50.220> and<00:00:50.610> evidence<00:00:51.000> sometimes

to future ideas and evidence sometimes

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.390 
to future ideas and evidence sometimes
you<00:00:52.170> hear<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.380> criticism<00:00:52.590> scientists<00:00:53.250> can't

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
you hear the criticism scientists can't

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.710 
you hear the criticism scientists can't
even<00:00:53.550> predict<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:53.850> weather<00:00:53.970> so<00:00:54.390> why<00:00:54.540> should

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
even predict the weather so why should

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.030 
even predict the weather so why should
we<00:00:54.750> listen<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.110> them<00:00:55.290> about<00:00:55.380> something<00:00:55.710> even

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
we listen to them about something even

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.490 
we listen to them about something even
bigger<00:00:56.130> like<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> climate<00:00:57.110> well<00:00:58.110> that's<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
bigger like the climate well that's a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.960 
bigger like the climate well that's a
little<00:00:58.650> bit<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:58.920> saying<00:00:59.130> mathematicians

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
little bit like saying mathematicians

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.340 
little bit like saying mathematicians
can't<00:01:00.150> even<00:01:00.300> predict<00:01:00.570> how<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.810> coin<00:01:01.080> flip

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
can't even predict how this coin flip

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.540 
can't even predict how this coin flip
will<00:01:01.470> turn<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:01.920> why<00:01:02.040> should<00:01:02.220> we<00:01:02.250> listen<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
will turn out so why should we listen to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.860 
will turn out so why should we listen to
their<00:01:02.730> predictions<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.150> how<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.300> million<00:01:03.720> coin

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
their predictions of how a million coin

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410 
their predictions of how a million coin
flips<00:01:04.170> turn<00:01:04.350> out<00:01:04.640> climate<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.729> about<00:01:05.909> averages

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
flips turn out climate is about averages

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 
flips turn out climate is about averages
and<00:01:06.600> overall<00:01:06.990> trends<00:01:07.439> which<00:01:07.590> are<00:01:07.680> easier<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and overall trends which are easier to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.650 
and overall trends which are easier to
predict<00:01:08.610> than<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.940> particular<00:01:09.090> occurrence

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
predict than a particular occurrence

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.780 
predict than a particular occurrence
also<00:01:10.620> the<00:01:10.950> predictions<00:01:11.340> are<00:01:11.430> getting<00:01:11.640> better

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
also the predictions are getting better

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.360 
also the predictions are getting better
and<00:01:12.030> better<00:01:12.090> over<00:01:12.630> time<00:01:12.860> remember<00:01:13.860> science

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
and better over time remember science

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.130 
and better over time remember science
never<00:01:14.640> claims<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.330> exactly<00:01:15.840> correct

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
answer that's just a misconception and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.060 
answer that's just a misconception and

of science means that it tends to

common<00:04:32.620> criticism<00:04:33.160> is<00:04:33.370> have<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.000> ever<00:04:34.120> ridden

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
common criticism is have you ever ridden

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.270 
common criticism is have you ever ridden
on<00:04:34.420> a<00:04:34.480> modern<00:04:34.810> airliner<00:04:34.990> because<00:04:35.950> they're<00:04:36.130> all

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
on a modern airliner because they're all

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.070 
on a modern airliner because they're all
designed<00:04:36.520> on<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:36.910> computer<00:04:37.030> model<00:04:37.900> on<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
then physical models and finally

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.840 
then physical models and finally
computer<00:04:41.620> models<00:04:41.890> again<00:04:42.130> which<00:04:42.490> is<00:04:42.610> where<00:04:42.760> the

computer models again which is where the

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.820 
computer models again which is where the
pilots<00:04:43.150> actually<00:04:43.420> learn<00:04:43.570> to<00:04:43.600> fly<00:04:43.930> them<00:04:44.170> when

pilots actually learn to fly them when
the<00:04:44.920> Boeing<00:04:45.160> 777<00:04:45.550> was<00:04:46.120> first<00:04:46.360> flown<00:04:46.600> all<00:04:46.870> the

that<00:04:51.040> it<00:04:51.160> would<00:04:51.220> fly<00:04:51.460> why<00:04:52.270> because<00:04:53.230> we've

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
that it would fly why because we've

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.900 
that it would fly why because we've
learned<00:04:53.560> how<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.710> make<00:04:53.920> good<00:04:54.130> computer<00:04:54.460> models

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
learned how to make good computer models

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.340 
learned how to make good computer models
by<00:04:55.060> tweaking<00:04:55.330> them<00:04:55.600> until<00:04:55.840> their<00:04:55.960> output

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
by tweaking them until their output

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.960 
by tweaking them until their output
matches<00:04:57.070> what<00:04:57.220> we<00:04:57.310> see<00:04:57.460> in<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.640> physical

debate<00:06:01.960> about<00:06:01.990> whether<00:06:02.320> we're<00:06:02.590> the<00:06:02.650> ones

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
debate about whether we're the ones

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.980 
debate about whether we're the ones
causing<00:06:03.040> it<00:06:03.310> taking<00:06:04.240> action<00:06:04.540> may<00:06:04.660> make<00:06:04.810> things

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
causing it taking action may make things

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.740 
causing it taking action may make things
worse<00:06:05.230> climate<00:06:06.190> changes<00:06:06.490> all<00:06:06.580> the<00:06:06.670> time<00:06:06.850> we're

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
worse climate changes all the time we're

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.240 
worse climate changes all the time we're
coming<00:06:07.930> out<00:06:08.110> of<00:06:08.170> a<00:06:08.260> cold<00:06:08.440> cycle<00:06:08.680> so<00:06:08.980> this<00:06:09.130> is

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
coming out of a cold cycle so this is

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.730 
coming out of a cold cycle so this is
natural<00:06:09.630> 100<00:06:10.630> years<00:06:10.840> of<00:06:10.990> data<00:06:11.140> is<00:06:11.320> not<00:06:11.470> enough

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
natural 100 years of data is not enough

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.940 
natural 100 years of data is not enough
to<00:06:11.860> know<00:06:11.950> 1000<00:06:12.610> years<00:06:12.790> of<00:06:12.970> past<00:06:13.300> climate

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
to know 1000 years of past climate

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.990 
to know 1000 years of past climate
personally<00:06:14.950> I<00:06:15.070> don't<00:06:15.160> think<00:06:15.340> global<00:06:15.730> warming

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
personally I don't think global warming

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.940 
personally I don't think global warming
is<00:06:16.120> as<00:06:16.270> definitely<00:06:16.660> man<00:06:16.990> cause<00:06:17.260> as<00:06:17.530> popular

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
is as definitely man cause as popular

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.950 
is as definitely man cause as popular
media<00:06:18.220> make<00:06:18.430> it<00:06:18.520> out<00:06:18.640> to<00:06:18.730> be<00:06:18.760> that's<00:06:19.750> my

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
media make it out to be that's my

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.410 
media make it out to be that's my
favorite<00:06:20.320> personally<00:06:21.190> I<00:06:21.340> think<00:06:21.420> we're

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
favorite personally I think we're

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.790 
favorite personally I think we're
talking<00:06:22.690> the<00:06:22.750> most<00:06:22.840> complex<00:06:23.290> science<00:06:23.650> in<00:06:23.740> the

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
talking the most complex science in the

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.770 
talking the most complex science in the

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
history of humankind chaos theory was

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.420 
history of humankind chaos theory was
discovered<00:06:26.350> studying<00:06:26.770> weather<00:06:26.980> systems

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
discovered studying weather systems

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.210 
discovered studying weather systems
personally<00:06:28.330> I<00:06:28.540> think<00:06:28.600> who<00:06:29.590> the<00:06:29.740> heck<00:06:29.890> are<00:06:29.920> you

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
personally I think who the heck are you

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.670 
personally I think who the heck are you
to<00:06:30.370> say<00:06:30.520> what<00:06:30.670> the<00:06:30.760> physical<00:06:31.060> truth<00:06:31.300> is<00:06:31.680> but

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
to say what the physical truth is but

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.080 
to say what the physical truth is but
then<00:06:32.830> I<00:06:32.860> admit<00:06:33.310> I<00:06:33.430> fell<00:06:33.610> into<00:06:33.730> a<00:06:33.820> similar

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
then I admit I fell into a similar

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.030 
then I admit I fell into a similar
mistake<00:06:34.510> of<00:06:34.690> being<00:06:34.900> absolute<00:06:35.500> claiming<00:06:35.920> in

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
mistake of being absolute claiming in

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.830 
mistake of being absolute claiming in
that<00:06:36.160> video<00:06:36.520> that<00:06:36.580> the<00:06:36.970> only<00:06:37.390> choice<00:06:37.660> is

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
that video that the only choice is

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.750 
that video that the only choice is
column<00:06:38.140> a<00:06:38.230> who<00:06:38.890> the<00:06:38.920> heck<00:06:39.130> are<00:06:39.310> we<00:06:39.460> to<00:06:39.640> think

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
column a who the heck are we to think

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.880 
column a who the heck are we to think
we've<00:06:39.940> got<00:06:40.120> a<00:06:40.150> lock<00:06:40.360> on<00:06:40.540> truth<00:06:40.840> have<00:06:41.680> you<00:06:41.740> ever

we've got a lock on truth have you ever

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:42.850 
we've got a lock on truth have you ever
been<00:06:42.040> completely<00:06:42.400> sure

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
been completely sure

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.959 
been completely sure
something<00:06:43.159> and<00:06:43.310> then<00:06:43.490> turned<00:06:43.669> out<00:06:43.789> to<00:06:43.879> be

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:43.969 
something and then turned out to be

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:45.700 
something and then turned out to be
wrong<00:06:44.240> shouldn't<00:06:45.050> that<00:06:45.139> temper<00:06:45.590> our

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
wrong shouldn't that temper our

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.110 
wrong shouldn't that temper our
confidence<00:06:46.129> but<00:06:46.340> next<00:06:46.490> time<00:06:46.669> we<00:06:46.789> feel<00:06:46.939> that

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
confidence but next time we feel that

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.059 
confidence but next time we feel that
way<00:06:47.300> it<00:06:48.080> should<00:06:48.259> give<00:06:48.379> you<00:06:48.500> pause<00:06:48.680> when<00:06:48.979> the

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:49.069 
way it should give you pause when the

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:50.649 
way it should give you pause when the
trained<00:06:49.310> person<00:06:49.669> is<00:06:49.819> less<00:06:50.090> certain<00:06:50.449> of

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:50.659 
trained person is less certain of

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:52.480 
trained person is less certain of
themselves<00:06:51.050> than<00:06:51.289> the<00:06:51.379> untrained<00:06:51.830> person<00:06:52.099> I

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
themselves than the untrained person I

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.309 
themselves than the untrained person I
was<00:06:53.240> certainly<00:06:53.509> humbled<00:06:53.870> by<00:06:53.960> the<00:06:54.020> unexpected

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 
was certainly humbled by the unexpected

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.230 
was certainly humbled by the unexpected
explosion<00:06:55.250> in<00:06:55.340> my<00:06:55.430> classroom<00:06:55.879> that<00:06:56.060> I<00:06:56.090> was

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
explosion in my classroom that I was

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.999 
explosion in my classroom that I was
described<00:06:56.780> in<00:06:56.870> the<00:06:56.930> video<00:06:57.080> I<00:06:57.469> hope<00:06:57.590> I'm<00:06:57.800> wrong

00:06:57.999 --> 00:06:58.009 
described in the video I hope I'm wrong

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.429 
described in the video I hope I'm wrong
I<00:06:58.280> guess<00:06:59.150> the<00:06:59.300> bottom<00:06:59.389> line<00:06:59.569> lesson<00:07:00.050> here<00:07:00.289> is

00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:00.439 
I guess the bottom line lesson here is

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:01.869 
I guess the bottom line lesson here is
that<00:07:00.620> we<00:07:00.740> will<00:07:00.860> probably<00:07:01.039> do<00:07:01.460> better<00:07:01.669> for

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879 
that we will probably do better for

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:02.409 
that we will probably do better for
ourselves

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 
ourselves

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.950 
ourselves
and<00:07:02.569> for<00:07:02.810> the<00:07:02.900> whole<00:07:03.080> with<00:07:03.560> some<00:07:03.740> humility

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
and for the whole with some humility

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.450 
and for the whole with some humility
look<00:07:05.960> I<00:07:06.199> don't<00:07:06.469> have<00:07:06.770> the<00:07:06.919> answers<00:07:07.250> I'm

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
look I don't have the answers I'm

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.059 
look I don't have the answers I'm
neither<00:07:07.969> probably<00:07:08.539> to<00:07:08.689> you<00:07:08.840> but<00:07:09.590> we<00:07:09.800> as<00:07:10.039> a

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:10.069 
neither probably to you but we as a

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:12.189 
neither probably to you but we as a
people<00:07:10.310> as<00:07:10.669> a<00:07:10.699> species<00:07:11.060> can<00:07:11.539> probably<00:07:11.780> come<00:07:12.169> up

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 
people as a species can probably come up

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:14.050 
people as a species can probably come up
with<00:07:12.319> something<00:07:12.680> that's<00:07:12.830> decent<00:07:13.039> will<00:07:13.849> it<00:07:13.939> be

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
with something that's decent will it be

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.469 
with something that's decent will it be
right

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 
right

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.350 
right
will<00:07:14.840> it<00:07:14.960> work<00:07:14.990> we<00:07:15.979> can't<00:07:16.189> know<00:07:16.310> for<00:07:16.340> sure<00:07:16.550> well

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
will it work we can't know for sure well

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.409 
will it work we can't know for sure well
it'd<00:07:17.449> be<00:07:17.509> better<00:07:17.659> than<00:07:17.750> nothing<00:07:18.110> probably<00:07:18.830> I

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:19.419 
it'd be better than nothing probably I

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:21.580 
it'd be better than nothing probably I
forget<00:07:20.419> where<00:07:20.569> I<00:07:20.599> read<00:07:20.810> it<00:07:20.930> maybe<00:07:21.169> it<00:07:21.289> was<00:07:21.379> even

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.590 
forget where I read it maybe it was even

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.800 
forget where I read it maybe it was even
a<00:07:21.680> bumper<00:07:21.979> sticker<00:07:22.009> lol<00:07:22.789> but<00:07:23.180> I<00:07:23.240> recently<00:07:23.479> came

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:23.810 
a bumper sticker lol but I recently came

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.059 
a bumper sticker lol but I recently came
across<00:07:23.870> a<00:07:24.139> line<00:07:24.409> that<00:07:24.560> I<00:07:24.590> think<00:07:24.830> pretty<00:07:24.979> well

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:25.069 
across a line that I think pretty well

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:26.559 
across a line that I think pretty well
sums<00:07:25.340> up<00:07:25.550> the<00:07:25.639> lesson<00:07:25.819> and<00:07:26.029> humility<00:07:26.360> that

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:26.569 
sums up the lesson and humility that

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:28.779 
sums up the lesson and humility that
scientific<00:07:27.169> thinking<00:07:27.469> teaches<00:07:27.860> us<00:07:28.039> and<00:07:28.219> I

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:28.789 
scientific thinking teaches us and I

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:30.399 
scientific thinking teaches us and I
suspect<00:07:29.210> it<00:07:29.300> may<00:07:29.419> help<00:07:29.569> us<00:07:29.779> make<00:07:29.930> some<00:07:30.080> headway

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:30.409 
suspect it may help us make some headway

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:31.629 
suspect it may help us make some headway
in<00:07:30.529> this<00:07:30.650> whole<00:07:30.800> discussion<00:07:31.129> of<00:07:31.340> what<00:07:31.460> to<00:07:31.550> do
