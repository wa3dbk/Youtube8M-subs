 finely chopped and a laurel leaf 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.690
 let's boil the water with the 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.390
 panela to high heat here we have the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.460
 boiling panela let's reduce the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.460
 fire for her to leave 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.340
 caramelized here we have left more or 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.570
 minus 15 minutes when this is 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.890

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.430
 the onions and we do not want to feel it like that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.430
 we can liquefy it 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.759
 we mix it 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:26.460
 and we leave it there another 5 minutes to 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.469
 low fire since it is well caramelized 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.069

 let's remove it from the fire if we want 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.020
 we can liquefy it so that it is not going to 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.819
 get with no lumps here we have already 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.310
