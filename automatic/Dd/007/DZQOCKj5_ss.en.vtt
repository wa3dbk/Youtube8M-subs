 I want to go bag good point october r 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.870
 Hi. Welcome to the board. 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.059
 In this class we will start with the groups 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.820
 vertebrates and let's talk about the 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.770
 then starting sag births 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.980
 let's first understand the name of this 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:27.580
 group a is the negation prefix and gnatus 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.940
 means jawbone then the agnate are 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.250
 animals that do not have a jaw and 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.070
 what animals are these group bonuses 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.420
 alienated we find the lampreys and 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.370
 the witch fish 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.770
 In this class we are going to talk about the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.050
 lamps that are found animals 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.760
 mainly in North America 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.020
 and you know what the body of a 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.920
 lamprey good lamprey have the 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.370
 well-elongated cylindrical body they can 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.610
 reach up to one meter in length 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.840
 they have very smooth skin without 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.420
 Scales 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.909
 but in this skin there are several glands 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.010
 crazy producers 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.520
 those glands that are here 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.290
 represented will produce a mucus that 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.990
 will be very important for the 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.240
 lubricating the animal's body 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.880
 the lampreys also lack 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.320
 paris fins as we will see in the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.930
 fish lessons 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.020
 they have only one fin 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:33.490
 dorsal region that lies here in 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.979
 back and a fin here in the region of 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.310
 tail that we call a fin 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:42.430
 these fins are important. 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.530
 for the movement of the animal but 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.200
 main feature of lampreys 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.770
 which you probably already have seen 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.729
 in books is that circular mouth that 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.979
 mouths 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.110
 because these animals do not have the 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.729
 jaw and they can be called 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.939
 Cyclists also mean 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.280
 circular and it takes or tongue then 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.399
 are animals that present the mouth 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.909
 circulate inside that mouth 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.840
 we found several dumb asses and 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.349
 also a line 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.709
 the water that is a hard drag tongue and 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.410
 the lampreys have lateral eyes 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.019
 which are located on the side of the 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.050
 body and it is important to remember that the 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:33.610
 of these animals is very aggressive. 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.200
 the lampreys are ectoparasites and from 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.650
 from this circular mouth 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.799
 she fixes herself on other fish and starts 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.849
 sugar blood of these animals 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:50.310
 good the lamprey presents a phase of 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:53.019
 wash this lava is called love 7 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.480
 generally are blind larvae that 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.030
 buried in the river bottom 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.989
 this larval stage can last up to seven 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.579
 years 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.030
 the long will then go through a 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:07.090
 metamorphosis and will become a 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.780
 adult individual who is the one that we 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.220
 represent adults will migrate to 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.489
 the sea and the sea 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.010
 they will suffer sexual maturity 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.910
 This means what it means to go. 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.769
 to happen 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.739
 the development of organs 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.840
 and I want you to have 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.630
 much attention to this detail here I 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:34.000
 I said that the lava phase is found 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.019
 in the rivers and the adult phase found in 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.560
 nose 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.290
 then after the metamorphosis the adults will 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.130
 to the sea at sea will happen 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.680
 sexual maturity will happen to 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.519
 and then these individuals will 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.669
 return to the rivers in the rivers will 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.560
 happen deposition of eggs 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.590
 so much attention that the lampreys 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.530
 can be found in both 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.989
 as in water environments 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.150
 and there for the development of the 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.120
 animal is very important that they 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.480
 pass through these two environments 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.209
 well, that's it, we'll end up here with 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.609
 the agnÃ¡tus in the next class 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.479
 Let's start with the fish I hope there. 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.479
 See you
