00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.719
 next what we are going to see are 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.840
 two of the tools that go our way 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.800
 to come good especially in this course 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.590
 which are the groups and the pages in this 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.689
 case I will not go into detail on how 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.270
 configure the or how to create them since what 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.189
 let's see in the second part of the 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.869
 second lesson of this module then 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.300
 here what we are going to see a bit is the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.489
 general structure and above all 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.350
 how do they work then on the one hand 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.080
 let's see the pages in this case the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.490
 cabinet from education and here we go 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.160
 to see that it is very similar to what is 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.770
 structure of a profile we found a 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.370
 headed with one image and then another 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.329
 profile picture which is the one that will appear 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.480
 specifically every time it is published 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.610
 something in the pages the main idea of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.530
 the pages is to be followed that is to say that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.300
 someone give to I like this page 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.790
 so that by the time the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.970
 that gives megusta start to see 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.830
 all your publications so 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.640
 updated on his on his wall in his 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.380
 in your area news or news 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.080
 that is, when I entered my profile 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.120
 I can see all those new 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.160
 publications of those pages to which 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.170
 I still have to go to this area 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.030
 where do you like and that is to say 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.460
 I like it and at the moment when I already 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.460
 I follow this page so I will see its all its 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.530
 information we can also enter 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.460
 directly to the page and see all the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.980
 publications that go that have gone 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.540
 publishing throughout its history 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.780
 where we find them in this area 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.700
 central to the right where you see appear 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.920
 all these publications and I'm going to 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.100
 to interact with them to be able to give 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.490
 I like to comment or share it 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.410
 for example in let's say in my area 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.780
 news so that my friends then 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.700
 can see publications in this case of 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.410
 this page 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.479
 also according to how the 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.850
 page I can also as a user 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.429
 then I can write on the page though 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.590
 that information will not appear in a 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.380
 relevant way is to say as main 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.280
 since always important information 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.310
 the bar 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.970
 the page is going to be the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.790
 administrator or in this case the teacher 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.709
 the one that always publishes the name of the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.920
 page and all these publications are going to 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.530
 be the main ones then we have a 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.959
 zone to the left here where it appears 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.270
 Well then information of how many 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.560
 like to say how many people are still 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.660
 in this page 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.130
 also it appears to us of these of all 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.980
 these people how many are friends 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.850
 our in this case would be 129 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.440
 these 127 plus these two then gives me 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.940
 also the option to invite other 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.600
 people who are part of this 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.210
 page 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.420
 and then we also found information 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:03.410
 general of the page photographs that 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.930
 have risen and opinions of third parties about 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.790
 the page and then I like the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.240
 own page is to say that other pages 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.590
 follow is this page then good if you 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.900
 you set here for example we can go 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.580
 directly to specific years because yes 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.550
 we want to see all the publications by 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.000
 example of 2013 or 2012 is a 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.700
 sort of file 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.590
 we also find here in this area 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.840
 a superior we find a series of 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.900
 eyelashes that lead us to parties 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.260
 concrete or specific sections of this 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.510
 page 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.520
 biography is the central area where 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.500
 we found the wall information but 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.230
 then we will have concrete information from 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.360
 the page or the photos if we want to go to 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.850
 see all the photos that have been published 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.500
 or opinions or good directly 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.870
 Well, the other sections that we had 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.670
 seen before in addition to the pages 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.550
 you can also send them messages 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.050
 We can send a private message to 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.330
 contact that page 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.850
 in this case if I were another user 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.840
 Well, I could contact him with the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.610
 page now it's okay to stop the 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.160
 education and send any questions 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.390
 that I had privately and now 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.920
 well let's go back to the 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.959
 home page I always remember you 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.239
 then clicking here in the beginning in the area 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.709
 superior or on the facebook efe and now 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.480
 what we are going to see is a group how 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.720
 the groups work 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.310
 the idea of â€‹â€‹the groups we go here to 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.350
 groups we are going to enter for example here to 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.810
 the mathematics subject is one that 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.760
 we have test also has a 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.250
 pretty similar structure we have a 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.640
 upper area where we can add a 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.050
 headed with an image and here the 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.760
 difference that we are going to have with the 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.450
 groups the main difference is that 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.040
 will there be or will not be a 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.380
 major publications of 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.630
 of the page itself or in this case the 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.130
 group is to say all the users are going to 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.620
 count all publications equally 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.530
 they will be equally important here 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.220
 We will have a wall but we will have a 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.080
 wall of the group with which all the 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.030
 publications so much as this group is 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.710
 a course of a subject of 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.440
 mathematics so much the publications 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.600
 of the students like that of the teachers 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.290
 they will be equally important 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.230
 they are simply going to be ordered 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.710
 chronological way not by role or 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.850
 importance within what the group is 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.990
 and the only difference is that the 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.730
 administrators or teachers may 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.410
 For example, delete publications and 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.770
 after they consider that they are not 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.520
 appropriate or let's say a kind of 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.890
 moderation or also add or remove 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.290
 users and edit the settings 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:42.460
 general of this group otherwise going to 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.450
 be like a page then the others 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.639
 characteristics so here we have a 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.340
 series of tabs since the 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:53.069
 in these groups we can see the number of 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.749
 members that are part of the group in 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.699
 the case of the page we could only see 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:58.080
 those members who were friends 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.720
 our 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.430
 events we can associate events with this 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.400
 directly to this wall 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.680
 to this group forgiveness and we will see them 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.009
 here linked the photos this same as 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.449
 the pages and then a tab that 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.819
 it's quite interesting with an option 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.860
 that they do not offer us the pages that is 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:19.740
 archives ie the groups we can 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.229
 upload files and share them as such 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:27.190
 so it is very useful for 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:29.470
 for teaching I see them really 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.860
 I see it as a kind of equivalent to 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.350
 what would be a classroom or even a 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.110
 e-learning platform but without the 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:40.750
 part of enrollment or that part 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.220
 more administration otherwise here 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.380
 I already say that we can work a lot 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.890
 with all this information the pages 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:51.280
 they are more for their spaces and even for 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:55.360
 give publicity for example for a 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.970
 master to let us know and about 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.300
 all reflect information or notices of 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.310
 daily so as to keep the 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.250
 contact with people but 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.290
 is always more focused on a concept of 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.760
 page or website I say that the 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.470
 groups in the groups we will be able to 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.960
 work in a much more active way 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.180
 with our students and they will be in this 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.790
 look rather more useful although already 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.220
 I say we'll see more in detail later 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.320
 these two these two tools and there 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.670
 you can choose which one is 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.670
 more is adapted to your needs
