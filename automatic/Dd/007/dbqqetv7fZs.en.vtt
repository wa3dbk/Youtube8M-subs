lesson<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.799> tricks<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.460> trace<00:00:05.759> we're

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
lesson of tricks of the trace we're

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.129 
lesson of tricks of the trace we're
going<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.899> discuss<00:00:07.670> unnecessary<00:00:08.670> hours<00:00:09.139> spent

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
going to discuss unnecessary hours spent

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.089 
going to discuss unnecessary hours spent
on<00:00:10.349> unmet<00:00:10.830> hours<00:00:11.809> while<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.620> could<00:00:13.830> apply<00:00:13.920> to

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
on unmet hours while this could apply to

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.359 
on unmet hours while this could apply to
trace<00:00:14.429> 700<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.719> could<00:00:16.109> actually<00:00:16.320> apply<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.190> any

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
trace 700 it could actually apply to any

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.390 
trace 700 it could actually apply to any
other<00:00:17.640> energy<00:00:18.150> modeling<00:00:18.510> software<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:19.680> let's

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
other energy modeling software so let's

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.609 
other energy modeling software so let's
take<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.880> classroom<00:00:21.539> with<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.930> storage<00:00:22.410> closet

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
take a classroom with a storage closet

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.029 
take a classroom with a storage closet
for<00:00:23.100> example<00:00:23.900> if<00:00:24.900> there's<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> thermostat<00:00:25.680> in

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
for example if there's a thermostat in

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.689 
for example if there's a thermostat in
the<00:00:26.340> classroom<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.529> the<00:00:28.529> storage<00:00:28.949> closet<00:00:29.160> has

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the classroom and the storage closet has

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.479 
the classroom and the storage closet has
an<00:00:29.880> exterior<00:00:30.359> wall<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.859> only<00:00:32.070> wall

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
an exterior wall and it's the only wall

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.040 
an exterior wall and it's the only wall
and<00:00:34.399> both<00:00:35.399> rooms<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.030> 75<00:00:36.540> degrees<00:00:36.870> set

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and both rooms have a 75 degrees set

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.180 
and both rooms have a 75 degrees set
point<00:00:38.360> let's<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.480> say<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.860> never

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
point let's just say that this is never

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.690 
point let's just say that this is never
going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.550> happen<00:00:41.840> because<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.890> classroom<00:00:44.520> is

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
going to happen because the classroom is

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.910 
going to happen because the classroom is
going<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> different<00:00:45.870> load<00:00:46.289> profile

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
going to have a different load profile

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.290 
going to have a different load profile
than<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.059> storage<00:00:48.450> closet<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.910> storage

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
than the storage closet and the storage

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.459 
than the storage closet and the storage
closet<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.809> going<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.079> need<00:00:52.230> much<00:00:52.440> more

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
closet is going to need much more

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.760 
closet is going to need much more
conditioning<00:00:53.190> than<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> classroom<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.930> what

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
conditioning than the classroom so what

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.849 
conditioning than the classroom so what
are<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.010> potential<00:00:56.340> solutions<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:58.500> simplest

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
are the potential solutions the simplest

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.910 
are the potential solutions the simplest
thing<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.480> to<00:01:00.480> combine<00:01:00.690> two<00:01:01.199> rooms<00:01:01.530> into<00:01:01.800> one

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
thing is to combine two rooms into one

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.929 
thing is to combine two rooms into one
zone<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.699> therefore<00:01:04.250> minimize<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.549> effects

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
zone and therefore minimize the effects

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.910 
zone and therefore minimize the effects
of<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> wall<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> storage<00:01:07.710> closet

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
of the wall on just the storage closet

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.250 
of the wall on just the storage closet
we<00:01:08.909> could<00:01:09.090> assume<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.720> there's<00:01:09.930> enough

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
we could assume that there's enough

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
we could assume that there's enough
doors<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> storage<00:01:11.280> closet<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.939> there's<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
doors on the storage closet or there's a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.270 
doors on the storage closet or there's a
fan<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.530> air<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.189> be

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
fan and that the air is going to be

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.130 
fan and that the air is going to be
adequately<00:01:14.790> mixed<00:01:15.270> between<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.750> two<00:01:15.900> rooms

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
adequately mixed between the two rooms

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.609 
adequately mixed between the two rooms
so<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.939> air<00:01:18.150> conditioning<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> classroom

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
so the air conditioning the classroom

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.120 
so the air conditioning the classroom
will<00:01:20.280> also<00:01:20.670> condition<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> storage<00:01:21.509> closet

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
will also condition the storage closet

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.700 
will also condition the storage closet
but<00:01:23.509> sometimes<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:25.049> isn't<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> very<00:01:25.560> good

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
but sometimes this isn't a very good

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.980 
but sometimes this isn't a very good
option<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:27.090> don't<00:01:27.299> want<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.630> delete<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
option as you don't want to delete a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.899 
option as you don't want to delete a
bunch<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.439> rooms<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.430> already<00:01:29.610> have

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
bunch of rooms as you already have

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.020 
bunch of rooms as you already have
templates<00:01:30.390> made<00:01:30.710> for<00:01:31.710> instance<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.340> your

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
templates made for instance if your

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.020 
templates made for instance if your
lighting<00:01:33.450> density<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:33.990> different<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.250> what<00:01:36.000> I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
lighting density is different so what I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.679 
lighting density is different so what I
propose<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:37.009> to<00:01:38.009> change<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.939> set<00:01:39.180> points<00:01:39.570> in

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
propose is to change the set points in

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.120 
propose is to change the set points in
the<00:01:40.020> storage<00:01:40.409> closet<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.360> about<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
the storage closet if you think about it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.429 
the storage closet if you think about it
the<00:01:44.130> storage<00:01:44.579> closet<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.299> never<00:01:46.079> actually

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the storage closet is never actually

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.580 
the storage closet is never actually
going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.130> 75<00:01:47.549> degrees<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.270> reality<00:01:48.840> so

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
going to be 75 degrees in reality so

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.789 
going to be 75 degrees in reality so
your<00:01:50.159> initial<00:01:50.759> assumption<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.930> 75<00:01:52.439> degree

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
your initial assumption of the 75 degree

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.929 
your initial assumption of the 75 degree
set<00:01:53.040> point<00:01:53.310> was<00:01:53.549> actually<00:01:54.270> wrong<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.939> that's

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
set point was actually wrong and that's

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.639 
set point was actually wrong and that's
okay<00:01:57.619> see<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.610> storage<00:01:59.909> closet<00:02:00.649> nobody's

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
okay see in the storage closet nobody's

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.350 
okay see in the storage closet nobody's
going<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> care<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.880> couple<00:02:03.240> degrees

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
going to care if it's a couple degrees

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.289 
going to care if it's a couple degrees
different<00:02:03.930> than<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.140> classroom<00:02:04.649> as<00:02:05.299> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
different than the classroom as the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.150 
different than the classroom as the
teacher<00:02:06.570> maybe<00:02:06.899> spends<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.530> couple<00:02:07.860> minutes

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
teacher maybe spends a couple minutes

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.969 
teacher maybe spends a couple minutes
maybe<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:09.119> most<00:02:09.149> an<00:02:09.599> hour<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.959> day<00:02:10.140> gathering
