00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.630
 today a colorful recipe we do 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.460
 we'll make a nice salad with these 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.040
 beautiful cauldrons and fruit 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.780
 let's start by cooking prawns that 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.199
 we will listen in boiling water a couple of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:28.279
 bay leaves a little not so much salt 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:30.929
 and we put our prawns close 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.239
 and count a couple of minutes of cooking 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.719
 we take the bull and fill it with 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.719
 cold water 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.260
 the best thing would be to have some 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.260
 ice water and then while 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.079
 put them ice this will serve for 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.000
 Quickly cool our shrimp 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:57.149
 let's proceed with the recipe let's go to 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:01.859
 squeezing an orange we put in the juice in 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.580
 this little bull that we will then use 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.510
 to make the seasoning company 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.670
 let's check our shrimp 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.040
 we are practically ready to put them 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.580
 immediately in cold water in such a way 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.290
 that the cooking stops and if 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.310
 they can cool down quickly 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.990
 Here is our shrimp ready 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.580
 we gather another bubble where 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.799
 we will put our fruit we have 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.799
 meanwhile already sliced 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:46.070
 diced then we continue with the fin 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:50.619
 here then we have some grapefruit that 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:55.060
 we have already peeled alive and of the rancia 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.060
 here we put everything 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.480
 here remained of the aforementioned that us 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:10.240
 together with the orange juice 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:13.980
 we have the apple we take the piece is 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:19.000
 we also do this in small cubes 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:25.090
 we take our shrimp that we are 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:29.640
 cooled we take some paper in 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.640
 so you can dry the water 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.709
 that's how we dry we put them there 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.530
 so- and- so fruit cinema 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:47.650
 let us dedicate ourselves to our salce tina 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:51.310
 we will add some oil of the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.540
 orange juice as you see tend to 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:00.690
 to separate we will create an emotion in 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.690
 so that it can be joined 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.299
 here we regulate with salt 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.540
 so we also put salt in the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.110
 our 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:24.270
 in the evening we put our emotion 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.250
 so we can put all the acidity 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.480
 of the fruit and this sauce 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.410
 will also cook our own 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.920
 shrimp really are the colors 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.920
 beautiful 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.230
 let it rest for a few minutes 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.390
 or is there anyway we have time 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.820
 we put some films we put in the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.520
 refrigerator to cool then a 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:56.460
 at this point we take our plate 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.330
 of scope and we will begin to build the 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.680
 our dish 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.010
 the important thing is that there is not too much 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.570
 liquid does not have to be a soup but 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.190
 like colors and the dish is really 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:10.950
 beautiful but also of taste I can 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.830
 ensure that fabulous and now the gem 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.370
 final will be the salt we will use this 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.860
 salt that a salt of volcanic origin 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.890
 of uai is a black salt that is really 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.210
 very beautifull 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:28.060
 we're going to put on these beans 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:31.860
 it goes up so fruit 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.860
 a crunchy slice 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.750
 and whole prawn 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.780
 very good dead
