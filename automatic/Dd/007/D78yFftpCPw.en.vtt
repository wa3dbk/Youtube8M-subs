00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hi there and welcome to Toral's stuff

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.439 
hi there and welcome to Toral's stuff
real<00:00:01.979> easy<00:00:02.220> and<00:00:02.490> today<00:00:02.700> I'm<00:00:02.879> gonna<00:00:03.060> show<00:00:03.389> you

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
real easy and today I'm gonna show you

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.099 
real easy and today I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.810> draw<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.850> wind<00:00:05.850> turbine<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.690> you're

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
how to draw a wind turbine and you're

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.680 
how to draw a wind turbine and you're
really<00:00:07.620> gonna<00:00:07.859> want<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.250> more<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.059> an<00:00:09.150> ellipse

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
really gonna want a more of an ellipse

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.799 
really gonna want a more of an ellipse
than<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.080> circle<00:00:10.820> and<00:00:11.820> we'll<00:00:12.150> find<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.509> middle

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
than a circle and we'll find the middle

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.589 
than a circle and we'll find the middle
there<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.320> put<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.250> line<00:00:14.610> out<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.420> then<00:00:15.509> you

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
there and put a line out and then you

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.670 
there and put a line out and then you
could<00:00:17.090> but<00:00:18.090> these<00:00:18.300> three<00:00:18.810> blades<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.439> feels

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
could but these three blades that feels

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.310 
could but these three blades that feels
more<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:22.430> you're<00:00:23.430> going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.670> want<00:00:23.910> a

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
more right so and you're going to want a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.870 
more right so and you're going to want a
plane<00:00:25.320> going<00:00:25.740> through<00:00:25.949> there<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.640> plane

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
plane going through there and a plane

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.109 
plane going through there and a plane
coming<00:00:27.330> down<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:27.869> vertically<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.939> this

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
coming down here vertically and this

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.760 
coming down here vertically and this
will<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.510> your<00:00:32.000> kind<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.090> motor<00:00:33.300> section<00:00:33.960> like

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
will be your kind of motor section like

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.910 
will be your kind of motor section like
that<00:00:35.540> and<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.870> will<00:00:37.020> probably<00:00:37.500> kind<00:00:37.800> of

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that and then that will probably kind of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.069 
that and then that will probably kind of
come<00:00:38.100> back<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.309> sort<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.120> square<00:00:39.600> or

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
come back and sort of square or

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.889 
come back and sort of square or
something<00:00:40.440> at<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> back<00:00:40.920> there<00:00:41.250> anyway<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
something at the back there anyway and

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.930 
something at the back there anyway and
then<00:00:42.899> you're<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> blades

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
then you're going to get the blades

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.290 
then you're going to get the blades
coming<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.120> here<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.430> follow<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.910> right<00:00:48.059> out

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
coming out here so follow that right out

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
coming out here so follow that right out
to<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.510> edge<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:51.050> curve<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.410> outside<00:00:53.039> way

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to the edge and curve this outside way

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.830 
to the edge and curve this outside way
some<00:00:53.750> turbos<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:55.020> big<00:00:55.260> wide<00:00:56.660> blades<00:00:57.829> someday

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
some turbos have big wide blades someday

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.070 
some turbos have big wide blades someday
this<00:01:00.840> will<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.260> come<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.750> again

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
this will then come out here and again

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.160 
this will then come out here and again
bring<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:05.510> some<00:01:06.510> yeah<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.840> think<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
bring it out some yeah I think it

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.609 
bring it out some yeah I think it
depends<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> kind<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.979> speed<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.619> wind

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
depends on the kind of speed of the wind

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.370 
depends on the kind of speed of the wind
in<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.890> area<00:01:11.540> this<00:01:12.540> will<00:01:12.750> be<00:01:12.869> coming<00:01:13.229> down

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
in the area this will be coming down

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.399 
in the area this will be coming down
there<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.450> kind<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.509> coming<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:16.020> you'll

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
there and then kind of coming up you'll

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.980 
there and then kind of coming up you'll
see<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.840> hint<00:01:18.840> of

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
see that like that you know hint of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.630 
see that like that you know hint of
something<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.280> you're<00:01:20.520> gonna

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
something there and then you're gonna

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.940 
something there and then you're gonna
have<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> mast<00:01:22.280> will<00:01:23.280> come<00:01:23.610> it'll<00:01:24.540> be<00:01:24.689> getting

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
have the mast will come it'll be getting

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.420 
have the mast will come it'll be getting
wider<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.250> wider<00:01:26.310> down<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> ground<00:01:27.420> I

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
wider and wider down to the ground I

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
wider and wider down to the ground I
have<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> standing<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> hill<00:01:30.229> some<00:01:31.229> mountains

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
have a standing on a hill some mountains

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.580 
have a standing on a hill some mountains
in<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.829> background<00:01:33.049> and<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> want<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.500> go

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
in the background and if you want to go

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.310 
in the background and if you want to go
and<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> look<00:01:35.250> at<00:01:35.549> my<00:01:36.150> other<00:01:36.600> channel

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
and have a look at my other channel

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.319 
and have a look at my other channel
called<00:01:38.119> she<00:01:39.119> Reina<00:01:39.420> life<00:01:40.880> I'm<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.090> doing

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
called she Reina life I'm just doing

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.510 
called she Reina life I'm just doing
little<00:01:42.450> dots<00:01:42.750> there<00:01:43.640> I'll<00:01:44.640> put<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.939> link<00:01:46.520> here

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
little dots there I'll put a link here

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.080 
little dots there I'll put a link here
and<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.180> see<00:01:48.360> me<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:49.380> my<00:01:49.439> wind<00:01:50.189> turbine<00:01:50.670> I

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and you can see me at my wind turbine I

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.810 
and you can see me at my wind turbine I
like<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.170> think<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.530> my<00:01:52.740> winter<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.490> then<00:01:53.670> it's

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
like to think is my winter but then it's

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.789 
like to think is my winter but then it's
not<00:01:53.850> really<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> tiny<00:01:55.439> tiny<00:01:56.340> tiny<00:01:56.670> tiny

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
not really I have a tiny tiny tiny tiny

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.749 
not really I have a tiny tiny tiny tiny
little<00:01:58.799> piece<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:01.280> had<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.670> a

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
little piece of it I had a kind of a

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.580 
little piece of it I had a kind of a
community<00:02:05.299> thing<00:02:06.299> likely<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.350> wind

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
community thing likely for this wind

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.369 
community thing likely for this wind
turbine<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.509> community<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.289> have

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
turbine so the community can have

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.940 
turbine so the community can have
brought<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.830> little<00:02:11.069> piece<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.640> air

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
brought a little piece of air

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.970 
brought a little piece of air
to<00:02:13.950> put<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.250> up<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.319> like<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.590> think<00:02:16.830> it's

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
to put it up and so I like to think it's

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.740 
to put it up and so I like to think it's
my<00:02:17.550> wind<00:02:18.030> turbine<00:02:19.430> can<00:02:20.430> get<00:02:20.670> have<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.910> look<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
my wind turbine can get have a look and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.210 
my wind turbine can get have a look and
see<00:02:22.379> me<00:02:22.530> hugging<00:02:22.980> my<00:02:23.190> wind<00:02:23.459> turbine<00:02:25.220> just

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
see me hugging my wind turbine just

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.680 
see me hugging my wind turbine just
before<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:26.580> actually<00:02:26.700> started<00:02:27.239> turning<00:02:27.480> I

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
before it actually started turning I

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.610 
before it actually started turning I
haven't<00:02:27.989> seen<00:02:28.260> it

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
haven't seen it

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.420 
haven't seen it
getting<00:02:28.920> around<00:02:29.069> yet<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:31.620> I'm<00:02:32.040> going<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.250> do

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
getting around yet and I'm going to do

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.550 
getting around yet and I'm going to do
these<00:02:32.610> little<00:02:32.760> bits<00:02:33.060> as<00:02:33.239> dots<00:02:33.569> maybe<00:02:34.319> will

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
these little bits as dots maybe will

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.259 
these little bits as dots maybe will
have<00:02:34.709> kind<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.130> talking<00:02:35.580> around<00:02:35.790> there<00:02:36.030> like

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
have kind of a talking around there like

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.410 
have kind of a talking around there like
that<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:41.010> leading<00:02:41.340> edge<00:02:41.700> here

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
that and this is the leading edge here

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:53.089 
that and this is the leading edge here
so<00:02:42.810> it's<00:02:42.959> gonna<00:02:43.110> be<00:02:43.290> go<00:02:46.069> and<00:02:49.819> no<00:02:50.819> I<00:02:51.950> like<00:02:52.950> that

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
so it's gonna be go and no I like that

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.089 
so it's gonna be go and no I like that
one<00:02:53.220> completely<00:02:53.700> wrong
