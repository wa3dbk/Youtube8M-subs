00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
wallow for every single meal pick a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.030 
wallow for every single meal pick a
particular<00:03:40.269> meal<00:03:40.989> that<00:03:41.290> you<00:03:41.470> want<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.769> cheat

me it was dessert and sometimes dinner

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.580 
me it was dessert and sometimes dinner
so<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.370> had<00:03:48.640> probably<00:03:48.940> two<00:03:49.120> cheat<00:03:49.420> meals<00:03:49.660> maybe

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590

so I had probably two cheat meals maybe
two<00:03:50.890> cheat<00:03:51.250> meals<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.880> another<00:03:52.510> thing<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.500> to

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
two cheat meals and another thing is to

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.050
