we're<00:00:01.110> here<00:00:01.260> with<00:00:01.410> another<00:00:02.129> video<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:03.560> talk<00:00:04.560> to

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
we're here with another video to talk to

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.909 
we're here with another video to talk to
people<00:00:04.920> about<00:00:05.870> wiring<00:00:06.870> their<00:00:07.020> trees<00:00:07.350> or<00:00:07.680> bones

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
people about wiring their trees or bones

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.660 
people about wiring their trees or bones
I<00:00:08.099> down<00:00:08.370> into<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.790> pot<00:00:09.410> we<00:00:10.410> anchor<00:00:11.160> trees<00:00:11.429> down

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
I down into the pot we anchor trees down

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.549 
I down into the pot we anchor trees down
into<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.090> containers<00:00:12.630> for<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:12.990> fact<00:00:13.290> that

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
into the containers for the fact that

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.120 
into the containers for the fact that
most<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> containers<00:00:15.179> are<00:00:15.330> shallow<00:00:15.599> and

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
most of the containers are shallow and

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.279 
most of the containers are shallow and
don't<00:00:17.130> provide<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.850> lot<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> support<00:00:18.630> for<00:00:19.080> root

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
don't provide a lot of support for root

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.620 
don't provide a lot of support for root
balls<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:20.400> what<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.449> do<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.980> we<00:00:22.980> utilize<00:00:23.630> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
balls so what we do is we utilize the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.429 
balls so what we do is we utilize the
holes<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> bottom<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> pot<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.070> run<00:00:26.400> up

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
holes in the bottom of the pot to run up

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.980 
holes in the bottom of the pot to run up
to<00:00:28.439> send<00:00:28.710> through<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.130> wire<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.390> we'll

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
to send through a wire and we'll

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.049 
to send through a wire and we'll
actually<00:00:31.230> use<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:32.160> wire<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.610> anchor<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
actually use that wire to anchor the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.660 
actually use that wire to anchor the
tree<00:00:33.300> down<00:00:33.510> into<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> pot<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.590> what<00:00:35.399> I'd<00:00:35.520> like

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
tree down into the pot so what I'd like

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.970 
tree down into the pot so what I'd like
to<00:00:35.730> do<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.180> show<00:00:36.390> people<00:00:36.600> how<00:00:37.020> how<00:00:37.770> it's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
to do is to show people how how it's

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040 
to do is to show people how how it's
done<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.390> what<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.719> here<00:00:39.750> are<00:00:40.020> two

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
done and what I have here are two

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.280 
done and what I have here are two
different<00:00:40.440> pots<00:00:40.879> this<00:00:41.879> pot<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:42.600> has<00:00:42.989> two

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
different pots this pot here has two

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.430 
different pots this pot here has two
bigger<00:00:43.500> holes<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:44.070> well<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.239> four<00:00:46.050> smaller

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
bigger holes as well as four smaller

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.529 
bigger holes as well as four smaller
holes<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:48.469> over<00:00:49.469> here<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.920> pot<00:00:50.539> with

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
holes and over here I have a pot with

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.240 
holes and over here I have a pot with
just<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:52.260> hole<00:00:54.440> let's<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:55.559> back<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> first

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
just one hole let's go back to the first

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.770 
just one hole let's go back to the first
one<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.480> pot<00:00:59.239> due<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> fact<00:01:00.690> that

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
one with this pot due to the fact that

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.009 
one with this pot due to the fact that
it<00:01:00.960> has<00:01:01.109> many<00:01:01.590> holes<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.760> take<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> piece<00:01:03.989> of

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it has many holes we can take a piece of

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.640 
it has many holes we can take a piece of
wire<00:01:04.379> there's<00:01:04.830> as<00:01:04.979> ordinary<00:01:05.220> bones<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.850> wired

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
wire there's as ordinary bones on wired

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.109 
wire there's as ordinary bones on wired
wire<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.130> use<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.670> number<00:01:08.909> two

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
wire I like to use it's like number two

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.830 
wire I like to use it's like number two
or<00:01:09.360> number<00:01:09.390> two<00:01:09.869> point<00:01:10.080> five<00:01:10.290> millimeter<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
or number two point five millimeter and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.969 
or number two point five millimeter and
what<00:01:12.840> we'll<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.680> simply<00:01:14.250> send<00:01:14.760> out

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
what we'll do is just simply send out

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.630 
what we'll do is just simply send out
the<00:01:16.979> wire<00:01:17.159> through<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> hole<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:19.520> come<00:01:20.520> back

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the wire through the hole and come back

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.580 
the wire through the hole and come back
up<00:01:20.700> through<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> other<00:01:21.270> hole<00:01:21.570> through<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
up through the other hole through the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.679 
up through the other hole through the
other<00:01:22.710> side<00:01:23.659> flatten<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.750> out<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.340> now<00:01:26.689> we

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
other side flatten it out and now we

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.120 
other side flatten it out and now we
have<00:01:27.869> two<00:01:28.110> leads<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:29.579> work<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.240> order<00:01:30.479> to

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
have two leads to work with in order to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.490 
have two leads to work with in order to
work<00:01:32.130> with<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> root<00:01:32.520> ball<00:01:32.990> simply<00:01:33.990> by<00:01:34.259> just

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
work with a root ball simply by just

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.050 
work with a root ball simply by just
twisting<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.070> down<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> pot<00:01:37.909> well<00:01:38.909> that

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
twisting it down to the pot well that

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.889 
twisting it down to the pot well that
was<00:01:39.180> easy<00:01:40.909> but<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> manufacturer<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> this

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
was easy but the manufacturer of this

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.200 
was easy but the manufacturer of this
pot<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.409> gave<00:01:44.130> us<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:46.680> series<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.430> smaller

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
pot actually gave us a series of smaller

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.569 
pot actually gave us a series of smaller
holes<00:01:48.479> where<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.560> actually<00:01:49.890> send<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.399> wire

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
holes where we can actually send a wire

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.249 
holes where we can actually send a wire
in<00:01:50.820> through<00:01:51.060> these<00:01:52.430> okay<00:01:54.079> pushing<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.170> up

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
in through these okay pushing it up

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.980 
in through these okay pushing it up
through<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:55.740> flattening<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.579> out<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.869> we

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
through there flattening it out so we

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.620 
through there flattening it out so we
can<00:01:58.110> utilize<00:01:58.229> these<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:58.979> well<00:01:59.189> we<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
can utilize these as well we can have a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.410 
can utilize these as well we can have a
wire<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.290> side<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.369> utilize<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> wire

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
wire on this side we can utilize a wire

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.369 
wire on this side we can utilize a wire
on<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.750> side<00:02:04.189> so<00:02:05.189> that's<00:02:05.340> very<00:02:05.490> convenient

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.089 

but<00:02:09.379> what<00:02:09.530> do<00:02:09.590> we<00:02:09.649> do<00:02:09.860> in<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:10.099> case<00:02:11.680> pot<00:02:12.680> here

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
but what do we do in this case pot here

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.270 
but what do we do in this case pot here
only<00:02:13.430> has<00:02:13.730> one<00:02:13.970> hole<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.700> what<00:02:16.819> do<00:02:16.879> we<00:02:16.940> do

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
only has one hole so what do we do

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.920 
only has one hole so what do we do
certainly<00:02:19.280> can't<00:02:19.519> do<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.849> so<00:02:20.480> what<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.690> want

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
certainly can't do that so what I want

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.320 
certainly can't do that so what I want
to<00:02:20.989> do<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.230> demonstrate<00:02:21.440> on<00:02:22.129> what<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.030> do<00:02:23.180> with

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
to do is demonstrate on what to do with

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.240 
to do is demonstrate on what to do with
a<00:02:23.360> pot<00:02:23.629> with<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.870> single<00:02:24.290> hole<00:02:24.500> well<00:02:25.040> there's<00:02:25.220> a

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
a pot with a single hole well there's a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.920 
a pot with a single hole well there's a
couple<00:02:25.370> different<00:02:25.549> methods<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.330> we<00:02:26.510> can<00:02:26.660> use

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
couple different methods that we can use

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.770 
couple different methods that we can use
one<00:02:27.890> easy<00:02:28.129> one<00:02:28.430> here's<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.239> piece<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.599> wire

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
one easy one here's the piece of wire

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.180 
one easy one here's the piece of wire
that<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.110> had<00:02:30.640> an<00:02:32.110> easy<00:02:33.110> method<00:02:33.379> is<00:02:33.709> simply

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
that I had an easy method is simply

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.960 
that I had an easy method is simply
holding<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:34.970> wire<00:02:35.150> in<00:02:35.360> half<00:02:35.769> like<00:02:36.769> so<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.940> it's

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
holding the wire in half like so so it's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.210 
holding the wire in half like so so it's
able<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.510> fit<00:02:41.690> through<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.989> hole<00:02:42.230> all<00:02:42.890> right

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
able to fit through the hole all right

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.509 
able to fit through the hole all right
but<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:44.540> doesn't<00:02:44.870> hold<00:02:44.989> that<00:02:45.739> doesn't<00:02:46.430> hold

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
but that doesn't hold that doesn't hold

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.360 
but that doesn't hold that doesn't hold
the<00:02:46.640> wire<00:02:47.180> in<00:02:47.450> place<00:02:47.620> so<00:02:48.620> what<00:02:48.769> we<00:02:48.890> need<00:02:49.069> to<00:02:49.099> do

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
the wire in place so what we need to do

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.449 
the wire in place so what we need to do
is<00:02:49.760> take<00:02:49.970> my<00:02:50.090> wire<00:02:50.299> cutters<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:52.010> here<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.250> got<00:02:52.430> a

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
is take my wire cutters and here I got a

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.309 
is take my wire cutters and here I got a
heavy<00:02:52.640> gauge<00:02:53.090> piece<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.510> wire<00:02:53.690> here<00:02:53.989> it's

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
heavy gauge piece of wire here it's

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.300 
heavy gauge piece of wire here it's
probably<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.650> number<00:02:54.769> 5<00:02:56.319> cut<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.349> small<00:02:57.709> segment

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
probably a number 5 cut a small segment

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.759 
probably a number 5 cut a small segment
of<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.790> off<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:02.510> going<00:03:03.110> back<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.349> the<00:03:03.590> pot

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
of that off so going back to the pot

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.210 
of that off so going back to the pot
with<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:04.010> single<00:03:04.700> hole<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.590> can<00:03:06.590> shove<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.010> wire

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
with a single hole I can shove the wire

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.789 
with a single hole I can shove the wire
through<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:08.120> opening<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.720> take<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.650> heavy

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
through the opening and take the heavy

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.280 
through the opening and take the heavy
gauge<00:03:10.099> piece<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.579> wire<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.920> loop<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.100> over<00:03:14.290> so

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
gauge piece of wire and loop it over so

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.610 
gauge piece of wire and loop it over so
let's<00:03:15.410> just<00:03:15.560> that<00:03:15.709> pot<00:03:16.579> your<00:03:16.730> tree<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.620> you

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
let's just that pot your tree and you

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.539 
let's just that pot your tree and you
have<00:03:18.799> an<00:03:18.950> instant<00:03:19.400> anchor<00:03:20.920> well<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.310> can<00:03:22.430> do

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
have an instant anchor well you can do

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.110 
have an instant anchor well you can do
that<00:03:22.730> there's<00:03:23.510> actually<00:03:23.840> another<00:03:24.019> way<00:03:25.120> force

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
that there's actually another way force

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.059 
that there's actually another way force
I<00:03:26.180> like<00:03:26.329> to<00:03:26.450> show<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:27.680> back<00:03:29.799> over<00:03:30.799> here's

number 2 and what we'll do is make a

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.509 
number 2 and what we'll do is make a
series<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.930> bends<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:36.500> this<00:03:36.620> piece<00:03:36.859> of<00:03:37.010> wire<00:03:37.190> I

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
series of bends in this piece of wire I

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.120 
series of bends in this piece of wire I
like<00:03:38.359> using<00:03:38.540> my<00:03:38.660> finger<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:41.599> make<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.989> figure<00:03:42.769> 8

like using my finger to make a figure 8

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:58.780 
like using my finger to make a figure 8
you<00:03:43.579> might<00:03:43.790> say

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.190 

and<00:03:59.269> there<00:03:59.420> you<00:03:59.510> have<00:03:59.689> it<00:03:59.870> now<00:04:02.019> with<00:04:03.019> that

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
and there you have it now with that

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.710 
and there you have it now with that
being<00:04:03.409> done<00:04:03.849> go<00:04:04.849> back<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.299> pot<00:04:05.480> with<00:04:05.689> a

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
being done go back to the pot with a

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.030 
being done go back to the pot with a
single<00:04:06.079> hole<00:04:06.230> run<00:04:07.159> it<00:04:07.280> up<00:04:07.489> through<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.819> Center

and<00:04:19.789> it<00:04:20.510> won't<00:04:20.630> pull<00:04:20.840> through<00:04:21.220> it's<00:04:22.220> as<00:04:22.310> simple

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
and it won't pull through it's as simple

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:32.270 
and it won't pull through it's as simple
as<00:04:22.699> that
