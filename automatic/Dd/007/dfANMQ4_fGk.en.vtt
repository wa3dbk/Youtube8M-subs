00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.710
 and well, this time we are in a 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.450
 fabulous script mode although good because 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.519
 has a little bus and here we 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.070
 we met with a friend the villager as 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.100
 you can see already in the title more script is 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.689
 calls up new horses in brothers 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.529
 and witches good as they see brussels said 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.779
 and as you can see it works quite well 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.660
 way and good then first of all at all 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.420
 the credits to the creator of the monster that 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.950
 in the description of what would be the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.340
 forum where I found it since it was the 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.980
 microphone and will be your forum leave me 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.809
 try something I want to see 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:51.379
 and before the recording I can not do 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:54.829
 which made a friend on the day we do not go 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.600
 to see if they give us what would be more things 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.660
 Well, this had not been discovered 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.519
 and well, as you can see by giving it 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.430
 with a diamond now the day does not give you 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.170
 things is like trading that's pretty 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.930
 good since you can trade with the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.780
 villagers and less than just with them and 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.050
 Well, that's good enough 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.320
 Well, let's make a sword 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.570
 let's see here is because if it does not come out 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.720
 the witch or something like that let's see let's 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.090
 go for each young man appeared lenderman 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.030
 Well, this sick person is pretty 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.770
 well the only bad thing is that it has a bug to 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.100
 what would be the walking since as 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.190
 they will have noticed well very strange when walking 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.410
 and you can not hit that not bad and 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.210
 Well, that was a bit 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.340
 overwhelmed so good then the creator 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.440
 has said in its jurisdiction that the next 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.750
 updates that we are going 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.480
 to fix that for Spain we are going to 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.060
 put let's put the witch let's 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.460
 put play cauich and we already miss her and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.020
 that keyboard does not take off and we're 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.120
 where is it 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.190
 here is good as you see arrows strips 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.190
 It's like a skeleton too 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.350
 we did the pull the positions since 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.540
 while sensing to damage positions 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.300
 and poisoning and all that but as 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.010
 they will know here not here will not be able and good 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.020
 because as you see it follows you, it does not stop 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.850
 Chase you 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.880
 and it's like a skeleton that is being 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.690
 burning in what would be villa and 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.810
 messi 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.569
 now let's study the let's see 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.010
 the horse let's see let's put 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.379
 plates horse hosting 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.890
 and good for either responding where 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.890
 will be 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.380
 here as you see the horse is quite 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.810
 okay but it always has a bug what 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.000
 would be walking as you can see them or the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.920
 sword from behind like he turns them or something 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.510
 Well, well, well, it's pretty 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.950
 similar to what is called in cash pc and 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.440
 then where you can climb on it 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.990
 but the sight as it hinders you as 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.020
 they see the view in our but so 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.610
 less can may be transported by 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.340
 so to speak since this is a main tour 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.230
 I think 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.349
 and then to go down we're going to press 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.080
 the little circle that we got off and is 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.940
 pretty good to be the way they have 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.500
 the horse pity that bus that has 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.410
 but in the next updates what 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.720
 they will fix now good since that was all 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.030
 and good for Spain 'erosion 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.299
 brothers are going to have to put is the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.730
 appeal in brother and for the villagers 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.500
 the good gen tail so in the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.500
 description is of all commands and 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.200
 to miss the minecraft modes 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.750
 pc and well I hope you liked it 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.970

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.950
 like to comment and also before I was 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.709
 forget for this they will need a texture 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.720
 that in the description will be the link of the 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.190
 mold and texture so we're not going to 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.190
