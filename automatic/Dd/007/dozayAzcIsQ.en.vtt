this huge trailer and now I actually

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.110 
this huge trailer and now I actually
went<00:00:44.850> ahead<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.539> did<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.649> sort<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.850> rough

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
went ahead and did a sort of like rough

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.330 
went ahead and did a sort of like rough
sketch<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.600> what<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.110> thought<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.070> guy<00:00:50.280> would

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
sketch of what I thought this guy would

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.779 
sketch of what I thought this guy would
look<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.850> I'm<00:00:51.600> assuming<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.260> guy<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
look like I'm assuming it's a guy I

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.430 
look like I'm assuming it's a guy I
hoping<00:00:53.789> that's<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> girl<00:00:54.449> cuz<00:00:55.140> that'd<00:00:55.320> be

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
hoping that's not a girl cuz that'd be

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.069 
hoping that's not a girl cuz that'd be
really<00:00:55.590> weird<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.640> uh<00:00:56.750> just<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> way<00:00:57.960> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
really weird but uh just the way it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.590 
really weird but uh just the way it
looks<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.699> what<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> thought<00:01:00.210> he<00:01:00.420> look

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
looks so this is what I thought he look

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.850 
looks so this is what I thought he look
like<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> took<00:01:02.280> him<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:02.910> kind<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.449> this

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
like so I took him as kind of like this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.520 
like so I took him as kind of like this
monstrous<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.430> beefy<00:01:05.939> dude<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.500> one<00:01:07.500> thing

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
monstrous like beefy dude and one thing

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.570 
monstrous like beefy dude and one thing
that<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.040> did<00:01:08.100> add<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.000> was<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.510> felt<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.290> if

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
that I did add it was I felt as if

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.230 
that I did add it was I felt as if
possibly<00:01:11.580> his<00:01:12.540> face<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.439> skull<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.240> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
possibly his face was a skull and the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.850 
possibly his face was a skull and the
reason<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.600> thought<00:01:15.869> about<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.530> just

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
reason I thought about this was just

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.649 
reason I thought about this was just
because<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> way<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.540> video

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
because the way that like in the video

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
because the way that like in the video
and<00:01:19.020> also<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> still<00:01:19.770> image<00:01:19.950> looked<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
and also on a still image looked it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.120 
and also on a still image looked it
looked<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.570> his<00:01:21.840> face<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> shadow<00:01:22.830> was

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
looked like his face in the shadow was

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.149 
looked like his face in the shadow was
like<00:01:23.280> having<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.670> skull<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:25.080> I'm<00:01:25.650> guessing

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
like having a skull so I'm guessing

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.600 
like having a skull so I'm guessing
maybe<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.240> guy<00:01:27.509> might<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.350> undead<00:01:28.920> now

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
maybe this guy might be like undead now

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.370 
maybe this guy might be like undead now
what<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> said<00:01:30.329> was<00:01:30.479> he<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> science

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
what it said was he was a science

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.130 
what it said was he was a science
experiment<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.189> dt<00:01:33.090> trails<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> science

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
experiment in dt trails to the science

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.510 
experiment in dt trails to the science
experiment<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.939> ran<00:01:35.939> loose<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.930> now<00:01:37.619> this

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
experiment I ran loose and now this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.230 
experiment I ran loose and now this
reminded<00:01:39.060> me<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:40.159> dr.<00:01:41.159> mundo<00:01:41.670> from

haven't played that game and he is
a<00:01:50.320> lot<00:01:50.979> beefier<00:01:51.280> than<00:01:51.640> what<00:01:52.240> this<00:01:52.450> new

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
a lot beefier than what this new

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.450 
a lot beefier than what this new
borderlands<00:01:53.290> 2<00:01:53.500> character<00:01:53.950> could<00:01:54.130> be<00:01:54.250> like

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
borderlands 2 character could be like

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.730 
borderlands 2 character could be like
but<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.479> is<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.659> pretty<00:01:55.960> cool<00:01:56.170> thing<00:01:56.439> to<00:01:56.470> think

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
but it is a pretty cool thing to think

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.749 
but it is a pretty cool thing to think
about<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:58.060> guy<00:01:58.330> as<00:01:59.080> far<00:01:59.740> as<00:01:59.890> I'm<00:02:00.100> seeing<00:02:00.460> he

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
about this guy as far as I'm seeing he

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.149 
about this guy as far as I'm seeing he
looks<00:02:00.970> like<00:02:01.149> he<00:02:01.330> could<00:02:01.360> be<00:02:01.649> basically<00:02:02.649> a<00:02:02.770> lot

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
looks like he could be basically a lot

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.480 
looks like he could be basically a lot
like<00:02:03.490> he<00:02:03.880> got<00:02:04.240> not<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.720> gunzerker<00:02:05.170> but<00:02:06.130> the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
like he got not the gunzerker but the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.050 
like he got not the gunzerker but the
new<00:02:07.479> brick<00:02:07.960> was<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:08.590> Borderlands<00:02:09.130> one<00:02:09.369> where

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
new brick was in Borderlands one where

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.309 
new brick was in Borderlands one where
you<00:02:10.390> just<00:02:10.600> punch<00:02:10.899> stuff<00:02:11.170> like<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.910> guy

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
you just punch stuff like this guy

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.470 
you just punch stuff like this guy
obviously<00:02:14.319> looks<00:02:15.310> like<00:02:15.489> he's<00:02:15.640> male<00:02:15.910> late<00:02:16.120> but

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
obviously looks like he's male late but

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.990 
obviously looks like he's male late but
he<00:02:16.540> could<00:02:16.750> surprise<00:02:17.080> us<00:02:17.610> another<00:02:18.610> thought<00:02:18.970> I

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
he could surprise us another thought I

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.050 
he could surprise us another thought I
had<00:02:19.269> was<00:02:19.540> they<00:02:19.750> keep<00:02:19.989> showing<00:02:20.019> like<00:02:20.530> red<00:02:21.060> like

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
had was they keep showing like red like

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.880 
had was they keep showing like red like
red<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.510> black<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:23.080> don't<00:02:23.319> know<00:02:23.440> if<00:02:23.560> that's<00:02:23.739> on

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
red and black I don't know if that's on

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.550 
red and black I don't know if that's on
purpose<00:02:24.100> or<00:02:24.459> just<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.790> way<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.560> guy

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
purpose or just the way that the guy

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.000 
purpose or just the way that the guy
recorded<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.370> film<00:02:28.000> was<00:02:28.299> but<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.560> have<00:02:29.950> a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
recorded the film was but I have a

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.250 
recorded the film was but I have a
feeling<00:02:30.209> possibly<00:02:31.209> he<00:02:31.450> might<00:02:31.660> have<00:02:31.840> some<00:02:32.080> sort

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
feeling possibly he might have some sort

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.870 
feeling possibly he might have some sort
of<00:02:32.319> lava<00:02:32.590> powers<00:02:33.160> which<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.489> would<00:02:33.670> absolutely

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
of lava powers which I would absolutely

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.190 
of lava powers which I would absolutely
love<00:02:34.660> if<00:02:34.989> he<00:02:35.170> had<00:02:35.350> lava<00:02:35.620> powers<00:02:36.600> hands<00:02:37.600> down<00:02:37.900> I

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
love if he had lava powers hands down I

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.759 
love if he had lava powers hands down I
would<00:02:38.260> just<00:02:38.560> love<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.489> frickin<00:02:40.120> DLC<00:02:40.680> even<00:02:41.680> if
