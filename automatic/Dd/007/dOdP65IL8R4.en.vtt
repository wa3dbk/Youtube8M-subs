something like that because superior you
get<00:03:40.490> I<00:03:41.080> think<00:03:42.080> it's<00:03:42.260> like<00:03:44.290> 30%<00:03:45.290> magic<00:03:46.160> fine<00:03:46.400> for

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
get I think it's like 30% magic fine for

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.440 
get I think it's like 30% magic fine for
all<00:03:46.700> six<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.480> then<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:47.900> get<00:03:48.110> like<00:03:49.150> extra<00:03:50.150> gold

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
all six and then you get like extra gold

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.590 
all six and then you get like extra gold
from<00:03:51.350> going<00:03:51.830> stuff<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:55.010> now<00:03:55.250> I've<00:03:55.910> used<00:03:56.239> up<00:03:56.420> all

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
from going stuff so now I've used up all

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.720 
from going stuff so now I've used up all
my<00:03:56.630> original<00:03:57.050> ones<00:03:57.560> but<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.070> get<00:03:58.250> some<00:03:58.520> back

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
my original ones but you get some back

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.880 
my original ones but you get some back
so<00:03:59.060> though<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.959> can<00:04:00.140> just<00:04:00.350> start<00:04:00.590> forging

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
so though you can just start forging

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.650 
so though you can just start forging
them<00:04:01.310> it's<00:04:01.520> not<00:04:01.700> worth<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.270> sell<00:04:02.480> them

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
them it's not worth it to sell them

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.540 
them it's not worth it to sell them
really<00:04:02.959> because<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:06.440> spent<00:04:06.890> more<00:04:07.190> making

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
really because you spent more making

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.610 
really because you spent more making
them<00:04:07.940> then<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.420> get<00:04:08.630> selling<00:04:09.080> them<00:04:09.260> if<00:04:09.500> you

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620
