was<00:00:39.960> definitely<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.800> right<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.670> called<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
was definitely not right we called the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.090 
was definitely not right we called the
vet<00:00:42.180> into<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.660> blood<00:00:42.870> tests<00:00:43.290> showed<00:00:43.770> up<00:00:43.950> that

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
vet into the blood tests showed up that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770 
vet into the blood tests showed up that
we<00:00:44.219> were<00:00:44.280> lacking<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.789> selenium<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.329> cobalt

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
we were lacking in selenium and cobalt

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.840 
we were lacking in selenium and cobalt
and<00:00:46.079> hence<00:00:46.559> starting<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> bolus<00:00:47.520> all<00:00:47.700> our

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and hence starting to bolus all our

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.630 
and hence starting to bolus all our
lambs<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.750> Animax<00:00:49.260> bonuses<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.610> a

huge<00:00:51.300> amount<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.570> success<00:00:51.949> what<00:00:52.949> health

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
huge amount of success what health

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
huge amount of success what health
problems<00:00:54.030> were<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.239> noticing<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> Lambs

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
problems were you noticing in the Lambs

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.520 
problems were you noticing in the Lambs
before<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.800> started<00:00:56.250> bonusing<00:00:56.820> them

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
before you started bonusing them

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.990 
before you started bonusing them
primarily<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.100> they<00:00:59.280> weren't<00:00:59.489> growing

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
primarily just that they weren't growing

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.389 
primarily just that they weren't growing
as<00:01:00.420> well<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.530> they<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.829> done<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> past

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
as well as they have done in the past

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.399 
as well as they have done in the past
and<00:01:02.940> also<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:03.629> were<00:01:03.690> looking<00:01:03.960> very<00:01:04.080> dry

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
and also they were looking very dry

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.640 
and also they were looking very dry
skinned<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.330> pick<00:01:06.330> up<00:01:06.510> immediately<00:01:07.080> because

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
skinned to pick up immediately because

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.060 
skinned to pick up immediately because
we<00:01:07.890> run<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.340> large<00:01:08.640> flock<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.970> sheep<00:01:09.140> we<00:01:10.140> spread

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
we run a large flock of sheep we spread

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.280 
we run a large flock of sheep we spread
out<00:01:11.250> different<00:01:11.729> grazing<00:01:12.180> etc<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.110> always

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
out different grazing etc and you always

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.499 
out different grazing etc and you always
have<00:01:13.650> some<00:01:14.100> lambs<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.610> will<00:01:14.790> do<00:01:15.000> well

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
have some lambs that will do well

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.510 
have some lambs that will do well
whatever<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.619> always<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> call

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
whatever and you always have what I call

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.160 
whatever and you always have what I call
some<00:01:17.790> bottom<00:01:18.210> end<00:01:18.390> lambs<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.900> there's<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
some bottom end lambs but there's a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.840 
some bottom end lambs but there's a
whole<00:01:19.380> picture<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.130> see<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> Lambs

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
whole picture we can see that the Lambs

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.359 
whole picture we can see that the Lambs
weren't<00:01:21.330> where<00:01:21.720> they<00:01:21.869> should<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.470> hence

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
weren't where they should be so hence

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.950 
weren't where they should be so hence
the<00:01:23.520> bonusing<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.210> hence<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> results<00:01:24.869> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the bonusing and hence the results that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.560 
the bonusing and hence the results that
we're<00:01:25.110> getting<00:01:25.439> after<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.490> started<00:01:26.970> bonusing

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
we're getting after you started bonusing

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.160 
we're getting after you started bonusing
what<00:01:27.840> results<00:01:28.380> did<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.560> notice<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.930> Lambs

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
what results did you notice the Lambs

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.960 
what results did you notice the Lambs
generally<00:01:32.040> pick<00:01:32.189> up<00:01:32.310> they<00:01:32.400> look<00:01:32.520> healthier

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
generally pick up they look healthier

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.630 
generally pick up they look healthier
better<00:01:33.600> skin<00:01:33.990> yeah<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:35.369> bit<00:01:35.460> more

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
better skin yeah a little bit more

also you know you can generally see when
your<00:01:45.990> flock<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.560> your<00:01:46.710> lambs<00:01:46.950> are<00:01:47.159> picking<00:01:47.490> up

administer<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:51.210> bonuses<00:01:51.600> are<00:01:51.750> easy<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
administer the bonuses are easy to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.719 
administer the bonuses are easy to
administer<00:01:52.350> yeah<00:01:52.740> we're<00:01:52.979> fortunate<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.640> have

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
administer yeah we're fortunate to have

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.670 
administer yeah we're fortunate to have
a<00:01:53.850> reasonably<00:01:54.329> good<00:01:54.390> paneling<00:01:55.079> system<00:01:55.439> here

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
a reasonably good paneling system here

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.800 
a reasonably good paneling system here
at<00:01:55.799> 3<00:01:56.009> foot<00:01:56.219> race<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:57.090> run<00:01:57.270> them<00:01:57.420> up<00:01:57.540> through

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
at 3 foot race we run them up through

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.990 
at 3 foot race we run them up through
obviously<00:01:58.229> keep<00:01:58.530> them<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.770> tight<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.790> now

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
obviously keep them up tight we have now

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.550 
obviously keep them up tight we have now
got<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> lot<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.509> arable<00:02:00.990> ground<00:02:01.229> that's<00:02:01.409> been

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
got a lot of arable ground that's been

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.420 
got a lot of arable ground that's been
taken<00:02:01.920> out<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.100> put<00:02:02.520> into<00:02:02.700> rail<00:02:03.180> overlays<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
taken out and put into rail overlays and

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.760 
taken out and put into rail overlays and
mentioning<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.579> red<00:02:06.000> clover<00:02:06.270> there<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:07.409> why

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
mentioning the red clover there is why

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.490 
mentioning the red clover there is why
we've<00:02:08.069> started<00:02:08.340> bonusing<00:02:08.879> our<00:02:09.060> use<00:02:09.470> because<00:02:10.470> a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
we've started bonusing our use because a

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.199 
we've started bonusing our use because a
big<00:02:11.039> chunk<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.430> time<00:02:11.640> they're<00:02:11.879> running<00:02:12.150> on

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
big chunk of the time they're running on

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.420 
big chunk of the time they're running on
the<00:02:12.300> red<00:02:12.450> clover<00:02:12.690> we're<00:02:13.020> feeding

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
the red clover we're feeding

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.789 
the red clover we're feeding
red<00:02:13.609> clover<00:02:13.819> silage<00:02:14.359> in<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.599> winter<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.170> we

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
red clover silage in the winter and we

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.069 
red clover silage in the winter and we
have<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.099> issue<00:02:16.250> with<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.609> goitrogens<00:02:17.079> so

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
have the issue with the goitrogens so

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.130 
have the issue with the goitrogens so
hence<00:02:18.379> bonusing<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.609> use<00:02:19.849> with<00:02:20.239> not<00:02:21.109> only

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
hence bonusing the use with not only

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.500 
hence bonusing the use with not only
problem<00:02:21.739> selenium<00:02:22.250> but<00:02:22.400> iodine<00:02:22.760> as<00:02:22.969> well<00:02:23.239> and

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
problem selenium but iodine as well and

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.709 
problem selenium but iodine as well and
we've<00:02:23.900> actually<00:02:24.079> found<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.819> second

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:26.719 
we've actually found that the second

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.709 
we've actually found that the second
year<00:02:26.989> in<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:27.950> have<00:02:28.189> rotated<00:02:28.879> higher<00:02:29.090> multiples

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:29.719 
year in we have rotated higher multiples

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.280 
year in we have rotated higher multiples
back<00:02:30.469> to<00:02:30.709> 250<00:02:31.579> years<00:02:31.790> carrying<00:02:32.150> triplets<00:02:32.329> and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
back to 250 years carrying triplets and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.170 
back to 250 years carrying triplets and
we<00:02:33.439> were<00:02:33.560> getting<00:02:33.709> some<00:02:33.889> steel<00:02:34.340> burst<00:02:34.579> in<00:02:34.849> the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
we were getting some steel burst in the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.770 
we were getting some steel burst in the
triplets

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
triplets

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.509 
triplets
there<00:02:36.260> was<00:02:36.439> no<00:02:36.620> classic<00:02:37.010> signs<00:02:37.219> of<00:02:37.340> any

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
there was no classic signs of any

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.759 
there was no classic signs of any
abortion<00:02:38.030> we<00:02:38.599> investigated<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:39.469> matter

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
abortion we investigated that matter

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.459 
abortion we investigated that matter
it's<00:02:40.400> definitely<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.909> iodine<00:02:41.329> levels<00:02:41.719> so

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:42.469 
it's definitely the iodine levels so

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.039 
it's definitely the iodine levels so
actually<00:02:42.889> our<00:02:43.129> use<00:02:43.489> last<00:02:44.450> year<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.900> were

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
actually our use last year that were

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.199 
actually our use last year that were
carrying<00:02:45.560> triples<00:02:45.980> we<00:02:46.159> actually<00:02:46.489> bolus<00:02:46.879> twice

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
carrying triples we actually bolus twice

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.929 
carrying triples we actually bolus twice
with<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.599> iodine<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.169> we<00:02:48.980> had<00:02:49.129> virtually<00:02:49.549> no

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
with the iodine and we had virtually no

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.000 
with the iodine and we had virtually no
stillbirths<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.930> we<00:02:51.079> couldn't<00:02:51.409> account<00:02:51.680> for

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
stillbirths that we couldn't account for

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.369 
stillbirths that we couldn't account for
this<00:02:52.220> year<00:02:52.579> but<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.120> feel<00:02:53.299> sure<00:02:53.329> that<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.169> is

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
this year but I feel sure that that is

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.250 
this year but I feel sure that that is
working<00:02:54.769> 100%<00:02:55.489> so<00:02:56.389> as<00:02:56.540> long<00:02:56.720> as<00:02:56.780> we're<00:02:57.109> growing

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
working 100% so as long as we're growing

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.229 
working 100% so as long as we're growing
the<00:02:57.530> REA<00:02:57.650> clover<00:02:58.099> which<00:02:58.669> is<00:02:58.819> part<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
the REA clover which is part of the

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.349 
the REA clover which is part of the
organic<00:02:59.629> system<00:02:59.810> then<00:03:00.500> yeah<00:03:01.370> that's<00:03:02.090> what

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
organic system then yeah that's what

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.719 
organic system then yeah that's what
we're<00:03:02.480> doing
