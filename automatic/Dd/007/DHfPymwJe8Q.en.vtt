something<00:02:37.790> cool<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.330> discovered<00:02:38.840> this

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
something cool that I discovered this

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.680 
something cool that I discovered this
year<00:02:39.380> with<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.950> kale<00:02:40.160> is<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.480> can<00:02:41.660> just

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
year with the kale is that you can just

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.870 
year with the kale is that you can just
pick<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.140> leaves<00:02:42.350> off<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.710> it<00:02:42.980> as<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.340> go<00:02:43.490> and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
pick the leaves off of it as you go and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.130 
pick the leaves off of it as you go and
it<00:02:44.030> will<00:02:44.150> grow<00:02:44.360> all<00:02:44.570> summer<00:02:44.840> long

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
it will grow all summer long

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.130 
it will grow all summer long
last<00:02:46.070> year<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.430> was<00:02:46.940> pulling<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.420> whole<00:02:47.600> plants

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
last year I was pulling the whole plants

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.340 
last year I was pulling the whole plants
when<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.560> picked<00:02:48.860> them<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.280> didn't<00:02:50.030> need<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.350> okay

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
when I picked them I didn't need to okay

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.400 
when I picked them I didn't need to okay
so<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.280> our<00:02:52.670> kale<00:02:52.970> now<00:02:53.900> graph<00:02:54.140> what<00:02:54.380> is

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
so that is our kale now graph what is

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.090 
so that is our kale now graph what is
this<00:02:54.830> like<00:02:56.830> cilantro

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
bought at Whole Foods these were like

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.830 
bought at Whole Foods these were like
sprouts<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.710> they<00:03:58.340> are<00:03:58.490> these<00:03:58.670> tomatoes<00:04:00.250> and
