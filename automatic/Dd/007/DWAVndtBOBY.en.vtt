00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
tournament but of course in a few days

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.210 
tournament but of course in a few days
time<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.509> would<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:42.990> expired<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.799> we'll<00:01:44.040> get

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
time that would be expired and we'll get

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.260 
time that would be expired and we'll get
a<00:01:44.369> new<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:45.270> new<00:01:46.729> tournament<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.790> competing<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
a new a new tournament to competing and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.730 
a new a new tournament to competing and
we<00:01:48.360> cannot<00:01:48.570> really<00:01:48.750> use<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.200> team<00:01:49.470> because

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
we cannot really use this team because

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.469 
we cannot really use this team because
the<00:01:50.009> requirements<00:01:50.579> are<00:01:50.640> most<00:01:50.820> likely<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the requirements are most likely from a

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.660 
the requirements are most likely from a
specific<00:01:51.659> league<00:01:52.259> when<00:01:52.860> competing<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.520> these

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
specific league when competing in these

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.520 
specific league when competing in these
tournaments<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.720> team<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.110> be<00:01:55.259> used<00:01:55.439> in

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
tournaments so this team can be used in

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.620 
tournaments so this team can be used in
the<00:01:55.649> championship<00:01:56.340> tournament<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the championship tournament and in the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.359 
the championship tournament and in the
championship<00:01:58.140> tournament<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.890> use<00:01:59.130> all

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
championship tournament we can use all

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.670 
championship tournament we can use all
the<00:01:59.430> players<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.240> collect<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:01.049> compete<00:02:01.469> with

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
the players we collect to compete with

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.740 
the players we collect to compete with
so<00:02:02.310> we<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.430> sort<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.729> build<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.060> team<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
so we can sort of build a team and and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.139 
so we can sort of build a team and and
play<00:02:04.200> with<00:02:04.380> them<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:05.460> collect<00:02:05.759> more<00:02:06.000> and

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
play with them so as we collect more and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.819 
play with them so as we collect more and
more<00:02:06.270> team<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.600> season<00:02:06.899> players<00:02:07.140> our<00:02:07.350> squat

more team the season players our squat

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.559 
more team the season players our squat
for<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> championship<00:02:08.640> tournament<00:02:09.239> will<00:02:09.360> get

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
for the championship tournament will get

for the championship tournament will get
really<00:02:10.080> strong<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.590> hopefully<00:02:11.280> will<00:02:11.400> make<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
really strong and hopefully will make it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.610 
really strong and hopefully will make it
easier<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.270> us<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.360> win<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.870> whereas<00:02:13.379> each

players if that makes sense it'll make

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.280 
players if that makes sense it'll make
sense<00:02:20.849> as<00:02:21.000> we<00:02:21.030> go<00:02:21.299> along<00:02:21.390> I'd<00:02:21.750> say<00:02:21.989> and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
sense as we go along I'd say and

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.920 
sense as we go along I'd say and
hopefully<00:02:22.439> you<00:02:22.799> understood<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.310> rules<00:02:23.640> here

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
hopefully you understood the rules here

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.199 
hopefully you understood the rules here
but<00:02:24.930> yeah<00:02:25.079> jumping<00:02:25.500> into<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.099> first<00:02:26.430> game<00:02:27.000> off

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
but yeah jumping into the first game off

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.589 
but yeah jumping into the first game off
the<00:02:27.299> series<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.319> his<00:02:28.650> 1st<00:02:28.680> episode<00:02:29.390> we<00:02:30.390> come

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
the series and his 1st episode we come

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.119 
the series and his 1st episode we come
up<00:02:30.720> against<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.079> pretty<00:02:31.319> strong<00:02:31.620> team<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:31.920> that

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
up against a pretty strong team and that

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.160 
up against a pretty strong team and that
is<00:02:32.310> probably<00:02:32.610> something<00:02:33.209> more<00:02:33.450> face<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.989> most

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
is probably something more face and most

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.649 
is probably something more face and most
of<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:35.129> games<00:02:35.340> we<00:02:35.519> play<00:02:35.549> but<00:02:35.879> it's<00:02:36.030> also<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.360> bit

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
of the games we play but it's also a bit

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.089 
of the games we play but it's also a bit
of<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> challenge<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:37.440> suppose<00:02:37.799> we'll<00:02:37.980> be

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
of the challenge I suppose we'll be

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.099 
of the challenge I suppose we'll be
playing<00:02:38.310> with<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.489> silver<00:02:38.760> team<00:02:39.060> with<00:02:39.659> one

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
playing with a silver team with one

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.569 
playing with a silver team with one
maybe<00:02:40.440> two<00:02:40.530> three<00:02:40.890> team<00:02:41.159> of<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.310> season

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
maybe two three team of the season

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:42.740 
maybe two three team of the season
players<00:02:41.790> depending<00:02:42.209> on<00:02:42.269> how<00:02:42.390> many<00:02:42.450> will

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
players depending on how many will

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.839 
players depending on how many will
unlock<00:02:43.079> and<00:02:43.379> will<00:02:43.769> face<00:02:43.980> gold<00:02:44.340> teams<00:02:44.609> which

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
unlock and will face gold teams which

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.369 
unlock and will face gold teams which
most<00:02:45.150> likely<00:02:45.239> also<00:02:45.599> will<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:45.959> team<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.319> the

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
most likely also will have team of the

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.920 
most likely also will have team of the
season<00:02:46.709> players<00:02:46.950> into<00:02:47.370> them<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:48.150> yeah<00:02:48.329> for

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
my first game you can see my opponent

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.030 
my first game you can see my opponent

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
them but that didn't matter because our

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.110

the players a lot of people went to

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.190 
the players a lot of people went to

because they were good players and
effective<00:05:19.770> plays<00:05:20.010> and<00:05:20.430> now<00:05:20.670> is<00:05:20.910> what<00:05:21.120> I<00:05:21.150> saw

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
effective plays and now is what I saw

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.420 
effective plays and now is what I saw
right<00:05:21.690> from<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:21.930> start<00:05:21.990> of<00:05:22.290> the<00:05:22.320> game<00:05:22.560> we

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
right from the start of the game we

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.580 
right from the start of the game we
played<00:05:23.670> 13<00:05:24.210> minutes<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.810> my<00:05:25.020> opponent<00:05:25.530> was

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
played 13 minutes and my opponent was

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.340 
played 13 minutes and my opponent was
already<00:05:26.340> up<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.940> nil<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:28.020> think<00:05:28.230> what's

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
already up to nil I think what's

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.980 
already up to nil I think what's
Balotelli's<00:05:28.890> going<00:05:29.190> both<00:05:29.400> of<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:29.670> goals<00:05:29.990> just

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
Balotelli's going both of the goals just

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.290 
Balotelli's going both of the goals just
a<00:05:31.110> terrible<00:05:31.380> start<00:05:31.860> for<00:05:32.010> me<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.520> my<00:05:32.820> opponent

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
a terrible start for me and my opponent

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.270 
a terrible start for me and my opponent
was<00:05:33.420> just<00:05:33.690> pushing<00:05:33.960> on<00:05:34.290> trying<00:05:34.740> to<00:05:34.860> score<00:05:35.070> more

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.400 
was just pushing on trying to score more
goals<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:36.030> I<00:05:36.120> was<00:05:36.300> really<00:05:36.690> struggling<00:05:37.110> in

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
goals and I was really struggling in

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.040 
goals and I was really struggling in
this<00:05:37.530> up<00:05:37.770> but<00:05:37.980> then<00:05:38.160> 19th<00:05:38.640> minute<00:05:38.760> we<00:05:39.420> get<00:05:39.570> into

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.110 
this up but then 19th minute we get into
the<00:05:40.200> box<00:05:40.500> and<00:05:40.770> that<00:05:41.670> should<00:05:41.910> have<00:05:42.000> been<00:05:42.030> a

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
the box and that should have been a

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.790 
the box and that should have been a
penalty<00:05:42.300> but<00:05:42.660> the<00:05:43.050> referee<00:05:43.230> didn't<00:05:43.680> give

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.950
