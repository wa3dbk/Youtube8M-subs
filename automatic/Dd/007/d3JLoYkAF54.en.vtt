00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 and friends now I'm going to teach you later 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.510
 of being regulated the floating of the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.759
 carburetors to check if the level of 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.410
 the vats that will be done a month if they were not 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.120
 it must be open again 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.640
 carburetors regulate again the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.130
 flowering 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.430
 how do you do this first one was installed 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.230
 bath 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.960
 here I am going to move now 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.230
 in that position under the broom 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.790
 has a fuel outlet 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.730
 of good and clesa 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.090
 later, what is done is to open 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.090
 all 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.610
 if you can see better 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.430
 open the screw highlight that is the 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.430
 speech screw 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.079
 I do not know if it looks good but it is the one that is 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.800
 below the carburetors 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.910
 is here 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.989
 I do not know if I achieve are well 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.989
 This could be 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.230
 and some below if you can or 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.230
 they grew up together 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.860
 and culture one more time because 2 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.680
 for not having making this video a 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.540
 only hand once you add the 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.470
 speech and position yourself always put 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.620
 this hose below to see the level 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.130
 of 5 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.240
 correct then that screw that is 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.530
 there the one that opens 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.060
 let the neighbor pass to the hose 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.299
 which then we do what is called 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.579
 in mechanical or in physics or in 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.460
 Hydraulics the subject of glasses 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.240
 communicants then we place our 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.380
 blood and from there 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.659
 and the level of benzine 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.980
 we hang our flag and the level of 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.180
 benzine has to give us 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:07.110
 at this point at that point they had is in 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.470
 this case taquilleras indicates that the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.630
 neighbor has been a lot and the flotation that 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.460
 or badly badly regulated 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.310
 let me see if the test of the best 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.760
 position so you can see excuse 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.440
 that the camera moves a lot 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.980
 but one and a half compliments 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.990
 so now if we see we see that the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.620
 neighbor of sample at this moment is 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.930
 up there which is very bad 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.580
 if we see it well 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.410
 apologies 2 in the morning 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.720
 we see that it is there being the other day 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.790
 here 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.280
 that's the level of benzine with that 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.250
 you regulating where it meets the 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.690
 lower needle with the carburetor in the 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.000
 As the neighbor has to arrive 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:01.050
 more or less millimeters of low kingdom 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.650
 but there is not there not because that provokes 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.730
 that after the carburetor 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:11.420
 votes of oaks in this other case 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:15.870
 we have a well leveled tank let's leave 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.030
 back is also connected from below 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.380
 and they realize the hose comes out of the 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.690
 Cuba 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.220
 well and there's our level of 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.380
 fuel then if we place 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.600
 we put our hose that we can 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.520
 appreciate I do not know if in this video it 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.380
 appreciate but you know the level of 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:40.190
 just fuel in the culture of the 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:44.550
 reading or this is what it's called 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.460
 float that either leveled if not the 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.200
 flotation is not well leveled and that 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.260
 they have it from throwing a lot of fuel 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.640
 so chokes the bike but it has to 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.740
 serve this video excuse me as I 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.640
 that this one but with one hand you can not 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.640
 do better thanks
