00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.200 
them I check to see if it didn't run
into<00:00:42.469> my<00:00:42.710> side<00:00:42.949> balls<00:00:43.190> which<00:00:43.519> it<00:00:43.670> didn't<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:44.180> I

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
into my side balls which it didn't so I

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.260 
into my side balls which it didn't so I
cure<00:00:44.539> them

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.080

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
of working I really like this method on

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.399 
of working I really like this method on
myself<00:01:37.679> because<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.220> saves<00:01:38.490> me<00:01:38.700> some<00:01:38.850> time<00:01:39.409> I

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
myself because it saves me some time I

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.950 
myself because it saves me some time I
hear<00:01:40.920> them<00:01:41.100> individually<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> while<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
hear them individually and while the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.809 
hear them individually and while the
other<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.409> curing<00:01:44.039> I<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.369> work<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
other one is curing I can work on the

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:54.529 
other one is curing I can work on the
next<00:01:45.030> nail<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:52.250> have<00:01:53.250> really<00:01:53.610> flexible<00:01:53.969> fingers

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
next nail I have really flexible fingers

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.350 
next nail I have really flexible fingers
so<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.020> way<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.229> working<00:01:55.399> suits<00:01:56.399> my<00:01:56.789> way<00:01:57.060> if

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
so this way of working suits my way if

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.510 
so this way of working suits my way if
you<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.140> really<00:01:58.319> stiff<00:01:58.679> fingers<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.280> don't

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
you have really stiff fingers I don't

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:10.260 
you have really stiff fingers I don't
suggest<00:01:59.729> doing<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.390> because<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.780> might<00:02:00.929> hurt

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.440 

I<00:02:10.440> must<00:02:11.440> say<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:11.710> far<00:02:12.160> so<00:02:12.460> good<00:02:12.880> if<00:02:13.000> they<00:02:13.240> don't

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
I must say so far so good if they don't

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.360 
I must say so far so good if they don't
have<00:02:13.630> any<00:02:13.780> shrinkage<00:02:14.080> they<00:02:14.800> don't<00:02:15.100> have<00:02:15.250> any

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
have any shrinkage they don't have any

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.670 
have any shrinkage they don't have any
wrinkling<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.480> polish<00:02:16.840> looks<00:02:17.050> nice<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.500> even

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
wrinkling the polish looks nice and even

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.610 
wrinkling the polish looks nice and even
but<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.760> definitely<00:02:18.970> does<00:02:19.540> need<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.260> second

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
but it definitely does need a second

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:37.800 
but it definitely does need a second
coat

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.809 

so<00:02:38.810> lastly<00:02:39.319> you<00:02:39.739> can<00:02:39.890> do<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.130> thumb<00:02:40.370> or<00:02:40.610> you

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
so lastly you can do the thumb or you

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.580 
so lastly you can do the thumb or you
can<00:02:40.970> do<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.209> first<00:02:41.510> whichever<00:02:42.110> suits<00:02:42.319> your

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
can do that first whichever suits your

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:52.990 
can do that first whichever suits your
preference<00:02:43.069> I<00:02:51.040> try<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.100> apply<00:02:52.400> this<00:02:52.670> coat<00:02:52.970> a

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
preference I try to apply this coat a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.059 
preference I try to apply this coat a
little<00:02:53.239> bit<00:02:53.510> thicker<00:02:53.840> just<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.500> check<00:02:54.770> and

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
little bit thicker just to check and

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.309 
little bit thicker just to check and
experiment<00:02:55.819> with<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:56.870> did<00:02:57.080> cure

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
experiment with it and it did cure

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:15.140 
experiment with it and it did cure
really<00:02:57.680> well<00:02:57.800> as<00:02:57.980> well

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.660 

this<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.049> what<00:03:16.230> one<00:03:16.470> coat<00:03:16.709> looks<00:03:16.980> like<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.489> can

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
this is what one coat looks like you can

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.490 
this is what one coat looks like you can
tell<00:03:17.849> that<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.299> shines<00:03:18.659> a<00:03:18.870> little<00:03:19.110> bit<00:03:19.200> through

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
tell that it shines a little bit through

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.210 
tell that it shines a little bit through
so<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:19.920> needs<00:03:20.129> a<00:03:20.310> second<00:03:20.730> coat<00:03:25.159> this<00:03:26.159> time

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
so it needs a second coat this time

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.240 
so it needs a second coat this time
around<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:27.030> do<00:03:27.090> them<00:03:27.390> all<00:03:27.599> five<00:03:27.959> at<00:03:28.200> once

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.190 

they<00:03:34.250> do<00:03:34.310> stay<00:03:34.730> glossy<00:03:35.420> after<00:03:35.810> they've<00:03:35.959> been

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
they do stay glossy after they've been

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.309 
they do stay glossy after they've been
cured<00:03:36.530> which<00:03:36.860> I<00:03:36.980> really<00:03:37.220> like<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:38.260> they<00:03:39.260> do

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
cured which I really like and they do

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.559 
cured which I really like and they do
apply<00:03:39.860> really<00:03:40.280> smoothly<00:03:40.670> on<00:03:40.970> top<00:03:41.299> of<00:03:41.450> each

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
apply really smoothly on top of each

00:03:41.569 --> 00:04:24.220 
apply really smoothly on top of each
other<00:03:41.690> as<00:03:41.959> well

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.620 

so<00:04:24.800> when<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.130> second<00:04:25.520> layer<00:04:25.640> has<00:04:25.940> been<00:04:26.180> cured

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
so when the second layer has been cured

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.370 
so when the second layer has been cured
I<00:04:26.900> applied<00:04:27.260> a<00:04:27.290> top<00:04:27.680> gel<00:04:28.010> I<00:04:28.250> do<00:04:28.640> this<00:04:29.210> one<00:04:29.570> one<00:04:30.260> at

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
I applied a top gel I do this one one at

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.320 
I applied a top gel I do this one one at
a<00:04:30.410> time<00:04:30.710> as<00:04:30.920> well<00:04:31.100> because<00:04:31.490> I<00:04:31.610> don't<00:04:31.970> know<00:04:32.120> how

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
a time as well because I don't know how

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.240 
a time as well because I don't know how
they<00:04:32.570> will<00:04:32.720> react<00:04:33.170> when<00:04:34.040> they've<00:04:34.220> been

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
they will react when they've been

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.220 
they will react when they've been
applied<00:04:34.760> if<00:04:35.000> they're<00:04:35.240> runny<00:04:35.510> if<00:04:35.840> they're<00:04:36.050> not

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
applied if they're runny if they're not

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:52.430 
applied if they're runny if they're not
runny<00:04:36.560> which<00:04:37.550> they<00:04:38.390> say<00:04:38.660> put<00:04:38.870> quite<00:04:39.170> well

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.960 

sometimes<00:04:53.440> when<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.830> apply<00:04:54.130> it<00:04:54.160> top<00:04:54.490> gel<00:04:54.760> and

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
sometimes when you apply it top gel and

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.210 
sometimes when you apply it top gel and
you<00:04:55.060> put<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.419> underneath<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:56.080> UV<00:04:56.350> lamp<00:04:56.500> or<00:04:56.770> LED

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
you put it underneath the UV lamp or LED

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.310 
you put it underneath the UV lamp or LED
lamp<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.580> product<00:04:58.030> itself<00:04:58.419> will<00:04:58.690> heat<00:04:58.930> up<00:04:58.960> for

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
lamp the product itself will heat up for

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.800 
lamp the product itself will heat up for
a<00:04:59.350> short<00:04:59.680> period<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.160> time<00:05:00.220> which<00:05:01.120> makes<00:05:01.449> the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
a short period of time which makes the

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.570 
a short period of time which makes the
product<00:05:02.260> a<00:05:02.380> little<00:05:02.650> bit<00:05:02.740> more<00:05:03.010> runny<00:05:03.220> than<00:05:03.460> it

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
product a little bit more runny than it

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.520 
product a little bit more runny than it
eventually<00:05:03.910> was<00:05:04.300> before<00:05:05.260> it<00:05:05.380> actually

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
eventually was before it actually

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.490 
eventually was before it actually
settles<00:05:06.160> down<00:05:06.370> I<00:05:06.729> did<00:05:07.600> not<00:05:07.780> see<00:05:07.930> any<00:05:08.080> problem

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
settles down I did not see any problem

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.010 
settles down I did not see any problem
at<00:05:08.620> all<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:09.070> it<00:05:09.220> will<00:05:09.430> just<00:05:09.940> stay<00:05:10.180> put<00:05:10.479> for<00:05:10.870> all

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
at all and it will just stay put for all

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.560 
at all and it will just stay put for all
the<00:05:11.169> time<00:05:11.440> so<00:05:12.340> I<00:05:12.370> applied<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:13.060> gel<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:13.510> the

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
the time so I applied the gel and the

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.620 
the time so I applied the gel and the
remainder<00:05:14.290> of<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.710> three<00:05:14.949> nails<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.630> some

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
remainder of the three nails and some

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:30.920 
remainder of the three nails and some
actually

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.300 

so<00:05:31.930> in<00:05:32.080> all<00:05:32.230> the<00:05:32.380> nails<00:05:32.560> have<00:05:32.770> been<00:05:32.950> fully

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
so in all the nails have been fully

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.520 
so in all the nails have been fully
cured<00:05:33.730> I<00:05:34.030> top<00:05:34.390> the<00:05:34.630> nail<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:35.020> see<00:05:35.170> if<00:05:35.260> it<00:05:35.350> has<00:05:35.500> a

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
cured I top the nail to see if it has a

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.560 
cured I top the nail to see if it has a
sticky<00:05:35.920> layer<00:05:36.220> in<00:05:36.460> which<00:05:36.730> it<00:05:36.940> does

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
sticky layer in which it does

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.550 
sticky layer in which it does
I<00:05:37.650> just<00:05:38.650> got<00:05:38.950> a<00:05:39.480> limb<00:05:40.480> free<00:05:40.720> wipe<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.200> some

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
I just got a limb free wipe and some

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.610 
I just got a limb free wipe and some
alcohol<00:05:42.250> and<00:05:42.910> swipe<00:05:43.450> to<00:05:43.480> tacky<00:05:43.900> layer<00:05:44.110> away

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.650
