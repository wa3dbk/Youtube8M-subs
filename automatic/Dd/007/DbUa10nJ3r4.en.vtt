add some ice whoa whoa Ben that's right
our<00:00:22.289> bodies<00:00:22.710> burn<00:00:23.010> calories<00:00:23.369> by<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> warming<00:00:24.689> up

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
our bodies burn calories by a warming up

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.609 
our bodies burn calories by a warming up
ice-cold<00:00:25.199> water

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
ice-cold water

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.679 
ice-cold water
but<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.039> understand<00:00:26.460> whether<00:00:26.640> ice<00:00:27.029> water<00:00:27.359> can

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
but to understand whether ice water can

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.450 
but to understand whether ice water can
be<00:00:27.840> an<00:00:28.080> effective<00:00:28.470> weight-loss<00:00:28.890> tool<00:00:29.310> we

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
be an effective weight-loss tool we

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.160 
be an effective weight-loss tool we
first<00:00:29.699> need<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> talk<00:00:30.179> about<00:00:30.359> what<00:00:30.750> calorie

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
first need to talk about what calorie

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.900 
first need to talk about what calorie
burning<00:00:31.439> entails<00:00:32.070> that's<00:00:32.489> right<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> takes

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
burning entails that's right it takes

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.120 
burning entails that's right it takes
one<00:00:33.329> calorie<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:34.140> raise<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.500> temperature<00:00:34.649> of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
one calorie to raise the temperature of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.100 
one calorie to raise the temperature of
one<00:00:35.670> liter<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.300> water<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:37.410> degree<00:00:38.129> Celsius<00:00:39.110> so

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
one liter of water one degree Celsius so

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.110 
one liter of water one degree Celsius so
clearly<00:00:40.440> calories<00:00:41.430> are<00:00:41.550> burned<00:00:41.730> off<00:00:41.910> during

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
clearly calories are burned off during

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.270 
clearly calories are burned off during
the<00:00:42.660> process<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.230> our<00:00:43.320> bodies<00:00:43.590> heating<00:00:44.100> up

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the process of our bodies heating up

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.940 
the process of our bodies heating up
that<00:00:44.550> cold<00:00:44.910> water<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.539> our<00:00:45.570> internal<00:00:46.440> body

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
that cold water to our internal body

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.510 
that cold water to our internal body
temperature<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.239> around<00:00:48.469> 37<00:00:49.469> degrees<00:00:49.520> Celsius

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
temperature of around 37 degrees Celsius

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.880 
temperature of around 37 degrees Celsius
translated<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.510> course<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.930> 98.6<00:00:52.829> degrees

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
translated of course the 98.6 degrees

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.720 
translated of course the 98.6 degrees

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.340 
Fahrenheit
oh<00:00:53.760> nice<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.449> right<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.809> let's<00:00:55.050> figure<00:00:55.230> out

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
oh nice all right so let's figure out

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.770 
oh nice all right so let's figure out
exactly<00:00:55.620> how<00:00:55.980> many<00:00:56.190> calories<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:56.910> burn<00:00:57.059> we're

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
exactly how many calories we burn we're

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.670 
exactly how many calories we burn we're
drinking<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:59.180> 16-ounce<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.629> half<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.469> liter

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
drinking a 16-ounce or half a liter

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.319 
drinking a 16-ounce or half a liter
glass<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.340> ice<00:01:02.609> water

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
glass of ice water

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.660 
glass of ice water
well<00:01:03.570> let's<00:01:04.049> estimate<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> temperature

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
well let's estimate that the temperature

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.109 
well let's estimate that the temperature
of<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.970> ice<00:01:06.000> water<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.659> zero<00:01:07.340> degrees<00:01:08.340> Celsius

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
of the ice water is zero degrees Celsius

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.090 
of the ice water is zero degrees Celsius
or<00:01:09.299> freezing<00:01:09.869> yeah<00:01:10.290> okay<00:01:10.590> that's<00:01:10.740> some<00:01:10.890> cold

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
or freezing yeah okay that's some cold

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.789 
or freezing yeah okay that's some cold
water<00:01:11.310> that's<00:01:11.610> really<00:01:12.000> cold<00:01:12.180> water<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.650> we

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
water that's really cold water so as we

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.440 
water that's really cold water so as we
mentioned<00:01:13.920> earlier<00:01:14.310> our<00:01:14.549> body<00:01:14.909> temperatures

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
mentioned earlier our body temperatures

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.230 
mentioned earlier our body temperatures
somewhere<00:01:15.840> around<00:01:16.110> 37<00:01:16.950> degrees<00:01:16.979> Celsius<00:01:17.939> in

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
somewhere around 37 degrees Celsius in

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.749 
somewhere around 37 degrees Celsius in
which<00:01:18.570> case<00:01:18.900> if<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.350> drink<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.740> liter<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.159> that

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
which case if you drink a liter of that

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.660 
which case if you drink a liter of that
ice<00:01:21.030> water<00:01:21.390> you'll<00:01:21.780> burn<00:01:22.020> around<00:01:22.460> 37<00:01:23.460> calories

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
ice water you'll burn around 37 calories

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.719 
ice water you'll burn around 37 calories
as<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> by-product<00:01:25.200> boom<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.009> considering

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
as a by-product boom and considering

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.730 
as a by-product boom and considering
that<00:01:26.759> 37<00:01:27.450> calories<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> context<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
that 37 calories in the context of a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.940 
that 37 calories in the context of a
2,000<00:01:29.280> calorie<00:01:29.310> daily<00:01:29.970> diet<00:01:30.270> isn't<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
2,000 calorie daily diet isn't that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
2,000 calorie daily diet isn't that
significant<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.939> portion<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.869> means<00:01:34.140> that

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
significant of a portion it means that

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.840 
significant of a portion it means that
even<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.740> drink<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> recommended<00:01:35.700> 8

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
even if you drink the recommended 8

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.270 
even if you drink the recommended 8
glasses<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.479> water<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.990> glory<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.710> adds<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.220> to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
glasses of water and glory it adds up to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.690 
glasses of water and glory it adds up to
just<00:01:38.880> under<00:01:39.030> two<00:01:39.329> liters<00:01:39.780> you're<00:01:40.229> burning

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
just under two liters you're burning

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.060 
just under two liters you're burning
less<00:01:41.700> than<00:01:41.909> 75<00:01:42.420> calories<00:01:42.720> that's<00:01:43.710> not<00:01:43.920> that's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
less than 75 calories that's not that's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.789 
less than 75 calories that's not that's
not<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.430> much<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.420> Ben<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.619> can

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
not that much but but Ben you can

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.679 
not that much but but Ben you can
increase<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.369> calorie<00:01:47.670> burning<00:01:47.970> effect<00:01:48.450> by

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
increase that calorie burning effect by

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.480 
increase that calorie burning effect by
chewing<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.350> ice<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.040> takes<00:01:50.189> 80

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
chewing on ice because it takes 80

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.600 
chewing on ice because it takes 80
calories<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.570> melt<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.320> liter<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.009> ice<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.490> if

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
calories to melt a liter of ice so if

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.490 
calories to melt a liter of ice so if
you<00:01:53.700> freeze<00:01:54.119> half<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.810> your<00:01:54.930> daily<00:01:55.229> water

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
you freeze half of your daily water

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.480 
you freeze half of your daily water
intake<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
intake and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.609 
intake and
just<00:01:56.670> eat<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.060> ice<00:01:57.299> you'll<00:01:58.079> burn<00:01:58.259> an<00:01:58.380> extra

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
just eat that ice you'll burn an extra

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.560 
just eat that ice you'll burn an extra
80<00:01:58.740> calories<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.430> possibly<00:02:00.119> need<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.329> go<00:02:00.420> see

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
80 calories and possibly need to go see

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.160 
80 calories and possibly need to go see
the<00:02:00.659> dentist

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the dentist

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.039

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
yes for you you taste chewing habit

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.749 
yes for you you taste chewing habit
