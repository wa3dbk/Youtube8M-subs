00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
day and that make conundrums Fink's a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.370 
day and that make conundrums Fink's a
little<00:00:25.140> less<00:00:25.289> exciting<00:00:26.810> so<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.080> could<00:00:28.199> take

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
little less exciting so it could take

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.650 
little less exciting so it could take
sign<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.890> blood<00:00:29.039> or<00:00:29.160> probably<00:00:29.730> your<00:00:29.880> armor

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
sign in blood or probably your armor

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.510 
sign in blood or probably your armor
dissension<00:00:31.170> instead<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.399> think

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
dissension instead but I think

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.790 
dissension instead but I think
conundrums<00:00:33.210> Fink's<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:34.260> blue<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.500> just

really<00:00:35.040> good<00:00:35.190> seems<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.149> pretty<00:00:36.510> safe<00:00:36.780> bet

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840

really good seems like a pretty safe bet
here<00:00:38.989> okay<00:00:39.989> that's<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.500> pretty<00:00:40.680> situational

as<00:00:44.579> far<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:45.059> being<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.280> you<00:00:47.280> know<00:00:47.399> top

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
as far as being on the you know top

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.729 
as far as being on the you know top
inside<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> damage<00:00:48.870> level<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.320> what<00:00:49.469> auras

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
inside of the damage level of what auras

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.049 
inside of the damage level of what auras
can<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.930> seems<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> solid<00:00:52.829> plan<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
can do so that seems like a solid plan I

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.840 
can do so that seems like a solid plan I
mean<00:00:54.469> blue<00:00:55.469> red<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.949> obviously<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.489> good<00:00:56.640> color

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
mean blue red is obviously a good color

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.430 
mean blue red is obviously a good color
combination<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.600> pretty<00:00:57.809> much<00:00:57.870> every<00:00:58.230> set

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
combination in pretty much every set

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.130 
combination in pretty much every set
ever<00:00:58.969> on<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> other<00:01:00.120> hand<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.690> blue<00:01:00.899> white

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
ever on the other hand so is blue white

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.290 
ever on the other hand so is blue white
and<00:01:01.170> pacifism<00:01:01.949> definitely<00:01:02.460> stands<00:01:02.760> out<00:01:02.969> here

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and pacifism definitely stands out here

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.920 
and pacifism definitely stands out here
um<00:01:04.250> I<00:01:05.250> think<00:01:05.280> passivism<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.390> probably<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
um I think passivism is probably just a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.300 
um I think passivism is probably just a
little<00:01:07.140> bit<00:01:07.260> better<00:01:07.350> than<00:01:07.619> SHIVs<00:01:07.920> embrace

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
little bit better than SHIVs embrace

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.160 
little bit better than SHIVs embrace
although<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.850> might<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.510> ignorance

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
although that might be just ignorance

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.760 
although that might be just ignorance
talking<00:01:11.900> hmm<00:01:14.420> yeah<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.930> mean<00:01:16.380> none<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> these

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
talking hmm yeah I mean none of these

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.620 
talking hmm yeah I mean none of these
cars<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.369> compared<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> pacifism<00:01:18.330> or

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
cars really compared to pacifism or

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.080 
cars really compared to pacifism or
SHIVs<00:01:18.810> embrace<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.640> think<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.939> give

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.199 
take a little flyer over this card which
is<00:02:16.190> such<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> good<00:02:17.120> card<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.280> card<00:02:19.520> you

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
is such a good card so this card you

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.000 
is such a good card so this card you
know<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.390> it's<00:02:20.930> better<00:02:21.110> than<00:02:21.380> draw<00:02:21.590> two<00:02:21.770> cards

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
know you it's better than draw two cards

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.600 
know you it's better than draw two cards
obviously<00:02:22.820> um<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:24.230> if<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.740> really<00:02:24.770> need<00:02:25.340> a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
obviously um and if you really need a

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.520 
obviously um and if you really need a
card<00:02:25.970> like<00:02:26.270> that<00:02:26.330> day<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.840> judgment<00:02:27.320> that<00:02:27.440> you

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
card like that day of judgment that you

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.350 
card like that day of judgment that you
have<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.860> hit<00:02:28.040> then<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:28.580> can<00:02:28.730> really<00:02:28.970> be<00:02:29.090> like

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
have to hit then it can really be like

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.290 
have to hit then it can really be like
draw<00:02:29.660> 6<00:02:30.020> cards<00:02:30.640> because<00:02:31.640> all<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:32.000> need<00:02:32.180> is

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
draw 6 cards because all you need is

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.380 
draw 6 cards because all you need is
that<00:02:32.450> one<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.930> then<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.110> win<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.380> game<00:02:33.590> I'm

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
that one and then you win the game I'm

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.420 
that one and then you win the game I'm
sort<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.450> from<00:02:35.660> Pegasus<00:02:36.440> definitely<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.280> one

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
sort of from Pegasus definitely is one

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.979 
sort of from Pegasus definitely is one
to<00:02:37.550> think<00:02:37.730> about<00:02:38.030> here<00:02:40.360> it's<00:02:41.360> harder<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.660> find

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
to think about here it's harder to find

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.250 
to think about here it's harder to find
good<00:02:42.260> early<00:02:42.830> drops<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.750> that's<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.050> good<00:02:45.200> one

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
good early drops and that's a good one

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.440 
good early drops and that's a good one
however<00:02:48.260> I'm<00:02:48.680> not<00:02:48.860> sat<00:02:49.610> on<00:02:49.640> white<00:02:49.970> yet<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.390> I'm

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
however I'm not sat on white yet and I'm

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.090 
however I'm not sat on white yet and I'm
definitely<00:02:50.690> set<00:02:51.110> on<00:02:51.200> blue<00:02:51.440> especially<00:02:51.980> after

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
definitely set on blue especially after

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.729 
definitely set on blue especially after
taking<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:52.670> for<00:02:52.910> see<00:02:56.230> okay<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:57.440> got<00:02:57.620> my

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
taking this for see okay and I got my

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.880 
taking this for see okay and I got my
chance<00:02:57.950> anyway<00:02:58.520> so<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:59.810> really<00:03:00.020> harbor

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
chance anyway so it's really harbor

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.940 
chance anyway so it's really harbor
serpent<00:03:01.459> or<00:03:01.580> storm<00:03:02.420> front<00:03:02.720> Pegasus<00:03:03.260> look<00:03:03.860> at

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
serpent or storm front Pegasus look at

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.199 
serpent or storm front Pegasus look at
this<00:03:04.040> point<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.340> don't<00:03:04.370> have<00:03:04.640> any<00:03:04.790> reason<00:03:05.180> not

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
this point I don't have any reason not

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.210 
this point I don't have any reason not
to<00:03:05.330> stick<00:03:05.660> with<00:03:05.810> blue<00:03:05.989> white<00:03:06.170> really<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.680> know

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
to stick with blue white really I know

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.979 
to stick with blue white really I know
it's<00:03:07.519> a<00:03:07.549> good<00:03:07.640> color<00:03:07.820> combination<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.600> continue

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
it's a good color combination I continue

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.240 
it's a good color combination I continue
to<00:03:09.019> see<00:03:09.230> good<00:03:09.410> cards<00:03:09.739> which<00:03:09.860> means<00:03:10.070> it's

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
to see good cards which means it's

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.310 
to see good cards which means it's
probably<00:03:10.400> open<00:03:13.299> an<00:03:14.299> elite<00:03:14.570> Vanguard<00:03:15.019> is<00:03:15.170> not

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
probably open an elite Vanguard is not

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.690 
probably open an elite Vanguard is not
really<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.680> type<00:03:15.830> of<00:03:15.860> deck<00:03:16.160> I'm<00:03:16.340> building

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
really the type of deck I'm building

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.310 
really the type of deck I'm building
this<00:03:16.820> is<00:03:17.000> clearly<00:03:17.239> more<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:17.660> control<00:03:18.080> deck

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
this is clearly more of a control deck

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.090 
this is clearly more of a control deck
than<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:19.070> white<00:03:19.519> weenie<00:03:19.730> aggro<00:03:20.239> deck<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:21.100> this

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
than a white weenie aggro deck and this

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.380 
than a white weenie aggro deck and this
card<00:03:22.340> can<00:03:22.519> really<00:03:22.700> fit<00:03:22.880> in<00:03:23.000> either<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.239> those

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
card can really fit in either of those

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.970 
card can really fit in either of those
decks<00:03:23.720> anyway<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:24.200> it's<00:03:24.470> probably<00:03:24.680> just

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
decks anyway so it's probably just

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.310 
decks anyway so it's probably just
better<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.670> either<00:03:25.820> case<00:03:26.150> this<00:03:26.780> early<00:03:27.110> in<00:03:27.200> a

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
better in either case this early in a

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.830 
better in either case this early in a
draft

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.970 

okay<00:03:33.620> well<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.930> know<00:03:36.019> prized<00:03:36.319> unicorn<00:03:36.349> is

okay well you know prized unicorn is
sweet<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:38.739> but<00:03:39.739> then<00:03:39.890> there's<00:03:40.069> a<00:03:40.129> sewer<00:03:40.400> Drake

good<00:04:00.920> is<00:04:00.950> this<00:04:01.220> in<00:04:01.400> EM<00:04:01.519> 11<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:04.930> think<00:04:05.930> this<00:04:06.019> was

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
good is this in EM 11 I think this was

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:16.020 
good is this in EM 11 I think this was
playable<00:04:06.860> in<00:04:07.390> m10<00:04:08.390> but<00:04:08.660> it<00:04:08.750> wasn't<00:04:09.049> great

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.569 

harbor<00:04:16.810> serpent<00:04:17.290> could<00:04:17.560> be<00:04:17.739> key<00:04:18.010> in<00:04:18.040> this<00:04:18.310> deck

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
harbor serpent could be key in this deck

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.070 
harbor serpent could be key in this deck
I<00:04:20.730> mean<00:04:21.730> I<00:04:21.820> just<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.389> get<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.690> feeling<00:04:23.050> that

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
I mean I just I get the feeling that

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.110 
I mean I just I get the feeling that
it's<00:04:23.350> better<00:04:23.560> than<00:04:23.800> ice<00:04:23.980> cage<00:04:24.340> but<00:04:24.580> Tara

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
it's better than ice cage but Tara

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.370 
it's better than ice cage but Tara
morphic<00:04:25.480> expand<00:04:25.810> slightly<00:04:26.020> better<00:04:26.260> than

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
morphic expand slightly better than

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.950 
morphic expand slightly better than
either<00:04:26.650> of<00:04:26.800> those<00:04:26.980> cards<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.750> have<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.780> feeling

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
either of those cards I have a feeling

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.510 
either of those cards I have a feeling
I'll<00:04:29.169> be<00:04:29.230> able<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.440> get<00:04:29.620> harbor<00:04:29.950> serpents<00:04:30.400> as

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
I'll be able to get harbor serpents as

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.720 
I'll be able to get harbor serpents as

like<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:41.400> should<00:04:42.400> probably<00:04:42.520> just<00:04:42.820> take<00:04:42.940> the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
like I should probably just take the

like I should probably just take the
palace<00:04:43.389> guard<00:04:43.660> it's<00:04:43.870> definitely<00:04:44.200> playable<00:04:44.560> in

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
palace guard it's definitely playable in

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.200 
palace guard it's definitely playable in
the<00:04:44.740> deck<00:04:44.919> on<00:04:45.070> building<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.610> hold<00:04:45.880> down<00:04:46.000> the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
the deck on building you hold down the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.560 
the deck on building you hold down the
ground<00:04:46.450> while<00:04:46.720> you<00:04:46.980> swing<00:04:47.980> over<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.730> air<00:04:49.030> for

ground while you swing over the air for

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.340 
ground while you swing over the air for
the<00:04:49.600> wind<00:04:50.250> like<00:04:51.250> if<00:04:51.400> i<00:04:51.730> consider<00:04:52.390> mind<00:04:52.960> rot<00:04:53.200> or

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
the wind like if i consider mind rot or

Nightwing<00:04:53.710> shade<00:04:54.040> but<00:04:55.410> you<00:04:56.410> know<00:04:56.530> this<00:04:57.280> keeps

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
Nightwing shade but you know this keeps

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.340 
Nightwing shade but you know this keeps
me<00:04:57.730> in<00:04:57.820> color<00:04:58.060> I'd<00:04:58.570> rather<00:04:58.750> have<00:04:58.960> a<00:04:58.990> two<00:04:59.200> color

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
me in color I'd rather have a two color

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.070 
me in color I'd rather have a two color
deck<00:04:59.650> for<00:04:59.860> sure<00:05:00.480> and<00:05:01.480> look<00:05:01.600> at<00:05:01.720> that<00:05:01.870> the

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
deck for sure and look at that the

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.350 
deck for sure and look at that the
armored<00:05:02.380> ascension<00:05:02.860> wheels<00:05:03.040> so<00:05:03.730> I<00:05:03.760> think<00:05:04.120> it's

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
armored ascension wheels so I think it's

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.030 
armored ascension wheels so I think it's
pretty<00:05:04.570> safe<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:04.900> say<00:05:05.080> that<00:05:05.230> white<00:05:05.530> is<00:05:05.560> open

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
pretty safe to say that white is open

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.390 
pretty safe to say that white is open
although<00:05:06.760> seinem<00:05:07.450> blood<00:05:07.860> came<00:05:08.860> around<00:05:09.070> two<00:05:09.370> so

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
although seinem blood came around two so

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.790 
although seinem blood came around two so
it's<00:05:09.850> safe<00:05:10.000> to<00:05:10.150> say<00:05:10.180> that<00:05:10.300> black<00:05:10.930> is<00:05:10.960> maybe

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
it's safe to say that black is maybe

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.820 
it's safe to say that black is maybe
open<00:05:14.370> as<00:05:15.370> well<00:05:15.720> I'll<00:05:16.720> continue<00:05:17.500> with<00:05:17.620> what

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
open as well I'll continue with what

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.270 
open as well I'll continue with what
we're<00:05:17.950> doing<00:05:18.160> here<00:05:18.400> I<00:05:19.919> could<00:05:20.919> see<00:05:21.100> myself

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
we're doing here I could see myself

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.190 
we're doing here I could see myself
playing<00:05:21.640> golden<00:05:22.090> go<00:05:22.210> unlock<00:05:22.450> it<00:05:22.750> also<00:05:23.020> sends

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
playing golden go unlock it also sends

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.810 
playing golden go unlock it also sends
the<00:05:23.380> best<00:05:23.560> signal<00:05:23.950> i<00:05:24.130> don't<00:05:24.310> think<00:05:24.490> i'm<00:05:24.610> really

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
the best signal i don't think i'm really

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.840 
the best signal i don't think i'm really
interested<00:05:25.270> that<00:05:25.720> much<00:05:25.960> any<00:05:26.229> of<00:05:26.350> these<00:05:26.410> cards

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:37.110 

okay<00:05:30.850> I<00:05:31.270> will<00:05:34.800> this<00:05:35.800> is<00:05:35.950> just<00:05:36.340> like<00:05:36.400> ice<00:05:36.610> cage<00:05:36.910> I

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
okay I will this is just like ice cage I

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.520 
okay I will this is just like ice cage I
mean<00:05:37.330> obviously<00:05:37.479> I'm<00:05:37.840> not<00:05:37.870> taking<00:05:38.260> this<00:05:38.350> look

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
mean obviously I'm not taking this look

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.350 
mean obviously I'm not taking this look
at<00:05:38.650> my<00:05:38.740> four<00:05:39.010> drops<00:05:39.280> lot<00:05:39.550> it's<00:05:40.000> pretty<00:05:40.270> much

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
at my four drops lot it's pretty much

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.870 
at my four drops lot it's pretty much
already<00:05:40.600> used<00:05:40.900> up<00:05:41.100> the<00:05:42.100> gate<00:05:42.310> will<00:05:42.460> probably

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
already used up the gate will probably

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.980 
already used up the gate will probably
make<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.180> main<00:05:43.360> deck<00:05:43.570> here<00:05:44.250> and<00:05:45.690> dress<00:05:46.690> is<00:05:46.960> a

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
make the main deck here and dress is a

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.460 
make the main deck here and dress is a
good<00:05:47.229> option<00:05:47.500> for<00:05:47.740> a<00:05:47.979> splash<00:05:48.400> I<00:05:49.350> guess<00:05:50.350> we'll

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
good option for a splash I guess we'll

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.940 
good option for a splash I guess we'll
leave<00:05:50.500> that<00:05:50.620> open<00:05:52.169> take<00:05:53.169> the<00:05:53.320> Holy<00:05:53.530> strength

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
leave that open take the Holy strength

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.460 
leave that open take the Holy strength
just<00:05:54.160> for<00:05:54.370> signals<00:05:55.800> and<00:05:56.800> there's<00:05:57.039> pack<00:05:57.250> one
