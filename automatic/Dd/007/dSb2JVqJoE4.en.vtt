Adam also sent me this story it was

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.240 
Adam also sent me this story it was
published<00:01:38.590> about<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.159> salt<00:01:39.610> air<00:01:39.790> spoof<00:01:40.270> and

published about the salt air spoof and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.560 
published about the salt air spoof and
at<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.370> moment<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:42.760> don't<00:01:42.790> know<00:01:43.090> just<00:01:43.330> where<00:01:43.510> it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
at the moment I don't know just where it

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.250 
at the moment I don't know just where it
was<00:01:43.690> published<00:01:43.900> but<00:01:44.350> it<00:01:44.470> was<00:01:44.590> written<00:01:44.770> by

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
was published but it was written by

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.700 
was published but it was written by
signed<00:01:47.260> by<00:01:47.440> Steve<00:01:47.740> Wozniak<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.350> must<00:01:50.560> have

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710
