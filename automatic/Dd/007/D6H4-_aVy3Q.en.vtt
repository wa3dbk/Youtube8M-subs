00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.519
 I quickly find many lids 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.589
 it mostly a forester in 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.790
 This is my first time here 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.790
 ranges from bonds 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:55.230
 warm and by the way I have it 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.970
 have stopped with purely school 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.680
 everyday my body was allowed to 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.989
 digestive work that makes a me 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.710
 a bit of sleep that we sleep for a lot 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.710
 energy 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.760
 had to 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.040
 is colder I like love 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.140
 and of it 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.050
 and then embarrassing 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.750
 but as well 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.040
 in addition to trust and both clubs on whole 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.430
 a lot of different varieties and 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.210
 quality differences could left 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.890
 milk or sometimes I will 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.640
 it has come together already 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.640
 finished then it tells fiercely 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.860
 the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.860
 waiting 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.459
 and have the first times the bullet 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.140
 had 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.140
 your coconut flakes almonds 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.600
 therein 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.330
 unfortunately we have a little more 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.840
 fiber and then to the sweet older 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.160
 raisins or 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.160
 it comes for example 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.939
 then come on 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.829
 Not about 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.989
 and then most importantly, that's 29 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.480
 minutes then have to stand or one 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.769
 half an hour of the ok and then get that 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.769
 such a consistency 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.710
 I like a lot of different things 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.660
 to have things on the table that the 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:46.340
 this crispbread can taste different 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:49.480
 and the well-developed piece of food 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.480
 really nice long out
