be<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.080> final<00:04:31.380> factor<00:04:31.710> for<00:04:31.889> me<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.159> to<00:04:32.639> know

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
be the final factor for me to to know

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.190 
be the final factor for me to to know
whether<00:04:33.180> or<00:04:33.270> not<00:04:33.389> going<00:04:33.599> to<00:04:33.659> be<00:04:33.719> revealing

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
whether or not going to be revealing

a<00:04:34.260> show<00:04:34.530> on<00:04:34.920> a<00:04:34.980> weekly<00:04:35.280> basis<00:04:35.790> so<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:37.590> don't<00:04:37.890> know

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
a show on a weekly basis so I don't know

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.290 
a show on a weekly basis so I don't know

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
so with that being said it's been the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.000 
so with that being said it's been the
brake<00:04:39.450> master<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.050> until<00:04:40.320> then<00:04:40.820> break<00:04:41.820> out
