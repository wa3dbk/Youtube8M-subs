00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.649
 you are with her 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.749
 with her today we have a game 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:21.970
 this term 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.460
 game made by guys from the west 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.779
 the studio 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.439
 likes to create himself 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.420
 enough non-standard measures 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.630
 An example of such games is 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.710
 block cottage cheese 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.910
 and under pressure 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.860
 these games fascinate with their simplicity but also 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.650
 unusual gimpu barking 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.300
 and naturally their 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.520
 enchanting sound 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.750
 johansson unbowed heart 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.800
 motive intro part completed 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.949
 now i am im 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.470
 and a pleasant female voice from the game 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.480
 then his yulia will tell you he is the world 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.480
 Sakharov 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.550
 now 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.550
 it makes sense 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.470
 and if all is not gold 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.210
 in the game we control the cameras as you can 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.979
 we can only turn on the camera side 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.729
 say that even man 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.110
 stopped thinking or hurry his 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.110
 and i keep 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.110
 in that 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.650
 the fall is equally not understood 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.650
 explanation 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 on the contrary, they willingly gave 1 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.830
 280 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 together 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.969
 csk 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.779
 there is 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:23.089
 but everything is really simple 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:24.969
 I have nothing to add 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.669
 really no obstacles no 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.669
 of problems 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:36.529
 white circle in this game this spring or 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.529
 trampoline 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.319
 similar statements 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.319
 Where we invite depends AvtoVAZ 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.489
 this sense 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.839
 trust go game modes 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:06.469
 today in tver 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.469
 the first one is malt 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.109
 the essence of which this policy has 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.339
 5 4 the judge called their projects 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.339
 but let it be tass 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:28.699
 couples this is the easiest mode 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.649
 I pass it quickly by chance 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:32.249
 just beauty to work 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.249
 bang but they already met 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.409
 This mode did not like him 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.769
 most 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.609
 so like this and disney mode 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.629
 where you need to think where you can 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:53.979
 use your own eyes 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.699
 and not just stupid against Tehran 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.199
 right here 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.989
 not easy to reach arrest 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.399
 need more care obkom 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.399
 so as not to run into black PR 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:09.439
 of course meeting with black 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.389
 with the text of them yet 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.229
 analysis dropping you alibaba 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.030
 start level either 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.030
 the nearest obama found 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.520
 but russia said it's time to let down 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.889
 measures by 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.889
 let's Georgian 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:38.159
 what did inspire you 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.559
 developers on such an unusual 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.699
 probably this event is so different 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.939
 impossible objects and optical illusions 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.119
 such as impossible teresopolis 

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:50.590
 endless staircase rishar 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.120
 waterfalls 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.960
 or the work of some collaborator 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.960
 for example dmitry cancer 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.789
 why did i not like th minute 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.199
 first glance they are all just wonderful 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.900
 this is a great idea 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.889
 and superb graphic solution 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.889
 Yes, I think that minimalism 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:15.729
 here are 35 Ukrainians 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.729
 you will now see the first level in this 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.089
 a game that I could not get through the first time 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.949
 it would seem that everything just connected 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:23.979
 two roads 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.639
 even the strip between them was gone 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.629
 pass 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.569
 maybe because that's how it can 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.189
 no run around anyway 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.180
 I do not understand try 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.249
 on the other side of the center 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:40.960
 these are either a choice or fall into a hole 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.469
 either go further 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:45.620
 no he runs in a circle 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.349
 and what a shame what and when the fish too 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.550
 especially can not cover we want 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.749
 there is this restriction in google 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:55.039
 there if you look at the camera 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.869
 that leaves only a sphere ball sphere 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:00.849
 thomas disposal is only 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.969
 floor of this ball 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.460
 and sometimes even less 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.190
 now it seems necessary to him all the same 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.249
 to go 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:12.330
 I mean, that jerk 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.139
 only rotate each time 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:15.389
 left 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.069
 if he falls into the hands 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:19.070
 then he will go around 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.819
 little fool 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.860
 even if there are of course others 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.889
 alternative paths 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:27.220
 I didn't like it either 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.089
 the soundtrack of this game 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:30.419
 such tons 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.270
 pained and sad for you 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.569
 and it's hard for me to say how much the composition 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:36.099
 of them 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.569
 this game seems to me that one 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.889
 but as we saw this hours fell 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.900
 I repeated this moment 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.680
 even in slow motion 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.419
 so here's a note 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:48.729
 passed 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:50.830
 turning the camera 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.830
 and it just went down 

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:56.309
 very sad 

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:58.930
 that the vatican burgundy in the game abound 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.930
 we look further 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:03.570
 connect 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.250
 it informed serdyukov that it was 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.360
 such a 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.449
 unclear 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.409
 can this manifestation of artificial 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:12.610
 intelligence 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.830
 I do not know 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.839
 also very often annoys me 

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.229
 level of difficulty 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:23.599
 in some level 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:26.599
 for example here is this classic example 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:32.789
 this mode we take gave my application 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:37.039
 nominated second we take 

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:41.899
 and win 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.990
 with such levels in this game 

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:50.520
 very monotonous 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.080
 I can play no more peace in one sitting 

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.300
 half an hour 

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.689
 hurt that 

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:56.910
 developers 

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.960
 they ran out of summer shine 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.180
 paper in such a simple iron is very 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.169
 annoy 

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:04.120
 but for the idea of ​​the developers 

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.249
 get from me 

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:07.050
 fat police 

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.710
 see you friends 

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.199
 arch
