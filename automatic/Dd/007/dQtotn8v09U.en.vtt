second when I purchased all the stuff I

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.670 
second when I purchased all the stuff I
thought<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.340> had<00:00:32.669> bought<00:00:32.880> three<00:00:33.680> control

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
thought I had bought three control

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.340 
thought I had bought three control
valves<00:00:35.220> I<00:00:35.660> bought<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> valves<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.080> couple

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
valves I bought the valves a couple

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.540 
valves I bought the valves a couple
years<00:00:37.530> ago<00:00:37.680> that's<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.130> was<00:00:38.310> thinking

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
years ago that's when I was thinking

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.510 
years ago that's when I was thinking
just<00:00:38.700> building<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.180> two<00:00:39.450> station<00:00:39.870> stand<00:00:40.520> with

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
just building a two station stand with

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.370 
just building a two station stand with
my<00:00:41.670> three<00:00:41.910> station<00:00:42.210> stand<00:00:42.450> I'm<00:00:42.720> missing<00:00:43.200> one

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
my three station stand I'm missing one

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.780 
my three station stand I'm missing one
and<00:00:43.560> I<00:00:43.590> forgot<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.100> didn't<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.400> one<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.760> I

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
and I forgot that I didn't have one so I

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.010 
and I forgot that I didn't have one so I
have<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> order<00:00:45.330> that<00:00:45.420> before<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.810> get<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
have to order that before I get the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.810 
have to order that before I get the
whole<00:00:46.140> thing<00:00:46.320> plumbed<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.740> but<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.640> have

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
whole thing plumbed up but I have

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.490 
whole thing plumbed up but I have
plumbed<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.450> together<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.900> I<00:00:48.990> fired<00:00:49.350> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
plumbed it all together and I fired it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.670 
plumbed it all together and I fired it
up<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.700> works<00:00:51.000> better<00:00:51.960> than<00:00:52.080> I<00:00:52.260> expected

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
up and it works better than I expected

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.370 
up and it works better than I expected
it<00:00:52.740> to<00:00:52.800> work<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.690> let's<00:00:54.690> zoom<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> little<00:00:55.260> bit

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
it to work so let's zoom in a little bit

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.690 
it to work so let's zoom in a little bit
of<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.770> these<00:00:55.830> burners<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.220> you<00:00:56.400> can<00:00:56.520> see

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
of one of these burners so you can see

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.260 
of one of these burners so you can see
all<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> pieces<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:57.600> how<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> put<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.560> together

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
all the pieces and how I put it together

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.460 
all the pieces and how I put it together
okay<00:01:00.270> let's<00:01:00.450> take<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.630> look<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.110> here's<00:01:01.320> the

okay let's take a look so here's the

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.020 
okay let's take a look so here's the
burner<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> center<00:01:02.520> burner<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
burner this is the center burner on the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.980 
burner this is the center burner on the
rig<00:01:03.229> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.290> an<00:01:04.530> older<00:01:04.799> burner<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.189> mine<00:01:05.400> from

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
rig this is an older burner of mine from

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
rig this is an older burner of mine from
previous<00:01:06.990> cooker<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.009> bought<00:01:08.249> two<00:01:08.640> new

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
black pipe is for the gas so you can see

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.080 
black pipe is for the gas so you can see
along<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> back<00:01:57.959> as<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.619> an<00:01:59.399> elbow<00:01:59.850> there

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
along the back as I have an elbow there

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.300 
along the back as I have an elbow there
I'll<00:02:00.270> do<00:02:00.929> I<00:02:00.959> put<00:02:01.319> a<00:02:01.350> cap<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.279> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
I'll do I put a cap on it just like a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.399 
I'll do I put a cap on it just like a
test<00:02:02.609> fire<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.779> I've<00:02:03.990> rigged<00:02:04.139> up<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
test fire but I've rigged up the

way back all right I want to show you

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.290 
way back all right I want to show you
what<00:02:30.750> one<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:30.900> these<00:02:31.550> propane<00:02:32.550> orifice<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.150> all

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
what one of these propane orifice is all

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.880 
what one of these propane orifice is all
about<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:34.170> probably<00:02:34.290> have<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.830> these

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
about you probably have one of these

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.940 
about you probably have one of these
already<00:02:35.160> if<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.270> turkey<00:02:36.630> fryer

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
already if you have a turkey fryer

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.200 
already if you have a turkey fryer
already<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.100> your<00:02:38.250> thing<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.640> have<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.060> have

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
already in your thing you have to have

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.950 
already in your thing you have to have
an<00:02:39.330> orifice

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
an orifice

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.080 
an orifice
let's<00:02:40.800> get<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.010> small<00:02:41.340> hole<00:02:41.520> in<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.760> center

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
let's get that small hole in the center

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.460 
let's get that small hole in the center
this<00:02:42.930> helps<00:02:43.290> act<00:02:43.560> like<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:43.800> jet<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.280> shoots<00:02:44.940> the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
this helps act like a jet and shoots the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.890 
this helps act like a jet and shoots the
gas<00:02:47.270> into<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.420> burner<00:02:50.690> depending<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.780> your

application would be propane or natural
gas<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.540> size<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:54.960> orifice<00:02:55.290> has<00:02:55.560> to

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
gas the size of this orifice has to

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.990 
gas the size of this orifice has to
change<00:02:55.950> but<00:02:56.190> one<00:02:56.400> way<00:02:56.550> or<00:02:56.640> another<00:02:56.670> if<00:02:56.970> you

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
change but one way or another if you

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.810 
change but one way or another if you
just<00:02:57.270> pipe<00:02:57.780> all<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.770> this<00:02:58.950> type<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.370> these<00:02:59.580> type

ffice there won't be enough flow to

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.670 
ffice there won't be enough flow to
appropriately<00:03:06.060> mix<00:03:06.390> with<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.470> air

coming through the venturi here to get a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.080 
coming through the venturi here to get a
good<00:03:10.260> burn<00:03:10.590> you'll<00:03:10.800> just<00:03:10.920> get<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.100> white<00:03:11.400> gentle

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
good burn you'll just get a white gentle

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.180 
good burn you'll just get a white gentle
flame<00:03:12.330> almost<00:03:12.690> like<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> candle<00:03:13.440> burning

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
flame almost like a candle burning

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.110 
flame almost like a candle burning
rather<00:03:14.610> than<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:15.030> jet<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.800> clean<00:03:16.800> blue<00:03:17.070> flame<00:03:17.370> so

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
rather than a jet of clean blue flame so

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.410 
rather than a jet of clean blue flame so
you<00:03:18.210> have<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.570> have<00:03:18.720> one<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:18.990> these<00:03:19.050> offices

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
you have to have one of these offices

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.910 
you have to have one of these offices
these<00:03:21.420> burners<00:03:21.720> actually<00:03:22.200> when<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.740> bought

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
had an orifice on this old burner so

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.790 
had an orifice on this old burner so
just<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.390> matter<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.750> figuring<00:03:28.050> out<00:03:28.290> how<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.530> get

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
from here to here so that's that's how

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.030 
from here to here so that's that's how
it<00:03:45.870> goes<00:03:46.020> right<00:03:46.260> now<00:03:47.210> the<00:03:48.210> basically<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.560> use

it goes right now the basically I use

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.710 
it goes right now the basically I use
this<00:03:50.220> water<00:03:50.460> supply<00:03:50.880> line<00:03:51.060> because<00:03:51.270> it<00:03:51.420> was

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
this water supply line because it was

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.370 
this water supply line because it was
flexible<00:03:52.020> and<00:03:53.510> worked<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.810> right<00:03:54.960> sizes

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
flexible and worked in the right sizes

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.500 
flexible and worked in the right sizes
that<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.530> want<00:03:55.740> this<00:03:55.860> is<00:03:56.040> half-inch<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:57.180> only

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
that I want this is half-inch the only

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.730 
that I want this is half-inch the only
thing<00:03:57.660> I'm<00:03:57.750> concerned<00:03:57.780> about<00:03:58.110> this<00:03:58.350> point<00:03:58.590> is

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
thing I'm concerned about this point is

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.890 
thing I'm concerned about this point is
that<00:03:58.950> it<00:03:59.490> is<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.730> vinyl<00:04:00.000> tube<00:04:00.360> in<00:04:00.510> there<00:04:00.660> I<00:04:00.690> don't

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
that it is a vinyl tube in there I don't

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.480 
that it is a vinyl tube in there I don't
know<00:04:00.990> if<00:04:01.110> it<00:04:01.200> generates<00:04:01.320> enough<00:04:01.800> heat<00:04:01.830> down

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
know if it generates enough heat down

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.190 
know if it generates enough heat down
underneath<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:02.910> burner<00:04:03.210> that<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:04.050> could

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
underneath the burner that this could

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.810 
underneath the burner that this could
become<00:04:04.320> a<00:04:04.560> liability<00:04:04.860> once<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.400> starts<00:04:05.640> getting

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
become a liability once I starts getting

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.750 
become a liability once I starts getting
hot<00:04:05.850> so<00:04:06.030> when<00:04:06.990> I<00:04:07.020> do<00:04:07.170> my<00:04:07.500> first<00:04:07.710> fired<00:04:08.280> up<00:04:08.460> test

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
hot so when I do my first fired up test

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.830 
hot so when I do my first fired up test
run<00:04:09.000> which<00:04:09.180> I'm<00:04:09.330> going<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.510> do<00:04:09.630> in<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.780> little

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
run which I'm going to do in a little

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.870 
run which I'm going to do in a little
bit<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.350> heat<00:04:10.710> some<00:04:10.860> water<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.340> clean<00:04:11.580> out<00:04:11.730> a

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
bit to heat some water to clean out a

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.530 
bit to heat some water to clean out a
potential<00:04:12.660> cake<00:04:12.870> for<00:04:13.080> HLT<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.970> will<00:04:14.970> get<00:04:15.510> a

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
potential cake for HLT I will get a

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.380 
potential cake for HLT I will get a
sense<00:04:15.930> for<00:04:16.109> how<00:04:16.260> hot<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.620> gets<00:04:16.739> under<00:04:17.010> there

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
sense for how hot it gets under there

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.000 
sense for how hot it gets under there
and<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.690> might<00:04:18.840> have<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:19.080> change<00:04:19.350> this<00:04:19.530> over<00:04:19.859> to

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
and I might have to change this over to

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.790 
and I might have to change this over to
a<00:04:20.040> hard<00:04:20.400> line<00:04:20.670> like<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> copper<00:04:21.480> line<00:04:22.260> with<00:04:22.770> a

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
a hard line like a copper line with a

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.700 
a hard line like a copper line with a
flared<00:04:23.310> nut<00:04:24.090> fitting<00:04:24.570> on<00:04:24.720> both<00:04:24.900> ends<00:04:25.260> here<00:04:25.440> so

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
flared nut fitting on both ends here so

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.250 
flared nut fitting on both ends here so
another<00:04:26.250> big<00:04:26.460> deal<00:04:26.730> but<00:04:27.480> I've<00:04:28.110> already

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
another big deal but I've already

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.450 
another big deal but I've already
invested<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.740> little<00:04:28.800> bit<00:04:28.980> of<00:04:29.070> money<00:04:29.190> in<00:04:29.340> these

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
invested a little bit of money in these

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.320 
invested a little bit of money in these
two

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
two

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.249 
two
two<00:04:30.949> flexible<00:04:31.949> hoses<00:04:32.750> but<00:04:33.750> we<00:04:33.990> need<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.169> be

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
two flexible hoses but we need to be

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.200 
two flexible hoses but we need to be
safe<00:04:34.500> with<00:04:34.949> the<00:04:35.039> propane<00:04:35.400> especially<00:04:35.879> see<00:04:36.090> how

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
safe with the propane especially see how

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.119 
safe with the propane especially see how
I<00:04:36.240> use<00:04:36.330> this<00:04:36.599> sometimes<00:04:36.810> right<00:04:37.710> inside<00:04:37.949> my

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
I use this sometimes right inside my

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.350 
I use this sometimes right inside my
garage<00:04:38.370> door<00:04:38.699> I<00:04:38.729> don't<00:04:38.879> need<00:04:39.060> one<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.240> these

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
garage door I don't need one of these

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.570 
garage door I don't need one of these
things<00:04:39.569> melting<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.169> then<00:04:40.319> having<00:04:40.580> propane

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
things melting and then having propane

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.110 
things melting and then having propane
and<00:04:41.759> gas<00:04:41.909> flying<00:04:42.300> all<00:04:42.479> over<00:04:42.569> the<00:04:42.719> place<00:04:42.780> so<00:04:44.120> so

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
and gas flying all over the place so so

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.260 
and gas flying all over the place so so
that's<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.360> basic<00:04:45.659> stand<00:04:45.870> at<00:04:45.990> this<00:04:46.139> point

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
that's the basic stand at this point

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.580 
that's the basic stand at this point
I'll<00:04:48.270> fire<00:04:48.509> up<00:04:48.539> a<00:04:48.750> burner<00:04:48.990> in<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.169> second<00:04:49.500> and

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
I'll fire up a burner in a second and

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.469 
I'll fire up a burner in a second and
we'll<00:04:49.889> take<00:04:50.159> a<00:04:50.189> look<00:04:52.400> okay<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:53.430> could<00:04:54.419> my

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
we'll take a look okay so could my

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.390 
we'll take a look okay so could my
propane<00:04:54.900> on<00:04:55.020> I'm<00:04:55.229> opening<00:04:55.530> up<00:04:55.740> this<00:04:56.039> used<00:04:56.310> to

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
propane on I'm opening up this used to

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.890 
propane on I'm opening up this used to
be<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.669> control<00:04:56.969> valve<00:04:57.210> for<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.509> burner<00:04:57.750> that

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
be the control valve for the burner that

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.080 
be the control valve for the burner that
I<00:04:58.050> had<00:04:58.379> this<00:04:58.530> one<00:04:58.710> hose<00:04:58.889> on<00:04:59.069> and<00:04:59.639> I<00:04:59.759> opened<00:05:00.030> this

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
I had this one hose on and I opened this

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.820 
I had this one hose on and I opened this
up<00:05:00.270> all<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.509> way<00:05:00.629> this<00:05:00.780> is<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.990> 30<00:05:01.379> psi

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
up all the way this is a 30 psi

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.830 
up all the way this is a 30 psi
regulator<00:05:02.129> so<00:05:03.030> far<00:05:03.270> I<00:05:03.300> think<00:05:03.360> it's<00:05:03.659> going<00:05:03.810> to

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
regulator so far I think it's going to

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.510 
regulator so far I think it's going to
be<00:05:03.990> enough<00:05:04.229> pressure<00:05:04.500> to<00:05:04.740> power<00:05:05.129> all<00:05:05.340> three

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
be enough pressure to power all three

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.999 
be enough pressure to power all three
burners<00:05:05.789> at<00:05:05.909> once<00:05:06.289> but<00:05:07.289> I'll<00:05:07.560> show<00:05:07.800> you<00:05:07.889> what

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
burners at once but I'll show you what

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:16.159 
burners at once but I'll show you what
it<00:05:08.099> looks<00:05:08.219> like

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.199 

so<00:05:17.169> I<00:05:17.199> can<00:05:17.379> play<00:05:17.559> with<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.860> air<00:05:18.129> intake<00:05:18.789> here

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:19.209 
so I can play with the air intake here

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:22.100 
so I can play with the air intake here
you<00:05:20.139> get<00:05:20.259> a<00:05:20.319> nice<00:05:20.529> pretty<00:05:21.069> blue<00:05:21.159> flame<00:05:21.610> that's

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
you get a nice pretty blue flame that's

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.890 
you get a nice pretty blue flame that's
what<00:05:23.110> I'm<00:05:23.229> used<00:05:23.409> to<00:05:23.499> and<00:05:23.740> I<00:05:23.949> can

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
what I'm used to and I can

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.290 
what I'm used to and I can
really<00:05:26.470> dial<00:05:26.710> dial<00:05:27.070> up<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.400> power<00:05:27.610> it's<00:05:28.150> hard

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
really dial dial up the power it's hard

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.490 
really dial dial up the power it's hard
to<00:05:28.389> see<00:05:28.540> out<00:05:28.630> here<00:05:28.780> in<00:05:28.870> the<00:05:28.930> sunlight<00:05:29.290> but

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
to see out here in the sunlight but

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.159 
to see out here in the sunlight but
looks<00:05:30.250> pretty<00:05:30.460> good<00:05:30.639> and<00:05:31.450> if<00:05:31.630> I<00:05:31.750> start<00:05:32.050> the

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
looks pretty good and if I start the

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.640 
looks pretty good and if I start the
second<00:05:32.560> one

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.689 

with<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:38.740> second<00:05:38.979> one<00:05:39.099> burning<00:05:39.280> I<00:05:39.430> don't<00:05:39.580> get

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
with the second one burning I don't get

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.809 
with the second one burning I don't get
any<00:05:39.849> loss<00:05:40.060> of<00:05:40.300> power<00:05:40.479> on<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:40.990> first<00:05:41.710> one<00:05:41.919> so<00:05:42.789> I

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
any loss of power on the first one so I

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.879 
any loss of power on the first one so I
think<00:05:42.939> that<00:05:43.210> 30<00:05:43.840> psi<00:05:44.229> regulate<00:05:44.650> is<00:05:44.710> going<00:05:44.830> to

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
think that 30 psi regulate is going to

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.529 
think that 30 psi regulate is going to
work<00:05:45.009> just<00:05:45.189> fine<00:05:45.310> we'll<00:05:46.030> see<00:05:46.180> what<00:05:46.270> happens

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
work just fine we'll see what happens

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.839 
work just fine we'll see what happens
when<00:05:46.659> I<00:05:46.719> fire<00:05:46.990> up<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.229> third<00:05:47.439> one<00:05:47.729> when<00:05:48.729> I<00:05:48.759> get

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
when I fire up the third one when I get

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.119 
when I fire up the third one when I get
that<00:05:49.060> all<00:05:49.180> plumbed<00:05:49.419> in<00:05:50.460> but<00:05:51.460> this<00:05:51.580> is<00:05:51.639> burning

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:35.469 
a hard pipe application it'll be there

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:37.950 
a hard pipe application it'll be there
