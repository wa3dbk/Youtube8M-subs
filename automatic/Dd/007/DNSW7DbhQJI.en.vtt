00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 Well, people asked me to do 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.809
 serious conversation and so let's 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.320
 let's start guys you thought 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.890
 sometime about such things as 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:20.100
 manipulation of people and realism today 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:26.660
 i will try to tell you about it so 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:30.810
 let 's start manipulating people this is very 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.079
 fine science yes yes stress science 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.399
 it is science because having mastered it you 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.399
 learn the minimum averages or even 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:47.030
 fully able to build your life and 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:54.440
 on manipulating people a simple example 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:58.800
 sometimes people talk about something well 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:05.720
 someone is talking about some 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:09.180
 things but the other person does not finish 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.830
 he instead begging 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.619
 tell this thing he may just well 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.799
 do not believe the type of allegedly not believe that 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.659
 he believes in it is given he even if not already 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:27.840
 realized about says that he does not believe 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.650
 Shope that pizdobol so on although he 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.720
 he believes but already starts automatically 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.210
 talk to tell him yes it is 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.299
 minimum level of manipulation 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.360
 which works and it works already 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.340
 most people's minds that 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.570
 the way use this method works 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.250
 already at automatic level 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:58.950
 Further, for example, did you notice that your 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.200
 parents for example yes they give you money 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.899
 yes how would 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.149
 money is give money there let's say you 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.720
 need to go to school for guitar there 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.599
 somewhere in the music there will cost 5 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.340
 10,000 to 20,000 thousand will give you no problems 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.709
 and ask you somewhere there for something 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.800
 a jar of Coca-Cola then rubles 100 to you 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.080
 I will say no money, we will not give you 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.110
 noticed this so in my opinion 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:32.000
 learn to manipulate parents so 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.450
 so that they give money as if 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.319

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:43.040
