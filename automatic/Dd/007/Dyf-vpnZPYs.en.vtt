00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:07.500
 yes hello and welcome 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.210
 the sv lippstadt today guest in 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.230
 wattenscheid on the third day of the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.230
 Oberliga Westphalia 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.920
 the sv lippstadt was able to save one 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.290
 The exception of the series dog must be ill for 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.210
 He played with the number 18 lars 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.830
 schröder from the beginning with the 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.189
 identical layout of the last 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.080
 play at the start 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.800
 750 spectators first brought one 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.800
 very good mood 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.070
 referee of the meeting daniel j 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.340
 wattenscheid 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.340
 in white 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.940
 and also had offense 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.260
 the numerous terraces fans from 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.450
 gstadt hoped for a success as well 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.360
 in Wattenscheid 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.520
 but the wattenscheider had something 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.760
 better start and started immediately like 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.760
 the fire department 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.549
 alexander had come to this corner 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.840
 the big chance the same 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.430
 Wattenscheider bring into leadership 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.580
 but his header bounced against the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.580
 crossbar 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.680
 the rebound kevin brümmer comes 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.789
 subject and close by 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.270
 Christopher Sander in the gate ran later 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.899
 could not at the beginning of the game 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.300
 to complain about lack of employment 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:47.149
 liberated at the end of the second half 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.159
 the sv lippstadt and like here 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.610
 lars schröder she intersperses wonderfully 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.880
 but just barely failed took over the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.500
 black and red more and more the director 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.500
 then it was already half time 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.240
 kick off the second half and the sv 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.590
 stormed los lars schröder 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.350
 a beautiful shot to the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.550
 lower edge of the latte wembley-tor yes all 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.480
 have seen him in it only the 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.450
 referee not 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.030
 But it went on almost every minute 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.990
 there was a dream weather there and gate 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.770
 yes that's the old björn he lurking 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:32.740
 fuchs yes past the goalkeeper in the long corner 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:35.140
 no chance that's the 1 0 for the sv 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.360
 lippstadt not undeserved to this 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.680
 time wattenscheid had in the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.050
 second half time still not right 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.320
 took place and the fans of sv 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.750
 Of course, Lippstadt was from the 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.240
 lodge 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.770
 wattenscheid was not stuck after the 1 0 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.900
 and tried again and again 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.450
 lippstädter defense in embarrassment too 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.540
 bring 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:04.440
 But all actions ended at the end 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.440
 little luck going on or just unsuccessful 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.599
 the sv lippstadt people now of course 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.610
 to counter the inevitably came 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.730
 here by lars schröder who beautiful 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.900
 on the left side, yes 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.340
 flank something still unfocused 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.650
 benni park otherwise set 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.640
 defender got warm 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.560
 he should in midfield the construction of the 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.739
 lippstädter something more powerful 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.290
 shape 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:43.110
 In this phase of the game was Lippstadt 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.959
 but very dominant wattenscheid came 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:52.380
 not getting out of the way at the back 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:54.959
 again the sv express rolled in here 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.280
 beautiful pass on break ever 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.269
 Goalkeeper what does the goalkeeper do 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.269
 friend sector 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.970
 my goodness would have been on the post 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.680
 latte posts and pia strauber lars 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.030
 Schröder not in the offside 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.400
 wonderful 20 yes it can go on 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.450
 yes, the slow motion sees it again completely 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.820
 just the post latte inside post and 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.729
 in front of the feet of blaas röder 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.539
 he can not run away but that 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.539
 you have to be able to 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:35.190
 joy in the square as well as joy 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:37.979
 Wattenscheid was always on the ranks 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.250
 dangerous at standards here too 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:44.699
 again the really good goalkeeper 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:48.270
 lippstadt christopher sander had the 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:50.160
 All the same, a basic nervousness 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.290
 By and large, he does his 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.900
 very neat in contrast 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.990
 compared to actually after the 2 0 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.600
 not quite many get set here 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.900
 wonderful by a lupfer 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:11.570
 it should be but frontzeck smelled the 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:15.600
 roast the sg wattenscheid tried it 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:18.990
 again and again they failed 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.320
 actually often to yourself 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.320
 then the captain fischer left riepe 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.660
 The place for him was dominik Lausch 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.030
 then out of nowhere a flank of 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.580
 cuba he was and sander christoph was im 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.400
 gate of the lippstädter wonderful kept 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.210
 that's great that then the 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.610
 lippstädter fans so wattenscheid 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.889
 tried and tried the sv lurking 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.630
 again it was the strong schroder of the im 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.990
 midfield won his fight 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.060
 Meyer sent 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.130
 the fits on it weather traufetter 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.669
 back to meier and that's it 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.260
 the 2 3 1 1 over it 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.979
 then lars was allowed to go for one 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:05.370
 very good part out for him came sven 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.810
 dyballa pass from mountain on it 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.150
 and what makes the woman stuck 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.750
 my goodness you have to feel sorry 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.510
 this is not his day beer 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.150
 Traufetter had no trouble this 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.150
 Light ball in the gate in too 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.400
 bring that is the 13 0 for the sv 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.810
 lippstadt which is also or is 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.810
 also at the same time the endstand was 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:40.860
 daniel farke sports director and team manager 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:44.219
 at sv lippstadt could be satisfied 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:47.270
 13 0 in wattenscheid to win the 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:47.270
 does not happen every day 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:56.879
 the away victory of the lippstädter was on 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:07:00.779
 end may be a little too high though 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:05.009
 Not to serve the team thanked 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:08.240
 still against the fans on friday against 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:08.240
 have a look there again
