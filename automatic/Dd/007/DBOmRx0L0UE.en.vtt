00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
sequential color combination lock now it

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.360 
sequential color combination lock now it
used<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.809> be<00:00:12.929> back<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.740> day<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.160> would

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
used to be back in the day that I would

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.400 
used to be back in the day that I would
upload<00:00:14.580> tons<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.360> these<00:00:15.480> kind<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.839> combination

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
upload tons of these kind of combination

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.990 
upload tons of these kind of combination
locks<00:00:16.590> because<00:00:17.010> they<00:00:17.250> were<00:00:17.310> fairly<00:00:17.640> quick

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
locks because they were fairly quick

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000 
locks because they were fairly quick
they<00:00:18.420> were<00:00:18.480> easy<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.930> they<00:00:19.199> were<00:00:19.260> also<00:00:19.740> very

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
they were easy and they were also very

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.550 
they were easy and they were also very
effective<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.600> got<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> point<00:00:22.260> wired

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
effective but it got to the point wired

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.679 
effective but it got to the point wired
uploaded<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.400> many<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.939> ran<00:00:24.240> out<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.420> ideas

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
uploaded so many that I ran out of ideas

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.170 
uploaded so many that I ran out of ideas
I<00:00:24.960> literally<00:00:25.500> ran<00:00:25.859> dry<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> could<00:00:26.730> not<00:00:26.910> upload

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
I literally ran dry I could not upload

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.839 
I literally ran dry I could not upload
another<00:00:27.539> combination<00:00:28.439> lock<00:00:28.920> video<00:00:29.189> but

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
another combination lock video but

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.420 
another combination lock video but
minecraft<00:00:30.510> 1.5<00:00:31.080> has<00:00:31.289> been<00:00:31.439> released<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.920> with

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
minecraft 1.5 has been released and with

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.850 
minecraft 1.5 has been released and with
it<00:00:32.610> came<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.969> bunch<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.809> awesome<00:00:34.260> new<00:00:34.290> features

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
it came a bunch of awesome new features

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.620 
it came a bunch of awesome new features
that<00:00:35.010> make<00:00:35.460> these<00:00:35.700> kind<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.090> combination

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that make these kind of combination

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.139 
that make these kind of combination
locks<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.989> lot<00:00:37.469> more<00:00:37.680> easy<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.370> without<00:00:38.940> further

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
locks a lot more easy so without further

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.709 
locks a lot more easy so without further
ado<00:00:39.570> let's<00:00:39.899> take<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> look<00:00:40.489> now<00:00:41.489> I'm<00:00:41.640> sure<00:00:41.879> 90%

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
ado let's take a look now I'm sure 90%

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.540 
ado let's take a look now I'm sure 90%
of<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.989> understand<00:00:43.530> how<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.860> works<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.399> for

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
of you understand how this works but for

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.979 
of you understand how this works but for
those<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.969> who<00:00:45.090> don't<00:00:45.239> I'm<00:00:45.539> going<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
those of you who don't I'm going to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.959 
those of you who don't I'm going to
explain<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> little<00:00:46.620> bit<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.399> idea<00:00:47.789> is

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
explain it a little bit so the idea is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.000 
explain it a little bit so the idea is
very<00:00:48.149> simple<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.809> set<00:00:49.320> yourself<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.800> color

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
very simple you set yourself a color

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
very simple you set yourself a color
combination<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.180> anyone<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.719> tries

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
combination and then anyone that tries

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.779 
combination and then anyone that tries
to<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.320> into<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:52.680> base<00:00:52.829> will<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> get

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
to get into your base will have to get

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.250 
to get into your base will have to get
it<00:00:53.820> correct<00:00:54.210> now<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.690> setup<00:00:54.960> here

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
it correct now with this setup here

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.740 
it correct now with this setup here
we've<00:00:55.710> got<00:00:55.920> 10,000<00:00:56.760> possible<00:00:57.149> combinations

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
we've got 10,000 possible combinations

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.099 
we've got 10,000 possible combinations
because<00:00:58.140> 10<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.890> power<00:00:59.039> 1<00:00:59.190> 10<00:01:00.090> squared<00:01:00.570> 10

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
because 10 to the power 1 10 squared 10

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.500 
because 10 to the power 1 10 squared 10
cubed<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:02.039> 10<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> 4<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.180> added

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
cubed and then 10 to the 4 if we added

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.270 
cubed and then 10 to the 4 if we added
in<00:01:03.629> another<00:01:03.809> module<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.920> you'd<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
in another module then you'd have a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.100 
in another module then you'd have a
hundred<00:01:05.610> thousand<00:01:06.150> possible<00:01:06.510> combinations

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
hundred thousand possible combinations

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
hundred thousand possible combinations
added<00:01:07.740> another<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.220> after<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:09.030> would

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
added another one after that that would

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.060 
added another one after that that would
be<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> million<00:01:09.810> possible<00:01:10.229> combinations<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
be a million possible combinations and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.670 
be a million possible combinations and
from<00:01:11.850> there<00:01:12.150> things<00:01:12.479> get<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.930> little<00:01:13.290> bit<00:01:13.409> crazy

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
from there things get a little bit crazy

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.800 
from there things get a little bit crazy
now<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.270> when<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.479> hit<00:01:15.689> this

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
now as you can see when we hit this

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.179 
now as you can see when we hit this
button<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.409> color<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> screen

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
button here the color on the screen

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.520 
button here the color on the screen
changes<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.030> all<00:01:18.390> fairly<00:01:18.689> quick<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
changes it's all fairly quick and it

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.010 
changes it's all fairly quick and it
works<00:01:19.740> very<00:01:19.890> nicely

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
works very nicely

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.480 
works very nicely
ok<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.080> let's<00:01:22.409> give<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.710> shot<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:23.070> cracking

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
ok so let's give it a shot of cracking

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
ok so let's give it a shot of cracking
the<00:01:23.610> combination<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.720> course<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.229> know

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the combination now of course I know

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.890 
the combination now of course I know
what<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.220> red<00:01:26.640> across<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.420> board<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
what it is it is red across the board so

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.200 
what it is it is red across the board so
every<00:01:28.259> single<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.009> our<00:01:29.400> combinations<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
every single one of our combinations is

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.319 
every single one of our combinations is
red<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.079> there<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> first<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.490> then

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
red so there is the first one and then

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.660 
red so there is the first one and then
hopefully<00:01:33.990> once<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:34.890> hit<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.159> button<00:01:35.220> it

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
hopefully once we hit this button it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.760 
hopefully once we hit this button it
will<00:01:35.939> all<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.360> correct<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.439> will<00:01:37.590> get

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
will all be correct and we will get

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.149 
will all be correct and we will get
ourselves<00:01:37.890> our<00:01:39.170> 13:37<00:01:40.170> levels<00:01:40.530> that's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
ourselves our 13:37 levels that's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.899 
ourselves our 13:37 levels that's
perfect<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.229> I<00:01:43.229> think<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:44.009> waffled<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.579> for

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.760 
perfect so I think of waffled on for
long<00:01:45.090> enough<00:01:45.329> about<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.869> one<00:01:46.079> how<00:01:46.350> about<00:01:46.619> we

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
long enough about this one how about we

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.649 
long enough about this one how about we
take<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> look<00:01:47.159> at<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.369> Redstone<00:01:47.790> behind<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.240> so

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
take a look at the Redstone behind it so

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.389 
take a look at the Redstone behind it so
I'm<00:01:48.750> going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.899> jam<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.350> my<00:01:49.470> cameras<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.189> mod

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
I'm going to jam on my cameras to do mod

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.660 
I'm going to jam on my cameras to do mod
and<00:01:50.640> let's<00:01:51.060> take<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> look<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.890> hopefully<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and let's take a look so hopefully the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.130 
and let's take a look so hopefully the
first<00:01:53.939> thing<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.390> notice<00:01:54.659> about<00:01:54.750> this

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
first thing that you notice about this

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.530 
first thing that you notice about this
build<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:56.130> incredibly<00:01:56.540> compact

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
build is that it's incredibly compact

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.170 
build is that it's incredibly compact
each<00:01:57.780> module<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.530> only<00:01:59.009> three<00:01:59.520> blocks<00:01:59.850> wide

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
each module is only three blocks wide

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.389 
each module is only three blocks wide
and<00:02:00.479> only<00:02:00.869> four<00:02:01.320> blocks<00:02:01.500> deep<00:02:01.920> which<00:02:02.219> is

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and only four blocks deep which is

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.370 
and only four blocks deep which is
pretty<00:02:02.670> incredible<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.390> may<00:02:03.780> also<00:02:04.020> notice

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
pretty incredible you may also notice

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.050 
pretty incredible you may also notice
there<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> hundred<00:02:05.159> percent<00:02:05.310> Tyler<00:02:05.820> ball

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
there is a hundred percent Tyler ball

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.429 
there is a hundred percent Tyler ball
meaning<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.600> can<00:02:06.750> put<00:02:06.930> two<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.200> them

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
meaning that you can put two of them

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.139 
meaning that you can put two of them
next<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.829> each<00:02:07.890> other<00:02:08.069> without<00:02:08.640> any<00:02:08.789> other

redstone canoodling now if you're

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.920 
redstone canoodling now if you're
wondering<00:02:11.160> what<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
wondering what the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.809 
wondering what the
P<00:02:12.049> said<00:02:12.349> the<00:02:12.439> back<00:02:12.650> is<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.640> the

P said the back is that is the

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.940 
P said the back is that is the
combination<00:02:14.090> lock<00:02:14.689> check<00:02:14.989> align<00:02:15.349> that<00:02:15.799> is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
combination lock check align that is

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.160 
combination lock check align that is
what<00:02:16.159> tells<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:16.670> if<00:02:16.819> you've<00:02:17.329> actually<00:02:17.629> got<00:02:18.049> the

what tells it if you've actually got the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.470 
what tells it if you've actually got the
correct<00:02:18.409> combination<00:02:19.069> or<00:02:19.280> not<00:02:19.519> so<00:02:20.120> without

further<00:02:20.810> ado<00:02:21.260> let's<00:02:21.709> crack<00:02:21.950> straight<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.400> with

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
further ado let's crack straight on with

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.330 
further ado let's crack straight on with
this<00:02:22.760> tutorial<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.709> want<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.980> get<00:02:25.099> things

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
this tutorial so you want to get things

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.089 
this tutorial so you want to get things
started<00:02:25.609> with<00:02:25.909> a<00:02:25.969> three<00:02:26.450> by<00:02:26.659> four<00:02:26.719> area<00:02:27.560> now

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
started with a three by four area now

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.559 
started with a three by four area now
your<00:02:28.340> combination<00:02:28.909> look<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.209> going<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.480> be

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
your combination look is going to be

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.449 
your combination look is going to be
looking<00:02:29.900> in<00:02:30.139> this<00:02:30.409> direction<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.129> you<00:02:31.340> just

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
looking in this direction so you just

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.429 
looking in this direction so you just
want<00:02:31.639> to<00:02:31.700> place<00:02:31.849> regular<00:02:32.540> pistons<00:02:32.959> like<00:02:33.170> this

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
want to place regular pistons like this

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.220 
want to place regular pistons like this
and<00:02:33.709> then<00:02:34.340> regular<00:02:34.609> pistons<00:02:35.180> facing<00:02:35.420> in<00:02:35.930> this

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
and then regular pistons facing in this

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.740 
and then regular pistons facing in this
direction<00:02:36.290> here<00:02:37.099> now<00:02:37.939> this<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:38.359> the<00:02:38.450> tricky

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
direction here now this is the tricky

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.449 
direction here now this is the tricky
part<00:02:38.780> finding<00:02:39.230> out<00:02:39.469> where<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.769> top<00:02:39.980> ones<00:02:40.189> go

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
part finding out where the top ones go

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.670 
part finding out where the top ones go
so<00:02:40.939> you<00:02:41.030> want<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.269> go<00:02:41.420> block<00:02:41.930> up<00:02:42.049> like<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.439> and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
so you want to go block up like this and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.949 
so you want to go block up like this and
take<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.129> one<00:02:43.310> out<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.639> then<00:02:43.849> go<00:02:44.030> one<00:02:44.510> two

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
take that one out and then go one two

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.949 
take that one out and then go one two
three<00:02:45.739> four<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.700> your<00:02:47.120> piston<00:02:47.569> is<00:02:47.750> going<00:02:47.900> to

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
three four and your piston is going to

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.259 
three four and your piston is going to
be<00:02:48.049> facing<00:02:48.319> in<00:02:48.739> this<00:02:49.010> direction<00:02:49.090> here<00:02:50.090> and

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
be facing in this direction here and

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.809 
be facing in this direction here and
then<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:51.079> this<00:02:51.290> side<00:02:51.349> you<00:02:51.950> just<00:02:52.370> want<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:52.579> put

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
then on this side you just want to put

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.740 
then on this side you just want to put
it<00:02:52.939> over<00:02:53.200> like<00:02:54.250> this<00:02:55.250> facing<00:02:55.849> downwards<00:02:56.329> then

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
it over like this facing downwards then

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.149 
it over like this facing downwards then
you<00:02:56.840> can<00:02:56.989> fill<00:02:57.169> in<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.349> rest<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:57.680> your<00:02:57.769> piston

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
you can fill in the rest of your piston

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.679 
you can fill in the rest of your piston
tape<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:58.609> you<00:02:58.639> just<00:02:58.849> want<00:02:58.969> to<00:02:59.000> place<00:02:59.209> your

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
tape so you just want to place your

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.990 
tape so you just want to place your
glass<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.260> there<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.739> then<00:03:01.370> just<00:03:01.700> all<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:01.969> way

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
glass in there and then just all the way

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.970 
glass in there and then just all the way
around<00:03:02.419> like<00:03:02.840> this<00:03:03.700> there<00:03:04.700> we<00:03:04.819> have<00:03:04.969> it<00:03:05.120> now

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
around like this there we have it now

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.649 
around like this there we have it now
this<00:03:06.980> glass<00:03:07.280> line<00:03:07.639> here<00:03:07.909> is<00:03:08.120> actually<00:03:08.540> going

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
this glass line here is actually going

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.690 
this glass line here is actually going
to<00:03:08.750> be<00:03:08.840> your<00:03:09.049> combination<00:03:09.650> checker<00:03:09.919> line<00:03:10.189> so

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
to be your combination checker line so

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.520 
to be your combination checker line so
if<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.909> want<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.150> put<00:03:11.389> one<00:03:11.419> solid<00:03:12.169> block<00:03:12.349> in

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
if you want to put one solid block in

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.349 
if you want to put one solid block in
there<00:03:12.709> straight<00:03:13.069> away<00:03:13.219> so<00:03:13.879> you<00:03:14.000> know<00:03:14.180> which

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
there straight away so you know which

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.119 
there straight away so you know which
one<00:03:14.540> is<00:03:14.659> going<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.840> be<00:03:14.989> then<00:03:15.409> that's<00:03:15.560> fine<00:03:15.889> then

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
one is going to be then that's fine then

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.920 
one is going to be then that's fine then
all<00:03:16.190> you<00:03:16.370> have<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.669> do<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.970> copy<00:03:17.479> the<00:03:17.720> same

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
all you have to do is copy the same

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.780 
all you have to do is copy the same
thing<00:03:18.169> on<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.409> other<00:03:18.440> side<00:03:18.680> using<00:03:19.459> your

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
thing on the other side using your

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.069 
thing on the other side using your
different<00:03:20.120> colored<00:03:20.389> wool<00:03:20.569> blocks<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.019> I'm

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
different colored wool blocks and I'm

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.240 
different colored wool blocks and I'm
not<00:03:21.260> going<00:03:21.379> to<00:03:21.440> be<00:03:21.530> doing<00:03:21.650> all<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.919> different

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
not going to be doing all the different

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.699 
not going to be doing all the different
colors<00:03:22.519> in<00:03:22.639> this<00:03:23.060> cut<00:03:23.389> because<00:03:23.629> let's<00:03:24.440> face<00:03:24.530> it

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
colors in this cut because let's face it

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.439 
colors in this cut because let's face it
there's<00:03:25.010> not<00:03:25.190> enough<00:03:25.400> space<00:03:25.519> in<00:03:25.849> my<00:03:25.970> hotbar

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
there's not enough space in my hotbar

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.509 
there's not enough space in my hotbar
but<00:03:26.989> there<00:03:27.349> you<00:03:27.470> have<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.769> you<00:03:27.889> just<00:03:28.069> place<00:03:28.250> all

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
but there you have it you just place all

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.309 
but there you have it you just place all
the<00:03:28.639> different<00:03:28.939> colors<00:03:29.209> in<00:03:29.329> that<00:03:29.419> line<00:03:30.019> and

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
the different colors in that line and

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.199 
the different colors in that line and
also<00:03:30.560> place<00:03:31.099> down<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.459> remaining<00:03:31.639> Pistons

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
also place down the remaining Pistons

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.819 
also place down the remaining Pistons
that<00:03:32.299> I've<00:03:32.479> forgotten<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:32.900> do<00:03:33.079> so<00:03:33.560> that's<00:03:33.680> just

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
that I've forgotten to do so that's just

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.140 
that I've forgotten to do so that's just
a<00:03:33.979> regular<00:03:34.310> piston<00:03:34.459> facing<00:03:34.760> in<00:03:35.060> this

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
a regular piston facing in this

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.479 
a regular piston facing in this
direction<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.930> then<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.590> one<00:03:36.979> facing

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
direction and then the one facing

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.259 
direction and then the one facing
downwards<00:03:38.000> as<00:03:38.180> well<00:03:39.019> there<00:03:39.560> we<00:03:39.650> go

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
downwards as well there we go

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.699 
downwards as well there we go
now<00:03:41.269> I'd<00:03:41.449> suggest<00:03:41.900> doing<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.290> exterior

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
now I'd suggest doing the exterior

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.559 
now I'd suggest doing the exterior
obviously<00:03:43.489> you<00:03:43.609> can<00:03:43.759> do<00:03:43.909> whatever<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.389> want

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
obviously you can do whatever you want

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:45.999 
obviously you can do whatever you want
with<00:03:44.750> that<00:03:44.780> one<00:03:45.109> it's<00:03:45.290> not<00:03:45.470> going<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.650> affect

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:46.009 
with that one it's not going to affect

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.039 
with that one it's not going to affect
me<00:03:46.220> in<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.579> slightest<00:03:47.090> all<00:03:47.509> you<00:03:47.659> have<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:47.930> do

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
me in the slightest all you have to do

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.140 
me in the slightest all you have to do
is<00:03:48.259> place<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.709> button<00:03:49.159> slap-bang<00:03:49.669> in<00:03:49.849> the

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
is place a button slap-bang in the

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.429 
is place a button slap-bang in the
middle<00:03:50.269> then<00:03:50.689> you<00:03:50.720> want<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:50.989> go<00:03:51.079> out<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.409> back

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 
middle then you want to go out the back

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.670 
middle then you want to go out the back
here<00:03:51.919> place<00:03:52.430> a<00:03:52.639> block<00:03:53.060> with<00:03:53.569> a<00:03:53.599> repeater<00:03:54.349> on

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
all of your piston tape synched up so if

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.450 
all of your piston tape synched up so if
we<00:04:50.600> give<00:04:50.750> it<00:04:50.870> a<00:04:50.900> tester<00:04:51.350> there<00:04:51.980> we<00:04:52.100> have<00:04:52.310> it

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
we give it a tester there we have it

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.550 
we give it a tester there we have it
there<00:04:53.270> is<00:04:53.420> the<00:04:53.570> cycle<00:04:54.020> nice<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:54.980> easy<00:04:56.230> now<00:04:57.230> for

there is the cycle nice and easy now for

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.960 
there is the cycle nice and easy now for
the<00:04:57.620> combination<00:04:58.280> checker<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:58.760> want<00:04:58.910> to

the combination checker you want to

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.780 
the combination checker you want to
place<00:04:59.150> a<00:04:59.360> furnace<00:04:59.870> up<00:05:00.110> here<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:00.740> a<00:05:01.370> bunch<00:05:01.670> of

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
place a furnace up here and a bunch of

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.910 
place a furnace up here and a bunch of
items<00:05:02.210> in<00:05:02.450> there<00:05:02.660> it<00:05:03.050> doesn't<00:05:03.470> really<00:05:03.590> matter

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
items in there it doesn't really matter

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.010 
items in there it doesn't really matter
how<00:05:04.220> many<00:05:04.490> I'm<00:05:04.640> just<00:05:04.790> going<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:04.940> put<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.150> full<00:05:05.360> 64

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
how many I'm just going to put a full 64

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.630 
how many I'm just going to put a full 64
in<00:05:06.170> because<00:05:06.500> I'm<00:05:06.740> in<00:05:06.860> creative<00:05:07.280> mode<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.490> I

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
in because I'm in creative mode and I

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.130 
in because I'm in creative mode and I
can<00:05:07.790> do<00:05:07.910> what<00:05:08.060> I<00:05:08.120> want<00:05:08.390> and<00:05:08.510> then<00:05:09.020> you<00:05:09.110> just

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
can do what I want and then you just

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.080 
can do what I want and then you just
want<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.470> place<00:05:09.650> a<00:05:09.800> block<00:05:09.980> out<00:05:10.190> like<00:05:10.400> this<00:05:10.610> with

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
want to place a block out like this with

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.610 
want to place a block out like this with
a<00:05:11.120> comparator<00:05:11.870> facing<00:05:12.290> in<00:05:12.410> this<00:05:12.560> direction

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
a comparator facing in this direction

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.250 
a comparator facing in this direction
now<00:05:13.610> as<00:05:13.820> you<00:05:13.970> can<00:05:14.120> see<00:05:14.180> because<00:05:14.630> this<00:05:15.080> is<00:05:15.230> a

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
now as you can see because this is a

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.740 
now as you can see because this is a
transparent<00:05:16.100> block<00:05:16.340> our<00:05:16.670> comparator<00:05:17.390> is<00:05:17.570> not

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
transparent block our comparator is not

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.990 
transparent block our comparator is not
powered<00:05:18.170> but<00:05:18.440> if<00:05:18.830> we<00:05:19.040> place<00:05:19.250> a<00:05:19.430> solid<00:05:19.850> block

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
powered but if we place a solid block

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.550 
powered but if we place a solid block
there<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.540> comes<00:05:20.990> on<00:05:21.200> and<00:05:21.350> that<00:05:21.470> is

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
there it comes on and that is

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.500 
there it comes on and that is
essentially<00:05:22.040> how<00:05:22.070> we<00:05:22.310> set<00:05:22.700> our<00:05:22.850> combination

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
essentially how we set our combination

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.320 
essentially how we set our combination
so<00:05:23.780> it's<00:05:24.050> very<00:05:24.500> nice<00:05:24.740> and<00:05:24.950> easy<00:05:25.160> indeed<00:05:25.700> now

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
so it's very nice and easy indeed now

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.850 
so it's very nice and easy indeed now
for<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:26.630> combination<00:05:27.110> checker<00:05:27.380> across

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
for the combination checker across

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.460 
for the combination checker across
multiple<00:05:28.370> different<00:05:28.900> combination<00:05:29.900> locks<00:05:30.170> all

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
multiple different combination locks all

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.440 
multiple different combination locks all
you<00:05:30.710> have<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:31.010> do<00:05:31.160> is<00:05:31.370> place<00:05:31.610> a<00:05:31.820> block<00:05:32.060> up<00:05:32.270> like

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
you have to do is place a block up like

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.500 
you have to do is place a block up like
this<00:05:32.660> a<00:05:32.870> redstone<00:05:33.620> torch<00:05:33.920> and<00:05:34.400> then<00:05:34.850> a<00:05:35.090> piece

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
this a redstone torch and then a piece

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.930 
this a redstone torch and then a piece
of<00:05:35.750> redstone<00:05:36.020> dust<00:05:36.260> out<00:05:36.680> there<00:05:36.950> that<00:05:37.400> runs<00:05:37.610> all

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
of redstone dust out there that runs all

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.610 
of redstone dust out there that runs all
the<00:05:37.970> way<00:05:38.090> across<00:05:38.690> like<00:05:38.720> that<00:05:39.110> so<00:05:39.350> when<00:05:39.530> you

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
the way across like that so when you

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.740 
the way across like that so when you
connect<00:05:39.950> them<00:05:40.070> up<00:05:40.190> you<00:05:40.400> can<00:05:40.580> see<00:05:40.790> it<00:05:41.060> runs<00:05:41.450> into

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
connect them up you can see it runs into

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.480 
connect them up you can see it runs into
a<00:05:41.780> big<00:05:42.020> old<00:05:42.200> line<00:05:42.440> and<00:05:42.710> then<00:05:43.070> you<00:05:43.130> place<00:05:43.310> a

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
a big old line and then you place a

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.490 
a big old line and then you place a
redstone<00:05:43.730> torch<00:05:44.060> at<00:05:44.390> the<00:05:44.480> end<00:05:44.660> and<00:05:44.930> that<00:05:44.960> torch

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
redstone torch at the end and that torch

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.800 
redstone torch at the end and that torch
will<00:05:45.740> only<00:05:46.010> come<00:05:46.460> on<00:05:46.490> when<00:05:46.850> all<00:05:47.420> of<00:05:47.600> your

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
will only come on when all of your

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.570 
will only come on when all of your
combinations<00:05:48.440> are<00:05:48.650> correct<00:05:49.040> all<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.460> way

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
combinations are correct all the way

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.110 
combinations are correct all the way
across<00:05:50.050> so<00:05:51.050> it<00:05:51.320> really<00:05:51.680> is<00:05:52.010> as<00:05:52.280> simple<00:05:52.790> as<00:05:52.880> that

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
across so it really is as simple as that

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.940 
across so it really is as simple as that
all<00:05:53.330> you<00:05:53.420> have<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.720> do<00:05:53.840> is<00:05:54.080> rinse<00:05:54.350> and<00:05:54.590> repeat

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
all you have to do is rinse and repeat

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.830 
all you have to do is rinse and repeat
and<00:05:55.130> then<00:05:55.250> you'll<00:05:55.370> get<00:05:55.610> a<00:05:55.790> combination<00:05:56.690> lock

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
and then you'll get a combination lock

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.170 
and then you'll get a combination lock
with<00:05:57.260> bazillions<00:05:57.980> of<00:05:58.370> possible<00:05:58.940> combinations

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
with bazillions of possible combinations

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.840 
with bazillions of possible combinations
if<00:05:59.750> that's<00:05:59.990> really<00:06:00.290> what<00:06:00.410> you're<00:06:00.710> into<00:06:01.010> but<00:06:01.580> if

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
if that's really what you're into but if

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.670 
if that's really what you're into but if
