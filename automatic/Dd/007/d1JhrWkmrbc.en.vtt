lights<00:00:08.469> on<00:00:08.800> traffic<00:00:09.309> lights<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.840> the<00:00:11.050> traffic

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 
lights on traffic lights so the traffic

lights on traffic lights so the traffic
lights<00:00:11.559> at<00:00:11.769> the<00:00:11.860> end<00:00:11.980> of<00:00:12.129> the<00:00:12.249> road<00:00:12.429> we're

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:12.849 
lights at the end of the road we're

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.529 
lights at the end of the road we're
going<00:00:12.969> to<00:00:13.059> turn<00:00:13.269> left<00:00:15.270> normally<00:00:16.270> when<00:00:16.420> you

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
have a green traffic light it allows you

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.520 
have a green traffic light it allows you
to<00:00:18.550> travel<00:00:18.850> any<00:00:19.000> direction<00:00:19.360> but<00:00:20.110> sometimes

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.530 
to travel any direction but sometimes

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.560 
to travel any direction but sometimes
you<00:00:20.680> still<00:00:20.890> need<00:00:21.100> to<00:00:21.190> make<00:00:21.310> sure<00:00:21.340> it's<00:00:21.640> safe<00:00:21.820> to

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
you still need to make sure it's safe to

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.510 
you still need to make sure it's safe to
go<00:00:22.720> that<00:00:22.870> direction<00:00:23.020> when<00:00:23.890> there's<00:00:24.070> a<00:00:24.130> filter

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
go that direction when there's a filter

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.060 
go that direction when there's a filter
light<00:00:24.700> is<00:00:25.140> often<00:00:26.140> safe<00:00:26.410> to<00:00:26.590> travel<00:00:26.800> that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
light is often safe to travel that

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.800 
light is often safe to travel that
direction<00:00:27.400> because<00:00:28.090> everybody<00:00:28.510> should<00:00:28.780> have

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
direction because everybody should have

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.110 
direction because everybody should have
been<00:00:29.080> stopped<00:00:29.350> for<00:00:29.530> you<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.730> we're<00:00:30.910> going<00:00:31.060> to

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.120 
been stopped for you so we're going to

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.270 
been stopped for you so we're going to
turn<00:00:31.330> left<00:00:31.720> at<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.020> end<00:00:32.140> of<00:00:32.290> the<00:00:32.349> road<00:00:32.529> so<00:00:33.100> once

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
turn left at the end of the road so once

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.250 
turn left at the end of the road so once
we<00:00:33.460> pass<00:00:33.700> this<00:00:33.969> last<00:00:34.300> road<00:00:34.600> on<00:00:34.719> the<00:00:34.809> left<00:00:34.989> we're

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
we pass this last road on the left we're

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.960 
we pass this last road on the left we're
going<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:35.440> send<00:00:35.620> some<00:00:35.770> mirror<00:00:35.920> left<00:00:36.700> mirror

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
going to send some mirror left mirror

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.470 
going to send some mirror left mirror
left<00:00:37.240> signal<00:00:39.060> looking<00:00:40.060> at<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.270> traffic

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
left signal looking at the traffic

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.900 
left signal looking at the traffic
lights<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.920> far<00:00:42.160> ones<00:00:42.370> you<00:00:42.520> can<00:00:42.640> see<00:00:42.670> there's

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
lights the far ones you can see there's

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.790 
lights the far ones you can see there's
four<00:00:43.150> lights<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:44.230> bottom<00:00:44.560> one<00:00:44.680> is<00:00:44.770> a

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
four lights and the bottom one is a

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.110 
four lights and the bottom one is a
green<00:00:45.070> arrow<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:48.340> that<00:00:48.370> means<00:00:48.670> we're<00:00:48.880> allowed

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
green arrow so that means we're allowed

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.160 
green arrow so that means we're allowed
to<00:00:49.300> turn<00:00:49.450> left

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.590 

now<00:00:54.859> the<00:00:54.920> green<00:00:55.429> light<00:00:55.670> above<00:00:55.969> it<00:00:56.089> has<00:00:56.210> come<00:00:56.449> on

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
now the green light above it has come on

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.910 
now the green light above it has come on
which<00:00:56.870> means<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:57.199> filter<00:00:57.500> light<00:00:57.620> has<00:00:57.739> gone

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
which means the filter light has gone

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.680 
which means the filter light has gone
off<00:00:58.070> that<00:00:58.309> still<00:00:58.969> means<00:00:59.210> that<00:00:59.269> we're<00:00:59.480> allowed

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
off that still means that we're allowed

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.450 
off that still means that we're allowed
to<00:00:59.719> turn<00:00:59.989> left<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:00.710> we're<00:01:00.980> keeping<00:01:01.070> an<00:01:01.339> eye<00:01:01.429> on

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
to turn left so we're keeping an eye on

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.250 
to turn left so we're keeping an eye on
our<00:01:01.670> filter<00:01:02.030> light<00:01:02.149> on<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.390> left<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.050> we<00:01:03.140> can

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
our filter light on the left so we can

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.320 
our filter light on the left so we can
see<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.500> red<00:01:03.649> traffic<00:01:03.859> light<00:01:04.100> at<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.339> top<00:01:04.489> at

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
see the red traffic light at the top at

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.670 
see the red traffic light at the top at
the<00:01:05.360> bottom<00:01:05.449> we're<00:01:05.899> looking<00:01:06.110> for<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.380> green

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
the bottom we're looking for the green

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.950 
the bottom we're looking for the green
arrow<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:07.100> come<00:01:07.430> on<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:11.360> we're<00:01:11.479> also<00:01:11.600> looking

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
arrow to come on and we're also looking

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.050 
arrow to come on and we're also looking
deep<00:01:12.649> into<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.070> road<00:01:13.220> as<00:01:13.369> well<00:01:13.520> we<00:01:13.700> can<00:01:13.880> see
