I've<00:01:40.020> been<00:01:40.049> having<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.770> every<00:01:41.130> day<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.400> seemed

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
I've been having and every day it seemed

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.100 
I've been having and every day it seemed
that<00:01:41.610> more<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.210> more<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.570> these<00:01:42.659> little<00:01:42.840> odd

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that more and more of these little odd

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.690 
that more and more of these little odd
shaped<00:01:43.409> objects<00:01:43.950> were<00:01:44.009> starting<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.399> appear

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
shaped objects were starting to appear

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060 
shaped objects were starting to appear
in<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:45.420> field<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.780> vision<00:01:45.960> sometimes<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
in my field of vision sometimes I

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.460 
in my field of vision sometimes I
thought<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.310> was<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.670> crazy<00:01:48.110> now<00:01:49.110> deal<00:01:49.439> with

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
thought I was going crazy now deal with

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.170 
thought I was going crazy now deal with
eye<00:01:49.710> floaters<00:01:50.040> may<00:01:50.220> not<00:01:50.399> seem<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.850> big

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
eye floaters may not seem like that big

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.030 
eye floaters may not seem like that big
of<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.360> deal<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.540> some<00:01:51.810> people<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.619> let<00:01:52.799> me<00:01:52.890> tell

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
listen I I'm a very skeptical guy and I

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.150 
listen I I'm a very skeptical guy and I
did<00:03:29.290> not<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.440> didn't<00:03:29.650> believe<00:03:29.799> a<00:03:29.829> single<00:03:30.040> word

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
of what he was saying but the truth was

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.250 
of what he was saying but the truth was
I<00:03:33.250> was<00:03:33.400> just<00:03:33.430> so<00:03:33.669> desperate<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.780> had<00:03:35.079> to

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
I was just so desperate that I had to

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.170 
I was just so desperate that I had to
give<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.590> try<00:03:35.739> especially<00:03:36.310> if<00:03:36.730> my<00:03:36.940> close

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
give this a try especially if my close

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.110 
give this a try especially if my close
friend<00:03:37.569> if<00:03:38.349> he<00:03:38.889> really<00:03:39.130> said<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.970> worked

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
friend if he really said that it worked

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.150 
friend if he really said that it worked
for<00:03:40.209> him<00:03:40.359> the<00:03:40.450> way<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.630> did<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.139> I<00:03:41.739> ended<00:03:42.069> up

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
for him the way it did so I ended up

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.280 
for him the way it did so I ended up
jumping<00:03:42.370> on<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.669> program<00:03:43.030> myself<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.720> let<00:03:44.200> me

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
jumping on the program myself and let me

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.979 
jumping on the program myself and let me
tell<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.769> was<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.280> best<00:03:45.519> decision<00:03:46.389> of<00:03:46.870> my

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
tell you it was the best decision of my

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.860 
tell you it was the best decision of my
life<00:03:47.340> just<00:03:48.340> three<00:03:48.700> weeks<00:03:48.819> I<00:03:49.090> swear<00:03:49.419> just<00:03:49.720> three

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
life just three weeks I swear just three

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.240 
life just three weeks I swear just three
weeks<00:03:49.989> after<00:03:50.230> following<00:03:50.590> the

weeks after following the

floaters no more program I could
actually<00:03:55.090> say<00:03:55.599> that<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.290> number<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.739> my<00:03:56.919> eye

floaters in my vision has been reduced

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.890 
floaters in my vision has been reduced
by<00:03:59.319> at<00:03:59.500> least<00:03:59.769> 70%<00:04:00.579> it's<00:04:01.329> absolutely

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
by at least 70% it's absolutely

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.490 
by at least 70% it's absolutely
mind-boggling

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
mind-boggling

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.009 
mind-boggling
in<00:04:03.430> fact<00:04:03.819> I<00:04:03.970> now<00:04:04.090> find<00:04:04.359> myself<00:04:04.389> not<00:04:04.810> even

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
in fact I now find myself not even
