large turbines which also accommodate a
bottle<00:01:12.620> so<00:01:13.460> what<00:01:13.729> I've<00:01:13.850> done<00:01:14.030> is<00:01:14.240> I've<00:01:14.390> put<00:01:14.570> the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720

average-sized male and I've got plenty
of<00:01:18.590> room<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.159> most<00:01:19.460> people<00:01:19.610> should<00:01:20.240> be<00:01:20.360> fine<00:01:20.750> in

offroading

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.980 
offroading
and<00:02:06.760> when<00:02:07.760> you're<00:02:07.910> on<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.119> road<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.600> major

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
and when you're on the road a major

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.750 
and when you're on the road a major
positive<00:02:09.320> about<00:02:09.740> this<00:02:09.950> car<00:02:10.220> is<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.610> has

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
positive about this car is that it has

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.520 
positive about this car is that it has
the<00:02:10.880> smallest<00:02:11.210> turning<00:02:11.780> circle<00:02:12.140> in<00:02:12.260> class

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
the smallest turning circle in class

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:20.650 
the smallest turning circle in class
which<00:02:13.280> makes<00:02:13.610> these<00:02:13.850> tight<00:02:14.240> maneuvers<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:19.660> lot

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
which makes these tight maneuvers a lot

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.390 
which makes these tight maneuvers a lot
more<00:02:20.990> manageable

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.680 

whilst<00:02:29.400> you're<00:02:29.610> doing<00:02:29.640> all<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.210> fuel

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
whilst you're doing all this fuel

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.480 
whilst you're doing all this fuel
consumption<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.380> pretty<00:02:31.620> good<00:02:31.890> as<00:02:32.040> well<00:02:32.070> you

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
consumption is pretty good as well you

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.910 
consumption is pretty good as well you
should<00:02:32.610> get<00:02:33.090> around<00:02:33.360> 33<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> gallon<00:02:34.830> out

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
should get around 33 to the gallon out

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.000 
should get around 33 to the gallon out
of<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.310> also<00:02:35.940> good<00:02:36.780> news<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.290> if<00:02:37.470> you're<00:02:37.800> using

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
of it also good news is if you're using

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.740 
of it also good news is if you're using
it<00:02:38.280> for<00:02:38.310> work<00:02:38.610> because<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.300> classed<00:02:39.540> as<00:02:39.720> a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
it for work because it's classed as a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.990 
it for work because it's classed as a
commercial<00:02:40.140> vehicle<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:41.280> don't<00:02:41.580> need<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.850> pay

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
commercial vehicle you don't need to pay

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.320 
commercial vehicle you don't need to pay
company<00:02:42.450> car<00:02:42.690> tax<00:02:43.020> on<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.640> however<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:45.000> does

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
company car tax on it however that does

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.110 
company car tax on it however that does
bring<00:02:45.540> me<00:02:45.630> on<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.080> its<00:02:46.230> negative<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.820> does

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
bring me on to its negative so it does

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.880 
bring me on to its negative so it does
sound<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.540> bit<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.870> tractor<00:02:49.290> when<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.740> get

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
sound a bit like a tractor when you get

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.680 
sound a bit like a tractor when you get
it<00:02:49.980> up<00:02:50.070> speed<00:02:50.580> because<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.880> engine<00:02:51.330> is<00:02:51.420> so

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
it up speed because the engine is so

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.650 
it up speed because the engine is so
noisy<00:02:52.310> also<00:02:53.310> because<00:02:53.760> essentially<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.630> a

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
noisy also because essentially it is a

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.170 
noisy also because essentially it is a
commercial<00:02:55.410> vehicle<00:02:55.590> it's<00:02:56.310> designed<00:02:56.790> to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
commercial vehicle it's designed to

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
accommodate a heavy load in the back so

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.940 
accommodate a heavy load in the back so
when<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.060> bed<00:03:00.210> is<00:03:00.240> empty<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:01.290> suspension

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
when the bed is empty the suspension

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.480 
when the bed is empty the suspension
feels<00:03:02.250> very<00:03:02.670> bouncy<00:03:03.560> also<00:03:04.560> because<00:03:05.100> it's<00:03:05.310> such

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
feels very bouncy also because it's such

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.820 
feels very bouncy also because it's such
a<00:03:05.520> large<00:03:05.940> vehicle<00:03:06.270> without<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.230> optional

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.650 

the<00:03:22.770> last<00:03:22.980> small<00:03:23.250> criticism<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.090> have<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.360> this

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
the last small criticism I have of this

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.150 
the last small criticism I have of this
car<00:03:24.990> is<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.260> load<00:03:25.680> bed<00:03:27.710> now<00:03:28.710> you<00:03:28.770> might<00:03:29.130> think

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
car is the load bed now you might think

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.610 
car is the load bed now you might think
that<00:03:29.580> I'm<00:03:29.790> crazy<00:03:30.090> for<00:03:30.630> criticizing<00:03:31.080> one<00:03:31.500> of

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
that I'm crazy for criticizing one of

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.950 
that I'm crazy for criticizing one of
its<00:03:31.740> most<00:03:31.920> useful<00:03:32.460> features<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:33.570> actually

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
its most useful features but actually

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.810 
its most useful features but actually
the<00:03:34.140> reason<00:03:34.470> why<00:03:34.620> I'm<00:03:34.680> criticizing<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.610> is

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
the reason why I'm criticizing it is

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.370 
the reason why I'm criticizing it is
because<00:03:36.210> there's<00:03:36.360> no<00:03:36.420> way<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.720> protect<00:03:37.020> your

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
because there's no way to protect your

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.470 
because there's no way to protect your
contents<00:03:37.980> unless<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.460> go<00:03:38.580> for<00:03:38.790> an<00:03:38.850> optional

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
contents unless you go for an optional

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.270 
contents unless you go for an optional
load<00:03:39.900> cover<00:03:40.260> but<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.550> look<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:42.030> quite<00:03:42.330> fiddly

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.110 

there<00:03:47.280> we<00:03:47.370> go<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:48.230> also<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.710> size<00:03:50.100> in<00:03:50.520> here<00:03:50.850> is

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
there we go and also the size in here is

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.660 
there we go and also the size in here is
smaller<00:03:51.810> than<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.140> nissan<00:03:52.530> navara<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.340> a
