now<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.520> bar<00:02:21.820> it's<00:02:21.970> gonna<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.210> to<00:02:22.270> be<00:02:22.360> very

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
now the bar it's gonna have to be very

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.630 
now the bar it's gonna have to be very

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
into Charlie's think well right there

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.290 
into Charlie's think well right there
actually<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.250> mean<00:02:27.550> she'll<00:02:27.670> have<00:02:27.760> no<00:02:28.000> such

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
actually I mean she'll have no such

now for the first time
Owen<00:03:11.860> has<00:03:11.980> got<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.310> bike<00:03:12.519> in<00:03:12.790> his<00:03:12.940> sights<00:03:13.150> at

Owen has got the bike in his sights at

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.580 
Owen has got the bike in his sights at
the<00:03:13.360> hidden<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.630> Mansfield<00:03:13.959> hopefully<00:03:14.500> the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
the hidden to Mansfield hopefully the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.840 
the hidden to Mansfield hopefully the
bike<00:03:14.769> doesn't<00:03:14.980> lose<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.310> here<00:03:15.519> then<00:03:15.730> why's

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
bike doesn't lose it here then why's

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.430 
bike doesn't lose it here then why's
he's<00:03:16.030> gonna<00:03:16.150> have<00:03:16.300> an<00:03:16.360> m5<00:03:16.780> on<00:03:16.989> top<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.320> him

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
he's gonna have an m5 on top of him

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.530 
he's gonna have an m5 on top of him
actually<00:03:18.160> totally<00:03:19.030> goes<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.209> little<00:03:19.360> bit

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
actually totally goes a little bit

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.470 
actually totally goes a little bit
sideways<00:03:20.610> why<00:03:21.610> doesn't<00:03:21.820> look<00:03:21.910> wheelie<00:03:22.269> there

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
sideways why doesn't look wheelie there

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.050 
sideways why doesn't look wheelie there
and<00:03:22.810> he's<00:03:23.380> turning<00:03:23.650> up<00:03:23.950> towards<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.519> mountain

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
and he's turning up towards the mountain

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.210 
and he's turning up towards the mountain
now<00:03:25.330> this<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:26.050> would<00:03:26.230> be<00:03:26.260> very<00:03:26.650> very<00:03:26.980> tricky

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
now this this would be very very tricky

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.240 
now this this would be very very tricky
for<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.519> by<00:03:28.050> then<00:03:29.050> finds<00:03:29.410> all<00:03:29.530> over<00:03:29.950> here<00:03:30.130> not

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
for the by then finds all over here not

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.320 
for the by then finds all over here not
something<00:03:30.459> you've<00:03:30.549> seen<00:03:30.640> his<00:03:30.760> rear<00:03:30.970> mirrors

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
something you've seen his rear mirrors

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.420 
something you've seen his rear mirrors
now<00:03:31.510> over<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.230> hill<00:03:32.470> fighters<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.160> little

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
now over the hill fighters a little

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.930 
now over the hill fighters a little
really<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:35.709> heading<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.250> hall<00:03:36.430> bends<00:03:36.640> now<00:03:36.880> it

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
really the heading the hall bends now it

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.340 
really the heading the hall bends now it
can<00:03:37.120> be<00:03:37.180> particularly<00:03:37.540> tricky<00:03:37.810> for<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.140> by

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
can be particularly tricky for the by

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.539 
can be particularly tricky for the by
kicks<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:38.920> conditions

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
kicks of the conditions

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.550 
kicks of the conditions
Owen<00:03:40.209> able<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.480> brake<00:03:40.660> much<00:03:40.870> later<00:03:41.140> makes<00:03:41.440> it

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
Owen able to brake much later makes it

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.560 
Owen able to brake much later makes it
quite<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.739> bit<00:03:41.799> distance<00:03:42.489> might<00:03:43.239> even<00:03:43.390> be<00:03:43.510> able

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
quite a bit distance might even be able

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.090 
quite a bit distance might even be able
to<00:03:43.660> take<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.959> bike<00:03:44.110> here<00:03:44.410> now<00:03:44.920> they're

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
to take the bike here now they're

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.410 
to take the bike here now they're
heading<00:03:45.340> into<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.610> hairpin<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.269> bike

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
heading into the hairpin the bike

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.780 
heading into the hairpin the bike
remaining<00:03:46.870> upright<00:03:47.049> once<00:03:47.500> again<00:03:47.980> it's<00:03:48.549> very

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
remaining upright once again it's very

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.820 
remaining upright once again it's very
slippy<00:03:49.180> obviously<00:03:49.630> yeah<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:50.620> he<00:03:50.709> goes

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
slippy obviously yeah so he goes

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.500 
slippy obviously yeah so he goes
slightly<00:03:51.070> sideways<00:03:51.430> loses<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.120> better<00:03:52.269> time

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
slightly sideways loses a better time

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.070 
slightly sideways loses a better time
here<00:03:52.810> as<00:03:52.900> they<00:03:53.019> head<00:03:53.170> down<00:03:53.350> into<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.620> barn

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
here as they head down into the barn

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.510 
here as they head down into the barn
all<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.470> leaves<00:03:54.680> on<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:54.890> track<00:03:55.160> that<00:03:55.280> must<00:03:55.460> be

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
all the leaves on the track that must be

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.130 
all the leaves on the track that must be
quite<00:03:55.760> nerve-racking<00:03:56.480> for<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.660> rider<00:03:59.140> well

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
quite nerve-racking for the rider well

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.110 
quite nerve-racking for the rider well
guys<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.680> grinder<00:04:00.950> I<00:04:00.980> guess<00:04:01.310> sideways<00:04:01.760> again

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
guys the grinder I guess sideways again

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.700 
guys the grinder I guess sideways again
the<00:04:02.300> bite<00:04:02.570> able<00:04:02.990> to<00:04:03.080> nail<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.380> throttle<00:04:03.680> now

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
the bite able to nail the throttle now

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.100 
the bite able to nail the throttle now
to<00:04:04.160> make<00:04:04.310> up<00:04:04.430> some<00:04:04.580> of<00:04:04.640> that<00:04:04.700> lost<00:04:04.910> time<00:04:05.180> they

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
to make up some of that lost time they

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.630 
to make up some of that lost time they
cross<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.500> line<00:04:06.530> there's<00:04:07.280> only<00:04:07.430> about<00:04:07.550> a

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
cross the line there's only about a

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.720 
cross the line there's only about a
second<00:04:08.390> in<00:04:08.570> it<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.080> m5<00:04:09.740> managed<00:04:10.490> to<00:04:10.550> make

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
second in it so the m5 managed to make

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.730 
second in it so the m5 managed to make
up<00:04:10.850> about<00:04:11.030> nine<00:04:11.420> seconds<00:04:12.050> on<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.710> bike<00:04:14.740> well

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
up about nine seconds on the bike well

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.410 
up about nine seconds on the bike well
there<00:04:15.890> we<00:04:15.980> have<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.250> then<00:04:16.370> that<00:04:16.700> was<00:04:17.000> really

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
there we have it then that was really

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.030 
there we have it then that was really
close<00:04:17.630> wasn't<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.290> car<00:04:18.590> performed

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
close wasn't it the car performed

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.340 
close wasn't it the car performed
extremely<00:04:19.609> well<00:04:19.940> had<00:04:20.330> it<00:04:20.359> been<00:04:20.570> dry<00:04:20.750> though<00:04:20.959> it

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
extremely well had it been dry though it

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.300 
extremely well had it been dry though it
probably<00:04:21.620> wouldn't<00:04:21.769> have<00:04:21.890> caught<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.130> bike

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
probably wouldn't have caught the bike

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.090 
probably wouldn't have caught the bike
and<00:04:22.820> when<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:22.970> think<00:04:23.120> about<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.540> this<00:04:24.140> is<00:04:24.470> 60

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
and when you think about it this is 60

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.440 
and when you think about it this is 60
gram<00:04:25.250> less<00:04:25.490> than<00:04:25.730> that<00:04:25.850> and<00:04:26.030> if<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.240> had<00:04:26.360> the

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
gram less than that and if I had the

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.770 
gram less than that and if I had the
guts

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
guts

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.630 
guts
that's<00:04:27.110> pretty<00:04:27.260> where<00:04:27.410> my<00:04:27.620> money<00:04:27.860> will<00:04:28.010> go<00:04:28.160> but

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
that's pretty where my money will go but

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.220 
that's pretty where my money will go but
I<00:04:28.670> don't<00:04:28.790> so<00:04:29.210> I'd<00:04:30.020> rather<00:04:30.140> have<00:04:30.290> four<00:04:30.950> wheels
