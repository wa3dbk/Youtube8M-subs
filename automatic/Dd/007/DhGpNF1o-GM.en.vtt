00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:31.540
 be the most beautiful beaches and straight 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:35.570
 we are on the way to such a beach 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.790
 look for similar area where the water 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.100
 always expires and re-runs and 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.629
 right now the moment is over again 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.850
 runs and we try fast enough 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.860
 to get away from here because the water is 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.479
 I start to move quite fast 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:53.320
 the age here and it is so to speak 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.320
 Clear again 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.500
 exactly and I have already 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.199
 moved 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.840
 compared to talking in the evening 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.400
 gets very cold and that's why I am 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.830
 always happy and then always tries 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.520
 same and all possible trousers again 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.520
 pull it off 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.780
 I hope I can not wear a long pair of pants 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.780
 want 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.500
 Good morning I wanted mine again 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.290
 So start to the topic 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:00.580
 out of the game today 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.580
 I stopped counting what kind of one 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.880
 is on demand 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.350
 instead of downtown and that 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.990
 weather is fortunate enough now 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.260
 So little improved fire was the 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.450
 extremely rainy even a little bit 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.970
 and very windy and cold and there the 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.700
 Temperatures here are not so frame 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.620
 are always extremely noticeable when it is 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.030
 just a little less and now 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.570
 it's definitely on the way to the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.910
 city 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:34.270
 and let's see what camp to offer 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.270
 has and then stick 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.520
 Look, I'm in hiding here 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.250
 all around me are these 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.620
 Riesenfelgen and there are everywhere 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.660
 small holes and 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.550
 Entrances in it so that you actually there 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.800
 could go in and I'm doing in the morning 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.379
 a kayak tour 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.909
 swim the rock and yes i 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:42.419
 I'm really excited, I have to talk 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:45.940
 entrance 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:50.860
 For example 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:54.690
 and then you can climb in there and 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.690
 look what's in there
