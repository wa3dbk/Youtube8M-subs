00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.270 

I<00:01:41.859> think<00:01:42.640> that<00:01:43.210> he<00:01:43.329> tried<00:01:43.810> Tommy<00:01:44.469> can<00:01:44.799> add<00:01:45.009> a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
I think that he tried Tommy can add a

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.719 
I think that he tried Tommy can add a
tiny<00:01:45.609> bit<00:01:45.909> more<00:01:46.090> power<00:01:46.299> until<00:01:46.929> his<00:01:47.079> voice

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
tiny bit more power until his voice

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.319 
tiny bit more power until his voice
which<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:48.759> a<00:01:48.969> sensitive<00:01:49.780> horse<00:01:50.170> but<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:52.030> try

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
which is a sensitive horse but you try

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.370 
which is a sensitive horse but you try
this<00:01:52.390> more<00:01:53.380> solid<00:01:53.829> than<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.070> previous<00:01:54.460> one<00:01:54.670> I

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
this more solid than the previous one I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:07.949 
this more solid than the previous one I
think<00:01:56.380> it's<00:01:56.530> not<00:01:56.799> yet<00:01:57.340> finished<00:02:06.869> there's<00:02:07.869> a

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
think it's not yet finished there's a

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.949 
think it's not yet finished there's a
superb<00:02:08.500> control<00:02:09.160> over<00:02:09.819> each<00:02:10.090> step<00:02:10.539> in<00:02:10.780> this

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
superb control over each step in this

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:25.650
