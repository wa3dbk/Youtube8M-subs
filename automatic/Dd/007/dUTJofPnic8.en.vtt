00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.700
 today i would like to tell you 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.220
 several technical tips in 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.040
 particular storage brush not 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.120
 sure to be every time after 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.330
 classes after work 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.570
 they can be perfectly stored in a bucket with 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.560
 oil with regular sunflower oil 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.119
 they are stored there wonderful 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.580
 single exception cannot be stored 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.910
 there are very thin brushes of one and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.699
 twos they can be bent from bristles 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.160
 synthetics big brushes persist 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.719
 considered wonderful can stand in 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.610
 In this case, we do not need to think 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.739
 how much do we use brushes in work 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.350
 you can take as many as you like 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.030
 I don’t think that after work I’ll have to 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.059
 wash breathe solvents 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.520
 soap spoil the brush by the way washed the brush 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.090
 from the water quickly enough comes out 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.239
 building 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.140
 and here they absolutely serve on all their 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.129
 one hundred percent 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.500
 little advice on storing paints often 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.750
 we squeeze out a lot of paint and they 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.550
 dry on the palette or throw them away 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.280
 for this you can use this 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.560
 here's a bucket usual here some 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.520
 mayonnaise on my ugly 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.590
 here three hundred years, probably here we are just 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.110
 take out let's say before work 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.840
 take out saved paint from the past 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.890
 session they are absolutely fresh no not even 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.670
 crusted 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.710
 not dried out take out a knife scrub 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.560
 then it's a bucket and 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.440
 We work paints after work in 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.260
 reverse order to those paint 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.509
 sometimes very expensive paints we just 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.080
 throwing back in this bucket 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:44.229
 close the lid inside is not dark 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.000
 oxygen paint is long preserved in winter 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.180
 can be brought to the balcony or there for 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.950
 window hang freezer whom freezer 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.649
 big supply if you are long 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.280
 time don't plan on drawing you can 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.140
 pour the paint with water right in the bucket of oil 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.880
 as it is known does not mix with water and 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.619
 It will be stored for a very long time now I 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.929
 I want to talk about grease about 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.560
 imprimatura that I personally use 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.080
 each in each work we do 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.970
 for lubricating the canvas for imparting 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.970
 wet canvas to brush 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.450
 easily slid to paint fused 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.459
 and in order to tint the canvas 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.950
 yes and do not forget to throw a couple in a jar 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.500
 bolt or gadget 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.090
 in order to whip settled paint 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.090
 she is in time herself from the bottom 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.190
 the composition of this mixture is 40 percent 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.980
 white spirit 45 percent oil and at 0 5 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.070
 percent flag five percent 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.750
 mars case in my case mars 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.970
 brown dark transparent and five 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.830
 percent linen 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.900
 titanium white and must necessarily 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.180
 present in this mixture if 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.640
 this mixture was not present whitewash 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.850
 brown paint would be very bright 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.760
 she would have detonated with the rest of ours 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.250
 paints followed by paints in general 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.880
 if you try you will understand that white 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.880
 there necessarily 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.549
 now we dry our canvas with a hair dryer 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.829
 masculine or feminine to 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.629
 speed up 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.959
 weathered solvent can 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:41.739
 take a few minutes 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:46.060
 our canvas to the balcony or q something 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:49.030
 bathroom to inhale the wind 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.700
 the solvent is fast here and here 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.819
 ready in 5 10 minutes you are ready 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.459
 canvas to work this thinnest layer 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.640
 paint on the canvas will collect the picture 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.010
 in 1 gram add color to be 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.159
 as if the key for all our future 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.900
 pictures collect it into one here we 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.120
 we see artists as a cover very often 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.040
 enjoy this technique see that even 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.950
 not until drawn places 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.680
 this canvas 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.169
 from the so-called imprimatura itself 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.959
 important novice artists except 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.150
 He will not give a picture not razbelit 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.400
 make her bleached clean white on 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.660
 this canvas will look enough 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.639
 sharply and accordingly the artist will 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.280
 forced verse the picture is more lowered in 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:39.300
 more correct way that more 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.210
 competently and a couple of words about inexpensive 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.130
 growth diluent harn and artistic 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.380
 paints 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.650
 white spirit finnish is weak 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.750
 smelling very user-friendly for those 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.330
 who used to work with thinners 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.610
 comparing with NATO thinner 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.740
 he even smells 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.100
 nicer thinner and less odor 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.370
 there is also a swedish 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.900
 white spirit lacquer nafta I have not tried it 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.020
 I don't know what they say exactly the same without 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.030
 smell and this finnish varnish gasoline is not 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.510
 it's hard for me to get these smoked 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.310
 i bought leroy merlin scene it 150 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.070
 rubles per liter respectively 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.930
 about 10 times 15 cheaper than 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.940
 art on this all subscribe to 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.260
 our channel will be much more 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.000
 interesting ask questions in 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.479
 comments will try to answer 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.479
 happy
