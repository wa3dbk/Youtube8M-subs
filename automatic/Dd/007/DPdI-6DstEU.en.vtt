we wanted to differentiate from other
products<00:00:44.210> in<00:00:44.330> the<00:00:44.390> marketplace<00:00:45.190> more<00:00:46.190> dynamic

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
products in the marketplace more dynamic

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.910 
products in the marketplace more dynamic
more<00:00:47.180> exciting<00:00:47.750> we<00:00:48.260> focused<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:49.400> lot<00:00:49.730> on<00:00:50.090> the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
more exciting we focused a lot on the

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.620 
more exciting we focused a lot on the
aerodynamic<00:00:51.920> aspect<00:00:52.460> of<00:00:52.640> it<00:00:52.790> because<00:00:53.180> it<00:00:53.420> does

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
aerodynamic aspect of it because it does

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.040 
aerodynamic aspect of it because it does
equate<00:00:54.260> to<00:00:54.530> fuel<00:00:55.220> efficiency<00:00:55.880> and<00:00:56.630> I<00:00:56.780> think

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
equate to fuel efficiency and I think

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.500 
equate to fuel efficiency and I think
this<00:00:57.200> is<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.500> beauty<00:00:57.860> about<00:00:58.090> what<00:00:59.090> we've<00:00:59.270> done

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
this is the beauty about what we've done

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.500 
this is the beauty about what we've done
here<00:00:59.840> with<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.200> EcoSport<00:01:00.560> and<00:01:01.100> we<00:01:01.490> utilized<00:01:02.150> a

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
here with the EcoSport and we utilized a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.630 
here with the EcoSport and we utilized a
lot<00:01:02.720> of<00:01:02.900> this<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.680> come<00:01:03.890> up<00:01:04.040> with<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.280> product

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
lot of this to come up with a product

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.530 
lot of this to come up with a product
that<00:01:05.229> looks<00:01:06.229> right<00:01:06.560> in<00:01:06.770> India<00:01:07.189> but<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.240> also

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
that looks right in India but it also

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.260 
that looks right in India but it also
works<00:01:09.320> very<00:01:09.680> well<00:01:09.799> in<00:01:10.189> downtown<00:01:10.700> Sao<00:01:10.939> Paulo

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
works very well in downtown Sao Paulo

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.830 
works very well in downtown Sao Paulo
I'm<00:01:12.170> sure<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:12.829> this<00:01:13.070> design<00:01:13.549> it's<00:01:14.240> gonna<00:01:14.540> hit

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
I'm sure that this design it's gonna hit

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.540 
I'm sure that this design it's gonna hit
the<00:01:15.079> market<00:01:15.530> it's<00:01:15.710> gonna<00:01:15.860> be<00:01:15.979> something

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
the market it's gonna be something

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.250 
the market it's gonna be something
completely<00:01:17.090> different<00:01:17.180> than<00:01:17.630> everything<00:01:17.990> you

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
completely different than everything you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.240 
completely different than everything you
see<00:01:18.500> on<00:01:18.620> the<00:01:18.770> street

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
see on the street

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.969 
see on the street
and<00:01:19.340> I<00:01:19.700> think<00:01:19.970> that<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.690> brand's<00:01:21.140> Equus<00:01:21.590> parts

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
and I think that the brand's Equus parts

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.310 
and I think that the brand's Equus parts
the<00:01:22.159> nameplate<00:01:22.370> to<00:01:22.820> a<00:01:22.909> crisp<00:01:23.240> are<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:23.900> strong

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
the nameplate to a crisp are so strong

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.730 
the nameplate to a crisp are so strong
that<00:01:25.040> it's<00:01:25.220> gonna<00:01:25.490> it's<00:01:25.850> gonna<00:01:26.030> help<00:01:26.330> a<00:01:26.600> lot<00:01:26.740> to

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
that it's gonna it's gonna help a lot to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.219 
that it's gonna it's gonna help a lot to
deliver<00:01:28.070> that<00:01:28.520> design<00:01:28.970> we<00:01:29.270> created<00:01:29.780> in<00:01:29.960> the
