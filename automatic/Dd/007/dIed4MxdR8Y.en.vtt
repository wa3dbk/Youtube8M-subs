00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
open high E string which is 1/7 F let me

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.710 
open high E string which is 1/7 F let me
go<00:00:31.840> to<00:00:31.900> a<00:00:32.200> minor

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.740 

so<00:00:35.720> what<00:00:35.870> you're<00:00:35.960> doing<00:00:36.170> there<00:00:36.350> is<00:00:36.530> sliding<00:00:37.750> up

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
and then bounce it up again so B flat B

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.390 
and then bounce it up again so B flat B
flat<00:00:55.980> F<00:00:56.340> again<00:00:57.800> D<00:00:58.800> a<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:01.920> slow<00:01:02.190> you've

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
flat F again D a so you can slow you've

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.320 
flat F again D a so you can slow you've
got<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.670> cause<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:04.050> I<00:01:04.080> deem<00:01:04.379> 87

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330
