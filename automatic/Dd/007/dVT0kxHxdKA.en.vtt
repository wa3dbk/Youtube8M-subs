 7 the last minute changes 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.709

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.249

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:15.219
 we in the Netherlands 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.910
 the other not and for sebastian langeveld in this case it is 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.510
 gent wevelgem has been a prey for the sprinters in recent years 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.010
 that we have a fake but the foot follows and even a nice mario cipollini 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.149
 live here 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.639
 maybe today is something for the rabo if he agrees with you 

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:33.920
 but the life he came to the side of the road 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.570
 mariÃ«nburgplein the finder and thanks to a broad spectrum can be requested 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.360
 there were more than expected her husband a whining it goes well then from 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.360
 start in the first hour of the race, its ranks are in london 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.519
 50 kilometers of traffic jams all due to rising stocks 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.510
 the government the place where the riders organized the dinners by the plans 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.170
 lichtervelde sends today 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.080
 look back the 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.080
 we only have this moment once, but we always do that 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.690
 and an energy drink 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.530
 I cooperated anyway 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.820
 they fear 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.270
 the party with 6 2 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.630
 by fast effective couples including a 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.530
 good food a great artist 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.340
 wall street has it first it's not so bad to get back in order 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.340
 guess everyone and ask your question 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.910
 the village there were more than expected 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.350
 but unfortunately for nothing the riders have given 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.540
 on the Flemish roads it is about continuing with here and there what he said 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.540
 it to the hill zone with the kemmelberg killer 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.050
 the race ended in a sprinter being won by poland lars boom 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.520
 sprinter did he was ninth not bad eric dekker with in the middle 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.960
 east 9 no more 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.370
 why not 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.420
 certainly not at all of those guys at church in 2004 who ride the rest of it 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.850
 the band exists 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.850
 fan the preparation tomorrow and that's what they thought 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.549
 maybe another year 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.449
 especially glad we have he is enclosed there 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.929
 there were so many variables 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:23.539
 that the right hall is among the very best in the world and that was yesterday afternoon 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.789
 are going to be brochures on Sunday 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:28.339
 then everyone at full war strength is already the best of the 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:32.159
 world it is that gives another a different picture the prices were packed with 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.789
 the strongest is going to be 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:37.599
 the past year he has me as I cannot afford so many mistakes 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.309
 technology like twitter 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.349
 but we are caught in a river 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.499
 a few years the majority he is very strong afterwards I am curious what 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:46.729
 a joke 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.479
 a lap longer than a year earlier 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.519
 we lose 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.209
 but i don't think they have to wait for the eu salary and a demarrage 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.709
 placed 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.259
 I can hardly wait for almost 200 million euros here
