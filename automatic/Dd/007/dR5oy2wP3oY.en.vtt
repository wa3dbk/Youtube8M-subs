00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hello dear friends with you I am 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.990
 cranes we look at the top 3 tanks in 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.330
 the game world of tanks that cause 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.519
 the maximum amount of damage for the fight so 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.449
 sit down more comfortably we begin 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.000
 and in third place we have t110 and three on 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.910
 which I already long ago rode 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.060
 streams you could watch this tank 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.420
 plus I often say that to me 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.219
 This tank really like and he really 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.390
 bends the best fattest 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.969
 frontal armor 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.640
 Yes, even though the board and back we have not 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.399
 armored but forehead is just something 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.420
 adamante you are only the bottom armor 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.160
 served by breaking sbbzh golda of course 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.070
 maybe someone us and be able to the deck 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.739
 flash but it is unlikely as well ladies 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.910
 slow but we have a great weapon 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.579
 300 grandmas and 375 gold breakthroughs 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.080
 time as damage 750 units 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.110
 dpm is also at 2640 8 hp per minute 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.229
 allow us to really damage but also a plus 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.890
 this tank is not the main weapon namely 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.450
 his frontal armor you can 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.420
 vytankovyvat enemies you will be afraid and 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.869
 you just ride them tank 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.090
 damage and and just explode farts 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.159
 because e 3 is capable of it 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.350
 but with third place is not so simple 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.210
 because you could put here 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.909
 many different tanks but i 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.020
 I chose her preference for her 3 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.610
 not second and first place is 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.150
 unconditionally these tanks were supposed to 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.720
 stand them let's find out what are the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.950
 second most homemade tank in the game 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.640
 This of course amx 50b still half a year ago 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.130
 who would tell me that this tank will take 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.340
 second place among all the dealers 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.420
 I would just laugh at his face 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.969
 because then 50b it was real 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.860
 nightmare there was t57 heavy of course 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.810
 how was it possible to forget about him 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.920
 then generally imbo but unfortunately 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.440
 sometimes not 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.080
 eggs and developers are some kind of tanks 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.010
 Nerfat any apyat and in this case 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.380
 for nerf ren was t57 heavy and apn and m x 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.660
 50 b but this is not surprising because amx 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.209
 50b lost absolutely all 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.930
 parameters hevik to hevik and now 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.560
 good machine but the gun leaves him 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.840
 she is wanting the slant and not really 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.730
 pleasant while a 50 m x b 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.730
 is heavy tanks on the tenth 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.709
 level has simply phenomenal 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.510
 have phenomenal performance 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.540
 speed well what is there to hide it 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.120
 french tank they are all practically 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.100
 fast and amx 50b me exception he 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.680
 the fastest heavy tank at the same time 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.930
 have a good good drum like that 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.720
 before the drum recharges a bit longer 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.910
 than the rate to between hevika 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.330
 two and a half shots in the drum 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.239
 seconds against in 2 and centuries but still 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.090
 dpm is not the main thing is that we are much 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.760
 more mobile we have a much nicer gun 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.570
 therefore implement the very 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.049
 damage is much easier for us though 50b is extremely 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.820
 feels bad and down skill 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.500
 hands if you have bad statistics 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.170
 tons of this tank 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.450
 you will not live at home like a god here 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.940
 still, a little bit you need to catch it 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.910
 and be able to understand at least a little relief 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.180
 terrain understand tactics and if many 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.209
 the arts just stay out of the way and damage 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.670
 somewhere back lines but then the second 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.280
 place is the most inside of de most domestic 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.120
 tanks in the game world of tanks have gone already 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.940
 to the first place well and in the first place 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.940
 wafer e100 I think even the most inexperienced 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.609
 fighter and with confidence could say that 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.150
 In the first place on any will be a waffle 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:06.239
 This tank is imba but on release 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.139
 and he was even better developers already his 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:13.440
 a bunch of times nerfili increased many times 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:17.280
 scatter taken even one shell from before 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.620
 top guns from yagdtigra which when 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.889
 This has already reduced the review 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.130
 and that with him just did not do but the fact 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.620
 The fact remains that the waffle is the most domestic 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.949
 tank in the game not only is the most homely 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.130
 so also the most easy home even 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:38.100
 being extremely not a skill player though 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.620
 you will even be a red fawn at you 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.940
 it will still be there more than 2000 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.560
 damage if you are skill then all four 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.800
 thousand plus me this is not surprising after all 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.919
 you have a drum for 5 shells of five hundred 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.520
 sixty one - time damage and 276 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.860
 I used to punch in general was as much as six 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.180
 shells scatter minimum scatter 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.910
 as such no boil down all 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.729
 instantly and you do not even stop 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.810
 what you most huge barn in the game and 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.340
 it follows that you have the worst 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.520
 stealth more cut a little bit 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.770
 review but in general the tank doesn't care itself 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.960
 feels the same way he has everything 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.840
 he has the same drum 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.630
 penetrative and well- aimed gun while 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.289
 running characteristics too smart 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.030
 enough speed passability excellent 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:32.430
 maximum speed is also enough 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.440
 and believe friends you will be on it 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.780
 just enjoy it 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.789
 problem given tank sooner or later 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.479
 will withdraw and from the game and it is for anyone 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.889
 not a secret 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.800
 so if you have not had time 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.020
 I advise everyone to enjoy this waffle 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.849
 Thanks for watching I hope you 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.610
