00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
weeks so I decided I needed to get out

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.820 
weeks so I decided I needed to get out
we<00:00:11.759> had<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> huge<00:00:12.150> snowstorm<00:00:12.450> last<00:00:12.929> about<00:00:13.620> two

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.010 
we had a huge snowstorm last about two
weeks<00:00:13.889> deal<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:15.710> it<00:00:16.880> snowed<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.119> lot<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.750> I

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
weeks deal and it snowed a lot so I

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.660 
weeks deal and it snowed a lot so I
didn't<00:00:19.650> go<00:00:19.710> out<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> few<00:00:20.189> weeks<00:00:20.340> one

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
didn't go out for a few weeks one

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.980 
didn't go out for a few weeks one
because<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.090> had<00:00:21.180> launched<00:00:21.570> an<00:00:21.660> injured<00:00:21.869> and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
because it had launched an injured and

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.210 
because it had launched an injured and
two<00:00:22.109> because<00:00:22.439> everything<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:22.920> would<00:00:23.130> have

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
two because everything that would have

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.580 
two because everything that would have
been<00:00:23.310> dropped<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.820> being<00:00:24.359> covered<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:25.560> I

awesome he has an inside spread of

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:27.350 
awesome he has an inside spread of
probably

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.820 

26<00:06:28.360> inches<00:06:28.740> probably<00:06:29.740> and<00:06:30.630> I<00:06:31.630> would<00:06:32.260> score<00:06:32.620> him

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
26 inches probably and I would score him

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.140 
26 inches probably and I would score him
up<00:06:33.210> it<00:06:34.210> looks<00:06:34.389> like<00:06:34.450> he's<00:06:34.720> probably<00:06:34.990> got

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
up it looks like he's probably got

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:43.440 
up it looks like he's probably got
fairly<00:06:38.070> even<00:06:39.070> main<00:06:39.340> beams<00:06:39.669> of<00:06:40.770> about<00:06:42.450> 26

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
fairly even main beams of about 26

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:49.820 
fairly even main beams of about 26
inches<00:06:45.150> so<00:06:46.150> I'd<00:06:46.300> say<00:06:46.570> that<00:06:47.520> between<00:06:48.520> main<00:06:49.000> beam

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
inches so I'd say that between main beam

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:58.350 
inches so I'd say that between main beam
g<00:06:50.830> one<00:06:52.950> g<00:06:53.950> twos<00:06:54.250> threes<00:06:56.400> and<00:06:57.400> fours<00:06:57.850> he's

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
g one g twos threes and fours he's

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.260 
g one g twos threes and fours he's
probably<00:06:58.630> got<00:06:59.580> maybe<00:07:02.760> 12<00:07:03.760> inches<00:07:04.120> of

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
probably got maybe 12 inches of

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:12.080 
probably got maybe 12 inches of
deductions<00:07:07.260> wow<00:07:08.430> this<00:07:09.430> guy<00:07:09.639> scores<00:07:10.650> 160

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
deductions wow this guy scores 160

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.610 
deductions wow this guy scores 160
that's<00:07:13.090> my<00:07:13.240> guess<00:07:13.300> he<00:07:14.139> doesn't<00:07:14.380> have<00:07:14.590> the

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:14.620 
that's my guess he doesn't have the

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.000 
that's my guess he doesn't have the
biggest<00:07:14.950> mass<00:07:15.660> but<00:07:16.660> he<00:07:16.750> carries<00:07:17.200> what<00:07:17.860> he's

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.010 
biggest mass but he carries what he's

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.590 
biggest mass but he carries what he's
got<00:07:18.190> that's<00:07:18.400> about<00:07:18.639> three<00:07:19.210> and<00:07:19.240> a<00:07:19.360> half<00:07:19.389> inches

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:19.600 
got that's about three and a half inches

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.360 
got that's about three and a half inches
right<00:07:19.990> there<00:07:20.729> right<00:07:21.729> there<00:07:21.940> as<00:07:22.090> well<00:07:22.270> there

right there right there as well there

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.500 
right there right there as well there
and<00:07:24.370> he's<00:07:24.520> probably<00:07:24.729> got<00:07:24.970> five<00:07:25.330> inch<00:07:25.690> basis

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.510 
and he's probably got five inch basis

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.120 
and he's probably got five inch basis
