00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello they talk about spray laptop 10 diego 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.150
 I bring you this topic that I have here 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.069
 called nexgen and the truth that changes by 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.260
 complete the view of our device 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.990
 this theme will work for all 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.880
 ipod touch and for all the iphone and ya 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.100
 be of the new models with 4 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.600
 inches or the previous versions and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 pro will work with everyone and as you see 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.010
 the icons do not appear simply 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.260
 buttons appear and here we go to 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.460
 left side looks like a clock and here 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.519
 we have simply two applications 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.920
 dreamboard and sidya and three with which 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.480
 we are going to apply these themes but good 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.649
 if I want to see all my applications what 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.750
 only I have to press is here 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.820
 where it says all my applications just 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.469
 applications and here will be all the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.750
 list in alphabetical order in all things 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.270
 and I want to get some application is 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.280
 simply touching on one it could be 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.860
 since it presents other applications that 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.910
 are the ones that come by default 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.640
 installed and when we buy our 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.010
 device like maps time contacts 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.829
 and here is another of games but it has a 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.090
 error and only game center appears 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.520
 but good the most used applications 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.930
 of applications like facebook phone 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.369
 all that kind of applications we're going 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.970
 to find here in the center what 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.280
 we can do 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
 touch and good as you see if I want 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.200
 accessing music would simply have it 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.150
 that squeeze calendar contacts time 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.940
 they see everything is here I can turn 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.680
 this to any side and since they are going to 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.540
 be if I do not want to occupy any 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.300
 our application simply touched and already 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.800
 I can not move between my pages and another 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.540
 thing is that this topic is very complete 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.400
 It also has a lock screen as they can 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.430
 see looks pretty good like all of these 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.620
 numbers like they were I do not know hackers or 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.940
 something like that completely changes the part of 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.950
 up here that we're going to need a 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.750
 tweet to erase the next clock 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.940
 normally but good here I do want 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.800
 accessing it could finish it and how 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.900
 I tell them it's going to open directly to 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.790
 this topic, I 'm going to teach you how to 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.010
 We can download this theme in our 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.420
 ok devices to install it sorry we 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.160
 we have to go like this once and for all that it 's so 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.590
 we're going to drive in 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.509
 handle let's squeeze sources edit 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.759
 add and there we are going to write the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.580
 next handsome that is re pop point in 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.080
 zanelli dotcom is the yy then it goes to 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.360
 one and Latin once they write it 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.740
 they press add source and then we 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.720
 let's go find and we will look for the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.489
 issue as such this will depend on whether 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.600
 We are on a device like iPhone 5 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.160
 white doctor 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.440
 of fifth generation election masters the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.110
 you have and five if we are in an ipod 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.540
 fourth generation an iphone 4 a 4 is 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.370
 a 3gs we select the one above has 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.110
 that be from starr and paul de jinshan the and 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.910
 so that the clock does not show 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.830
 our blog screen we need to install 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.030
 this one is the screen clock heil well 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.890
 that equal the pre also install and 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.360
 confirm cities it's okay all 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.190
 that in case you do not have these two 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.260
 applications winterboard dreamboard it 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.730
 they will install automatically but the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.290
 theme is activated in these two applications 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.600
 first thing they have to do is open 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.430
 winterboard and they will select themes 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.810
 and you have to select both the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.690
 first is to put all the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.610
 icons and the style of the theme and the second 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.080
 is the lock screen as such once 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.370
 they do it they just go back and they go to 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.590
 press here where they will say west 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.090
 spring and once you have this in 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.590
 winter so they are going to do is that they 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.910
 is going to look dreamboard and good the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.920
 interface also works like this 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.300
 here are all the topics and that you 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.430
 would have downloaded in this case 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.360
 they would simply disappear these three and 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.400
 you just have to 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.140
 select this and that's that simple 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.880
 they are going to have the whole theme activated 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.790
 principle gives them a bit of how 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.620
 a tutorial works 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.239
 and here is the interface as such and so 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.680
 of simple is how it will work not 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.120
 we can modify anything of it not 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.280
 we can change the order of 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.840
 applications nothing like that and good 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.189
 this would be all like in all my videos 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.079
 I give some this occasion I will 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.909
 give away three applications of the price more 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.319
 low in the app store to earn the only 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.970
 what they have to do is leave a like in 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.829
 this video and a comment that starts 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.329
 with the letter n any comment 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.829
 they just have to start with lyrics 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.540
 and they were going to be able to comment on the times 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.040
 they want in the day so this would be 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.299
 all do not forget to subscribe to this channel 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.569
 if they are not yet 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.569
 goodbye
