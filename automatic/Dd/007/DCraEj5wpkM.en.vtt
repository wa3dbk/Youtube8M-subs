00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
new SL D our driver heads so Taylor made

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.480 
new SL D our driver heads so Taylor made
a<00:00:08.639> few<00:00:09.210> weeks<00:00:09.240> ago<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.570> introduced<00:00:10.230> our<00:00:10.830> new<00:00:10.889> SL

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
a few weeks ago I introduced our new SL

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.230 
a few weeks ago I introduced our new SL
D<00:00:11.639> our<00:00:12.049> driver<00:00:13.049> head<00:00:13.290> what<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.219> noticed<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.089> an

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
D our driver head what we noticed is an

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.720 
D our driver head what we noticed is an
increase<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.780> ball<00:00:15.990> speed<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:17.010> launch<00:00:17.250> angles

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
increase in ball speed the launch angles

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.220 
increase in ball speed the launch angles
went<00:00:17.940> up<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.330> spins<00:00:18.570> went<00:00:18.810> down<00:00:18.960> which

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
went up and the spins went down which

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.170 
went up and the spins went down which
obviously<00:00:19.770> just<00:00:20.039> equates<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.460> more<00:00:20.699> distance

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
obviously just equates to more distance

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.480 
obviously just equates to more distance
the<00:00:21.630> CG<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> little<00:00:22.500> closer<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> face<00:00:23.279> so

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
the CG is a little closer to the face so

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.689 
the CG is a little closer to the face so
the<00:00:23.580> speed<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.050> face<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.529> driver

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
the speed is in the face of the driver

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.990 
the speed is in the face of the driver
we're<00:00:26.699> also<00:00:26.849> able<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.449> control<00:00:27.869> direction

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
we're also able to control direction

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.870 
we're also able to control direction
with<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> SLD<00:00:30.689> are<00:00:30.900> removable<00:00:31.560> weight<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.730> as

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
with the SLD are removable weight so as

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.840 
with the SLD are removable weight so as
we<00:00:33.059> move<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.719> weight<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.620> toe<00:00:34.950> it

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
we move the weight to the toe it

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.780 
we move the weight to the toe it
obviously<00:00:35.940> slows<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.750> toe<00:00:36.930> down<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.790> takes

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
obviously slows the toe down and takes

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.630 
obviously slows the toe down and takes
away<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.090> drawer<00:00:39.420> produces<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.469> fade<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.460> we

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
away a drawer produces of fade and as we

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.690 
away a drawer produces of fade and as we
move<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.210> weight<00:00:42.360> towards<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.930> heel<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:44.100> does

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
move the weight towards the heel it does

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.279 
move the weight towards the heel it does
the<00:00:44.820> reverse<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.420> gonna<00:00:45.539> help<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.989> draw<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
the reverse it's gonna help you draw the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.650 
the reverse it's gonna help you draw the
ball<00:00:46.590> or<00:00:46.770> turn<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> ball<00:00:47.190> over<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.820> far<00:00:48.450> though

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
ball or turn the ball over so far though

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.650 
ball or turn the ball over so far though

let's<00:01:16.510> just<00:01:16.720> add<00:01:17.050> half<00:01:17.530> of<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:17.740> Grail<00:01:17.920> off<00:01:18.160> see

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
let's just add half of the Grail off see

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.660 
let's just add half of the Grail off see
how<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:19.000> goes<00:01:19.240> just<00:01:19.390> start<00:01:20.040> maybe<00:01:21.040> moving

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
how that goes just start maybe moving

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.740 
how that goes just start maybe moving
the<00:01:21.760> slider<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.210> get<00:01:22.330> little<00:01:22.480> more<00:01:22.540> tow

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
the slider and get little more tow

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.640 
the slider and get little more tow
waited<00:01:23.080> for<00:01:23.290> me<00:01:23.410> yeah<00:01:23.860> I<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:25.600> to<00:01:25.810> know<00:01:26.200> my<00:01:26.380> way

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
waited for me yeah I like to know my way

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.930 
waited for me yeah I like to know my way
to<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.860> toe<00:01:26.980> of<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.160> club<00:01:27.220> help

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
to the toe of the club help

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.340 
to the toe of the club help
just<00:01:28.270> pull<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.480> toe<00:01:28.690> down<00:01:28.870> a<00:01:28.900> little<00:01:29.020> bit<00:01:29.170> to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
just pull the toe down a little bit to

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.610 
just pull the toe down a little bit to
take<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.560> little<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:29.860> look<00:01:29.980> out<00:01:30.190> so<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:32.350> bring<00:01:32.560> it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
take a little to look out so to bring it

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.620 
take a little to look out so to bring it
even<00:01:33.460> more<00:01:33.640> okay

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
even more okay

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.600 
even more okay
as<00:01:34.810> we<00:01:35.170> move<00:01:35.380> it<00:01:35.500> further<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.100> further<00:01:36.280> toward

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
as we move it further and further toward

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.330 
as we move it further and further toward
the<00:01:36.940> toe<00:01:37.480> it's<00:01:37.750> gonna<00:01:37.870> lower<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.260> a<00:01:38.350> lot<00:01:38.530> this

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
the toe it's gonna lower it a lot this

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.300 
the toe it's gonna lower it a lot this
the<00:01:39.730> CG<00:01:40.120> as<00:01:40.240> it<00:01:40.390> gets<00:01:40.540> it<00:01:40.750> towards<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.200> toe<00:01:41.440> it

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
the CG as it gets it towards the toe it

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.090 
the CG as it gets it towards the toe it
actually<00:01:42.700> moves<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.060> higher<00:01:43.360> so<00:01:43.830> you<00:01:44.830> see<00:01:44.980> how

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
actually moves it higher so you see how

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.400 
actually moves it higher so you see how
that<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.880> slider<00:01:46.180> is<00:01:46.420> getting<00:01:46.720> higher<00:01:47.050> on<00:01:47.320> the

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
that the slider is getting higher on the

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.740 
that the slider is getting higher on the
head<00:01:47.560> so<00:01:48.490> that's<00:01:48.670> gonna<00:01:48.850> lower<00:01:49.240> your<00:01:49.510> launch

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
head so that's gonna lower your launch

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:58.980 
head so that's gonna lower your launch
slightly<00:01:57.270> alright<00:01:58.270> what<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.810> dramatic

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
slightly alright what a dramatic

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.740 
slightly alright what a dramatic
difference<00:01:59.440> eh<00:01:59.890> yeah<00:02:00.310> yeah<00:02:01.210> I<00:02:01.240> wouldn't<00:02:01.600> mind

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
difference eh yeah yeah I wouldn't mind
