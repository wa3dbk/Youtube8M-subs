00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.200
 when 

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:12.189
 now one 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.529
 in addition, such a group teacher receives from a group 4 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.070
 but also once again won in ermelo 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.380
 what i only like is for the method looks hunter 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.439
 you do not have 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:31.319
 the book 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.319
 more to work also in one or a book 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.010
 and that works too, it is full of all kinds of recognizable situations 9 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.670
 From here the traffic actually falls through it is the real feedback 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.840
 jeep to their own 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.650
 the world of experience 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.920
 and that they also know very in syria we count for their i brand 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.920
 just that that's also the involvement of height 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.680
 not very nice the first part but now starts 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.680
 It is a very concrete situation that you play TV shop or whatever 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.310
 and that then see for himself how it happened his head of intel's what coke 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.120
 very good find is that standing are doing a lot themselves 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.710
 I think it is eh 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.280
 are actually a book 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.590
 so if you explain that they work in the work block 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.760
 and they are watching and otherwise their swimsuit is most careful 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.640
 you start with explanation 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.240
 and then 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.229
 yes and then they can still be next to the decrease but now no more employees with 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.420
 you up 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.370
 and i notice it for kids in this time 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.020
 just went really well 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.070
 traders 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.070
 meter traders actually you are here 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.590
 what i like is that it just looks very good so when they 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.020
 started with the tables ordinary then they have laid with rolling papers 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.610
 folding leaves 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.860
 so they are very busy with three times four and four times three in their opinion 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 it for yourself and then you still get more insight into it 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.369
 in his child's and that it actually means 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.689
 first I thought of but very difficult because you are still free 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:19.949
 taken into account 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.999
 measures to compromise safety and 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.999
 in addition to the automation of way too fast 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:29.829
 I wish them very much 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:30.889
 creative 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.269
 also no actually also the children who get a bit difficult 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.909
 hilarity 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.029
 for example i have a girl in class and 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.029
 she has difficulty calculating 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:44.739
 m 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.900
 yes i did not notice that she reacts very nicely to age what she said i 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.900
 find it difficult to count but now I really like it 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.010
 because they have a lot of variety type highest it is not wrong during sitting 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:04.819
 this and another fine taste 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.819
 just very varied 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.129
 that they are again very concerned because I thought how this is really far more 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.640
 Orange can be very difficult for the children because of it 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.669
 yes I get a very good result from the result 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.689
 and that is something about the first vital and 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.229
 this was really a very well done job 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.229
 and the second shooter is also very well done 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.939
 and you get a keys and 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.279
 and that is very short 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:36.519
 six children 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.640
 they are only concentrated for a short period to the north 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.359
 not very very long to do is that will be very beneficial also for the weaker 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.469
 pupils 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.179
 but I found it too 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:51.519
 and behind the computer also very handy because your filter set a and 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.319
 the same child made a mistake from students' direction 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.319
 I have it ready in no time 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.179
 also because you 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:03.579
 with a lot of concrete material but works with an egg box 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.929
 and with the nos the balls 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:09.070
 They can also see the difference between years 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.070
 in total structure 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:18.329
 and I think it is a very pleasant way you can not quickly feel like it 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.059
 it seems to keep beautiful 

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:22.069
 it's for kids learning 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:26.520
 finding things very difficult and having a good overview of them is a cup competition 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.520
 can get 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:34.679
 yes they are going to be home what is nice about is that the two rear the 

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:36.900
 exactly and last restart 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.939
 what they have learned and how 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:43.969
 and I find it very pleasant for the parents but my father is like a child 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.610
 find it difficult they can always see how that is offered 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.460
 is brought to light 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.460
 you can also explain it in a worthy way 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.650
 the instruction is very short 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.059
 above and 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.469
 the little ones are so clear 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.629
 that the children actually do 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:06.979
 who had 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.439
 year difficult for a country to have some trouble reading and story to it 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:11.490
 beginning of the year 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.129
 can manage very well 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:16.020
 and always be able to understand 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.809
 and she doesn't understand well too 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:20.809
 that is very well visualized 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.319
 not because they 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.680
 the medicine nothing more 3 I like that 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.340
 because first set 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.870
 8 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.870
 certainly not if your interest beijing 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.839
 he is that is 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:42.990
 the good food takes into account the great fun they are 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.009
 sony 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.400
 the social rent 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.029
 the method 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:49.139
 to do together 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.509
 for the city chinatown group left at the beginning of the year as i have 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.240
 quite difficult month time that is not childish and nothing at all 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.340
 and not rise 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.990
 I get it better and better because I like the whole process more and more 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.240
 give way 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.100
 well I have been pretty well known a pity three children play that 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.379
 not placed you either etc 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:17.400
 it seems earlier 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.400
 lelystad i get all our church rkk 

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:31.580
 the 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.979
 the
