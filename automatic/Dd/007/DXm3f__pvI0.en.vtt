00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
the horse does nothing just stays in

the horse does nothing just stays in
town<00:03:51.590> scared<00:03:51.950> -<00:03:52.070> totally<00:03:52.430> ignores<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:52.940> that

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
town scared - totally ignores you that

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.670 
town scared - totally ignores you that
tends<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.630> happen<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.959> lot<00:03:53.989> of<00:03:54.200> operations

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
tends to happen a lot of operations

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.130 
tends to happen a lot of operations
because<00:03:54.769> they're<00:03:54.980> huntin<00:03:55.280> every<00:03:55.519> whatever<00:03:56.140> so

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
because they're huntin every whatever so

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.920 
because they're huntin every whatever so
that's<00:03:57.260> why<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:57.530> have<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.430> whip<00:03:58.610> -<00:03:58.930> something

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
that's why I have the whip - something

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.509 
that's why I have the whip - something
probably<00:04:00.320> not<00:04:00.739> required<00:04:01.100> if<00:04:01.310> you're<00:04:01.400> on<00:04:01.489> a

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
probably not required if you're on a

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.979 
probably not required if you're on a
thoroughbred<00:04:01.850> or<00:04:02.239> something<00:04:02.570> kind<00:04:02.690> of<00:04:02.810> hot

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
thoroughbred or something kind of hot

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.040 
thoroughbred or something kind of hot
because<00:04:03.380> it's<00:04:03.560> already<00:04:03.680> gonna<00:04:03.980> be

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
because it's already gonna be

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.140 
because it's already gonna be
kind<00:04:07.050> of<00:04:07.170> thing<00:04:07.350> so<00:04:07.650> don't<00:04:08.340> do<00:04:08.610> that<00:04:08.670> you've

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
kind of thing so don't do that you've

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.820 
kind of thing so don't do that you've
got<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.480> do<00:04:09.570> something<00:04:09.900> really<00:04:10.020> subtle<00:04:10.350> and

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
got to do something really subtle and

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.450 
got to do something really subtle and
really<00:04:11.280> easy<00:04:11.490> to<00:04:11.700> respect<00:04:12.210> how<00:04:12.570> they<00:04:12.750> learn

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
really easy to respect how they learn

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.740 
really easy to respect how they learn
because<00:04:14.460> I<00:04:14.490> only<00:04:14.880> want<00:04:15.090> expressions<00:04:15.660> right

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
because I only want expressions right

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.900 
because I only want expressions right
now<00:04:15.960> that's<00:04:16.709> that's<00:04:17.010> kind<00:04:17.459> of<00:04:17.489> why<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.700> whips

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
now that's that's kind of why the whips

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.670 
now that's that's kind of why the whips
in<00:04:18.060> my<00:04:18.150> strategy<00:04:18.720> because<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.230> know<00:04:19.320> that

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
in my strategy because I know that

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.840 
in my strategy because I know that
that's<00:04:19.800> they're<00:04:20.220> going<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.400> ignore<00:04:20.610> it<00:04:20.790> and

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
that's they're going to ignore it and

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.750 
that's they're going to ignore it and
just<00:04:20.940> be<00:04:21.090> like<00:04:21.120> whatever<00:04:21.440> um<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:23.250> yeah<00:04:23.400> if<00:04:23.580> they

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
just be like whatever um so yeah if they

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.280 
just be like whatever um so yeah if they
they're<00:04:24.210> ignoring<00:04:24.510> me<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:24.960> got<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.140> do

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
they're ignoring me you got to do

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.630 
they're ignoring me you got to do
something<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.710> make<00:04:25.830> them<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.070> little<00:04:26.190> hot<00:04:26.460> to
