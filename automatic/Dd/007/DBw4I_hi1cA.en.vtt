gorgeous and what I actually plan on
doing<00:02:11.489> after<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.819> get<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.090> couple<00:02:12.330> wares<00:02:12.599> out<00:02:12.810> of

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
doing after I get a couple wares out of

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.309 
doing after I get a couple wares out of
her

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
her

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.979 
her
I'm<00:02:13.769> actually<00:02:14.099> going<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.730> go<00:02:14.909> in<00:02:15.239> on<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.689> roots

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
I'm actually going to go in on the roots

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.660 
I'm actually going to go in on the roots
and<00:02:16.409> since<00:02:17.069> she<00:02:17.639> is<00:02:17.879> not<00:02:18.439> human<00:02:19.439> hair<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.519> know

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
and since she is not human hair you know

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.059 
and since she is not human hair you know
she<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.909> that<00:02:21.239> feature<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.780> fiber<00:02:22.139> which<00:02:22.829> means

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
she is that feature of fiber which means

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.589 
she is that feature of fiber which means
you<00:02:23.189> can<00:02:23.340> obviously<00:02:23.700> curl<00:02:24.120> her<00:02:24.389> and

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
you can obviously curl her and

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.679 
you can obviously curl her and
everything<00:02:25.019> like<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:26.120> cannot<00:02:27.120> die<00:02:27.420> her

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
everything like that you cannot die her

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.349 
everything like that you cannot die her
so<00:02:28.139> I'm<00:02:28.920> gonna<00:02:29.159> take<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.519> black<00:02:29.879> permanent

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
so I'm gonna take a black permanent
