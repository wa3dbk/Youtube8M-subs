00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hello dear friends with you I am Yuri 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.990
 Axenov is a gameplay review on a new 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.340
 a game from zeptolab called 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.280
 tink fev 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.590
 king of thieves a lot of games with similar 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.360
 title but let's see what 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.390
 this game is to allocate well firstly how are you 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.250
 already understood hail creators rob rob and that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.320
 but they have prepared for us 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.150
 probably right away I suggest looking at 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.789
 gameplay and then I will tell you about 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.369
 the nuances that are present in this game 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.779
 there is a huge world there are many missions 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.510
 which you will need to pass 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.489
 specifically 80 level of this game 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.600
 present by the way the game has become available 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.809
 not google play 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.079
 and in the amazon appstore completely without 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.260
 problems it is installed through 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.239
 the application is so peculiar 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.430
 hardcore platformer runner by type 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.289
 geometry dash numbers just not on 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.440
 planes in such a small 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.660
 surround room and so before 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.640
 hack this or that level you 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.829
 it will be necessary to open the lock you 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.290
 there are 10 master keys they are generated 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.210
 every certain length of time and 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.640
 you need to guess right now 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.189
 the first time was able to guess all what 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.360
 lock needs to be opened and now our 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.930
 the task to go and get to the chest 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.939
 which we have at the very end 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.920
 level if you lose then you 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.369
 losing lives start accordingly 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.530
 the level of the very beginning and the first mission 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.710
 Naturally they will be very simple, but 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.600
 already follow will call you 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 some difficulties and for example this one 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.130
 the mission is not as easy as it can 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.049
 seem at first sight from the first 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.950
 I don’t know if I’m going to go through 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.600
 or not, we will now see 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.420
 No, unfortunately it does not work, but in general 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.729
 the point of the game is precisely this 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.710
 that is, we are in a certain 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.649
 dungeon in a certain castle 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.549
 which we actually need 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.750
 study in order to pass and 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.189
 get to the treasure chest 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.340
 supplies we get we get 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.950
 reward crystals gems money 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.860
 naturally and open the way to 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.280
 the next 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.250
 level but in general it is part of the game for those 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.440
 who likes to go through the plot of the game company 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.330
 and so on also gradually we will 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.730
 open different caves here 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.890
 actually my cave now after that 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.960
 how to determine tours name will open 2 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.660
 cave let's see what we have 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.700
 in a home cave here we can also 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.620
 exhibit various here such 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.050
 obstacles can improve them 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.200
 rearrange and so on hire 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.990
 patrolling monsters can them also 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.990
 improve reroute and their movements in 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.690
 Generally do anything to others 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.890
 it was difficult for players to steal from us 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.489
 anything 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.830
 farther farther we can collect 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.110
 special gizmos are leaves 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.180
 mushrooms as ultraviolet you pollen 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.459
 snake eyes and 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.060
 from this we can craft various 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.340
 costumes that have different well 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.310
 not power up a mea extra 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.500
 abilities like more gold you 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.450
 will receive or something like that 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.030
 then you can connect to facebook 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.400
 and help your friends help you 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.739
 more accurately call friends 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.019
 then there are missions that you are doing 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.340
 will get extra crystal 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.049
 checks further you have a security log 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.170
 here you can see who you are 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.000
 attacked and can take revenge on him as well 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.580
 you can just attack absolutely 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.830
 random player on his friend 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.610
 acquaintance and so on here now I 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.799
 I will try to attack the offender but to 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.440
 Sorry for the time being to attack him 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.140
 can not be because there is no network it 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.200
 very strange in general, such is the part 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.180
 games attend toy new in 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.730
 principle interesting but from 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.010
 the only thing that is probably sad is that 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.370
 there are these keys here 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.820
 which are very quickly spent due 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.579
 it turns out to play the game very and 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.729
 I would like very little of course 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.700
 longer plunge into this gameplay 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.820
 but unfortunately time for us to play 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.920
 given very, very 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.810
 there is little to rob others 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.850
 players to get these 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.670
 here are the crystals that we can put 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.960
 to our totem and through a certain 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.540
 time interval 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.490
 this totem will generate another 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.250
 crystals will accordingly enhance our 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.690
 rating for which rating is needed in order 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.490
 to borrow on your own 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.040
 certain place in the league let's 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.500
 Now look where I am now, I 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.050
 I am on the 11th place despite the fact that 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.580
 not much else played but that's all because 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.240
 that the game is new 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.440
 and there are not many players in the game yet 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.090
 present 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.160
 discovering more precisely getting into one or another 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.130
 part of the league you get a certain 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.340
 reward therefore there is an incentive to grow and 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:16.440
 evolve but still donat pretty 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:19.680
 interferes and because of this play all the same 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.920
 it becomes very sad because 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.640
 I want to go through the mission yet but the keys are not 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.950
 enough and donat pity and it's somehow 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.800
 tear but in general it is a toy 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.190
 You can certainly see the laurels 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.680
 coder on this game will not be able to beat 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.220
 because cut the rope is really 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.860
 masterpiece is our all but in principle arcade 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.830
 I think there is not quite a checkpoint 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.950
 there are fans of this game that the game 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.420
 really like who will want 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.570
 improve your dungeon make it 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.090
 really over protected to 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.790
 no one could rob him in general here 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.160
 Such is the toy from the zip the lab in 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.320
 In principle, the original of course is 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.710
 similar games but that it was 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.280
 Combined in one thing I personally do not 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.330
 saw 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.940
 Of course I expected a little bit of another 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.880
 Of course Donat would like less 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.770
 you can play and as I said think 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.960
 many should like the game 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.910
 in general, this is my opinion to everyone 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.010
 thank you very much for your attention do not forget 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:31.490
 subscribe to channel put finger 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.490
 up under the video all bye and good luck
