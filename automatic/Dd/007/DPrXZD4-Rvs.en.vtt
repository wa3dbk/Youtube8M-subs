00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
playing artificial intelligence you're

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.580 
playing artificial intelligence you're
playing<00:02:45.430> live<00:02:46.000> opponent<00:02:46.420> which<00:02:46.930> acts<00:02:47.290> more

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
playing live opponent which acts more

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.940 
playing live opponent which acts more
quickly<00:02:48.720> changes<00:02:49.720> strategies<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.560> on<00:02:50.739> of

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
quickly changes strategies and so on of

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.030 
quickly changes strategies and so on of
course<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.640> know<00:02:51.760> if<00:02:51.970> one<00:02:52.150> plays<00:02:52.390> good<00:02:52.600> enough

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
course you know if one plays good enough

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.500 
course you know if one plays good enough
but<00:02:54.040> thanks<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.550> this<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:55.000> game<00:02:55.239> in

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
but thanks to this this game in

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.449 
but thanks to this this game in
multiplayer<00:02:56.080> mode<00:02:56.500> becomes<00:02:56.980> even<00:02:57.430> more

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
multiplayer mode becomes even more

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.979 
multiplayer mode becomes even more
frantic<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.600> really<00:02:59.200> fast<00:02:59.470> paced<00:03:00.989> another

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
frantic and really fast paced another

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.400 
frantic and really fast paced another
also<00:03:02.260> important<00:03:03.010> thing<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.519> that<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:04.840> really<00:03:05.049> I

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
also important thing is that we really I

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.500 
also important thing is that we really I
believe<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:06.010> can<00:03:06.040> say<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.640> looks<00:03:06.880> really<00:03:07.239> really

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
believe I can say it looks really really

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.750 
believe I can say it looks really really
good<00:03:07.540> as<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.380> know<00:03:08.500> as<00:03:08.830> on<00:03:09.040> mobile<00:03:09.730> devices

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
good as you know as on mobile devices

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.650 
good as you know as on mobile devices
this<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:10.720> passport<00:03:11.170> by<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.860> way<00:03:12.209> because<00:03:13.209> we

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
this is I passport by the way because we

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.880 
this is I passport by the way because we
put<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.830> lot<00:03:15.010> of<00:03:15.040> intention<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:16.890> technology

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
put a lot of intention to technology

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.890 
put a lot of intention to technology
that<00:03:18.430> means<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:19.570> game<00:03:19.959> is<00:03:21.209> for<00:03:22.209> example<00:03:22.720> this

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
that means this game is for example this

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.220 
that means this game is for example this
scene<00:03:23.290> has<00:03:23.470> as<00:03:24.040> many<00:03:24.220> polygons<00:03:24.880> as<00:03:25.090> average<00:03:25.570> PC

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
scene has as many polygons as average PC

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.500 
scene has as many polygons as average PC
seen<00:03:26.590> in<00:03:26.829> 3d<00:03:27.070> so<00:03:28.860> we<00:03:29.860> need<00:03:30.100> really<00:03:30.700> powerful

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
seen in 3d so we need really powerful

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.070 
seen in 3d so we need really powerful
GPUs<00:03:32.110> to<00:03:32.380> run<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.739> game<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.910> ipad<00:03:34.660> 4<00:03:35.019> or

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
GPUs to run the game so ipad 4 or

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.120 
GPUs to run the game so ipad 4 or
or<00:03:36.170> Nexus<00:03:37.160> 7<00:03:37.610> those<00:03:37.880> are<00:03:38.090> powerful<00:03:39.130> devices

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
or Nexus 7 those are powerful devices

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.210 
or Nexus 7 those are powerful devices
enough<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:40.850> run<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.210> game<00:03:41.390> but<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:42.220> older

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
enough to run the game but the older

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.820 
enough to run the game but the older
ones<00:03:43.520> probably<00:03:44.360> will<00:03:45.230> not<00:03:46.750> have<00:03:47.750> enough<00:03:48.170> GPU

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
ones probably will not have enough GPU

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.580 
ones probably will not have enough GPU
power<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.280> run<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.460> game<00:03:49.760> so<00:03:50.570> we're<00:03:51.140> making

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
power to run the game so we're making

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.620 
power to run the game so we're making
something<00:03:51.920> you<00:03:52.520> know<00:03:52.640> next-generation

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
something you know next-generation

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.990 
something you know next-generation
thingy<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:57.130> you<00:03:58.130> know<00:03:58.250> we<00:03:58.490> have<00:03:58.640> single

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
thingy and you know we have single

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.330 
thingy and you know we have single
player<00:03:59.210> campaign<00:03:59.690> we<00:03:59.900> have<00:04:00.080> multiplayer<00:04:00.800> we

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
player campaign we have multiplayer we

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.880 
player campaign we have multiplayer we
have<00:04:01.550> really<00:04:02.300> tough<00:04:02.540> modern<00:04:03.080> graphics<00:04:03.350> and

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
have really tough modern graphics and

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.700 
have really tough modern graphics and
this<00:04:04.550> is<00:04:04.730> why<00:04:04.940> I<00:04:05.360> can<00:04:05.750> easily<00:04:06.230> call<00:04:06.500> this

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
this is why I can easily call this

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.000 
this is why I can easily call this
mobile<00:04:07.370> triple-a<00:04:07.940> now<00:04:08.540> we<00:04:09.260> are<00:04:09.380> almost<00:04:09.650> done

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
mobile triple-a now we are almost done

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.199 
mobile triple-a now we are almost done
with<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:11.270> porting<00:04:11.810> so<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.710> big<00:04:13.130> problem<00:04:14.030> now

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
with the porting so the big problem now

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.170 
with the porting so the big problem now
is<00:04:14.240> to<00:04:14.750> make<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.200> game<00:04:15.440> smooth<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.700> mean

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
is to make the game smooth I mean

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.349 
is to make the game smooth I mean
running<00:04:17.720> smooth<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:18.830> we're<00:04:19.580> doing<00:04:20.060> the

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
running smooth so we're doing the

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.100 
running smooth so we're doing the
optimization<00:04:21.230> so<00:04:21.980> I<00:04:22.310> guess<00:04:22.490> we<00:04:23.090> are<00:04:23.240> about<00:04:23.600> two

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
optimization so I guess we are about two

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.160 
optimization so I guess we are about two
months<00:04:24.320> away<00:04:25.310> from<00:04:26.440> releasing<00:04:27.440> on<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.770> market
