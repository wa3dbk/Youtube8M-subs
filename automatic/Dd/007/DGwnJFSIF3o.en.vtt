00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.000 
why I have those is because if you add
that<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.640> oils<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.360> your<00:02:06.540> water<00:02:06.870> you<00:02:07.770> can

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
that the oils to your water you can

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.070 
that the oils to your water you can
actually<00:02:08.220> send<00:02:08.820> your<00:02:09.060> towels<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.840> if<00:02:09.960> you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
actually send your towels so if you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.950 
actually send your towels so if you
wanted<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.470> add<00:02:10.649> say<00:02:11.040> some<00:02:11.340> lemon<00:02:12.120> grass<00:02:12.360> or

to scent your towels or some lavender

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.600 
to scent your towels or some lavender

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.580 
like this I prefer not to use plastic in
the<00:03:03.090> heater<00:03:03.330> because<00:03:03.630> when<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.080> heat<00:03:04.260> up<00:03:04.380> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
the heater because when you heat up the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.820 
the heater because when you heat up the
oil<00:03:04.770> in<00:03:05.400> plastic<00:03:05.970> it's<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.690> about<00:03:07.320> some<00:03:07.739> of

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
oil in plastic it's just about some of

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.680 
oil in plastic it's just about some of
the<00:03:07.920> transference<00:03:08.520> depending<00:03:09.270> on<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.450> kind

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
the transference depending on the kind

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.199 
the transference depending on the kind
of<00:03:09.780> plastic<00:03:10.050> bottle<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.650> you're<00:03:10.890> using<00:03:11.209> so

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
of plastic bottle that you're using so

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.320 
of plastic bottle that you're using so

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
temperature of the stone should probably

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.100 
temperature of the stone should probably
be<00:03:53.060> about<00:03:53.180> 120<00:03:54.170> degrees<00:03:54.290> between<00:03:55.360> 120<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:56.510> 130

feel as though it's too hot you just

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.080 
feel as though it's too hot you just
plunge<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.630> hot<00:04:05.810> stone<00:04:06.200> just<00:04:07.099> very<00:04:07.549> briefly

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
plunge the hot stone just very briefly

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.890 
plunge the hot stone just very briefly
into<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:09.230> bowl<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.950> cold<00:04:10.250> water<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:10.849> that<00:04:10.910> will

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
into a bowl of cold water and that will

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.990
