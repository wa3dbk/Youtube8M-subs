00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.480 

it's<00:03:16.050> important<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.470> change<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:16.920> oil<00:03:17.040> in<00:03:17.220> the

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
it's important to change the oil in the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.280 
it's important to change the oil in the
engine<00:03:17.520> because<00:03:18.560> after<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.860> while<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:22.260> oil

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
engine because after a while the oil

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.720 
engine because after a while the oil
degrades<00:03:23.930> then<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.110> oil<00:03:25.320> stops<00:03:25.650> doing<00:03:26.520> its

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
degrades then the oil stops doing its

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.720 
degrades then the oil stops doing its
purpose<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:28.500> purpose<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.980> lubricating

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
purpose and that purpose is lubricating

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.380 
purpose and that purpose is lubricating
the<00:03:29.810> cylinder<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.140> piston<00:03:31.320> in<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.130> cylinder

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
the cylinder the piston in the cylinder

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.990 
the cylinder the piston in the cylinder
the<00:03:33.390> valve<00:03:33.600> tree<00:03:34.190> along<00:03:35.190> with<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.580> crankshaft

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
the valve tree along with the crankshaft

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.780 
the valve tree along with the crankshaft
the<00:03:36.720> connecting<00:03:37.200> rod<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.440> all<00:03:37.740> that<00:03:37.950> if<00:03:38.640> you

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
the connecting rod and all that if you

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.810 
the connecting rod and all that if you
don't<00:03:38.940> change<00:03:39.630> royal<00:03:40.080> then<00:03:40.920> what<00:03:41.070> happen<00:03:41.670> is

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
don't change royal then what happen is

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.260 
don't change royal then what happen is
the<00:03:42.330> engine<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.750> overheat<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.560> seize<00:03:44.030> up<00:03:45.030> or

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
the engine to overheat and seize up or

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.340 
the engine to overheat and seize up or
parts<00:03:46.230> wear<00:03:46.530> out<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.100> engine<00:03:47.370> will<00:03:47.490> smoke

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
parts wear out and the engine will smoke

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.800 
parts wear out and the engine will smoke
so<00:03:49.400> if<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.610> look<00:03:50.760> on<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.030> engine<00:03:51.330> there's<00:03:51.660> an

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
so if you look on the engine there's an

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.680 
so if you look on the engine there's an
oil<00:03:51.959> plug<00:03:52.650> right<00:03:52.860> there<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.520> there's<00:03:54.450> one<00:03:54.540> on

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
oil plug right there and there's one on

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.020 
oil plug right there and there's one on
the<00:03:54.930> other<00:03:54.959> side<00:03:55.610> so<00:03:56.610> what<00:03:56.730> I'm<00:03:56.790> going<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:56.940> do

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
the other side so what I'm going to do

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.120 
the other side so what I'm going to do
is<00:03:57.209> going<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.450> slowly<00:03:57.810> add<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.470> oil<00:04:01.130> let's

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
is going to slowly add the oil let's

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.170 
is going to slowly add the oil let's
slowly<00:04:02.400> add<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.760> oil<00:04:03.290> till<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.560> starts<00:04:05.180> coming
