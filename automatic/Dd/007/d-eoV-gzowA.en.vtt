00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.519
 hi i am alessandra and today we are here in 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.690
 james academy in reggio emilia per 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.010
 propose you to present a movement 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.250
 created with the new generation irons 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.039
 curly holidays hair active red 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.980
 in this case on eleonora we must 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.989
 definitely prepare a texture thing 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.899
 means means giving body and giving 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.690
 fill a little those that are 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.739
 tip the lengths the tips because she 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.469
 it has a very light color on the tips 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.530
 so to have the same volume the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.199
 same root texture at the tips we have 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.510
 need to increase with products 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.120
 styling we will use a product of 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.309
 sebastian as a trainer then 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.840
 especially on the tips where the hair 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.850
 this is clearer for own for 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.760
 report the same root porosity 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.100
 rendesse punge so it is very important 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.610
 distribute the product well over all 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.610
 hair pull out is very comfortable 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 massaged 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:30.360
 and intended this on all hair a 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.520
 great what every time we deliver 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.700
 the product on the hair we always have to 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.750
 comb the comb by combing them there 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.330
 helps to bring the product back to all 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.090
 hair evenly clearly 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.680
 we will insist more where the hair is 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.869
 they are much clearer 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.960
 precisely because it gives us a way to have more 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:58.820
 allowed once well distributed 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.820
 potion limelight of sebastian 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.369
 dry the hair lightly with the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.369
 phon 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.870
 here at this point we apply the 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.790
 real texture 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.030
 hence the strong mousse in this case 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.340
 always of the line of sebastien in three 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.459
 then the front sections of the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.569
 rear 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:43.650
 we create more or less 3 strands of lard 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:47.000
 cm and begin to apply the mousse 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.000
 colossal sebastian 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.360
 equally on root point lengths 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.380
 it is very important that the mousse then or 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.120
 any product you use 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.190
 that you decide to use depending on 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.510
 hair of the sebastian line is 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.510
 very important for distribution 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.240
 own of the head of the product on hair 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.230
 from root to length to falls 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:27.240
 at this point we do nothing but 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.240
 dry your hair completely 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.820
 from the excess of me 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.300
 I want to listen 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.300
 is 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.859
 well at this point we have 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.709
 completely dried hair and 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.659
 we begin to divide them into sectors for 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.969
 then all to realize we make 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:57.980
 sectors about 3 cm ads 23 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.379
 centimeters depending on even more than the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.909
 quantity of hair we have then 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.680
 of the mass of hair we have 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.680
 quite accurate 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.750
 and we start to work the hair from the 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.750
 rear 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.210
 we await the lock does not retire 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.750
 excessively and discreetly towards 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:31.400
 we here the correct position this 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.400
 insert the iron in this way 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.730
 always keeping the same in mind 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.500
 distance to all the strands from the 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.490
 root at the beginning of the first 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.660
 ripple we keep clean 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.340
 let's slide the iron we make you 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.140
 let out the iron we wait slightly 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.740
 let the lock go in tension 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.990
 let it cool down once created 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.160
 two sections 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.580
 let's go on two sections in two 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.580
 sections we do nothing but 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:06.030
 start brushing in this case 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.910
 we will use the maison to brush the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.870
 our shadows 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.540
 to position them and try to fix them 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.840
 manually the second one right in the 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.480
 formulation we want 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:24.880
 we fix the first surgeries with 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.590
 sebastian the zero gravity we try to 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.900
 fit together just using this stern e 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:34.030
 the waves inside each other and the 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.030
 we fix with zero gravity shelter 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.290
 let's continue 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:14.490
 now all we have to do is fix our own 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.510
 waves with a light product but be it 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.680
 sheen 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.990
 to the rains you highlight 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.960
 in this case we use trilliant of 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:32.370
 sebastian gives us a fixative effect 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:32.370
 bright and slightly more natural 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:54.330
 we are going to break the waves a little and ea 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.330
 give a more natural, more glamorous effect 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:07:01.289
 together with this product the 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.289
 trilliant 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.900
 and this is the final result 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.900
 thanks to the next
