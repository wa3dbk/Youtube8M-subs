00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 in practice, it is very difficult to do so, so you can develop a 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.410
 matrix about a past event 3 then sources develop it about events 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.050
 future 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.230
 because it is simply a past event that has not happened 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.679
 it still shines 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.750
 we do not know what to look for a matrix about the future that would not want macri 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.769
 there is the shadows limitation there was a lot of vision 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.550
 mm x 5 meters what we see is only the tip of the iceberg melilla I do not think that 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.140
 we still have not been able 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.399
 discover systematically 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:34.469
 all the different aspects of how 80 copies of that is confiscated 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.710
 is that there is a complete description of the cuckold and if we do not just take a look 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.530
 followed by another there 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.970
 I defend bilbao if you believe in the bible and in its prophecies the arrasatearras of 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.440
 a period of time called 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.250
 end of time or the end of days and good that is about the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.410
 most interesting battle between good and evil in the world which presented 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.410
 much interest nor terrorism the virus that is rs 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.760
 and other viruses and designs and colors all this is an indication that things 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.430
 bad that happen 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.370
 2 notwithstanding that the product 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.860
 and the bible that says 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.930
 that all those evil or devilish things are going to happen to me as he related 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.660
 in turkey I have biblical codes only corroborates that message to work 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.330
 external them 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.250
 that entity there is a whole tradition of specific requests about the end of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.640
 world in which it is 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.909
 and now the end of the days is of course a good and bad news is 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.630
 bad news if you are wrong as and good news if you are right 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.960
 pÃ©rez with this I mean what the end of the world means 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.060
 it's just that the world as it is can not always continue like this 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.200
 that is the concept 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.870
 asobal is actually a pretty important idea because if you think everything 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.479
 will continue like this you will always never try to change anything we will never understand 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.789
 transform it codes and projections are an invitation to 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.920
 participate in the creation of the future 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.970
 in chipping decision 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.900
 many of the sequences that refer to the end of the days the plan the 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.920
 middle East 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.030
 it is feared that it will become worse I made a matrix on this subject in hand 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.620
 westwood I found about six terms of good air that point to that 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.380
 probably nothing happens in any very good test at least in my 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.380
 opinion the money towards the end of the year 4707 the battering efficiency that 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.810
 could be in the auditorium of two banks located in cherÃ¡n 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.699
 Jun 19 If you know the prophecy and you know that in the end of the days as the end 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.859
 of the world the cermi is a period that lasts seven years the city begins with a 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:37.879
 peace treaty between Israel and the nations that surround him in 2010 although in 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.519
 reality says what are the peoples that sign the treaty but wrote 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.650
 since this peace treaty establishes that the lands of Israel are divided 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.079
 would be that the city of jerusalem is divided the bug and in return that 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.659
 encloses the sentra guaranteed peace 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.730
 fan of windows something similar to what we are seeing today with the group of 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:59.939
 four and its road map that the psdeg of the group of four is formed 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.180
 United States 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.050
 united nations onu the european union and russia I just gave 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.000
 they are developing a roadmap 6 to solve that problem 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.170
 of the Israelis and the Palestinians southeast of west goshen in that I find 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.770
 want what I just told does not sound like something like a peace treaty in which 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.330
 will create a Palestinian nation housing review I think following messi is 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.169
 This is where is 5770 the end of days 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:31.139
 that matrix is â€‹â€‹correct and the elections then I have tried peace will take place 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.139
 today in September or October 2003 v 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.969
 we believe or not in the comparison 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.729
 there is something true 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.639
 we will never know if the predictions of these hidden messages are true until 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.729
 that the events become history 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:48.729
 that's why we'll never know if the world is reaching its end 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.879
 now 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.819
 ansa
