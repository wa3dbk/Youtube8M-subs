00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.840 

imagine<00:00:00.840> that<00:00:00.989> each<00:00:01.260> toilet<00:00:01.829> paper<00:00:02.070> rule<00:00:02.429> roll

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
imagine that each toilet paper rule roll

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.820 
imagine that each toilet paper rule roll
there<00:00:03.179> install<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.899> paper<00:00:04.140> rule<00:00:04.440> is<00:00:04.920> his<00:00:06.830> one

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
there install the paper rule is his one

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.150 
there install the paper rule is his one
day<00:00:08.010> daily<00:00:08.990> then<00:00:09.990> we<00:00:10.200> have<00:00:10.290> two<00:00:10.710> billion

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
day daily then we have two billion

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.249 
day daily then we have two billion
children<00:00:11.219> below<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:11.969> age<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.210> 50<00:00:12.780> remember

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
children below the age of 50 remember

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.369 
children below the age of 50 remember
two<00:00:13.710> billion<00:00:14.099> they<00:00:14.519> are<00:00:14.610> there<00:00:14.820> zero<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.960> 50

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
two billion they are there zero to 50

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:41.090 
two billion they are there zero to 50
then<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.130> have<00:00:17.250> two<00:00:17.609> billion<00:00:18.060> between<00:00:18.420> 50<00:00:40.100> okay

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
then we have two billion between 50 okay

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.270 
then we have two billion between 50 okay
so<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:43.610> and<00:00:44.610> then<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.469> 1<00:00:46.469> 1<00:00:46.800> billion

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so here and then we have 1 1 billion

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.049 
so here and then we have 1 1 billion
which<00:00:47.850> between<00:00:48.329> 30<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.780> 45<00:00:49.260> 1<00:00:49.829> billion<00:00:50.070> 45<00:00:50.879> to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
which between 30 and 45 1 billion 45 to

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.250 
which between 30 and 45 1 billion 45 to
50<00:00:51.510> 60<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.440> then<00:00:52.710> migrate<00:00:53.219> 60<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.820> above<00:00:54.260> like

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
50 60 and then migrate 60 and above like

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.880 
50 60 and then migrate 60 and above like
this<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.190> disco<00:00:57.260> these<00:00:58.260> are<00:00:58.649> missing

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
this so this is disco these are missing

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.920 
this so this is disco these are missing
because<00:00:59.219> they<00:00:59.520> are<00:00:59.609> by<00:00:59.820> yes<00:01:00.359> there<00:01:00.539> was<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> high

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
because they are by yes there was a high

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.990 
because they are by yes there was a high
child<00:01:01.170> mortality<00:01:01.289> when<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> died<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.789> it's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
child mortality when I died but it's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.320 
child mortality when I died but it's
mainly<00:01:03.270> because<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.960> were<00:01:04.140> born<00:01:04.850> fuel<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
mainly because we were born fuel and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.300 
mainly because we were born fuel and
with<00:01:06.930> more<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.320> more<00:01:07.409> women<00:01:07.619> who<00:01:07.950> gave<00:01:08.130> birth

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
with more and more women who gave birth

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.910 
with more and more women who gave birth
even<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> fertility<00:01:09.540> rate<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.689> 40<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.710> got

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
even if the fertility rate was 40 we got

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.560 
even if the fertility rate was 40 we got
the<00:01:11.040> population<00:01:11.640> pyramid<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the population pyramid and then it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.270 
the population pyramid and then it
stopped<00:01:12.810> true<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> we'll<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:15.750> those<00:01:16.280> three

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
stopped true so we'll with those three

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
stopped true so we'll with those three
billion<00:01:17.549> B<00:01:17.909> because<00:01:18.299> they'd<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.630> living

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
billion B because they'd be living

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.700 
billion B because they'd be living
longer<00:01:19.619> now<00:01:20.390> we<00:01:21.390> would<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.720> 3<00:01:21.990> billion<00:01:22.470> even

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
longer now we would get 3 billion even

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.499 
longer now we would get 3 billion even
without<00:01:23.220> getting<00:01:23.700> more<00:01:23.880> children<00:01:24.330> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
without getting more children and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.420 
without getting more children and
without<00:01:25.049> living<00:01:25.290> longer<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.100> what<00:01:26.280> will

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
without living longer this is what will

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.870 
without living longer this is what will
happen<00:01:27.080> first<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.829> happens<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.579> group

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
happen first what happens to this group

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.870 
happen first what happens to this group
since<00:01:30.540> their<00:01:30.810> class<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> die<00:01:32.430> that's

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
since their class with a die that's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.149 
since their class with a die that's
right<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.810> done

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
right we done

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.569 
right we done
it's<00:01:35.939> good<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.509> don't<00:01:36.719> have<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:40.579> think

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
it's good that you don't have it I think

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.950 
it's good that you don't have it I think
they<00:01:41.729> were<00:01:41.789> very<00:01:41.909> good<00:01:42.329> teachers<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:44.960> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
they were very good teachers but the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.800 
they were very good teachers but the
rest<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.590> grow<00:01:46.619> 15<00:01:47.549> years<00:01:47.820> older<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.509> they<00:01:48.630> get

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
rest we grow 15 years older and they get

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.069 
rest we grow 15 years older and they get
2<00:01:49.049> billion<00:01:49.409> children<00:01:49.729> then<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:51.390> all<00:01:51.659> die<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
2 billion children then we all die and

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.289 
2 billion children then we all die and
the<00:01:55.079> rest<00:01:55.229> grow<00:01:55.590> 50<00:01:56.039> years<00:01:56.280> old<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:57.119> to

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the rest grow 50 years old I get to

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.819 
the rest grow 50 years old I get to
build<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.659> gym<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.810> this<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:01.200> died<00:02:01.470> and

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
build a gym and then this one died and

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.370 
build a gym and then this one died and
the<00:02:02.159> one<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:02.579> gets<00:02:02.880> 50<00:02:03.240> years<00:02:03.479> older<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.140> get

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the one one gets 50 years older and get

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:13.009 
the one one gets 50 years older and get
to<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.490> children<00:02:11.330> but<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.510> will<00:02:12.660> retire

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
to be the children but you will retire

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:24.080 
to be the children but you will retire
in<00:02:13.080> some<00:02:13.500> two<00:02:13.680> years<00:02:21.290> did<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.410> see<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:23.849> big

fella for adults it's inevitable it will

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.470 
fella for adults it's inevitable it will
add<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.709> three<00:02:29.069> billion<00:02:29.579> people<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.360> the

world population 2 to 3 you know that

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.610 
world population 2 to 3 you know that
this<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.180> wrong<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.599> not<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.110> it's<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.380> most

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
this is wrong is not but it's the most
