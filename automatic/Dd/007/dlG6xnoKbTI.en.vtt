00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 he is participating in it with us 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.790
 bringing the drawing technique pod you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.649
 I already knew people who did not know 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.269
 enjoying very easy people 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.610
 reminding you that you can apply various 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.179
 surfaces in acrylic plastic in the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.470
 glass and now we also show in the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.480
 fabric or fabric looks only to bury there 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.369
 our kitchen game, we have to 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.010
 do what the canopy plane is that with 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.720
 She 's part of the cup plan. 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.669
 and then I brought the sticker is ready 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.010
 what we just teach this 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.480
 thing I'll go over it then first 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.809
 People are going to pick up the fabric that we 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.750
 liked the print that will pass glue 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.670
 pet and even a question that year he 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.950
 but I have not told pet at home I can 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.050
 use white glue and a white bag that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.649
 home can not that it will get into action 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.690
 with the sticker and then it will crack everything 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.430
 So what's important has to be the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.840
 pet glue okay for you to have a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.329
 better quality 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.940
 I opened coca-cola pet everything in 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.840
 and ran and cut 30 of our 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.840
 plastic plate will pass the excluded 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.820
 Apply well 12 hours later it will be 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.340
 totally dry we'll take it 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.009
 from here to paste on any surface 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.799
 but in plastic we used a necklace 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.350
 and it takes off if it was a college right here 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.450
 our legitimate or new york city in the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.280
 Electric glass has no problem 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.030
 but in this case here we will roll 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.110
 he put the other one he will paste glued 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.090
 the sister 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.100
 there we will use it now in the fabric is 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.220
 easy we do not have like that like 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.350
 the stresses when remembering fabric is little 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.049
 So I'll use glue glue to say that. 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.360
 so stick our sticker on the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.360
 cloth we will pass cloth glue 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.719
 our companion chicken akita that the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.450
 Our voice kit is just cool. 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.450
 earn money and very cheap, right? 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.019
 and then you will use to put in to 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.970
 paste our chicken that in the dough 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:20.120
 our legal koplik plan is not the ball 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.200

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.019
 sauce 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.220
 us but there he not only that the 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.470
 using the product with the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.030
 people, because it reflects what the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.890
 because we end up not being able to 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.459
 whether or not it will work with the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.739
 other then I come here I get my to 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:44.480
