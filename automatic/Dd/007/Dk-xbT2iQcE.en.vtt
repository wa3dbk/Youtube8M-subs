00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello very good to all and good day 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.920
 Today I'm going to teach you how to play 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.019
 minecraft 1.6 points multiplayer online 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.180
 well first of all it was already a video 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.460
 previous I did an explanation of how 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.800
 download it install it and leave it ready 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.509
 to play then if they click on the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.429
 image pattern and gored the PND and 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.699
 corneÃ³ that will appear here to the 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:26.149
 left can go the good video let's go 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.149
 to execute 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.210
 and we wait for it to load we are going to put 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.510
 our username 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.110
 and then we give to play off line 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.550
 They will automatically start 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.550
 check the files and those things 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.430
 usually the first time it takes longer 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.810
 so do not be scared good as you see 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.000
 It is very similar to the versions 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.600
 previous and it's exactly the same 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.540
 we give the multiplayer add observen 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.100
 add observer server in English 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.170
 here we put the name that we want that 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.230
 the server appears 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.000
 that does not really matter and then we go 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.070
 to put the ip of the server 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.020
 this is a server that I found by 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.490
 there first of all clarify that no 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.350
 I'm advertising the server neither 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.880
 nothing like that we put the ip 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.100
 which are divided 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.790
 each figures by points and then two 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.700
 points and the one called door 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.070
 well then we give you to accept 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.580
 next hide or not the ip and accept 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.170
 as you can see it is to create another such that 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.330
 tells us the number of players 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.610
 connected and strictly players 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.330
 this is already the server information and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.040
 such we enter the server as they want and 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.600
 usually on all servers 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.130
 you have to register and you take the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.540
 command we put late to enter the chat 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.210
 Diagonal registration 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.460
 and our password but good here goes to 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.620
 appear the instructions can be a 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.300
 twice the password depending on 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.050
 server security good thank you 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.050
 everyone to see
