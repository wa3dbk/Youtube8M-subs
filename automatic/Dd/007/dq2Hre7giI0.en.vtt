 for 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.320
 /P 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.460
 Earth 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.760
 healed 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.839
 wet asphalt gravel 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.309
 each type of floor is a way of creating the new acronym 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.309
 even more because a lot of people are just 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 mouth cancer on the stage 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.249
 the French company 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.249
 in the land 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.269
 I was only stopped after death 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.269
 in Brazil this year 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.670
 the fine the toucans always bet that made with the gui 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.740
 the brakes 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.740
 with sensibility to realize that the rear wheel will lock the sector 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.300
 accessibility relieves the burden of freedom loads the workout wheel 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.960
 forward 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.969
 and vice versa 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.130
 is a key word and softness 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.500
 and this is just for starters 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.620
 until August 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.620
 it's also complicated 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.330
 the fight for victory 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.170
 I have spoken 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.490
 a total of exports of the input until the end will be disputed to people not 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.460
 there may be no culture of many mayors 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.730
 after all we always progressive people in which the two made now if diversity 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.050
 I had to go through the hole. 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.230
 I have to raise the process a bit 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.380
 we are talking and at least fifteen centimeters from the seat should not be 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.400
 fully open the leg to work as a buffer the fact that you lift a 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.729
 bit in your car with the body a little behind 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.049
 that way I'm doing protects from the floor of the front wheel it will overcome 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.959
 an obstacle with much more suavity to the pase if I had entered here 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.220
 especially the impact braking is going to be very potent 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.340
 the whole situation in which the family must prevail from the point of view of each 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.150
 worth as alert 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.870
 I've never been through this 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.870
 but nothing that can save 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.670
 but I accelerated the fipe are also accelerating 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.560
 I tried to make the passage I could predict 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.579
 that something could be found by the police 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.450
 and if it slowed down the crisis situation that could be 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:15.509
 much smaller 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:20.779
 on the other hand is who provoked the situation was the motorcyclist here 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.460
 how much more has he stuck in the car? 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.180
 more in the dust but in the lack of visibility he got involved would be 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.940
 revolting to have taken his hand rita wait a little 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.499
 Thank God it sells the picket 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.969
 I searched 24 of the mind david suazo 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:42.699
 the best thing to do is slow down 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:46.289
 not make any kind of abrupt change of direction 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.829
 I saw the use of the lidell throttle premium 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.129
