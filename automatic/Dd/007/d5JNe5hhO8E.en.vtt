00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.430 

the<00:00:14.210> big<00:00:14.360> insight<00:00:14.690> this<00:00:14.870> season<00:00:15.230> on<00:00:15.320> the

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
the big insight this season on the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.609 
the big insight this season on the
mercurial<00:00:15.799> vapor<00:00:15.950> 8<00:00:16.250> is<00:00:16.430> really<00:00:16.790> around<00:00:17.119> speed

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
mercurial vapor 8 is really around speed

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.070 
mercurial vapor 8 is really around speed
I'm<00:00:18.619> moving<00:00:18.950> from<00:00:19.189> speed<00:00:19.820> to<00:00:20.660> explosive<00:00:21.259> speed

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.010 

so<00:00:24.950> for<00:00:25.130> those<00:00:25.220> fast<00:00:25.550> players<00:00:25.850> have<00:00:26.420> an<00:00:26.540> extra

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
so for those fast players have an extra

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.900 
so for those fast players have an extra
edge<00:00:27.200> that<00:00:27.230> explosiveness<00:00:28.190> is<00:00:28.550> really<00:00:28.790> going

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
edge that explosiveness is really going

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.220 
edge that explosiveness is really going
to<00:00:29.000> be<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.150> key<00:00:29.450> to<00:00:29.480> separate<00:00:30.020> them<00:00:30.200> from

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
to be the key to separate them from

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.570 
to be the key to separate them from
their<00:00:30.529> opponents<00:00:31.040> during<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.400> game<00:00:36.520> one<00:00:37.520> of

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
their opponents during the game one of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.740 
their opponents during the game one of
the<00:00:37.670> areas<00:00:37.700> are<00:00:37.910> going<00:00:38.030> to<00:00:38.090> see<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:38.510> biggest

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
the areas are going to see the biggest

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.780 
the areas are going to see the biggest
difference<00:00:39.020> is<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.680> traction<00:00:40.040> system<00:00:40.220> and

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
difference is the traction system and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.950 
difference is the traction system and
probably<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.120> most<00:00:41.239> noticeable<00:00:41.629> when<00:00:41.870> you

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
probably the most noticeable when you

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.660 
probably the most noticeable when you
first<00:00:42.170> look<00:00:42.320> at<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.470> boot<00:00:42.680> because<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.400> studs

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
first look at the boot because the studs

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.950 
first look at the boot because the studs
have<00:00:43.820> gone<00:00:43.970> from<00:00:44.180> particularly<00:00:44.660> in<00:00:44.720> the<00:00:44.780> heel

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
have gone from particularly in the heel

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.770 
have gone from particularly in the heel
to<00:00:45.110> studs<00:00:45.530> to<00:00:45.860> one<00:00:46.040> step<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:47.269> simple<00:00:47.600> reason

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
to studs to one step the simple reason

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.229 
to studs to one step the simple reason
why<00:00:48.050> we've<00:00:48.230> done<00:00:48.379> that<00:00:48.559> is<00:00:48.860> penetration<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:50.150> be

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
why we've done that is penetration to be

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.180 
why we've done that is penetration to be
an<00:00:50.300> explosive<00:00:50.900> player<00:00:51.110> need<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:51.590> be<00:00:51.650> fast<00:00:51.949> in

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
an explosive player need to be fast in

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.220 
an explosive player need to be fast in
and<00:00:52.430> fast<00:00:52.699> out<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.030> ground<00:00:53.269> if<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:53.930> look<00:00:54.080> at

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
and fast out the ground if you look at

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.840 
and fast out the ground if you look at
the<00:00:54.290> front<00:00:54.590> edge<00:00:54.830> and<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.160> back<00:00:55.340> edge<00:00:55.580> does

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
the front edge and the back edge does

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.119 
the front edge and the back edge does
what<00:00:55.970> we<00:00:56.120> call<00:00:56.299> buttresses<00:00:56.930> they<00:00:57.589> provided

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
what we call buttresses they provided

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.189 
what we call buttresses they provided
stability<00:00:58.309> so<00:00:59.299> you<00:00:59.390> really<00:00:59.600> get<00:00:59.690> two<00:00:59.900> things

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
stability so you really get two things

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.310 
stability so you really get two things
in<00:01:00.350> one<00:01:00.379> stud<00:01:00.830> faster<00:01:01.699> than<00:01:01.850> out<00:01:02.030> fast<00:01:02.780> ability

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
in one stud faster than out fast ability

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.760 
in one stud faster than out fast ability
when<00:01:03.620> cutting<00:01:03.890> left<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:04.370> right<00:01:05.560> 20<00:01:06.560> otherwise

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
when cutting left and right 20 otherwise

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.200 
when cutting left and right 20 otherwise
you<00:01:06.979> might<00:01:07.100> notice<00:01:07.340> if<00:01:07.670> you're<00:01:07.850> familiar<00:01:07.970> with

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
you might notice if you're familiar with

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.570 
you might notice if you're familiar with
macule<00:01:08.630> before<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.200> central<00:01:09.619> stud<00:01:09.979> which

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
macule before is a central stud which

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.070 
macule before is a central stud which
really<00:01:10.820> isn't<00:01:11.000> a<00:01:11.210> central<00:01:11.600> point<00:01:11.810> in<00:01:12.020> the

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
really isn't a central point in the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.600 
really isn't a central point in the
highest<00:01:12.260> pressure<00:01:12.560> area<00:01:12.950> of<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.100> foot<00:01:13.310> a

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
highest pressure area of the foot a

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.430 
highest pressure area of the foot a
reason<00:01:14.270> why<00:01:14.330> we<00:01:14.420> put<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:14.690> n<00:01:14.810> is<00:01:14.840> really<00:01:15.290> that

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
reason why we put that n is really that

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.109 
reason why we put that n is really that
a<00:01:15.650> higher<00:01:15.890> pressure<00:01:16.159> point<00:01:16.640> really<00:01:16.940> means

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
a higher pressure point really means

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.140 
a higher pressure point really means
that's<00:01:17.330> where<00:01:17.510> you<00:01:17.600> need<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.810> most<00:01:17.990> traction

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
that's where you need the most traction

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
that's where you need the most traction
we<00:01:20.150> look<00:01:20.299> at<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.450> silhouette<00:01:20.659> from<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:20.960> side

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
we look at the silhouette from the side

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.149 
we look at the silhouette from the side
you're<00:01:21.470> going<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.650> notice<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.979> big<00:01:22.100> difference

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
you're going to notice a big difference

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.280 
you're going to notice a big difference
from<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.610> last<00:01:22.820> mercurial<00:01:23.210> vapor<00:01:23.390> aid<00:01:23.689> the

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
from the last mercurial vapor aid the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.500 
from the last mercurial vapor aid the
tower<00:01:24.530> is<00:01:24.650> a<00:01:24.680> lot<00:01:24.799> lower<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.970> arch<00:01:26.180> is<00:01:26.270> lot

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
tower is a lot lower the arch is lot

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.630 
tower is a lot lower the arch is lot
more<00:01:26.659> sculpted<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.619> even<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:27.890> plate<00:01:28.100> itself<00:01:28.430> is

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
more sculpted and even a plate itself is

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.370 
more sculpted and even a plate itself is
a<00:01:28.670> lot<00:01:28.820> more<00:01:28.940> sculpted<00:01:29.390> around<00:01:29.600> their<00:01:29.720> arch<00:01:29.930> on

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
a lot more sculpted around their arch on

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.440 
a lot more sculpted around their arch on
top<00:01:30.950> of<00:01:31.100> that<00:01:31.250> we've<00:01:31.430> actually<00:01:31.580> added<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:32.210> very

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
top of that we've actually added a very

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.480 
top of that we've actually added a very
soft<00:01:32.780> matte<00:01:33.170> finish<00:01:33.500> which<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.310> hand

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
soft matte finish which to the hand

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.700 
soft matte finish which to the hand
touch<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.850> very<00:01:35.120> very<00:01:35.270> soft<00:01:35.570> but<00:01:36.140> also<00:01:36.350> allows

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
touch is very very soft but also allows

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.460 
touch is very very soft but also allows
you<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:36.980> have<00:01:37.040> a<00:01:37.100> better<00:01:37.340> touch<00:01:37.670> on<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:37.910> ball

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
you to have a better touch on the ball

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.360 
you to have a better touch on the ball
one<00:01:39.470> of<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.590> questions<00:01:39.890> we<00:01:39.980> get<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.130> lot<00:01:40.340> is

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
one of the questions we get a lot is

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.220 
one of the questions we get a lot is
around<00:01:40.760> the<00:01:40.880> color<00:01:41.120> and<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.690> new<00:01:41.810> mercurial

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
around the color and a new mercurial

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.170 
around the color and a new mercurial
vapor<00:01:42.410> aid<00:01:42.650> has<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:42.980> brand<00:01:43.430> new<00:01:43.520> color<00:01:43.850> to

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
vapor aid has a brand new color to

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.330 
vapor aid has a brand new color to
launch<00:01:44.360> with<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:45.290> colors<00:01:45.590> called<00:01:45.770> mango<00:01:46.130> and

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
launch with the colors called mango and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.580 
launch with the colors called mango and
this<00:01:46.430> takes<00:01:46.670> color<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.120> new<00:01:47.270> dimension

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
this takes color to a new dimension

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.930 
this takes color to a new dimension
within<00:01:48.590> birth<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:49.130> explosive<00:01:49.610> speed<00:01:49.790> who

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
within birth of explosive speed who

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.700 
within birth of explosive speed who
wanted<00:01:50.180> a<00:01:50.270> color<00:01:50.480> represented<00:01:51.260> that<00:01:51.320> newness

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
wanted a color represented that newness
