00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.670
 plead 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.810
 you can do it differently but that 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.100
 well try what is the story of 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.680
 the elder scrolls online 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.530
 the whole is prior in time 1000 years 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.350
 sky blues play around in the second 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.920
 age years 4 to 6 100 somewhere 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.360
 between 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.980
 that means about two to 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.170
 three hundred years before everyone else 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.510
 elder scrolls play in the time 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.180
 have taken place 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.940
 The whole country is important because riot 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.140
 the danish prince marc bahl wants 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.450
 come back to the power again or 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.680
 right after that the power is on 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.750
 grab skeleton vampire werewolves evil 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.940
 monster teach and just wake up 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.860
 again and terrorizing the land harvest 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.240
 falls out the whole country is really in 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.970
 Cowes dropped 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.530
 and you try it all yourself 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.090
 solve or 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.750
 to defuse the whole country 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:04.520
 save the hero to be something with the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.290
 own quest series goal has happened 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.590
 not really clear you know 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.870
 that you start as a human or 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.400
 stop as no matter which breed or class 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.560
 who has lost his soul 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.420
 at least that's just rumored but 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.379
 they said you can do that 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.629
 maybe change 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.610
 it is not really final yet or so 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.790
 so you will be the great hero in the end 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.769
 and the whole story is all leyen 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.849
 can be played completely individually 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.989
 you do not need another 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.829
 sometime any other people 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.329
 otherwise the quest will be like this 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.970
 work the way it always works 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.370
 has you running tasks rom and done 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.459
 unlike many others always go 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.859
 in the old school style I say like, for example 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.159
 wow it will not be that you big 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.690
 quest if vasquez including tabs are there 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.739
 you should know otherwise rather 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.489
 bad is very short 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.709
 quest ab are small places that are part of a 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.730
 huge areal are where all the donors 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.639
 are gathered 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.769
 Usually you go there have so 20 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.180
 question mark on him accepts all and 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.500
 Do the quest in this huge one 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.470
 areal and must thereafter again and again 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.269
 run back to the holding of record 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.920
 turn into question marks and 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.420
 you know already the whole 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.950
 So in principle not be here 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.199
 instead, you should do your quest 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.260
 Based on optical information in the 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.209
 world can guess and this dynamic 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.220
 can execute 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.099
 the quest supposedly should not 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.739
 only to own races and classes 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.290
 was adapt but also to yours 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.639
 customize storyline and should also be 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.290
 adapt to new play style 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.840
 that is because they are pretty, for example 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.870
 like to play in close combat , the mobs 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.849
 or he has to do the tasks for 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.199
 be designed for the melee and less 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:52.440
 Fern fight finesse expect us to be very 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:54.449
 interesting how the whole arrange that 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.949
 questing should be alone with a couple of three 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.810
 or no matter how many people are still 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.579
 but should work in the end 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.930
 still your story is his other 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.169
 people can not jump into yours 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.180
 Engage history otherwise that is 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.220
 Not really known yet 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.629
 Things that are known outside of 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.000
 Information that I just mentioned 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.099
 have too much speculation and are 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.340
 officially nothing was said so 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.620
 that I omit these things what they do 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.440
 I liked the whole thing then 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.970
 in any case, my task is well fulfilled 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.970
 until next time guys and cha cha
