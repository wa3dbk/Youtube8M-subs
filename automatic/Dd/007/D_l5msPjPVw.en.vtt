00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 develop value levels 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.300
 physical in a sports season for 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.550
 a professional player have a player 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.250
 professional it's very complicated 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.680
 clubs think logically rather to handle 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.539
 the physical potential optimally 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.369
 rather than developing the levels of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.750
 physical potential of their different 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.489
 players as players 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.530
 that coach we know for a fact that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.570
 the player's success on the job 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.180
 individual have very very important 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.360
 between the end of the championship and the beginning 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 collective training with his 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.549
 team 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.680
 so he is he is really very very 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:51.600
 important to work individually 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.190
 that the player works individually 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.070
 between these two periods because that's 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.260
 which will condition his recovery and his 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.360
 individual level with his team at 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.339
 during the offseason the player can 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.680
 more focused on his needs and more 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.600
 working on himself to be able to 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.700
 train and then be able to perform 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.890
 the goal of the body in the water of colo 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.650
 is precisely to meet this need 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.020
 target and individualized for the player 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.460
 in both dimensions 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.270
 technical improvement increase 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.460
 ethical values 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.619
 I immediately adhered to the idea of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.789
 performance of colo because it fills 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.609
 an absolutely huge hole 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.070
 the preparation of the player is in addition 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.380
 it's a camp that's going to be open to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.640
 Pro players detect pros players 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.710
 also that they are in a step 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.719
 professional and so you want to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.770
 work when wanting to go back 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.259
 only want to progress 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.219
 the approach of the ndc basket ball was 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.170
 the players have a discussion with 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.880
 scientists to evaluate its 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.890
 needs 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.530
 and then to offer him a job 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.869
 à la carte will develop and 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.789
 to optimize your vote is a superb 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.430
 idea of ​​giving the possibility to some 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.270
 players who absolutely want 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.890
 progress who really want 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.100
 work individually on gold 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.280
 during the breaks to come work on 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.890
 the landau camp of colo and fill 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.630
 a hole that is absolutely huge for 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.670
 a top athlete is very 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.910
 important for the player as for the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.560
 play both profiles whether for 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.540
 accession to or for 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.060
 players and players already at most 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.010
 high level of being able to train for 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.599
 to be even more effective and more 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.549
 performing the next season 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.900
 it is true that the station of tignes us 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.230
 offers working conditions 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.239
 absolutely exceptional a frame too 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.590
 exceptional work at altitude is 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.470
 something that is done very very little 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.690
 it's really extremely beneficial and 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.959
 mostly recovery conditions 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.700
 also absolutely incredible 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.860
 of ndc basketball fits in the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.410
 continuity it's not just a 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.420
 week of intensive preparation 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.000
 course of the offseason but also 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.140
 a continuity to be the most 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.150
 powerful possible 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.090
 at the recovery with the sports structure 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.430
 is even further able to bring a 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.230
 followed during the season for 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.750
 players or players who would not 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.340
 not enough solutions 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.060
 performing within their clubs so 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.850
 meet this need of the players of 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.560
 to be able to work and develop 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.569
 physical dimensions perfect their 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.150
 technical during the offseason 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.569
 this is the main goal of the camp 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.569
 nando de colo 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.690
 and 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.990
