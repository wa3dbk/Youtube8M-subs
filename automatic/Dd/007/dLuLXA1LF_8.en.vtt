required<00:00:21.000> from<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> one<00:00:21.539> hundred<00:00:21.750> percent<00:00:21.779> if

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
required from the one hundred percent if

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.130 
required from the one hundred percent if
you<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.380> into<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.990> they're<00:00:24.990> pretty

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
you are into that and they're pretty

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
three episodes are pretty fairly easy so

people would come mms probably ama not

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.630 
people would come mms probably ama not
intentional<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.400> I'm<00:01:28.460> not<00:01:28.670> on<00:01:28.910> purpose<00:01:29.210> but

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
intentional and I'm not on purpose but

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.980 
intentional and I'm not on purpose but
you<00:01:31.640> know<00:01:31.730> they<00:01:31.910> have<00:01:32.060> that<00:01:32.300> happens<00:01:32.720> it

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
you know they have that happens it

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.270 
you know they have that happens it
happens<00:01:33.050> everybody

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.820 

usually<00:01:39.150> I'd<00:01:39.299> say<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.080> build<00:01:40.530> that

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
usually I'd say you have to build that

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.410 
usually I'd say you have to build that
 but<00:01:41.430> i'm<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> try<00:01:41.940> doing<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.299> about

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
 but i'm going to try doing it about

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.410 
 but i'm going to try doing it about
this<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.350> where<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.619> takes<00:01:43.650> me<00:01:44.010> I

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
this you see where that takes me I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.420 
this you see where that takes me I
think<00:01:45.420> it'll<00:01:45.720> work<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.900> as<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.920> well<00:01:47.159> if

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
think it'll work just as just as well if

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.760 
think it'll work just as just as well if
you<00:01:47.909> don't<00:01:48.030> need<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> use<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.509> ship<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.409> let's

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
you don't need to use the ship but let's

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.789 
you don't need to use the ship but let's
try<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.130> anyways<00:01:51.229> now<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.680> use

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
try it anyways now for this you can use

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.460 
try it anyways now for this you can use
Django<00:01:53.340> fed<00:01:53.580> but<00:01:53.970> what<00:01:54.119> i<00:01:54.570> use<00:01:54.780> both<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.290> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
Django fed but what i use both it and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.020 
Django fed but what i use both it and
