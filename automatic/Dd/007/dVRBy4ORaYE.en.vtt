I enjoy it on a cinematic level and the
action<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:16.660> also<00:02:16.810> enjoyed<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.410> evolution<00:02:17.890> to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950

each<00:02:18.100> game<00:02:18.340> seems<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.670> take<00:02:18.850> place<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.900> have

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
each game seems to take place you have

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.810 
each game seems to take place you have
the<00:02:20.200> sneaking<00:02:20.410> mission<00:02:20.980> then<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.250> have<00:02:21.430> first

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
the sneaking mission then you have first

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.550 
the sneaking mission then you have first
person<00:02:22.270> shooting<00:02:22.750> added<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.230> sneaking

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
person shooting added to the sneaking

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.600 
person shooting added to the sneaking
mission<00:02:23.770> which<00:02:23.890> makes<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.160> little<00:02:24.280> bit<00:02:24.460> easier

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
mission which makes a little bit easier

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.580 
mission which makes a little bit easier
then<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.450> have<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.750> adaptive<00:02:26.140> qualities<00:02:26.500> in

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
then you have the adaptive qualities in

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.980 
then you have the adaptive qualities in
Metal<00:02:26.770> Gear<00:02:26.800> Solid<00:02:27.070> 3<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:27.850> on<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.300> really

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
Metal Gear Solid 3 and so on I really

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.270 
Metal Gear Solid 3 and so on I really
enjoy<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.410> progression<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.130> game

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
enjoy the progression that the game

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.310 
enjoy the progression that the game
seemed<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.520> be<00:02:30.640> going<00:02:30.760> through<00:02:31.230> even<00:02:32.230> though

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
seemed to be going through even though

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.840 
seemed to be going through even though
it's<00:02:32.470> not<00:02:32.620> obviously<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.220> best<00:02:33.400> sneaking

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
it's not obviously the best sneaking

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.970 
it's not obviously the best sneaking
mission<00:02:34.180> games<00:02:34.450> or<00:02:34.720> stealth<00:02:35.110> gains<00:02:35.410> but<00:02:35.740> it's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
mission games or stealth gains but it's

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.290 
mission games or stealth gains but it's
just<00:02:36.190> there's<00:02:36.490> something<00:02:36.580> compelling<00:02:37.090> that

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
just there's something compelling that

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.150 
just there's something compelling that

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
then again it could be Kajima just

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.279 
then again it could be Kajima just
trolling<00:06:15.580> us<00:06:15.729> from<00:06:16.060> under<00:06:16.240> the<00:06:16.330> bridge<00:06:16.569> bad

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
trolling us from under the bridge bad

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.930 
trolling us from under the bridge bad
but<00:06:17.589> what<00:06:17.710> do<00:06:17.770> I<00:06:17.830> know<00:06:17.889> could<00:06:18.430> be<00:06:18.550> any<00:06:18.729> of<00:06:18.849> those

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
but what do I know could be any of those

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.129 
but what do I know could be any of those
things<00:06:19.300> or<00:06:19.479> could<00:06:19.629> be<00:06:19.659> none<00:06:19.870> of<00:06:19.900> those<00:06:20.080> things

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
things or could be none of those things

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.990 
things or could be none of those things
it's<00:06:20.860> just<00:06:21.039> something<00:06:21.129> to<00:06:21.370> contemplate<00:06:21.909> about

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
it's just something to contemplate about

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.450 
it's just something to contemplate about
and<00:06:22.300> ultimately<00:06:22.659> to<00:06:22.930> complain<00:06:23.409> about<00:06:23.460> just

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
and ultimately to complain about just

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.240 
and ultimately to complain about just
some<00:06:24.879> food<00:06:25.060> for<00:06:25.180> thought
