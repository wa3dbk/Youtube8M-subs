00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:17.540
 all France knows but the world 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:17.540
 know that good evening 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:29.849
 how we had died from actually 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.730
 we were talking about giving up 0 finally 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.260
 I would have preferred not to take the goal 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.079
 as early in the second period 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.370
 actually now behind we have 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.890
 sought to score yet to play and we have 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.809
 been rewarded I think on this match 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.079
 we have shown that we really have 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.910
 intentions of the game we had opportunities 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.910
 and the public does not know too much but that's it 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.969
 only the public is from the beginning of the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.199
 season he's behind us and I 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.479
 understand that there have been matches at 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.670
 difficult home but never can we 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.130
 blame the lute player and be 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.580
 in solidarity with having this dimension 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.280
 collective if we can add two of 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.780
 beautiful our offensive actions went 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.780
 abut on the guardian like landreau or 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.040
 touching poles like today 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.560
 for the show for our supporters 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.540
 it's good and it's nice that is 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.340
 that this support which was loaded if 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.020
 do not share what it is, but 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.900
 we must know that from the beginning we 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.119
 did not always want to try to do that 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.200
 there was not always happen and 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.509
 difficult moments but here today 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.780
 it was a pretty complete game account 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.490
 when you bastien returns by crazy you 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.750
 see that you had nothing you opportunity 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.399
 can not convert them to what you 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.320
 have not had a little fear that 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.430
 what happened against 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.399
 nice we could leave 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.850
 I had the right moment statistics 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.140
 given in speaking of 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.820
 of the largest number of centers have been 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.310
 the team that centralized the most we were 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.380
 one of my dd of the three teams that 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.140
 pulled the most not framed not a frame 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.459
 less than the other teams and 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.080
 today it turned out again the case 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.690
 even though the goalkeeper was very strong in 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.850
 face here but it was close with 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.200
 them for me I'm losing I knew that 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.670
 until the end we would still have 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.310
 opportunities because as he was 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.390
 launched this game we felt that it 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.390
 would not stop draw 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.420
 somewhere we continue to 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.400
 hang on this podium we will fight 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.260
 we still have three games to play they 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.090
 have 9 points a game everything is very tight 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.100
 cdc the same things but it's better 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.540
 have taken points 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.160
 which is complicated I already have a 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.430
 done it's the post but I'm thinking of 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.380
 Toulouse and chain two matches 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.000
 consecutive home is never 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.140
 easy it is necessary to prepare well 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.140
 for this match 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.329
 no no everything is possible there are nine 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.390
 points a nine points game in play for 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.220
 all teams and that's must 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.560
 to occupy ourselves once again with our 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.130
 trajectory and it starts with toulouse 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.130
 here 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.639
 he was successful in his match but that's 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.200
 I wish he was still there 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.200
 some weeks to come 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:35.370
 how do you feel the confidence 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.160
 so I have a lot of complicity with 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.560
 mathieu 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.690
 there was a lot of garbage at 2 was 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.680
 passed not again and after that there is also 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.030
 a whole team working around 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.310
 in the recovery of the balloon 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.130
 know that we mean 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.350
 complementarities that certainly gives 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.050
 is revealed in the open but 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:01.850
 and it's true that there was life 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:05.180
 in both of them to find themselves important 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.320
 match there is what the low the benefit 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.970
 of the day that replaced it is what 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.660
 it's reassured about the melting of 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.960
 workforce 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.390
 I saw that some thought that 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.760
 I spoke of the solidarity of life 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.600
 everyone that it was bullshit I 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.860
 he was the replacements who 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.000
 was not really concerned but 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.070
 they showed tonight that he was 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.540
 really concerned and who are really 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.830
 in the division the team salute them 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.510
 Moreover, substitutes 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.830
 not call them like that it's people 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.450
 who have less playing time but he 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.100
 give everything to the team and I the the 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.200
 know I see them every day and this 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:49.930
 would give an answer to those who are 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:49.930
 did not believe no it's not over how 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.890
 no but this bet is the same he plays 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.010
 tomorrow they have 9 points and a goal 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.200
 huge wager if betting is not 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.840
 domain champion 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.260
 they will not be there the next time 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.350
 I talked about the title is that 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:18.380
 paris reserves this title since 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:20.150
 long in this season never knows 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.190
 if ever enough when we lose I think 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.120
 that we lose the match on the first 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.620
 quarter of an hour and the last quarter 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.330
 of hour the first fifteen minutes 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.830
 technically it was at the national level 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.280
 what concerns us was insufficient 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.249
 to worry marseille despite this we have 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.769
 the chance to come back in the match then 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.449
 and to be still one everywhere in the 70th to 

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:39.849
 what was extraordinary compared 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.159
 to alan tam we did after we were 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.509
 in the summer much more consistent we were 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.769
 come to create danger we were able to 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.379
 creates we had too much waste 

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:50.379
 technique to worry this team of 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.719
 marseille more and after the last 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:56.109
 quarter of an hour because because I 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:58.899
 three wounded it was we did not 

00:05:56.109 --> 00:06:01.149
 way of how to say to do 

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:03.669
 coaching for to continue to 

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:05.019
 to make the team perform well here are some 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.179
 changes that I suffered and 

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:08.619
 athletically it was hard on the end 

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:10.089
 after we can regret to understand 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:11.909
 understand of goal against asimo but 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:14.349
 you marseille is a team of against 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:15.309
 this is the second goal let me 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.479
 a lot of regrets because we're in 

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:18.069
 place we defend very badly 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:22.179
 in aligning small I think it's 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:24.999
 bound his tiredness that's a pity me 

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:26.199
 I was very sincerely convinced 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.519
 we could do something because 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.229
 that the story would have been beautiful by 

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:30.909
 compared to these last three seasons 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.579
 now this is not the case marseille 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:36.219
 deserves his victory and we will recover 

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:38.110
 at work to get this 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:41.860
 victory that he misses and we still have 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.360
 than three games but no it's not me 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.569
 are waiting for you and thank you good blood 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.569
 evening
