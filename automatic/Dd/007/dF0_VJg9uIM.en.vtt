 A battery 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.440

 the first thing we have to do before 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.909
 you are welcome 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.940
 is to charge the battery that we have 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.700
 we will connect hector plug 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.659

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.110
 and here where are the three slots 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.960
 where you put e3 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.390
 then this is to load slower and 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.409
 fastest 3 amps and the kind of 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.040

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.770
 while we charge the battery 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.100
 let's go preparing 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.119
 our canton here where the battery goes 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.119
 the two antennas 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.830
 the system for the compass for the

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.190
 we will connect the compass 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.499
 ah 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.060
