 shopping site still rub food 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.670

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.379
 I order to leave their food 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.600

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.640

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.680

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.199
 start the first thing today tell it 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.640
 It will tie chiotchi of them here so here 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.369
 the way they look big-big 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.560
 the packing we need is enough is great 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.149
 source of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.460
 omega-6 and omega-9 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.649
 how much food is a knorkator here 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.899
 helps digestion I add them 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.350
 Usually in the morning I find everything if I am 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.910
 cook with fruit with sweat and a little bit 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.039
 I insist here these are the seeds of a glass 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.140
 separately then add to gruel 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.719
 plot porridge with such jelly 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.680
 grains very interesting tasty and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.780
 unusually 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.489
 it is also very often useful 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.590
 add to all sorts of pastries 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.600
 let's say different cookies pancakes 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.789
 road builders they are almost invisible when 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.430
 this thing is food much more useful and 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.159
 healthy next product is this 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.979
 here with a base protein shake from 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.600
 firms wiwa taste here tropical tango 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.460
 but very really delicious 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.200
 a tropical smell 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.659
 multifruit multivitamin 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.950
 multivitamin on juice taste since i 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.250
 I eat little meat 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.470
 I'm such a form that's pretty face 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.600
 while it is very really tasty 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.130
 and how well suited century we did 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.259
 Italians because this protein 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.930
 completely vegetable base January 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.150
 ordered do not know what to expect on the wire 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 loved it and do not know what's here 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.310
 a little felt sand such 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.619
 the taste and drink of the tooth itself is such 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.990
 feeling if you tried to draw protein 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.020
 therefore, it is clear what this is about 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 a little bit and creaking teeth but in 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.659
 principle 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.030
 less problems kim with rice if i 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.520
 I do it on the metal of milk, then in general 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.890
 there is no taste and no such 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.960
 drunk grains in general is very general 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.490
 happy with the product and recommend it to everyone 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.619
 I have the next product at home 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.060
 the constant is already a political whole 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.550
 year in time with bread 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.070
 of ours I tried it like this 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.620
 steve from a bite firm i have 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.500
 to taste one goes as neutral more 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.540
 simple he just adds a lot of sweetness 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.250
 delicious if you two kids he's richard not 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.300
 taste is felt and steve itself is not 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.310
 no taste 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.010
 the next steve of the same company but it 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.290
 taste happened and felt here 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.870
 Of course, vanilla got such a toy 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.910
 unusual in principle for a pleasant and 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.430
 this stalk and add in a varied 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.220
 yogurt idiot mixes let loose yoga 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.110
 yogurt berries so standing clan her 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.700
 the course of our weave turns out very 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.459
 tasty and sweet pool 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.250
 and do not need to buy anything shop 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.800
 harmful to the driver of sugar for me is 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.050
 great alternative and order already 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.790
 many many times and last time me 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.980
 came as different things because u 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.290
 I have already passed away the next row 5 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.390
 steve only this sachet sachet and 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.700
 tasty keeps sachets one gram each 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.610
 do you want a very comfortable handbag fighters 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.440
 a cafe so I used to be shooting in 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.049
 a jar but not particularly comfortable 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.959
 carry in a friend's bag up can spill 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.910
 then you will be sticky and sweet all 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.590
 being in the bag I think that to anyone 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.959
 no need for such a convenient packaging 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.299
 add to drink tea is very tasty and 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.299
 takes up little space and most importantly is convenient for 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.610
 Travel to some of the business is 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.890
 Home principle, if conveniently can 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.810
 use it is important yes sony and also 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.550
 kisses to refuse what is in all these 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.610
 styles 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.920
 zero calories i.e. no principle 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.770
 no carbohydrates no extra additives 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.930
 itâ€™s only the body that cannot 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.390
 It can be either a plus and so ordered by 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.620
 right i'm two different spices here's a movie 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.930
 a month further 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.100
 one year garlic and trail another just 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.590
 herbal mixture 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.980
 very pleasant principle smells also these 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.600
 spices without a quarrel and therefore the show + not 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.000
 I know I will order them yet or not 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.520
 fests we can be found quite similar 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.070
 products and even cheaper next under 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.070
 letters replacing conventional soy sauce 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:11.330
 and it's called liquid traded 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.310
 on the script from 45 years of general italic 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.910
 liquid amino acids and soy protein 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.430
 here 16 amino acids are very similar and 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.709
 came identical flavor and taste whole 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.040
 the plus sauce is absolutely wrong here 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.620
 no positive quarrel standing here 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.050
 no carbohydrate fat here 50 calories 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.480
 very tasty add to different sqashy 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.400
 in salads do we allow refueling for 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.950
 salads i like to mix 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.320
 sticky oil and here's these amino acids 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.690
 add spices what do you have what 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.180
 you usually use it turns out very 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.310
 Well, the last thing I ordered it will be 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.940
 quite unusual for me to try 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.200
 Basically, don't bother trying it 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.570
 certified organic by quiescence 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.160
 I ordered that I try something more 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.960
 healthy when stop firing 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.550
 movies with friends or producers 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.890
 when you want to chew something 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.570
 well, what about any holidays yet 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.790
 you can try out such a thing 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.730
 to make on a usual frying pan after 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.800
 close the lid and there go the olive oil 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.310
 like coconut oil or different 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.320
 spice 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.940
 You can make with oil 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.770
 pretty tasty here no 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.950
 there is no extra fat 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.290
 chemicals which usually have our 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.970
 the stores are prepared according to the forms 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.190
