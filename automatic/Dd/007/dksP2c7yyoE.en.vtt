00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.719
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.730
 Attack tutorials for today on the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.549
 nenner quartz blog that was with 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.230
 minecraft and 1.5 or the redstone 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.539
 update also added i show you 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.600
 where it passes him and how to get it 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.130
 great things out of power canada kombis 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.099
 The name says in case or something 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.390
 I have a portal here now 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.669
 built and made a little way here 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.430
 and also as it already starts 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.750
 So this was just the same as 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.370
 other doctors in the normal only falls 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.780
 that's maybe a bit 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.670
 harder to see that was very 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.899
 looks similar to the others 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.579
 happy here 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.230
 you just have to go and do that 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.360
 you get on this denominator quartz 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.629
 blog there is also somewhere here yes 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.160
 there and how to get him to these now 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.170
 other great blocks processed show 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.510
 I now first you've got to the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.770
 burn quartz block in an oven if 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.859
 it's done you get 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.090
 This nella can get out of it shortly 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.549
 many different things to do 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.010
 example could be a knife block 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.260
 It's easy and just like a power 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.729
 webcam could be synonymous but if you 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 in the top row glass lies in the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.909
 bottom row all the middle row 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.520
 because this never quartz and the and the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.380
 bottom row any one half 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.530
 stone from wood then you can use it 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.950
 daylight or because I think so hot 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.020
 to the daylight sensor yes that is now 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.570
 but not our theme as well 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.759
 look there for the red storm compressed 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.619
 hot compresses kloppich ear can you 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.180
 with it also forces but that is how 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.579
 Not the topic if you are now 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.259
 this country basket has crafted blog 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.700
 she also made many great things out of it 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.079
 For once, of course, make it natural 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.229
 half stones and stairs 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.430
 but if you steal out of it when 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.450
 her this superimposes gets how 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.119
 chiseled 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.259
 now we can master such 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.740
 Stone and I see that too much 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.509
 pretty 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.560
 So here again that is the normal in 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:04.679
 the departure stone carved the the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.240
 quartz parts of the trailer apparently because 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.829
 here are these stairs and this half 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.849
 steiner what the video I hope 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.500
 it has fallen so far and you 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.030
 of course helped further if you are now 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.650
 left click comes to a video in the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.420
 I'll tell you all about the funnel in 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.220
 Of course, minecraft is about crafting 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.780
 recipe there function if you 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.860
 Right click here comes to a channel there 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.630
 Of course you are welcome to do it 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.239
 stop by and see what else 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.920
 So I'll thank you for that
