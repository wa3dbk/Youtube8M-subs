00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.110 
they have your fingerprints I bet they
don't<00:04:54.009> because<00:04:54.669> they<00:04:54.759> don't<00:04:54.909> have<00:04:54.939> your

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
don't because they don't have your

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.990 
don't because they don't have your
fingers<00:04:55.469> well<00:04:56.469> this<00:04:56.740> of<00:04:56.889> course<00:04:56.919> we<00:04:57.729> won't<00:04:57.819> get

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
fingers well this of course we won't get

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.360 
fingers well this of course we won't get
into<00:04:58.150> that<00:04:58.210> but<00:04:58.710> it's<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.830> much<00:04:59.919> more<00:05:00.159> secure

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
into that but it's a much more secure

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.519 
into that but it's a much more secure
way<00:05:00.729> to<00:05:01.360> keep<00:05:01.479> your<00:05:01.569> content<00:05:01.990> locked<00:05:02.259> and

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:02.529 
way to keep your content locked and

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:04.110 
way to keep your content locked and
it'll<00:05:03.009> allow<00:05:03.069> a<00:05:03.159> different<00:05:03.430> one<00:05:03.699> of<00:05:03.789> these<00:05:03.879> for

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
it'll allow a different one of these for

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.420 
it'll allow a different one of these for
each<00:05:04.180> additional<00:05:04.900> user<00:05:05.349> that<00:05:05.620> is<00:05:05.770> logged<00:05:06.279> on

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
each additional user that is logged on

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.010 
each additional user that is logged on
to<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.580> system<00:05:06.639> so<00:05:07.300> that's<00:05:07.479> that's<00:05:07.719> a<00:05:07.870> really

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
to the system so that's that's a really

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.990 
to the system so that's that's a really
cool<00:05:08.199> way<00:05:08.349> to<00:05:08.379> scan<00:05:09.099> it<00:05:09.250> and<00:05:09.460> you're<00:05:09.610> logged<00:05:09.789> on

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
cool way to scan it and you're logged on

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.969 
cool way to scan it and you're logged on
there<00:05:10.419> you<00:05:10.509> go<00:05:10.659> all<00:05:11.199> right<00:05:11.259> how<00:05:11.529> about<00:05:11.560> another

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
there you go all right how about another

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.209 
there you go all right how about another
feature<00:05:12.310> can<00:05:13.060> they<00:05:13.180> handle<00:05:13.389> another<00:05:13.840> feature

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:14.219 
feature can they handle another feature

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.469 
feature can they handle another feature
how<00:05:15.219> about<00:05:15.370> an<00:05:15.460> integrated<00:05:15.909> webcam<00:05:16.060> right

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
how about an integrated webcam right

how about an integrated webcam right
there<00:05:16.689> that's<00:05:16.779> a<00:05:16.930> 1.3<00:05:17.349> megapixel<00:05:17.590> integrated

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.209 
there that's a 1.3 megapixel integrated
webcam<00:05:18.699> and<00:05:19.289> that's<00:05:20.289> just<00:05:20.469> another<00:05:20.889> reason

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
webcam and that's just another reason

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:23.309 
webcam and that's just another reason
that<00:05:21.400> this<00:05:21.639> thing<00:05:21.879> is<00:05:22.029> an<00:05:22.750> awesome<00:05:23.169> laptop

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
that this thing is an awesome laptop

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:25.339 
that this thing is an awesome laptop
it's<00:05:23.740> truly<00:05:24.069> as<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.219> desktop<00:05:24.550> replacement<00:05:24.669> and

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
it's truly as a desktop replacement and

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.779 
it's truly as a desktop replacement and
when<00:05:26.349> you<00:05:26.469> think<00:05:26.680> about<00:05:26.740> it<00:05:27.069> you're<00:05:27.610> not<00:05:27.639> gonna

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
when you think about it you're not gonna

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.159 
when you think about it you're not gonna
be<00:05:27.969> able<00:05:28.029> to<00:05:28.150> get<00:05:28.270> this<00:05:28.449> mini<00:05:28.690> ins<00:05:28.870> and<00:05:29.050> outs

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
be able to get this mini ins and outs

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.939 
be able to get this mini ins and outs
and<00:05:29.909> this<00:05:30.909> many<00:05:31.150> I<00:05:31.240> guess<00:05:31.389> ports<00:05:31.990> and<00:05:32.259> even

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
and this many I guess ports and even

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.529 
and this many I guess ports and even
like<00:05:33.129> the<00:05:33.250> integrated<00:05:33.669> webcam<00:05:33.879> if<00:05:34.210> this<00:05:34.330> was<00:05:34.509> a

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
like the integrated webcam if this was a

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.540 
like the integrated webcam if this was a
desktop<00:05:35.020> you'd<00:05:35.889> have<00:05:36.039> to<00:05:36.159> have<00:05:36.219> you<00:05:36.400> know<00:05:36.430> a

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
desktop you'd have to have you know a

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.189 
desktop you'd have to have you know a
separate<00:05:36.969> webcam<00:05:37.300> clipped<00:05:37.599> on<00:05:37.719> the<00:05:37.870> top<00:05:38.020> it's

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
separate webcam clipped on the top it's

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.390 
separate webcam clipped on the top it's
gonna<00:05:38.289> take<00:05:38.500> up<00:05:38.589> a<00:05:38.680> lot<00:05:38.800> more<00:05:38.919> room<00:05:39.099> this<00:05:39.219> one

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
gonna take up a lot more room this one

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.490 
gonna take up a lot more room this one
you<00:05:39.550> just<00:05:39.580> close<00:05:40.150> it<00:05:40.300> up<00:05:40.389> take<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:41.080> from<00:05:41.319> place

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
you just close it up take it from place

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.439 
you just close it up take it from place
to<00:05:41.529> place<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:42.190> mean<00:05:42.759> it's<00:05:42.909> a<00:05:42.969> little<00:05:43.180> heavier

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
to place I mean it's a little heavier
