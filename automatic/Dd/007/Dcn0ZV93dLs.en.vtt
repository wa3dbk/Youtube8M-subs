00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.400
 Hello, welcome, let's see 5 things from 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.290
 windows 8 that maybe you do not know or 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.150
 the best yes but that can help you in 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.950
 day to day and they are very simple for 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.780
 any user does not need to have 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.570
 great knowledge and know a lot 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.119
 let's see 5 things that windows 8 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.900
 can do and that normally then the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.900
 people do not know 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.860
 first to make catches of 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.480
 screen the first thing we're going to see 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.290
 is how to make a screenshot and 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.290
 save a file directly 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.019
 I do not usually know about you but before 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.449
 when someone wanted to make a capture 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.680
 We gave the key to the screen 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.289
 print screen and I for example 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.170
 it entered the paint and the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.640
 saved and already sent it well was a 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.949
 process it will make it a little bit hard 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.930
 although it does not take long because it is a 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.610
 process that is better not to do it because 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.750
 you have to open the paint if you have 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.820
 many applications open theories 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.920
 ok in windows 8 there is a way a lot 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.199
 easier to do that is pressing 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.780
 the combination of windows + keys 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.880
 print screen we give to windows + 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.369
 print screen as you just saw and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.840
 from now on images the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.720
 library we find capture of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.660
 screen and we see the screenshot 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.950
 as you can see here and it's already from 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.300
 here we can send it, let's do 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.820
 another test for example with the trash 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.830
 of open recycling we're going to give the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.950
 combination of windows + buttons 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.670
 print screen and we see how 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.740
 automatically appears here the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.689
 file with the screenshot 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.640
 this trick can be very useful and if 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.170
 you are sending screenshots you can 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.350
 use it because the truth is very 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.350
 all right 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.640
 that you may not know 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.070
 show you the advanced user menu of 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.659
 windows 8 that is pulled out very 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.430
 simple and can serve you for many 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.040
 things without going to the start menu 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.509
 of writing things this menu has 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.640
 Very interesting actions such as 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.020
 we take out is very simple we go to the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.399
 corner of the start menu as if we were 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.950
 to open the start menu and click 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.330
 with the right mouse button and here 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.429
 we have all the options that we are given 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.319
 directly from this menu for example 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.000
 we can uninstall a program with 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.489
 programs and features directly 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.990
 making the menu we can configure the 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.870
 energy options 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.590
 we can see the event viewer though 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.920
 not many people look at it the truth 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.590
 we can open the system to see the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.030
 system configuration we can open 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.530
 device manager for 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.410
 uninstall hardware I do not have 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.420
 privileges right now 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.240
 the disk manager that I 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.930
 wrong there is that in my case not 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.170
 Nothing appears because I do not have privileges 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.430
 the equipment manager with the viewer 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.450
 of events the shared folders 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.159
 etc. simple system symbol 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.629
 system in administrator user that already 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.040
 you know what is task manager 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.989
 sport file control panel 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.030
 search run and desktop all these 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.739
 options are one click directly 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.099
 with this menu sinesia to look for the 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.099
 you are welcome 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.230
 Another trick that I want to show you is that 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.780
 If you have not yet been used to 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.549
 new start menu we can put a 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.010
 small start menu with all the 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.989
 programs in our taskbar is 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.299
 very simple we click with the button 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.830
 right on the taskbar we do 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.650
 click on toolbar and in new 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.780
 toolbar here we put this 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.120
 address that you can see below update a 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.370
 microsoft windows start menu select 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.409
 folder and we see how we have a 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.370
 small start menu with access then to 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.370
 all our programs 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.519
 you remember the menu I told you before 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.959
 because in this advanced menu we can put 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.330
 our own shortcuts and 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.800
 our own things as it is very 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.180
 simple we open a browser 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.150
 windows and in the address bar 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.190
 we put this route in our unit 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.780
 hard drive in my case c users our 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.870
 Username 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.000
 update to local microsoft windows win x 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.250
 we click inside to go and we see that 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.900
 there are three groups these three groups are 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.400
 the three that we can see in this menu 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.400
 one up here two up here and three in 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.950
 our case then we go to group 1 up 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.210
 the desktop we are going to create for example 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.330
 a direct internet access does not weigh 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.330
 nothing 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.020
 Internet 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.810
 it weighs nothing there is then right now 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.190
 for example as far as we close session 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.110
 the back to see is open access 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.570
 direct let's do it 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.100
 well as you can see it has already closed and 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.690
 reopened session and already appears in the 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.980
 menu as an internal option does not weigh anything anymore 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.320
 we can open it by clicking 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.680
 simply in that simple menu 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.680
 like that 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.520
 another thing that maybe you do not know about 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.030
 windows 8 is the new invest button 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.560
 selection in the windows explorer 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.870
 let's see so that we could be useful 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.640
 well we have this folder with many 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.530
 imagine documents that we want 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:18.060
 delete all 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:22.200
 - for example 3 on 11 and 19 what 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.590
 would do is select a one with the 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.940
 pressed control key is very messy 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.250
 so why are we going to use this 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.500
 new function of inverting selection by 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.480
 example we are going to select the document 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.370
 3 on the 11th and the 19th and we click on 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.830
 invest selection and see how they are 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.970
 all selected except documents 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.970
 and now we can delete them 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.620
 if you liked this video give the button 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.030
 I like it or to the button subscribe below 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.439

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.389
 share on social networks by giving 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:54.210
 share any of the icons 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.949
 that appear also you can visit www 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.060

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.060
 you will find more information
