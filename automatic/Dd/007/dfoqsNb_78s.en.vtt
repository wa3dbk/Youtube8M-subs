00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
not be as dramatic as its ouch because

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.639 
not be as dramatic as its ouch because
things<00:00:38.969> were<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.360> chaotic<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.469> might

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
things were so chaotic as you might

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.619 
things were so chaotic as you might
expect<00:00:40.800> where<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:41.489> these<00:00:41.640> survivors<00:00:42.540> were

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
expect where all these survivors were

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.090 
expect where all these survivors were
brought<00:00:42.840> ashore<00:00:43.020> they<00:00:43.649> were<00:00:43.770> brought<00:00:43.950> to

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
brought ashore they were brought to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.040 
brought ashore they were brought to
different<00:00:44.489> areas<00:00:44.640> there<00:00:45.210> wasn't<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.539> great<00:00:45.899> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
different areas there wasn't a great a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.049 
different areas there wasn't a great a
name<00:00:46.559> checking<00:00:47.010> system<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.520> place<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.910> it's

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
name checking system in place so it's

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.430 
name checking system in place so it's
quite<00:00:48.210> possible<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.930> lot<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.320> those

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
quite possible that a lot of those

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.080 
quite possible that a lot of those
people<00:00:49.500> including<00:00:50.250> some<00:00:50.280> Australians<00:00:50.850> might

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
people including some Australians might

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.580 
people including some Australians might
be<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.480> lab<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.050> they<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.260> haven't

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
be on lab but they just haven't

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.189 
be on lab but they just haven't
registered<00:00:53.280> their<00:00:53.699> names<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.149> yet<00:00:54.329> yes<00:00:54.899> well

registered their names just yet yes well

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.439 
registered their names just yet yes well
let's<00:00:55.469> hope<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> case<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.180> just

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
let's hope that that is the case is just

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.560 
let's hope that that is the case is just
a<00:00:57.570> case<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.559> confusion<00:00:59.370> rather<00:00:59.579> than<00:00:59.910> bodies

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
