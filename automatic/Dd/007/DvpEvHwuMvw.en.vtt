have to say that in normal even the
confidence<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.080> suspension<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:42.310> really

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
confidence of the suspension is really

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.470 
confidence of the suspension is really
is<00:02:43.390> really<00:02:43.750> impressive<00:02:44.130> okay<00:02:45.209> some<00:02:46.209> of<00:02:46.329> you

is really impressive okay some of you
asked<00:02:47.349> if<00:02:47.739> in<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.489> Koala<00:02:48.700> folio<00:02:49.000> border<00:02:49.360> there

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
asked if in the Koala folio border there

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.970 
asked if in the Koala folio border there
are<00:02:49.720> anti-roll<00:02:50.200> bar<00:02:50.880> yeah<00:02:52.110> on<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.290> front<00:02:53.500> yes

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
are anti-roll bar yeah on the front yes

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.610 
are anti-roll bar yeah on the front yes
on<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.489> on<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.790> back<00:02:55.060> know<00:02:55.440> there<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.590> a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
on the on the back know there is a

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.860 
on the on the back know there is a
special<00:02:56.890> reason<00:02:57.489> for<00:02:57.519> that<00:02:57.970> well<00:02:58.420> we<00:02:58.690> think

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
special reason for that well we think

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.900 
special reason for that well we think
that<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.470> scheme<00:02:59.739> of<00:02:59.799> suspension<00:03:00.489> we<00:03:00.670> had<00:03:00.790> to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
that the scheme of suspension we had to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.400 
that the scheme of suspension we had to
be<00:03:01.000> adopted<00:03:01.269> for<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:03.340> Mito<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:04.989> quite

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
be adopted for the Mito and it is quite

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.199 
be adopted for the Mito and it is quite

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
control of the performances while the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
car is going in cures but as well in an

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.660 
car is going in cures but as well in an
even<00:03:16.959> Rosa<00:03:17.230> ensures<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:19.290> safety<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.670> handling

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
even Rosa ensures a safety and handling

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.120 
even Rosa ensures a safety and handling
and<00:03:22.120> sporty<00:03:22.540> handling<00:03:22.690> one<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.530> an<00:03:23.650> accessory

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
and sporty handling one is an accessory

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.849 
and sporty handling one is an accessory
so<00:03:24.910> we<00:03:25.450> think<00:03:25.599> this<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.230> perfect<00:03:26.410> balance

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
so we think this is a perfect balance

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.710 
so we think this is a perfect balance
because<00:03:27.459> anyway<00:03:27.760> we<00:03:27.910> have<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.209> think<00:03:28.569> about

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
because anyway we have to think about

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.039 
because anyway we have to think about
the<00:03:29.620> weight<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:31.000> car<00:03:31.209> but<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.599> has<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:31.900> be

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
the weight of the car but it has to be

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.699 
the weight of the car but it has to be
contained<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:33.010> ensure<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.579> agility<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.709> one

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
contained to ensure that agility and one

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.300 
contained to ensure that agility and one
of<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:35.980> best<00:03:36.190> as<00:03:36.730> well<00:03:37.169> ratio<00:03:38.169> between<00:03:38.319> power

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319

is one of the best of the category is a
good<00:03:46.030> compromise<00:03:46.269> I<00:03:46.810> think<00:03:47.139> for<00:03:47.410> all<00:03:47.530> and

we<00:04:02.349> decided<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:03.310> proceed<00:04:03.489> visa<00:04:04.019> well<00:04:05.019> we<00:04:05.290> think

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
we decided to proceed visa well we think

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.099 
we decided to proceed visa well we think

that the electronic co2 is then the

question that

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.740 
question that
is<00:04:15.140> often<00:04:15.379> recurring<00:04:16.160> about<00:04:16.430> maybe<00:04:17.060> brocco

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
launch of this kara and there are

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.850 
launch of this kara and there are
already<00:06:37.099> people<00:06:37.490> thinking<00:06:38.150> about<00:06:38.860> which

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
already people thinking about which

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.909 
already people thinking about which
could<00:06:40.130> be<00:06:40.310> the<00:06:40.490> development<00:06:41.150> of<00:06:41.509> these<00:06:41.930> in

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
could be the development of these in

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.830 
could be the development of these in
terms<00:06:43.310> of<00:06:43.490> diffusion<00:06:44.389> we<00:06:45.199> will<00:06:45.710> of<00:06:45.919> the

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
terms of diffusion we will of the

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.559 
terms of diffusion we will of the
European<00:06:47.840> diffusion<00:06:48.440> about<00:06:48.680> this<00:06:48.860> car<00:06:49.569> and

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:50.569 
European diffusion about this car and

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:52.480 
European diffusion about this car and
the<00:06:50.810> diffusion<00:06:51.319> will<00:06:51.470> be<00:06:51.620> the<00:06:51.770> same<00:06:52.009> as<00:06:52.069> the

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
the diffusion will be the same as the

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.659 
the diffusion will be the same as the
standard<00:06:52.699> version<00:06:53.020> okay<00:06:54.020> so<00:06:54.530> we<00:06:54.949> can<00:06:55.340> find

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
standard version okay so we can find

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:00.280 
standard version okay so we can find
this<00:06:55.880> car<00:06:56.210> in<00:06:56.539> all<00:06:56.840> Europe<00:06:57.229> yes<00:06:57.889> course
