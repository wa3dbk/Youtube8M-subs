00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.650 
am never going to have this out with
this<00:03:35.160> figure<00:03:35.609> ever<00:03:35.849> again<00:03:36.209> I'm<00:03:36.359> just<00:03:36.450> going<00:03:36.540> to

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
this figure ever again I'm just going to

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.490 
this figure ever again I'm just going to
pack<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.109> away<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.769> never<00:03:37.950> get<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.340> out<00:03:39.500> you

what<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.680> hell<00:03:43.829> is<00:03:43.949> the<00:03:44.099> point<00:03:44.930> so<00:03:47.629> that's<00:03:48.629> a

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
what the hell is the point so that's a

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.280 
what the hell is the point so that's a
minus<00:03:49.169> for<00:03:49.379> me<00:03:49.500> now<00:03:49.709> another<00:03:50.569> size<00:03:51.569> comparison

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
now I always have trouble transforming

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.010 
now I always have trouble transforming
this<00:04:14.580> guy<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:14.820> always<00:04:15.150> get<00:04:15.270> mixed<00:04:15.540> up<00:04:15.630> somewhere
