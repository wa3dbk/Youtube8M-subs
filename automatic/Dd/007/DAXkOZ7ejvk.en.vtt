00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.200
 hello guys with the chemical experiment 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.080
 of today we extract from this solution a 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.860
 real crystal like bow ribbon 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.080
 snow 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.580
 thank donatella of fan lab bloc that 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.080
 I link you past full of creative ideas 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.169
 for this reason and we go immediately to 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.890
 see how it's done to make the 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.840
 Snowflake 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.669
 let's start with an eyelash stick like 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.349
 this you find for example in 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.869
 stationery castle with a soul 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.180
 metal have chosen an orange 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.960
 so we see better the own deposit 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.210
 of the salt crystals which they then allow 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.039
 just this special effect let's say 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.629
 missed special snowflake and 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.550
 let's say how better was it 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.929
 you could get with a stick of 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.850
 eyelashes we have as I wanted to do 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.499
 the experiment with just orange for 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.170
 see better start the effect 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:54.499
 the effect that this does is long 45 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.239
 centimeters cut it into four parts 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:01:00.140
 one part the face a little longer 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:06.590
 because then I will need it to cut gods 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:09.040
 only bits we will see then 12 yes 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.040
 stick 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.500
 44 more suitable effect we are ok to 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.590
 this point what I do I go to if I do them 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.479
 overlap them they are ready so and 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.860
 they form exactly what will be the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.810
 our future snowflake 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.400
 as I told you to pull off some 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.520
 small piece from the longest part 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.600
 this because they will help me to fix 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.670
 just the snowflake and then to have 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.520
 an important longer step we start 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.950
 present thus making a cross then 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.649
 another price so another piece like that 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.780
 in this way we say the first 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.360
 part of the bow we want to fix 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.940
 just using these other two 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.330
 bits and pieces at this point when 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.619
 let us do nothing but exploit the soul 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.910
 mental coffee to go create one's own 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:06.700
 snow crystal that you don't go to 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.700
 separate in its different parts then 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:22.519
 so it is separated no problem 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.230
 no problem because we also have 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.180
 kept another piece aside for 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.450
 to make the structure of the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.900
 Our snowflake 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.019
 we take 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.110
 price we start from the other side 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.689
 so this turn 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.650
 I'm going to close for good so 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.790
 stabilize 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.180
 of all we have seen got the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.489
 our nemec crystal which is not 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.260
 still perfect because in addition to dictate 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.230
 all I have to do with my fingers 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.659
 to do some elders to cut 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:03.889
 it seems that the longer ones for example 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:08.840
 to make it consistent so it was good 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:11.769
 this a little we leave a little more 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.450
 long because not too much because 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.790
 we always use our soul 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.590
 movable metal to make a spice 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.709
 see when I made some kind of 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.500
 hook and this will help me to fix 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.200
 then the china court with which I will hang 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.489
 in the boric acid solution 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.900
 my snowflake then me 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.420
 will allow you to make a decoration 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.940
 true to then go to 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.280
 hang wait if this still 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.010
 start off with a few numbers 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.959
 at this point to say also enough 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.959
 balanced with milk 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.129
 ok and we're ready to go three 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.989
 solutions 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.909
 the solution is simply prepared 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.709
 thus heating water a little earlier 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.840
 that this bubble we are going to pour into 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.060
 a glass container, for example, I 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.190
 transparent or reused one of the 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.769
 old jams we make at home 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.690
 perfect then to go to insert 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.310
 now see the experiment we insert 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.129
 boric acid can be found in the pharmacy 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.599
 paid 40 cents per bag in this one 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.900
 episode of water that is about half a liter 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.760
 do not put in as much as boric acid 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.289
 we insert as needed because later 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.750
 find it hard to melt and then the 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.599
 solution is saturated see that in 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.159
 fund just ran for 3 4 minutes e 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.530
 just didn't melt anymore for which it is 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:29.000
 saturated I go to enter using 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.530
 hanging it with a toothpick of those 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.570
 to make the skewers on the grill a little 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.639
 of race remembers that to do 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.349
 the roast in the kitchen I did so 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.090
 that what the same completely 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.860
 inside I recommend using 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.910
 boric acid because in contact with 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.830
 eyes and much 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.900
 very dangerous so I recommend it to 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.650
 do this part with mom and dad later 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.390
 about an hour 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.670
 what happens happens they are formed 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.040
 these crystals this because of the water 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.690
 hot succeeds you have to melt the acid 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.020
 boric and even better than the cold one 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.520
 so when the water cools down the 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.170
 take a little contain the same 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.570
 amount of boric acid we have 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.450
 put in the hot one then and it goes out 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.190
 from the solution the excess can 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.980
 form crystals that then go to 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.720
 aggregate to group oneself or in 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.280
 background or in the objects they are 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.810
 president the solution then the effect 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.250
 I left the final here 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.560
 truly an hour and a half everything really 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.240
 so much and this crystal that is a lot 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.000
 however delicate because it is 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.890
 however, and salt crystals for 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.450
 any successful experiment questions 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.400

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.320
 below in the comments on this video 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.910
 I leave you with the other video experiments 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.340
 that I shot for example the slimer you do 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.930
 from you at home and if you liked a video 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.790
 like and then your videos are waiting for you 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.590
 here on games for boys you can 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.100
 subscribe to the channel hello hello soon
