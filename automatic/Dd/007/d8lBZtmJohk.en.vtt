put<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.490> couple<00:01:53.000> spoons<00:01:53.330> in<00:01:53.479> there<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.560> you're

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
put a couple spoons in there and you're

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.850 
put a couple spoons in there and you're
good<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:54.950> go<00:01:55.720> so<00:01:56.720> we<00:01:56.810> put<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.140> lid<00:01:57.350> cook<00:01:57.680> with

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
good to go so we put the lid cook with

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.240 
good to go so we put the lid cook with
the<00:01:57.950> lid<00:01:58.159> on<00:01:58.189> it<00:01:58.430> like<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.150> said<00:01:59.210> as<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.600> steam

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.750 

steam<00:02:04.250> holes<00:02:04.549> right<00:02:04.670> here

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
steam holes right here

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.960 
steam holes right here
so<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.540> could<00:02:06.690> you<00:02:07.170> could<00:02:07.520> drain<00:02:08.520> stuff<00:02:08.790> out

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
so you could you could drain stuff out

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.950 
so you could you could drain stuff out
with<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:11.360> strain<00:02:12.360> out<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.510> water<00:02:12.750> if<00:02:12.870> you're

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
with it strain out the water if you're

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.150 
with it strain out the water if you're
going<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.140> cook<00:02:13.290> some<00:02:13.320> noodles<00:02:13.560> or<00:02:13.860> something

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
going to cook some noodles or something

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.450 
going to cook some noodles or something
so<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:14.880> pretty<00:02:15.000> handy<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.400> said

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
so it's pretty handy like I said

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.590 
so it's pretty handy like I said
everything<00:02:17.730> stores<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.180> there<00:02:19.340> pretty<00:02:20.340> easily

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.330 

and<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.750> squeeze<00:02:25.050> these<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.100> locks

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
and you squeeze these in and it locks

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.750 
and you squeeze these in and it locks
everything<00:02:29.610> tight<00:02:30.540> together
