 pegi 16 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.080
 hello I am jean maxime morris 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.309
 creative director on remember me in 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.320
 this new video we are going to 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.000
 address the central theme of the game 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.619
 memories 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.020
 every day everything we see and 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.480
 hear hear feel and learn row 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.749
 in our brain in real time its 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.609
 memories define our identity in 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.779
 2013 we can say that memories are 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.669
 the last elements of our intimacy 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.360
 we have not made available 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.430
 others on social networks in 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.230
 2084 the last barriers of 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.180
 intimacy fell thanks to the cndd 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.920
 stage a neural implant that allows for 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.109
 digitize his memories in real time and 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.609
 to share them with others and that's 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.050
 a memo a company given to the 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.109
 bet that we owe this advance 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.579
 unprecedented technological 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.530
 immense power has been given to 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.120
 memories that controls through the 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.469
 memories the personal data and 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.129
 99% of the population 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.170
 everyone has it perfectly 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.579
 consciousness but gladly accepts this 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.199
 risk in exchange for pleasures 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.199
 fantastic memory sharing 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.230
 there is still a handful 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.090
 activists fighting against the 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.920
 memories domination we call them 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.990
 the rist heroes and you will embody the 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.030
 more gifted of them his name and nîmes 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.590
 the elite souvenir hunter 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.270
 she has the power to dive into the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.500
 memory of these victims stole their 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.090
 girl once a souvenir flap line 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.320
 to materialize the content in time 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.000
 real and three-dimensional 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.830
 this is called a re ma 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.360
 birth a technique developed 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.800
 by the police of neo paris for 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.230
 reconstruct crime scenes 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.640
 from the memories of the witnesses a 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.430
 technique then diverted by the airs 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.570
 at risk you will need to use the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.340
 information contained in 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.410
 memories of your victims to overcome 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.490
 the obstacles of the present it is 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.490
 to cross a minefield 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.119
 to infiltrate the places 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.159
 but sometimes stealing a memory will only be 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.689
 not enough then you can 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.909
 resort to the unique powers of nîmes 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.469
 the memory remix which consists of modifying 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.000
 some details in a memory of a 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.690
 nobody to radically change his 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.040
 behavior by butterfly effect 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.810
 the first step in a memory 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.810
 surrender and observe the target memory 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.560
 again dead of my cellar and franck dumas 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.069
 ecb 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.069
 so if 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.360
 inaction 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.940
 after this first phase of discovery 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.500
 you take control of the memory you 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.030
 are God's hand and could go 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.950
 back and forth as much as you 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.020
 do you want to go get what we 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.370
 calls memorial glitchs that's at 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.530
 say digital flaws in the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.180
 remember that will be so many objects with 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.500
 which you can interact and that 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.920
 you can combine to edit 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.030
 the outcome of the memory change the few 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:26.200
 good details will allow you to edit 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:28.120
 radically the memory is sometimes 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.470
 change only one of your memories comes back 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.470
 to change you entirely axis 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.470
 but ninine's weapons can sometimes 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.210
 to turn against her and at the beginning of 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.010
 game she undergoes a total erasure of the 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.050
 memory at the Bastille prison where 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.330
 she's incarcerated her quest for 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.920
 find his identity starts edge the 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.390
 leader of rist heroes comes into contact 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.300
 with her and help her escape from the 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.890
 bastille he's his lifeline and 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.490
 his guide in a city where his head is 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.320
 price 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.180
 and she is his best weapon for 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.920
 strike but morally gradually 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.300
 ninive found fragments of his 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.160
 identity through encounters 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.270
 that she performs she may also 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.040
 rely on the help of his companions 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.390
 rist hero who will leave behind them 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.860
 memories of places where they have 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.470
 hidden increase plugins from 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.880
 capacity 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.930
 because we know who was really 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.340
 will have no choice but to 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.190
 beat to recover the backup 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.630
 main part of her memory she will be able to 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.700
 serve combat memories she 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.100
 will gradually unlock we call 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.330
 these memories of the stage loans through 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.160
 they you can customize your 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.910
 combos and choose the fighting style that 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.950
 is the best for you 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.750
 the controls of your four combos are 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.460
 fixed but you can change the effect 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.740
 gameplay each shot and create some 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.270
 chains it's a very simple system to 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.980
 take in hand but if you choose 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.540
 to invest in it and take advantage of 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.560
 these advanced rules you will appreciate 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.540
 all the depth 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.840
 here we see a line fight a 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.840
 lipper 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.040
 the lipper are memorial junkies 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.540
 home uses is so 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.660
 outside memories that their seine seine 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.610
 has degenerated their dna has mutated do 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.990
 humans nevertheless who have regrouped 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.010
 in the lowlands given to paris and 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.120
 for some unknown reason 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.210
 they are particularly hostile 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.889
 towards nine in addition to its basic costs 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.600
 nili will also unlock memories of 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.760
 special moves that we call goddess 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.320
 precious cs near scenes are 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.270
 particularly powerful and will be 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.770
 decisive in some particular fights 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.210
 those who will immerse you in the soul and 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.440
 torture memory and some bosses 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.940
 in these fights 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.800
 it will no longer be a question of fighting against 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.360
 agni physics but to fight against 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.479
 the abc tortured quest of the worst enemies of 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.479
 nine 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.880
 to complete an enemy nor line will 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.770
 also carried out a new batch of 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.970
 memorial which will cause losses 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.160
 massive memories and a 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.570
 immediate fainting his enemies get 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.250
 will rise but they will not be 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.160
 necessarily his name us they 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.150
 live 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.410
 to finish you can also 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.270
 learn everything you want 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.860
 know about the history of neo paris and 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.410
 cndd scene by collecting memories 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.360
 does exist his memories are put to 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.550
 provided by the NGOs of the same name and 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.020
 are scattered across the city there 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.880
 aims to preserve the memory of a world 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.110
 where total sharing of memories rhymes with 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.410
 forgetfulness of things and events 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.410
 essential 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.150
 this concludes this excursion in 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.320
 memories of nine is given to paris 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.910
 I hope that what you have seen has 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.530
 more and that you will dive soon 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.530
 you even in the universe of remember no
