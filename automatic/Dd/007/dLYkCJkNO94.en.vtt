00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.059
 was already the 13 files and today too 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.059
 still friday 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.230
 Well, now we come to the red 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.930
 illustration in the navigation display the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:34.739
 related pages in the operating july 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:38.600
 at two are 613 and 614 as well as 691 to 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.600
 730 in pdf document 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.130
 Now it works 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.980
 to view the route in the navigation 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.420
 display can be displayed 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.920
 First, I'll switch over the engine 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.920
 lector on learning 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.450
 in the cdu display appear on the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:08.250
 longitudinal side at sk 6 the word cities 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.120
 I can painter every waypoint here 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.650
 center boats in navigation display 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.020
 in the top line I see through the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.490
 clue in tips that the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.350
 point as is currently centered in 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.350
 You can navigate to this navigation screen 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.660
 see rings at this distance too 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.670
 values ​​are displayed 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:33.360
 in the current setting is the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.990
 Inner ring of the 50 miles radius of the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.540
 outer 10 nautical miles now adjust 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.369
 I turn on the knobs 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.009
 Show area and you look at the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.009
 Ring how the display radius changes 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.970
 For example, now I have set to 80 and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.820
 the big ring shows a radius of 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.790
 will be altogether today 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.850
 80 miles in the entire display area 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.039
 so forward 40 and back 40 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.009
 people because the different ones 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.860
 display options in the net bonus show 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.560
 I then later see our good 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.500
 continue with the steps by step 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.700
 looks wandered ctr note accordingly 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.410
 with the last waypoint bad so up to 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.800
 which we had programmed our route 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.990
 is now delicious from ibid s so the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.030
 stuttgart airport 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.720
 Here then our star should be the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.010
 standard is based 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.170
 but we do not program them until im 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.940
 flight for now is not sure 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.730
 which country direction in Stuttgart to 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.020
 available 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.209
 what information will be nonetheless 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.130
 everything displayed 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.660
 Here you can see that the ad 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.660
 is aligned to the north 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.739
 there we have this plane symbol that 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:15.980
 shows us in which direction ours 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:19.280
 plane is up here on the left is gs 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.590
 for ground speed that 's zero because we 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.310
 Do not move us 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.489
 In addition, the values for true speed tas 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.349
 below that are wind direction slash 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.900
 wind speed are there now 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.980
 delete because these values ​​are not at the moment 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.370
 can be calculated 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.349
 right is the active waypoint so 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.709
 the waypoint of the next reached 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.140
 should be that now 600 in brackets 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.090
 means that, strictly speaking 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.030
 no effect but one 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.390
 Reference point to our departure 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.650
 The procedure is supposed to be on the spot 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.049
 plane to reach a height of 600 feet 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.329
 the dashes with the z mean behind it 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.069
 that the time we reach this point 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.959
 should not be reported 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.000
 is not a miracle? 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.200
 how should the computer know how long 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.480
 we are still here with the dry 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.030
 stop the theory 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.609
 the nordic ones among them is the 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.550
 current removal of our current 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:24.349
 position to this reference or waypoint 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.690
 you can also see this in the cdu display 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:29.840
 worth and in addition one more 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.950
 indication of direction the indication is in 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.960
 magenta because it is the active waypoint 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.740
 the 600 right is the height with the 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.270
 this way point should be reached 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.940
 standing at the other waypoints 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.780
 dash because here is no exact height 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.510
 required 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.250
 the strokes are in front of the slash 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.039
 for any prescribed 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.900
 speeds in the place the 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.150
 Distance which is still displayed here above 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.270
 are the distances between the 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.370
 waypoint over the waypoints on the 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.530
 the left side is still the direction of the 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.889
 connection from one to the other way 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.889
 Point 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.460
 For example we see that we move from ceuta to 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.930
 warburg to come 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:28.140
 a right turn from 173 degrees to 2 133 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.850
 Grad will continue to wacks 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:35.010
 turn back to 186 degrees 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.180
 navigation display you can see it on the 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.180
 magenta line 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.950
 then we have to pass through the 13th 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.620
 Part of this video tutorials done 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.940
 and we'll meet again at four 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.940
 partly for me
