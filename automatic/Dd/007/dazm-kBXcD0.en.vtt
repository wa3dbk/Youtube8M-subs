00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
going to go through and gonna look for

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.190 
going to go through and gonna look for
the<00:01:20.369> odd<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.790> out<00:01:20.820> all<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.110> gonna

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the odd one out all right so you gonna

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.810 
the odd one out all right so you gonna
go<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.380> there's<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.590> bunch<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.250> black<00:01:23.430> cards

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
go if there's a bunch of black cards

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.370 
go if there's a bunch of black cards
there's<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.540> bunch<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.810> red<00:01:25.020> look<00:01:25.200> at<00:01:25.290> there

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
there's a bunch of red look at there

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
there's a bunch of red look at there
there's<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:25.770> card<00:01:26.040> that's<00:01:26.340> odd<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:26.729> even

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
there's one card that's odd one out even

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
there's one card that's odd one out even
if<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.750> get<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.610> there's<00:01:29.610> one<00:01:29.820> card

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
if you get it like that there's one card

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.460 
if you get it like that there's one card
that's<00:01:30.180> going<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.450> odd<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.170> really

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
that's going to be odd so it's really

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.460 
that's going to be odd so it's really
really<00:01:31.680> simple<00:01:32.509> that's<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.689> card<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.200> build

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
