00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.889
 urania astronomy and astronautics newsletter edited by the institute 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.670
 national astrophysicist 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.670
 from found by luca nobili and elena lazzaretto 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:16.689
 which is the frida star homo a few days ago the title has passed one 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:17.570
 brown dwarf 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.659
 I lost temperatures of just 25 degrees 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:25.109
 space telescope of the infrared mass has been found to be serious trouble 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.689
 able to identify the coldest and least luminous celestial objects 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.720
 present in the universe as dwarfs as are common stars 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.440
 gas 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.440
 but they are too small to add sufficient pressures and temperatures to 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.600
 triggering the thermonuclear reactions necessary to turn them on 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.850
 so I don't get any stars but they go out slowly emitting weak 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.750
 I love infrared radiation representing a cross between star and planet 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.980
 gas giant have taken on an increasingly important role 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 as part of the tranitalia stellar function study 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.270
 white's so far found 100 new brown dwarfs besides that of temperature 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.590
 record of only 25 degrees despite another that seen from the sun 9 light years 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.870
 slightly more than twice the nearest star our proxima centauri 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.400
 at this rate it is not foolish to imagine that the space telescope is me 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.940
 I can discover even less distant 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.160
 perhaps closer than the designer proxima centauri amo 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.380
 a weak one. luminous, almost invisible even at the telescope 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.920
 a million times weaker than any star visible to the naked eye 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.850
 without warning from one day to the next it always gets brighter 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.000
 more. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.650
 that bright spot was the star that reached the final stages of its own 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.930
 evolution that ended in the most violent spectacular way with one 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.910
 very bright exclusion 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.460
 in other words a supernova 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.930
 this is the discovery made on August 24th almost in real time as soon as it is done for 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.100
 say 21 million light-years away in the galaxy by turning this one 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.460
 supernova you electrified the entire astronomical community 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.319
 the explosion tested registered by automatic instrumentation which performs 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.409
 night sky scans 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.389
 data is analyzed by computers that can recognize interesting events 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:29.559
 like this, report them automatically send the coordinates to the telescopes of 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.029
 Worldwide 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.879
 the brightness of the supernova will increase the next few days 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.410
 hundreds of telescopes will not lose sight of it and they will be added on 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.409
 weekend also space telescope in bolzano 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:50.089
 watching someone eat generally is not polite but nobody will 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:54.789
 reproaches the orbiting telescope suift of nasa and instead deserves warm 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:55.819
 applause 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.499
 sister observed an extra large black hole in Italy and in the act of swallowing 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:02.249
 if a star 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:06.429
 in the sissa universe these are things that happen but this is the first time 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:10.139
 that such an event is observed from beginning to end 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:15.279
 the star came to be within the influence of the black hole a move that 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.269
 in he left no way out 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.879
 was first crushed i disrupted and subsequently swallowed 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.269
 it is all generated a considerable emission of radiations x is yes 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.079
 formed two high-energy jets one of which is facing our direction 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:36.489
 a fortune that allowed suites to weed all in detail if this 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.919
 high meal was carefully studied and reconstructed and merit 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.509
 also Italian are 17 bellina and asÃ¬ astrophysicists 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.509
 involved in the analysis of what sarmato don't speak 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:53.399
 and with this it is all from the editorial staff of urania a good continuation 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.290
 urania vivastreet I won the next edition 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.319
