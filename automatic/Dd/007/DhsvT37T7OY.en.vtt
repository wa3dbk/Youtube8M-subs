00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 apply excess network to it 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.120
 today for a very video 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.429
 particular remember this plane 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.219
 that I did in tutorials and I had 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.509
 an improvement I made on xbox 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.099
 so I managed to find a 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.839
 improvement which is really that gives 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.830
 really pep 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.740
 so we'll take some red wool 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.180
 always from towards the stairs you 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.680
 can turn the stone slab on 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.119
 keep the cut stones you can 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.300
 to turn I think we will not need 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.640
 we will see after you announce allow 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.380
 as usual two of the authors like that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.550
 you broke the first you have 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:43.200
 asked you did 9 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:45.780
 as I will do the 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.860
 here is after doing that already well 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.640
 you played well in hockey 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.660
 no seriously go hop we put this here 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.570
 so it's a short improvement but 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.750
 well then we do exactly the same 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.640
 and they, on the other hand, must 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.380
 wings either save the same or chelsea 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.239
 Saturday night but in any case Fougasse 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.770
 devices up 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.320
 you try to do them well because 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.900
 if they wanted to miss after that will be more 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.150
 there it will be much more well I bump 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.930
 no we do not care so then 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.690
 you put one here you put it like that 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:25.010
 3 3 1 2 basically you was like that 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.170
 then you are doing here as it goes 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.979
 really wings and you put one on 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.979
 here below 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.330
 right here 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.150
 then 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.570
 do not hesitate to cover here with stone 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.680
 slabs 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.150
 finally two stone slabs earlier 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.500
 so here we do not put it because it will do 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.520
 maybe not pretty we'll try if you 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.330
 want but I did not do them on 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.640
 my thing 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.900
 it's not pretty at all around 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.380
 too precisely and that's what is 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.780
 problem on the plane so here goes hop 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.750
 we put back 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.780
 then we also put if I forgot here 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.610
 here is it 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.760
 then to make the trains 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.990
 landing so you take the 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.470
 randall feet you put it like that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.470
 so it's all stupid but it's not bad 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.110
 then the same you put in there and a 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.000
 the middle jelly this no so I believe 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.640
 and a rag 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.800
 for it to be good yeah no actually 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.900
 there I really liked it too much middle then 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.159
 we know it's here 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.620
 really there it's better here it is 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.540
 perfect so then when you have 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.129
 finished that you have more than one thing to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.560
 to make forgotten gardens every time the 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.290
 to put something here here is indeed 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.420
 we will do better we will also put the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.110
 double 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.670
 with the front here is the front you do 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.120
 already like apple the eagle you see this 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.280
 that I mean 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.440
 So here it is then it's done 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.450
 it starts to get weird but it 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.020
 already does more fighter planes with the 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.250
 nil pic 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.380
 I can assure you that it's more 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.300
 they have hunting so we put a 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.380
 double thickness here I think it can 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.870
 to be better we take off then we 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.920
 remove am here I test at the same time 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.690
 some little tricks because there are some 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.120
 stuff I did not do on the solo 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.880
 finally we on xbox to eat stuff that 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.870
 I did not do so here after I had 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.670
 price of the alumina of sagemor 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.600
 avalanche 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.780
 it's important what I do advertising 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.430
 games on xbox so suddenly I try 2 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.370
 to light the hand possible so here 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.510
 I put it here even if it does not look pretty 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.000
 at least 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.620
 sykes will eliminate a bit so then 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.569
 would have gone to smoke so the canvas 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.260
 of spider we put length here at 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.360
 center 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.439
 do not forget the center here there or that 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.280
 normally you asked 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.970
 vauzelle you have the second here there 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.860
 that I am aiming 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.500
 and you will put the canvases 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.420
 of spiders also crossed m canvases 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.130
 of spiders there and put them shorter 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.150
 that this is it 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.340
 you have to put them shorter because 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.870
 if you put them longer actually 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.160
 because that's actually it's for 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.200
 explain but it's all stupid but it's 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.260
 like that actually when you would be voting 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.090
 you their actors from this plane it is 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.490
 at the most powerful center and in addition to 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.470
 it's not that the most powerful is the one 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.840
 time I got stuck in more 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.890
 the one in the center is who is more 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.170
 far backwards 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.390
 so it's the one who will necessarily go 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.750
 further and so him that this is two 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.190
 boxes 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.390
 they will go into the sale of boxes less 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.500
 far so Norman I do not know how to fuck 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.150
 also here is normally it's 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.620
 perfect so that's it makes you a plane 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.760
 hunting but this time so we can 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.870
 still not go into what I read 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.370
 a comment on the video we 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.010
 could not fit in yes we can 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.170
 not go in but at least but he 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.820
 is well at least he is he serves as 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.830
 decoration so it's useless to 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.610
 looking to get in it serves more 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.980
 of deco than anything else 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.880
 good after you can do an airplane 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.520
 bigger than that for sure it's 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.060
 feasible but I would not do where you 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.129
 can excuse me wait i 'm doing that 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.179
 go break 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.830
 we fold web page that opens 

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:54.439
 traumato tome actively is very 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.059
 boring we must already it's much better 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.189
 the one on the left compared to the one on the left 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:00.050
 right so here I do it exactly 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:01.219
 like that in my tutorial it was ugly 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.949
 see that this one is a 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:04.330
 rather pretty improvement finally better in 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.229
 any case 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.550
 so after that I thought we could 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.419
 also put in there to hide the red 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.239
 but in fact I thought it was 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.649
 ugly so I'm not sure I can be 

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:13.749
 still an improvement so as well as 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:17.330
 maybe you should still have a video of 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:19.819
 two studios one that I think I 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.749
 will settle this match 3 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:25.819
 video one in two and where everything is beautiful and 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:27.529
 hot everyone was network on 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.719
 find himself for the next video so 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.379
 soon Norman will be a hunter games 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.379
 come on everybody
