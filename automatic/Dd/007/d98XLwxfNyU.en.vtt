00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.610
 they will visit some of the cities and in the centers and neighborhoods 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.859
 neighbors are visible in 3d on gogole arf 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.929
 in doing so we will discuss how your municipality could make use of 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.390
 cocaine 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.870
 to offer an attractive 3D vision to the public 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.010
 to private sector professionals to visitors and even to its different 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.249
 services 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.929
 starting with wildlife partly because she 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.080
 its location and topography 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.830
 we make this city of 5000 inhabitants a historic destination imagine 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.420
 how a 3d modeling would accompany its growth facilitating 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.970
 planning decisions and guaranteeing the preservation of its 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:41.900
 character 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.309
 imagine how a 3d modeling on aof gogol 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.760
 could facilitate decision-making about a construction project 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.930
 in your city 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.890
 all stakeholders municipal councilors to associations 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.330
 would benefit from a new perspective on the impact of the project on 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.330
 the neighborhood 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.530
 and participation in the planning process could expand 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.590
 in the case of a city as crucial 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.850
 it is also useful to be able to visualize the terrain with or without 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.869
 buildings the surrounding mountains forman natural amphitheater 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.960
 which contributes to the attractiveness of the city for its visitors as for its 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.689
 inhabitants 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.679
 there again the faculty to apprehend the real topography of your city thanks 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.750
 a model of the field would better perceive the impact of a project 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.000
 immovable 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.039
 are we now going to upset in the colorado 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.409
 we have another example of the interest of a representation of the 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.070
 ground 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.939
 right here 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.829
 explain the relationship between natural landscapes and zone boundaries 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.240
 administrative 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.550
 turns out to be a valuable analytic tool 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.530
 while we visit a voltaire mall imagine power 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.110
 propose a 3D view of the shopping district of your city 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.230
 this could allow you to attract new businesses and 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.600
 guide in choosing their location a 3d model is no longer as stimulating 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.320
 the economic activity of a city by offering to all those who think of 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.710
 visit also install an anticipated vision of its center and its 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.029
 neighborhoods 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.509
 here is a real view of a shopping district to revitalize 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:24.349
 as you see this model is rich in details about the location and the 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.699
 facades each store 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:30.009
 another flip jump brings us to japan 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.590
 they balk is a living metropolis 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.590
 of a prodigious auckland historical and political value 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:38.709
 for Japanese baseball fans 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.950
 this is also the opinion of the toyo map steal my stadium based team 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.799
 built in 1957 in the heart of the city 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.359
 a new stadium in spain is under construction for the 2009 season in 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.540
 close to a major railway station 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.580
 a 3d modeling that not only and help in the implementation of such 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.030
 project but it can not also be a valuable resource for the various 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.320
 parties involved in managing a complete facility 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.169
 contractor 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:12.489
 responsible for the facilities and the provider do we have together a 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.689
 effective joint tool for renovation work 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.689
 maintenance operations or deliveries 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.480
 although the images of building facades lack details 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.930
 their dimensions can be useful to visualize anima a little particular a 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.740
 district 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.740
 where the cityscape as a whole 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:37.709
 driving us now do astana named capital of kazakhstan after the 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.189
 fall of the Soviet Union in 1994 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.810
 we can appreciate here how a 3d model 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.200
 and as soon as a local government coordinates its evaluation services 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.200
 from taxes to garbage collection 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.939
 concluding this demonstration with a return to Germany 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.069
 the 3d model of combourg 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.230
 with him thousands of buildings offering his potential visitors a 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.709
 foresight of this spectacular historic city 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.149
 the virtual flyby of these beautiful laminated channels a tourist has found 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:15.149
 the ideal pied-Ã -terre as this hotel 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:20.379
 the sophisticated 3d model of repaying during the stock exchange reflects the 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.870
 popularity of gogol services around the world

 when your city benefits from 3d modeling on google cars 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.270
 millions of people around the world can visit it online
