00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.470
 very good to all kids who are 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.269
 I bring you here a new always black 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.320
 ops with the new camouflage that has come out 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.510
 of the cyborg 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.090
 that I have it here at n 94 that the 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.540
 it's true that it's going very well I love the 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.210
 camouflage on this weapon and see that encompasses 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.890
 let's go here we are 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.080
 arms race 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.419
 the bad as you know this in this way 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.430
 games that only 75 points ends very 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.750
 very fast then if you carry gaps 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.450
 tall 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.750
 with more arrived I now good highs are 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.040
 you have to get out pretty fast because if 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.340
 the game is not over and you stay 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.340
 socks 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.370
 As you can see, it 's super cool 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.360
 camouflage in this 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.580
 in this weapon 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.560
 and in the mouth and good is that actually 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.170
 also I have all seen it in peace in 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:58.820
 many ballistic cars oregon 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.820
 and they are quite pretty 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.329
 I do not really know why I'm staying 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.460
 I stay here, it's customary to play 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.990
 domain that I stay around haunting 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.990

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.359
 one 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:29.660
 but the car in the face 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.660

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.070

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.070

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.140
