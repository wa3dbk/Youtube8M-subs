00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.460
 the next song is she too 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.070
 Enough has become known because 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.350
 there was a time when we drove 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.230
 with these concerts she also appeared in 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.840
 the times of our trips to Ukraine and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.840
 and beyond that this river 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:37.580
 life flows to life 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.530
 two to give 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.890
 still life tariq 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.890
 grace 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.420
 wanting always lived 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.539
 I 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.080
 not 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.800
 we 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.800
 I wish 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.229
 mummy 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.760
 here's D major chick taken again with 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.970
 lower step with open string 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.970
 me 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.509
 I will now compile in G major 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.509
 way 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:54.070
 that is, I take a quart below 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:57.070
 so he has a little dress here but sometimes I 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.070
 I use 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.990
 on him an image like chord sound 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.129
 getting more so rich i 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.640
 the difficulty I see is that I am not 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:16.950
 sometimes there in the second in the 3 chorus i play 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.950
 rock and roll yana 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.950
 Yes 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.980
 but you can not play 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.650
 that is, I in Chor major take not fall 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.170
 I 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.720
 me at the end of it 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.880
 grandfather 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.970
 you walk 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.590
 again with this open string media here 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.590
 so it all sounds
