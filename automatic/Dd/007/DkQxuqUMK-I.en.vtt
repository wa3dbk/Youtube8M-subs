00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
four dragons alright so my opinion on

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.670 
four dragons alright so my opinion on
the<00:00:56.039> low<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.489> dragons<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.140> think<00:00:58.530> you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the low for dragons is that I think you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.139 
the low for dragons is that I think you
might<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:58.949> able<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.250> use<00:00:59.309> them<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> little<00:00:59.879> bit

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
might be able to use them a little bit

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.660 
might be able to use them a little bit
but<00:01:00.719> with<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.739> err<00:01:01.920> sweepers<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
but with the to the to err sweepers and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.270 
but with the to the to err sweepers and
you<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:05.820> level<00:01:06.290> seven<00:01:07.290> defenses<00:01:07.979> air

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
you know level seven defenses air

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.429 
you know level seven defenses air
defenses<00:01:08.790> even<00:01:09.060> at<00:01:09.150> level<00:01:09.390> 6<00:01:09.689> feel<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.229> them

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
defenses even at level 6 feel for them

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.149 
defenses even at level 6 feel for them
it's<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> be<00:01:11.460> hard<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.979> use<00:01:13.979> an

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
it's really going to be hard to use an

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.100 
it's really going to be hard to use an
awl<00:01:14.310> dragon<00:01:14.820> tech<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.330> honestly<00:01:15.570> don't<00:01:15.960> think

a clan castle troop you know for certain

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.460 
a clan castle troop you know for certain
things<00:01:35.299> but<00:01:36.299> personally<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.020> don't

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.310 
things but personally I just don't
really<00:01:38.150> really<00:01:39.150> think<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.720> that's<00:01:39.990> such<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
really really think that that's such a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.600 
really really think that that's such a
big<00:01:40.530> upgrade<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.009> know<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.220> there's<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.579> know

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610

another 20 or 40 damage per second maybe

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.370 
another 20 or 40 damage per second maybe
some<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:44.909> health<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.509> guess<00:01:46.229> we're<00:01:46.350> just

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
