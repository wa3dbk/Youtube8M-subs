00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
guitar I had I had a little bit of

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.120 
guitar I had I had a little bit of
weirdness<00:05:57.760> with<00:05:58.180> this<00:05:58.360> part<00:05:58.660> here<00:05:59.080> is<00:05:59.830> being

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
weirdness with this part here is being

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.160 
weirdness with this part here is being
too<00:06:00.340> high<00:06:00.550> but<00:06:00.910> that<00:06:00.940> allowed<00:06:01.390> my<00:06:01.630> bridge<00:06:01.960> to

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
too high but that allowed my bridge to

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.930 
too high but that allowed my bridge to
come<00:06:02.350> rollin<00:06:02.740> I<00:06:02.770> had<00:06:03.040> to<00:06:03.190> tweak<00:06:03.490> the<00:06:03.700> neck<00:06:03.910> a

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
come rollin I had to tweak the neck a

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.640 
come rollin I had to tweak the neck a
little<00:06:04.210> bit<00:06:04.330> and<00:06:04.570> really<00:06:04.930> it's<00:06:05.080> probably<00:06:05.230> due

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
little bit and really it's probably due

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.820 
little bit and really it's probably due
to<00:06:05.800> atmospheric<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.930> the<00:06:08.110> I<00:06:08.140> mean<00:06:08.530> I'm<00:06:08.590> sorry

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
to atmospheric the the I mean I'm sorry

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.260 
to atmospheric the the I mean I'm sorry
climactic<00:06:09.400> change<00:06:09.670> it<00:06:09.820> came<00:06:09.970> from<00:06:10.120> Florida

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
climactic change it came from Florida

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.380 
climactic change it came from Florida
came<00:06:10.660> up<00:06:10.810> here<00:06:10.930> to<00:06:11.020> Michigan<00:06:11.610> and<00:06:12.610> the<00:06:13.120> weather

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
came up here to Michigan and the weather

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.260 
came up here to Michigan and the weather
here<00:06:13.810> is<00:06:13.930> changing<00:06:14.350> for<00:06:14.590> fall<00:06:14.830> and<00:06:15.130> I<00:06:15.820> just<00:06:16.060> I

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
here is changing for fall and I just I

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.420 
here is changing for fall and I just I
think<00:06:16.330> it<00:06:16.570> played<00:06:16.780> havoc<00:06:16.990> with<00:06:17.170> the<00:06:17.410> wood<00:06:17.620> I

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
think it played havoc with the wood I

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.910 
think it played havoc with the wood I
can't<00:06:19.000> really<00:06:19.240> comment<00:06:19.840> too<00:06:20.170> much<00:06:20.350> more<00:06:20.650> on

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.420 
can't really comment too much more on
that<00:06:20.950> because<00:06:22.260> the<00:06:23.260> guitar<00:06:23.410> is<00:06:23.710> changing<00:06:24.280> I

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
that because the guitar is changing I

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.150 
that because the guitar is changing I
can<00:06:24.610> tell<00:06:24.850> it<00:06:25.120> like<00:06:25.240> every<00:06:25.450> left<00:06:26.050> it<00:06:26.170> in<00:06:26.290> the<00:06:26.410> in

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
can tell it like every left it in the in

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.280 
can tell it like every left it in the in
the<00:06:28.000> basement<00:06:28.420> for<00:06:28.450> a<00:06:28.600> while<00:06:28.780> I<00:06:28.810> left<00:06:29.080> it<00:06:29.200> in

the case for a while that's why it took

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.430 
the case for a while that's why it took
so<00:06:31.210> long<00:06:31.240> because<00:06:31.510> when<00:06:31.690> I<00:06:31.720> first<00:06:32.020> got<00:06:32.200> it<00:06:32.350> I

sudden<00:07:08.920> and<00:07:09.100> it's<00:07:09.250> I<00:07:09.370> think<00:07:09.400> it's<00:07:09.820> because<00:07:10.180> of

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
sudden and it's I think it's because of

sudden and it's I think it's because of
the<00:07:10.390> weather<00:07:10.660> I<00:07:10.990> think<00:07:11.590> it's<00:07:11.740> because<00:07:12.070> our

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
the weather I think it's because our

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.870 
the weather I think it's because our
weather<00:07:12.610> here<00:07:12.820> is<00:07:12.940> cold<00:07:13.300> and<00:07:13.510> wet<00:07:14.730> typical<00:07:15.730> for
