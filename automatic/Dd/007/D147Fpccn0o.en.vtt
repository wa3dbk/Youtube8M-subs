00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
but basically what I'm trying to say is

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.690 
but basically what I'm trying to say is
that<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.940> integration<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.560> mean<00:01:56.459> in<00:01:56.640> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
that the integration I mean in this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.359 
that the integration I mean in this
evolution<00:01:57.270> doesn't<00:01:57.450> bring<00:01:58.409> much<00:01:58.799> davidon

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
evolution doesn't bring much davidon

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.120

success<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.090> drawer<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:01.049> even<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.100> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
success the drawer so and even that is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.070 
success the drawer so and even that is
also<00:02:02.369> easy

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
also easy

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.430

I<00:02:06.470> send<00:02:06.710> game<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.040> draw<00:02:07.310> because<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.910> I

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
I send game to a draw because that I

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.120 
I send game to a draw because that I
should<00:02:08.750> give<00:02:08.990> myself<00:02:09.140> some<00:02:09.350> space<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.950> make

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.690 
I might be wrong but yeah this isn't
going<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.120> change<00:02:50.150> check<00:02:51.070> it's<00:02:52.070> a<00:02:52.190> profit<00:02:52.520> or

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
going to change check it's a profit or

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.980 
going to change check it's a profit or
not<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.810> mean<00:02:53.990> number<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.590> be<00:02:54.830> about<00:02:55.160> 3<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:56.150> 4<00:02:56.930> I

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
not so I mean number to be about 3 a 4 I

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.490 
not so I mean number to be about 3 a 4 I
mean<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.440> something<00:02:57.770> like<00:02:58.280> this<00:02:58.430> possible

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
mean is it something like this possible

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.050 
mean is it something like this possible
because<00:03:00.500> it's<00:03:00.650> kinda<00:03:00.920> be<00:03:01.250> better<00:03:01.430> for<00:03:01.640> blacks

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
because it's kinda be better for blacks

than taking yeah because this position

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.950 
than taking yeah because this position
yeah<00:03:33.950> this<00:03:34.160> will<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:34.940> was<00:03:35.330> little<00:03:35.570> bit<00:03:35.780> tricky

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
yeah this will I was little bit tricky

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.620 
yeah this will I was little bit tricky
because<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.320> eighth<00:03:37.100> i<00:03:37.280> was<00:03:37.490> kinda<00:03:37.850> maybe

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
because the eighth i was kinda maybe

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.750 
because the eighth i was kinda maybe
maybe<00:03:39.110> more<00:03:39.380> at<00:03:39.500> five<00:03:39.710> percent<00:03:40.070> because<00:03:40.160> for

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
maybe more at five percent because for

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.200 
maybe more at five percent because for
example<00:03:40.790> one<00:03:41.210> more<00:03:41.420> biz<00:03:41.540> days<00:03:42.490> then<00:03:43.490> what<00:03:44.030> you

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
example one more biz days then what you

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.790 
example one more biz days then what you
do<00:03:44.270> is<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:45.230> in<00:03:45.770> case<00:03:46.130> for<00:03:46.640> this<00:03:47.600> in<00:03:48.410> if<00:03:48.590> this

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
do is you in case for this in if this

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.880 
do is you in case for this in if this
and<00:03:49.040> f5<00:03:49.400> take<00:03:50.270> in<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.930> fire<00:03:51.110> king<00:03:51.380> buffet<00:03:51.680> girl

and f5 take in the fire king buffet girl

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.620 
and f5 take in the fire king buffet girl
so<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.280> mean<00:03:52.670> move<00:03:52.880> okay<00:03:53.570> so<00:03:54.490> yeah<00:03:55.490> not<00:03:55.970> sure<00:03:56.150> but

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
so I mean move okay so yeah not sure but

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.510 
so I mean move okay so yeah not sure but
leave<00:03:57.320> this<00:03:58.540> possibly<00:03:59.540> something<00:03:59.810> like<00:04:00.020> this

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
leave this possibly something like this

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.570 
leave this possibly something like this
yo<00:04:01.520> do<00:04:01.580> something<00:04:02.060> slightly<00:04:02.240> unpleasant<00:04:02.630> or

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
yo do something slightly unpleasant or

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.330 
yo do something slightly unpleasant or
if<00:04:04.580> i<00:04:04.700> play<00:04:04.910> example<00:04:05.540> might<00:04:05.690> be<00:04:05.830> three<00:04:06.830> then

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
if i play example might be three then

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.230 
if i play example might be three then
like<00:04:07.850> g6<00:04:08.660> I<00:04:09.050> mean<00:04:09.370> might<00:04:10.370> be<00:04:10.580> some<00:04:10.850> sort<00:04:11.090> of

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
like g6 I mean might be some sort of

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.900 
like g6 I mean might be some sort of
yeah<00:04:11.990> the<00:04:12.140> problem<00:04:12.290> is<00:04:12.500> if<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:12.830> go<00:04:13.010> here<00:04:13.490> there

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
yeah the problem is if I go here there

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.229 
yeah the problem is if I go here there
is<00:04:14.030> this<00:04:14.270> and<00:04:14.600> like<00:04:15.560> be<00:04:15.740> seven<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.549> this<00:04:17.060> could

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
is this and like be seven and this could

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.400

battalions oh for sure composer get
tricky<00:04:34.510> so<00:04:35.410> okay<00:04:35.620> I<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.770> show<00:04:36.160> some<00:04:36.370> precision

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
tricky so okay I to show some precision

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.850 
tricky so okay I to show some precision
because<00:04:36.970> here<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:37.570> idea<00:04:37.660> is<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:37.990> yeah

because here the idea is that yeah
there's<00:04:39.070> this<00:04:39.520> bonus<00:04:39.940> for<00:04:40.390> is<00:04:40.510> vulnerable

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
there's this bonus for is vulnerable

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.750 
there's this bonus for is vulnerable
because<00:04:41.080> example<00:04:41.920> in<00:04:42.040> this<00:04:42.130> kind<00:04:42.340> of<00:04:42.370> position

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
because example in this kind of position

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.810 
because example in this kind of position
I<00:04:42.910> can<00:04:43.510> basically<00:04:44.290> never<00:04:44.620> take<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.040> because

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
I can basically never take it because

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.420 
I can basically never take it because
the<00:04:46.750> night<00:04:46.930> is<00:04:46.960> trapped<00:04:47.290> okay<00:04:47.980> why<00:04:48.100> would<00:04:48.280> play
