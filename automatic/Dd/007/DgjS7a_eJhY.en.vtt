it's<00:01:51.580> cut<00:01:51.790> it's<00:01:52.240> gonna<00:01:52.360> come<00:01:52.600> out<00:01:52.690> more<00:01:52.870> of

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
it's cut it's gonna come out more of

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.660 
it's cut it's gonna come out more of
like<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.110> spiral<00:01:53.380> rather<00:01:53.800> than<00:01:54.040> like<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.250> wavy

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
like a spiral rather than like a wavy

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.110 
like a spiral rather than like a wavy
finish<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.330> I'm<00:01:56.200> using<00:01:56.410> my<00:01:56.530> con<00:01:56.860> air<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:57.790> curl

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
finish and I'm using my con air you curl

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.020 
finish and I'm using my con air you curl
and<00:01:58.480> I'm<00:01:59.110> pretty<00:01:59.410> sure<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.860> was<00:01:59.980> like<00:02:00.160> thirty

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
and I'm pretty sure it was like thirty

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.400 
and I'm pretty sure it was like thirty
dollars<00:02:01.420> when<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.630> got<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.930> but<00:02:02.020> I<00:02:02.080> got<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.290> like

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
dollars when I got it but I got it like

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.650 
dollars when I got it but I got it like
three<00:02:02.710> years<00:02:02.740> ago<00:02:03.130> when<00:02:04.120> it<00:02:04.150> was<00:02:04.300> like<00:02:04.510> more

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
three years ago when it was like more

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.330 
three years ago when it was like more
newer<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.470> um<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:07.150> how<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.450> get<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.870> wavy<00:02:08.340> kind

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
newer and um so how to get the wavy kind

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.460 
newer and um so how to get the wavy kind
of<00:02:09.490> thing<00:02:09.640> is<00:02:09.820> you<00:02:09.970> have<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.360> use<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:11.170> thick

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
of thing is you have to use a thick

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.380 
of thing is you have to use a thick
piece<00:02:11.740> of<00:02:11.770> hair<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.550> also<00:02:12.760> have<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.060> make<00:02:13.240> sure

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
piece of hair you also have to make sure

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.490 
piece of hair you also have to make sure
that<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.750> kind<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:13.990> keep<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.290> pieces

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
that you kind of keep the pieces

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.050 
that you kind of keep the pieces
separated<00:02:15.070> like<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.400> know<00:02:15.460> right<00:02:15.730> there<00:02:15.940> it

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
separated like I know right there it

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.760 
separated like I know right there it
looks<00:02:16.210> like<00:02:16.300> it's<00:02:16.510> trunk<00:02:16.780> together<00:02:17.110> but

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
looks like it's trunk together but

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.040 
looks like it's trunk together but
they're<00:02:17.920> all<00:02:18.100> separate<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:18.880> curls<00:02:19.480> like

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
they're all separate like curls like

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.660 
they're all separate like curls like
I'll<00:02:20.230> show<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.710> different<00:02:20.740> one<00:02:21.190> it's<00:02:21.610> a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
I'll show you in a different one it's a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.460 
I'll show you in a different one it's a
bad<00:02:21.820> example<00:02:21.940> let's<00:02:22.660> see<00:02:22.720> how<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.930> like<00:02:23.110> came

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
bad example let's see how it like came

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.970 
bad example let's see how it like came
out<00:02:23.590> like<00:02:23.800> wavy<00:02:24.070> it's<00:02:24.820> like<00:02:25.000> for<00:02:25.239> this<00:02:25.360> one<00:02:25.980> see

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
out like wavy it's like for this one see

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.680 
out like wavy it's like for this one see
how<00:02:27.100> it's<00:02:27.250> like<00:02:27.340> separated<00:02:27.910> right<00:02:28.060> there<00:02:28.270> you

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
how it's like separated right there you

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.120 
how it's like separated right there you
want<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.930> make<00:02:29.080> sure<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.500> your<00:02:29.590> hair<00:02:29.770> doesn't

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
lay flat you wanna make sure it's kind

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.170 
lay flat you wanna make sure it's kind
of<00:02:31.780> like<00:02:31.930> bunched<00:02:32.350> up<00:02:32.470> like<00:02:32.920> each<00:02:33.160> spiral<00:02:33.970> is

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
of like bunched up like each spiral is

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.270 
of like bunched up like each spiral is
bunched<00:02:34.660> up<00:02:34.780> in<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:35.200> plane<00:02:35.380> flat<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.220> it

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
bunched up in that plane flat so it

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.040 
bunched up in that plane flat so it
becomes<00:02:36.640> wavy<00:02:37.000> see<00:02:37.390> how<00:02:37.480> it's<00:02:37.660> like<00:02:37.750> bunched

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
becomes wavy see how it's like bunched

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.900 
becomes wavy see how it's like bunched
up<00:02:38.110> right<00:02:38.290> there<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:39.160> that's<00:02:39.520> what<00:02:39.790> you're

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
up right there so that's what you're

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.150 
up right there so that's what you're
going<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.150> want<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.510> do<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:41.080> you're<00:02:41.530> going<00:02:42.100> to
