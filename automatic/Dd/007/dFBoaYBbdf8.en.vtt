the<00:00:53.489> people<00:00:53.730> watching<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.210> was<00:00:54.360> probably

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the people watching that was probably

quite fun to watch quite entertaining

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.639 
quite fun to watch quite entertaining
but<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.840> change<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
but it's not really going to change the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.170 
but it's not really going to change the
mind<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.190> them<00:00:59.340> racing<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.820> go<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.030> play

state<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.539> decay<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.930> themselves<00:01:01.260> which<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
state of decay for themselves which is a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.160 
state of decay for themselves which is a
bit<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> shame<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.510> because<00:01:03.930> they

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
bit of a shame actually because they

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.590 
bit of a shame actually because they
probably<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:04.979> witnessed<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:06.090> game<00:01:06.360> at

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
probably just witnessed this game at

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.630 
probably just witnessed this game at
it's<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:06.900> very<00:01:07.500> best<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.369> didn't

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
it's very very best they just didn't

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.310 
it's very very best they just didn't
have<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.820> necessary<00:01:09.030> context<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> time

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.010 

attention<00:03:21.280> all<00:03:21.520> civilians<00:03:22.390> currently

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020

from<00:03:27.760> safety<00:03:28.330> but<00:03:28.540> really<00:03:28.840> I'm<00:03:28.930> just

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
from safety but really I'm just

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.750 
from safety but really I'm just
frustrated<00:03:29.319> with<00:03:30.040> how<00:03:30.160> long<00:03:30.190> it's<00:03:30.550> gonna<00:03:30.640> take

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
to run all the way back rather than

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.140 
to run all the way back rather than
being<00:03:32.560> worried<00:03:33.310> about<00:03:33.550> whether<00:03:33.760> or<00:03:33.910> not<00:03:34.000> I

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
being worried about whether or not I

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.059 
being worried about whether or not I
will<00:03:34.209> actually<00:03:34.780> make<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:35.680> see<00:03:35.830> at<00:03:35.920> this

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
will actually make it you see at this

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.920 
will actually make it you see at this
stage<00:03:36.340> we're<00:03:36.670> still<00:03:36.940> relatively<00:03:37.300> early<00:03:37.569> on<00:03:37.840> in

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
stage we're still relatively early on in

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.390 
stage we're still relatively early on in
the<00:03:38.019> campaign<00:03:38.349> and<00:03:38.620> most<00:03:38.830> of<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.099> zombies

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
the campaign and most of the zombies

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.949 
the campaign and most of the zombies
that<00:03:39.580> you<00:03:39.670> run<00:03:39.819> into<00:03:39.970> are<00:03:40.450> pretty

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
that you run into are pretty

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.570 
that you run into are pretty
straightforward<00:03:41.290> you've<00:03:41.860> got<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.160> typical

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
straightforward you've got the typical

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.699 
straightforward you've got the typical
zombies<00:03:42.910> like<00:03:43.120> this<00:03:43.300> fella<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.810> you've<00:03:44.410> also

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
zombies like this fella and you've also

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.470 
zombies like this fella and you've also
got<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.099> slightly<00:03:45.370> larger<00:03:45.670> variant<00:03:46.300> which

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
got the slightly larger variant which

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.699 
got the slightly larger variant which
can<00:03:46.630> still<00:03:46.840> be<00:03:46.900> stopped<00:03:47.230> with<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.440> single

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
can still be stopped with a single

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.280 
can still be stopped with a single
headshot<00:03:47.860> but<00:03:48.400> there<00:03:48.910> may<00:03:49.030> be<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.330> bit<00:03:49.840> trickier

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
headshot but there may be a bit trickier

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.720 
headshot but there may be a bit trickier
to<00:03:50.470> knock<00:03:50.620> off<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.890> feet<00:03:51.099> if<00:03:51.250> you're<00:03:51.400> going<00:03:51.519> in

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
to knock off the feet if you're going in

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.699 
to knock off the feet if you're going in
for<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.970> melee<00:03:52.330> however<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.319> most<00:03:53.440> obvious

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
for a melee however the most obvious

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.470 
for a melee however the most obvious
concern<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.220> had<00:03:54.430> was<00:03:54.459> these<00:03:54.880> zombie<00:03:55.209> hordes

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
concern I had was these zombie hordes

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.610 
concern I had was these zombie hordes
actually<00:03:55.840> even<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.200> most<00:03:56.319> bog-standard

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
actually even the most bog-standard

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.520 
actually even the most bog-standard
undead<00:03:57.370> can<00:03:57.910> be<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.330> problem<00:03:58.989> if<00:03:59.350> there's

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
undead can be a problem if there's

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.750 
undead can be a problem if there's
enough<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.860> them<00:03:59.920> but<00:04:00.130> look<00:04:00.280> at<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.519> a

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
enough of them but look at that a

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.570 
enough of them but look at that a
Molotov<00:04:01.450> takes<00:04:01.750> them<00:04:01.900> all<00:04:02.019> out<00:04:02.170> that's<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:03.069> was

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
Molotov takes them all out that's it was

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.250 
Molotov takes them all out that's it was

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
laugh it's the gear that he was using

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.540 
laugh it's the gear that he was using
and<00:04:50.380> how<00:04:50.410> he<00:04:50.500> played<00:04:50.800> differently<00:04:51.160> to<00:04:51.370> meijer

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.879 
and how he played differently to meijer
as<00:04:51.760> a<00:04:51.910> result<00:04:52.270> it's<00:04:52.570> that<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.050> decided<00:04:53.530> he<00:04:53.710> liked

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
as a result it's that I decided he liked

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.070 
as a result it's that I decided he liked
sports<00:04:54.160> cars<00:04:54.520> just<00:04:54.760> because<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:55.510> that<00:04:55.930> was

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
sports cars just because and that was

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.110 
sports cars just because and that was
auntie<00:04:56.350> bleep<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.710> reason<00:04:57.070> that<00:04:57.100> he<00:04:57.280> died<00:04:57.520> the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
auntie bleep the reason that he died the

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.700 
auntie bleep the reason that he died the
games<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.450> do<00:04:58.600> handle<00:04:58.960> permadeath<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.530> best

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
games that do handle permadeath the best

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.230 
games that do handle permadeath the best
in<00:04:59.889> my<00:04:59.979> opinion<00:05:00.010> are<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.460> ones<00:05:00.669> that<00:05:00.789> give<00:05:01.090> you

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
in my opinion are the ones that give you

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.000 
in my opinion are the ones that give you
that<00:05:01.419> room<00:05:01.660> to<00:05:01.900> grow<00:05:02.110> close<00:05:02.380> to<00:05:02.560> characters

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
that room to grow close to characters

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.279 
that room to grow close to characters
not<00:05:03.550> because<00:05:03.850> of<00:05:03.880> cutscenes<00:05:04.389> or<00:05:04.780> scripted

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
not because of cutscenes or scripted

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.469 
not because of cutscenes or scripted
moments<00:05:05.740> but<00:05:06.250> because<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.940> end<00:05:07.090> up<00:05:07.240> creating

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
moments but because you end up creating

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.930 
moments but because you end up creating
these<00:05:07.780> weird<00:05:08.110> personal<00:05:08.919> stories<00:05:09.340> that's<00:05:09.789> what

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
these weird personal stories that's what

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.430 
these weird personal stories that's what
makes<00:05:10.120> day<00:05:10.330> of<00:05:10.389> decay<00:05:10.630> worth<00:05:10.810> playing<00:05:11.110> it's

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
makes day of decay worth playing it's

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.050 
makes day of decay worth playing it's
not<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:11.650> very<00:05:11.889> pretty<00:05:12.070> video<00:05:12.400> game<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:12.789> it<00:05:12.850> does
