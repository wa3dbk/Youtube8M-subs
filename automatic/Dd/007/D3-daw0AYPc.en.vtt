00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:10.039
 Hann 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.609
 it starts 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.329
 Erfurt - 1 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:15.160
 Do plug 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.429
 from 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.849
 Of course, that's nothing to know 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.279
 I have a great Prof 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.279
 from or increased trunk of a class 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.640
 also fully functional 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.840
 close after hours 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.590
 it's probably a bit spectacular for our profile 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.750
 for the culture 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.050
 unfortunately can not claim only 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.520
 that's right or not enough light blown the disc 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.690
 finally electricity again 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.510
 I just have one 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.510
 Christianity is an external hard drive 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.490
 have nationwide 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.790
 the most important formats 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.790
 Let's see what will be the focus 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.930
 Christophe thoughtlessly 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.420
 Whistler 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.420
 prominent victims 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.900
 I am now quickly cleared 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.490
 Well, not 50,000 customers have you so the court 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.050
 I do not think that's so wild 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.070
 give way 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.780
 What Albert Koch already tested 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.640
 like key topic so just 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.870
 he stumbled 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.870
 the 12,000 euros occupied 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.030
 stunned 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200
 upstream 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 since it is a trauma 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.860
 what is happening 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.500
 my chance 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.500
 Meinhardt behaves similarly 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.469
 Hot is not just not wanting to change 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.529
 this game 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:03.309
 Opportunities 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.469
 have back there 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.349
 DAPD 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.349
 Vienna's Estonia seems unbroken 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.069
 the interests of Siemens have remained the worst 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.849
 as they eventually become 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.679
 only that we are here 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.120
 is to achieve this goal 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.830
 that does not work well 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.409
 the board had 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.960
 Weeks or so 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.869
 henceforth that would not be fair
