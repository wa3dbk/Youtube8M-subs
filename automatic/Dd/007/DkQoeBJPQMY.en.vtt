00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.820
 there are more ways in which we often do 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.440
 define referring to the color of the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.110
 our skin 1 and negro 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.910
 then there is black and then there is color on 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.890
 carmine nigro in its most form 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.150
 classical has a simple meaning 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.369
 racist was term was coined 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.130
 by people of white complexion so 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.169
 it is not a term we have given ourselves is a 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.470
 term that someone watching us from 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.939
 out 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.800
 this term has taken a turn 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.929
 different when in some environments they have 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.660
 began to use it as a synonym 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.640
 of brothers unlike the understood negotiation 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.220
 as in its classical form in this 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.440
 shape is different because why it is 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.270
 self-calling ie one of complexion 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.310
 dark with African origins that yes 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.680
 self-defining negro and this term 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.020
 often it is also used for 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.610
 define another person 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.710
 there is even if you were not a dark complexion 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.380
 common denominator to use 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.210
 this is this term for one 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.460
 dark-skinned person than one 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.590
 production of fair complexion and the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.329
 fact that they consider themselves brothers then 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.549
 the person of dark complexion from 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.250
 permission to use this term a 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.360
 another person who knows esteem 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.480
 so they took this word is the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.430
 you don't have the renovated year 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.580
 left a form of the identical term 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.860
 so negro but they changed the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.180
 content and there are two types of thoughts 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.590
 on this term one is the one 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.960
 this term would have in no 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.300
 case to be used should be 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.310
 banned completely demonized ho 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.020
 set aside remembered as something 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.520
 of simply brute in another 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.850
 school of thinking instead of this 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.340
 term can be used 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.260
 exorcised then sucking up everything 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.090
 the contents leave the form e 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.530
 retransform transform it with a new one 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.020
 meaning that not everyone can 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.810
 use is a kind of distinctive is 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.190
 a kind of is one is a recognition 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.200
 juice of the story they have 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.820
 changed the means there are those who think that 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.970
 this is however wrong because it is 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.260
 however offensive because why 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.970
 however the term negro is a word 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.680
 so powerful that really hard 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.600
 coming off I understand that both schools 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.850
 of thought, however, I understand more perhaps 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.229
 who has it who also decides to use it 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.780
 dinners without there will always be someone who 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.869
 do you want 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.770
 so banish it wanting nothing 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.200
 banish 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.090
 they are given to leave you negative power 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.670
 which has instead deconstruct it and 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.080
 taking away that negative power is good 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.950
 for no one has ever said the word of the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.470
 Negro term to say brother 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.360
 especially between a black and white create 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.230
 this absurd situation and how to create 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.130
 a new world is not necessarily a thing 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.420
 negative 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.430
 there is to do for example 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.380
 lately there is a boy costume of 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.300
 Senegalese origin who is trying to 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.459
 not clear this term, however 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.570
 restructuring it, that is, simple calls 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.570
 brunengo no problem 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.690
 this no this is not taking into account the 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.370
 history that at that term kg restructures 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.640
 takes into account the history of that term 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.620
 so it's 15 different shades of different 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.230
 then the negro then there is the term 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.390
 thousand people but it is the most suitable term 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.769
 if anyone needs to talk about one 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.709
 person and referring to his 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.569
 complexion for his black reasons 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.060
 I think it is the most suitable because it is black 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.160
 white two colors are equal all a 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.900
 instead there is the third word that can 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.700
 I think it is the most absurd the most 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.790
 second is the most problematic because it is 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.950
 of color is a term they use 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.049
 all is considered politically correct 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.470
 the problem of this term that one is 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.450
 a term like the initial negro in the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.850
 its most classic form is a term that 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.590
 therefore someone from outside gives us never is 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.959
 correct when I can give me a name 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.329
 because you have to tell me already caminero case 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.920
 need more color have no 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.700
 kind of sense ie in the right sense I have 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.190
 made a search 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.170
 I tried to understand what it means but 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.049
 I couldn't find a logical sense that 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.750
 minchia means color of color 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.730
 because of color I find racist senses 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.959
 I could make an endless list but not 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.560
 I find but I do not find a I do not find a 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.690
 correct logical sense clean for which 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.670
 It should call color color 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.410
 that because of color but in the sense of di 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.050
 color 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.940
 that is, if you want me to define me for 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.980
 my color is black but if not from 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.300
 this is a topic that should be 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.340
 in other words, there is a lot of relationship 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.200
 time to deepen it, however, would go 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.519
 deepened because we are we must 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.140
 throw the terms we want 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.370
 being called is not a person of the 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.410
 heart that calls you in color has 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.510
 the instinct of not wanting to offend you 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.100
 that hand at that moment is the 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.690
 what color calls you is why 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.610
 he doesn't have the weapons to call you another 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.500
 so so when someone calls you to 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.510
 color you should say with all the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.510
 gianni morandi kindness and calmness 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.860
 but because of color simply too 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.290
 this maybe a little provocative though 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.870
 I say find a way to Gianni Morandi 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.790
 to explain what color you don't want to 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.390
 homs is a meaning that I cannot 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.160
 right now to understand or perceive 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.300
 warn v according to me is among the three that 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.050
 absurd and what bothers me 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.780
 more 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.550
 but I repeat I believe that the first people 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.610
 use these to use this 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.980
 term because no one tells him but that 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.000
 fuck means that you ask for true me 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.430
 I always call in sympathy with so much 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.690
 love to the globe a go go however is a 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.260
 term on which a should be done 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.330
 reasoning because I repeat does not have a 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.250
 meaning does not have it right e 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.110
 feel-good is a good-sense term but a 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.690
 racist is good and the same in 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.280
 same but definitive at the same time 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.020
 He uttered the film is the preferred term 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.900
 black what I just can't stand anymore 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.390
 and color kills me instead 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.040
 the term negro and when it is 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.790
 we redevelop we give it a new one 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.070
 meaning 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.419
 It goes well where I feel a sense of 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.150
 brotherhood with the person who gives it to me 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.950
 if I don't feel it already it doesn't suit me anymore 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.330
 the term is rather blacker in the nel 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.310
 in its classic form to me 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.250
 honestly for 32 years it has not touched me 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.870
 not even video because logic always 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.060
 the one in the sense that ends us here 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.040
 we give power if one defines me in 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.720
 I have to accept the contents 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.540
 that way and offending her than that 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.910
 I think that is what are those 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.790
 I think I always have if one arrives and you 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.320
 he says fuck if he is an astronaut he is not 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.390
 that it becomes there is not mandatory that there 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.100
 so you don't know what you think 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.670
 you but I the one who can't stand anymore e 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.670
 of color
