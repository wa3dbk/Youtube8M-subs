couple<00:01:49.220> of<00:01:49.310> points<00:01:49.670> on<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:50.030> bottom<00:01:50.360> but

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
couple of points on the bottom but

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.740 
couple of points on the bottom but
that's<00:01:51.020> really<00:01:51.200> about<00:01:51.440> it<00:01:51.710> on<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:53.270> front<00:01:53.479> of

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
that's really about it on the front of

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.780 
that's really about it on the front of
course<00:01:53.990> we<00:01:54.200> have<00:01:54.409> a<00:01:54.440> very<00:01:54.620> attractive<00:01:55.130> flat

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
course we have a very attractive flat

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.149 
course we have a very attractive flat
design<00:01:56.210> just<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.600> little<00:01:56.870> bit<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.080> contour<00:01:57.979> out

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
design just a little bit of contour out

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.399 
design just a little bit of contour out
on<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.430> ends<00:01:58.790> here<00:01:59.180> and<00:01:59.360> one<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.260> these<00:02:00.380> e

Almohad<00:02:00.890> which<00:02:01.250> is<00:02:01.430> smart<00:02:01.880> is<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.170> don't

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
Almohad which is smart is you I don't

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.780 
Almohad which is smart is you I don't
know<00:02:03.350> if<00:02:03.380> you<00:02:03.470> can<00:02:03.620> really<00:02:03.740> see<00:02:04.010> it<00:02:04.100> here<00:02:04.250> but

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
know if you can really see it here but

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.240 
know if you can really see it here but
there<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:04.940> almost<00:02:05.150> like<00:02:05.360> little<00:02:05.979> poles<00:02:06.979> or

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
there is almost like little poles or

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.009 
there is almost like little poles or
rods<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.700> are<00:02:07.820> sticking<00:02:08.060> out<00:02:08.239> basically<00:02:08.929> the

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
rods that are sticking out basically the

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.500 
rods that are sticking out basically the
goal<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.679> that<00:02:09.709> is<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.010> not<00:02:10.459> let<00:02:10.700> this<00:02:10.910> get<00:02:11.150> bent

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
goal of that is to not let this get bent

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.850 
goal of that is to not let this get bent
I<00:02:11.780> don't<00:02:12.140> know<00:02:12.230> if<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.350> ever<00:02:12.380> Hatter<00:02:12.620> where

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
I don't know if you ever Hatter where

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.340 
I don't know if you ever Hatter where
you<00:02:13.010> have<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> 15-inch<00:02:13.820> speaker<00:02:14.269> and<00:02:14.600> something

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
you have a 15-inch speaker and something

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.020 
you have a 15-inch speaker and something
goes<00:02:15.530> through<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:16.310> bends<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.730> whole

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
goes through it and it bends the whole

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.699 
goes through it and it bends the whole
piece<00:02:17.330> because<00:02:17.660> there's<00:02:17.810> nothing<00:02:18.049> holding<00:02:18.620> it

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
piece because there's nothing holding it

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.740 
piece because there's nothing holding it
up<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.370> basically<00:02:19.730> that's<00:02:20.030> going<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.540> prevent

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
up so basically that's going to prevent

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.759 
up so basically that's going to prevent
that<00:02:20.870> from<00:02:20.989> happening

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
that from happening

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.880 
that from happening
real<00:02:22.340> nice<00:02:22.610> rugged<00:02:23.269> design<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:24.230> plastic<00:02:24.709> on

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
real nice rugged design the plastic on

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.250 
real nice rugged design the plastic on
this<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.549> same<00:02:25.820> plastic<00:02:26.150> design<00:02:26.900> or<00:02:27.170> the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
this is the same plastic design or the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.699 
this is the same plastic design or the
same<00:02:27.440> type<00:02:27.680> as<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.950> DVR<00:02:28.610> 10<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.450> when<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.440> first

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
same type as a DVR 10 and when you first

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.860 
same type as a DVR 10 and when you first
hold<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.370> does<00:02:31.640> not<00:02:31.940> feel<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:32.540> telling<00:02:32.780> you

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
hold it it does not feel but telling you

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.199 
hold it it does not feel but telling you
this<00:02:32.989> right<00:02:33.049> up<00:02:33.410> front<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.799> is<00:02:34.220> not<00:02:34.519> as<00:02:34.790> rugged

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
this right up front it is not as rugged

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.720 
this right up front it is not as rugged
as<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.780> other<00:02:35.930> speakers<00:02:36.440> Yamaha<00:02:37.250> will<00:02:37.519> tell

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
as the other speakers Yamaha will tell

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.190 
as the other speakers Yamaha will tell
you<00:02:37.850> this<00:02:38.000> that's<00:02:38.390> really<00:02:38.989> where<00:02:39.110> the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
you this that's really where the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.530 
you this that's really where the
difference<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.920> if<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:41.090> know<00:02:41.209> you're<00:02:41.390> looking

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
difference is if you know you're looking

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.910 
difference is if you know you're looking
for<00:02:41.870> something<00:02:42.080> they<00:02:42.290> can<00:02:42.440> take<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.650> lot<00:02:42.860> of

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
for something they can take a lot of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.890 
for something they can take a lot of
abuse<00:02:43.160> as<00:02:43.520> far<00:02:43.730> as<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:43.940> outer<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.870> outer

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
abuse as far as the outer the outer

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.270 
abuse as far as the outer the outer
shell<00:02:45.440> this

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
shell this

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.640 
shell this
is<00:02:46.400> not<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:47.030> that's<00:02:47.300> why<00:02:47.569> they<00:02:47.780> made<00:02:48.410> this

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
is not it that's why they made this

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.740 
is not it that's why they made this
where<00:02:48.950> it's<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.340> lower<00:02:49.520> pricepoint<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.360> that's

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
where it's a lower pricepoint and that's

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.320 
where it's a lower pricepoint and that's
the<00:02:50.959> one<00:02:51.140> sacrifices<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.370> all<00:02:52.580> do<00:02:52.790> are<00:02:52.970> using

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
the one sacrifices you all do are using

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.510 
the one sacrifices you all do are using
cheaper<00:02:54.050> type<00:02:54.260> of<00:02:54.380> plastic<00:02:54.830> but<00:02:55.250> it's<00:02:55.400> not

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
cheaper type of plastic but it's not

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.550 
cheaper type of plastic but it's not
cheap<00:02:55.819> in<00:02:56.000> quality<00:02:56.600> you<00:02:56.720> know<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.990> looks<00:02:57.290> good

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
cheap in quality you know it looks good

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.380 
cheap in quality you know it looks good
it's<00:02:57.920> not<00:02:58.459> just<00:02:58.700> going<00:02:58.819> to<00:02:58.910> break<00:02:59.150> when<00:02:59.360> you

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
it's not just going to break when you

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.970 
it's not just going to break when you
touch<00:02:59.780> it<00:03:00.050> it's<00:03:00.260> not<00:03:00.350> going<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.590> melt<00:03:00.770> in<00:03:00.890> the

touch it it's not going to melt in the

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.740 
touch it it's not going to melt in the
Sun<00:03:01.190> or<00:03:01.370> anything<00:03:01.610> silly<00:03:01.819> like<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.060> but<00:03:02.630> it's

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
Sun or anything silly like that but it's

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.470 
Sun or anything silly like that but it's
not<00:03:02.930> as<00:03:03.110> rugged<00:03:03.410> as<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.709> DXR<00:03:04.520> or<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:05.060> course<00:03:05.300> the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
not as rugged as a DXR or of course the

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.100 
not as rugged as a DXR or of course the
wooden<00:03:05.840> design<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.890> dsr<00:03:07.819> cabinet<00:03:08.510> the

wooden design of the dsr cabinet the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.690 
wooden design of the dsr cabinet the
handles<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.739> course<00:03:09.950> everything's<00:03:10.430> nicely

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
handles of course everything's nicely

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.210 
handles of course everything's nicely
weighted<00:03:11.209> so<00:03:11.810> there's<00:03:12.290> no<00:03:12.500> handle<00:03:12.860> on<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.040> top

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
weighted so there's no handle on the top

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.979 
weighted so there's no handle on the top
but<00:03:13.760> there<00:03:13.850> are<00:03:13.940> handles<00:03:14.300> on<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.510> side<00:03:14.690> you

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
but there are handles on the side you

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.470 
but there are handles on the side you
can<00:03:15.020> carry<00:03:15.440> one<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.010> them<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.310> each<00:03:16.430> hand<00:03:16.760> walk

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
can carry one of them on each hand walk

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.620 
can carry one of them on each hand walk
around<00:03:17.840> with<00:03:18.050> it<00:03:18.080> no<00:03:18.739> problem<00:03:19.250> there<00:03:19.459> for<00:03:20.239> a<00:03:20.269> 15

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630

around with it no problem there for a 15
inch<00:03:20.780> cabinet<00:03:21.320> this<00:03:21.500> guy<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.709> actually<00:03:21.890> pretty

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
inch cabinet this guy is actually pretty

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.310 
inch cabinet this guy is actually pretty
lightweight<00:03:22.550> too<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:23.570> that<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.900> one<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.230> the

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
lightweight too so that is one of the

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.960 
lightweight too so that is one of the
real<00:03:24.530> nice<00:03:24.709> things<00:03:24.950> about<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.370> series<00:03:25.790> if

for one reason or another all 15 inch
speakers<00:03:33.920> are<00:03:34.069> heavy<00:03:34.280> but<00:03:34.580> this<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.090> pretty

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
speakers are heavy but this is pretty

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.670 
speakers are heavy but this is pretty
lightweight<00:03:35.660> compared<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.380> some<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.650> the

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
lightweight compared to some of the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.770 
lightweight compared to some of the
other<00:03:36.830> ones<00:03:36.980> out<00:03:37.100> there<00:03:37.370> on<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.360> back<00:03:38.540> we<00:03:38.750> have

RCA and you have your through output now

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.000 
RCA and you have your through output now
if<00:03:56.720> you<00:03:56.810> didn't<00:03:57.049> see<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.200> other<00:03:57.380> video<00:03:57.680> this

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
if you didn't see the other video this

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.800 
if you didn't see the other video this
is<00:03:58.190> actually<00:03:58.519> pretty<00:03:58.670> cool<00:03:58.940> so<00:03:59.390> here's<00:03:59.570> what

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
is actually pretty cool so here's what

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.979 
is actually pretty cool so here's what
happens<00:04:00.140> when<00:04:00.320> I<00:04:00.590> have<00:04:00.829> this<00:04:01.040> clicked<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.640> it

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
happens when I have this clicked in it

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.479 
happens when I have this clicked in it
outputs<00:04:02.989> from<00:04:03.260> here<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.620> here<00:04:03.920> it'll<00:04:04.310> output

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
outputs from here to here it'll output

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.220 
outputs from here to here it'll output
it<00:04:04.790> through<00:04:05.299> these<00:04:05.420> extra<00:04:05.720> large<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:06.019> I<00:04:06.049> can

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
it through these extra large so I can

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.509 
it through these extra large so I can
daisy<00:04:06.410> chain<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:06.950> next<00:04:07.190> speaker

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
daisy chain to the next speaker

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.699 
daisy chain to the next speaker
if<00:04:07.970> I<00:04:08.120> only<00:04:08.269> have<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.570> on<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.989> only<00:04:09.170> outputs

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
if I only have that on it only outputs

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.979 
if I only have that on it only outputs
the<00:04:09.950> top<00:04:10.190> one<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.610> not<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.970> bottom<00:04:11.299> so<00:04:11.690> let's

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
the top one and not the bottom so let's

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.900 
the top one and not the bottom so let's
say<00:04:12.140> for<00:04:12.350> example<00:04:12.799> you're<00:04:13.040> doing<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.340> ceremony

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
say for example you're doing a ceremony

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.659 
say for example you're doing a ceremony
and<00:04:14.269> you're<00:04:14.660> using<00:04:14.930> fill<00:04:15.650> and<00:04:15.890> sound<00:04:16.190> maybe

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
and you're using fill and sound maybe

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.330 
and you're using fill and sound maybe
for<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:18.350> other<00:04:18.470> side<00:04:18.739> of<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:18.890> room<00:04:19.100> but

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
for the other side of the room but

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.770 
for the other side of the room but
you're<00:04:19.459> only<00:04:19.579> needing<00:04:19.970> microphone<00:04:20.600> you're

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
you're only needing microphone you're

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.260 
you're only needing microphone you're
not<00:04:20.900> needing<00:04:21.229> music<00:04:21.650> right<00:04:21.890> then<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:23.000> can

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
not needing music right then you can

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.900 
not needing music right then you can
just<00:04:23.539> plug<00:04:23.930> your<00:04:24.169> ceremony<00:04:24.800> mic<00:04:25.160> here<00:04:25.520> you

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
just plug your ceremony mic here you

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.850 
just plug your ceremony mic here you

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
there's an option of course where you

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.200 
there's an option of course where you
can<00:05:45.500> use<00:05:45.680> this<00:05:45.830> guy<00:05:46.039> as<00:05:46.099> a<00:05:46.219> monitor<00:05:46.729> if<00:05:47.029> you

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
can use this guy as a monitor if you

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.760 
can use this guy as a monitor if you
want<00:05:47.419> to<00:05:47.509> use<00:05:47.599> it<00:05:47.750> as<00:05:47.840> a<00:05:47.870> monitor<00:05:48.379> and<00:05:48.590> you're

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
want to use it as a monitor and you're

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.200 
want to use it as a monitor and you're
also<00:05:48.919> going<00:05:49.129> to<00:05:49.189> use<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.430> for<00:05:49.610> weddings<00:05:50.090> and

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
also going to use it for weddings and

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.240 
also going to use it for weddings and
events<00:05:50.360> like<00:05:50.689> that<00:05:50.930> put<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:51.650> blanket<00:05:52.159> or

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
events like that put a blanket or

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.649 
events like that put a blanket or
something<00:05:52.669> for<00:05:52.879> this<00:05:53.000> to<00:05:53.150> lay<00:05:53.270> down<00:05:53.300> on

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
something for this to lay down on

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.360 
something for this to lay down on
because<00:05:53.960> again<00:05:54.229> this<00:05:54.409> case<00:05:54.680> is<00:05:54.830> not<00:05:54.949> as<00:05:55.129> rugged

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
because again this case is not as rugged

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.390 
because again this case is not as rugged
as<00:05:55.550> a<00:05:55.699> DSR<00:05:56.599> so<00:05:56.960> it<00:05:57.199> will<00:05:57.439> scratch<00:05:57.830> a<00:05:58.039> little<00:05:58.219> bit

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
as a DSR so it will scratch a little bit

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.140 
as a DSR so it will scratch a little bit
easier

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
easier

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.700 
easier
so<00:05:59.509> again<00:05:59.719> just<00:05:59.930> have<00:06:00.050> something<00:06:00.409> kind<00:06:00.590> of

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
so again just have something kind of

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.409 
so again just have something kind of
patting<00:06:01.009> it<00:06:01.129> or<00:06:01.250> even<00:06:01.370> maybe<00:06:01.699> put<00:06:02.330> a<00:06:02.360> couple

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
patting it or even maybe put a couple

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:03.189 
patting it or even maybe put a couple
like<00:06:02.779> rubber

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
like rubber

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.379 
like rubber
those<00:06:03.589> with<00:06:03.860> touchable<00:06:04.219> rubber<00:06:04.460> feet<00:06:04.909> I<00:06:04.940> just

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
those with touchable rubber feet I just

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:06.490 
those with touchable rubber feet I just
wouldn't<00:06:05.690> leave<00:06:05.810> a<00:06:05.870> flat<00:06:06.139> on<00:06:06.259> there<00:06:06.409> because

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
wouldn't leave a flat on there because

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.769 
wouldn't leave a flat on there because
it<00:06:06.650> will<00:06:06.800> get<00:06:07.009> scratched<00:06:07.339> on<00:06:07.580> there<00:06:07.789> also<00:06:08.419> when

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779 
it will get scratched on there also when

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:10.089 
it will get scratched on there also when
I<00:06:08.810> mentioned<00:06:09.259> about<00:06:09.379> rigging<00:06:09.620> points<00:06:09.919> in<00:06:10.009> the
