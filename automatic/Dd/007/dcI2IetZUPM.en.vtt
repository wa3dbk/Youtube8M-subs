 Your voice and your way of expressing yourself 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.940

 here in bogota representing nariño has 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.280
 been something wonderful because I feel with 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.160
 also very safe because we have reviewed 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.560
 very strongly and right now we are in 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.530
 very hard trials to give all the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.340
 25 I feel very happy also for 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.430

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.880
 many friends and not so a vision to be 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.830
 here 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.080
 I was never in a theater because I was going to be 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.820
 my first time in a theater those when 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.890
 I'm on a stage I feel as if 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.110
 outside owner of him who put in a 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.630
 scenario, it would be wonderful what 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.340
 it's Maria tereza there was a happiness 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.640
 for me I always wanted to come here to 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.200
 Bogota and children are like sponges 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.910
 they receive all that with that knowledge and 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.310
 how are you so in love with what you do 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.320
 they make the synthesis of all that and what 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.630
 you come back with an expressiveness 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.970
 awesome does not interest me 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.790
 only the vocal part the good 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.110
 tuning of course the good diction 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.300
 the good interpretation but if you 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.250
 It is also very interesting to incorporate 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:06.100
 full body do an encounter with 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.380
 the inside of my being but so that the 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.600
 voice be the vehicle of my being but that 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.280
 I understood my complete being not that the 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.190
 ministry I have pointed to this is 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.280
 fundamental and I tell the country that 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.860
 is Colombia flooded with seeds of 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.500
 choirs of children and young people where I've been 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.540
 moved what I've seen from seeds well 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.090
 seeded musical leaders 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.190
 corals working with children in love 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.490
 what they do then is 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.490
 absolutely 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.880
 It is very powerful to feel the country from 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.190
 these children loving their country when it is 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.550
 I want to make you direct a 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.210
 youth music choir I would like very much 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.480
 be in then the various scenarios with 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.180
 choirs and I would also very much like a 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.870
 choir to study he cited my greatest 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.870
 achievement would be 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.520
 be a big star because to me 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.490
 passionate about music as I reach

 be a great singer a good trumpeter 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.610
 very interesting that the ministry of 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.430
 culture looks for the talent that we have in 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.190
 Colombia because in many places of 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.380
 our colombia have not discovered their 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.790
 talents and thanks to them is that 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.640
 we are discovering the 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.740
 talents that we have I invite you all 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.130
 so that they continue supporting us support that 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.140
 talent and they can go listen to us let's go 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.900
 to be with a very good repertoire and 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.420
 throw the towel and I invite all 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.310
 children who are passionate about music 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.860
 who like music that although 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.690
 that they keep going because there are 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.910
 many opportunities in life and one does not 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.990
 knows which one is the best that you can 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:54.850
 fall to one we all have a talent and if 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.760
 singing is what they like or music 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.860
 follow your dreams and never stop 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.200
 because music is a great way and 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.000
 this will never end for you 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.880

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.880
 and my shoulders are a pair of maracas that 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.000
 kiss the sun 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.930
 I have the dakar singing a thin flute that 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.440
 God gave me 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:24.639
 song of my color of tobacco brandy 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:27.750
