at<00:00:24.000> home<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.789> color<00:00:30.000> calibration<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
at home so what is color calibration and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.840 
at home so what is color calibration and
who<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.260> for<00:00:31.500> color<00:00:32.070> calibration<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.820> a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
who is it for color calibration is a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.670 
who is it for color calibration is a
pretty<00:00:33.059> simple<00:00:33.420> process<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.960> take<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.140> sensor

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
pretty simple process you take a sensor

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.340 
pretty simple process you take a sensor
and<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.920> run<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.090> calibration<00:00:36.630> wizard<00:00:36.960> so

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and you run a calibration wizard so

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.330 
and you run a calibration wizard so
we're<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.800> doing<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
we're going to be doing that with the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.590 
we're going to be doing that with the
color<00:00:38.520> monkey<00:00:38.850> later<00:00:39.000> we'll<00:00:39.149> show<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.360> how<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
color monkey later we'll show you how to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.160 
color monkey later we'll show you how to
do<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.110> what<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.770> does<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.370> takes<00:00:41.670> in

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
do it and what it does is it takes in

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.690 
do it and what it does is it takes in
what<00:00:43.170> colors<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.739> being<00:00:44.160> output<00:00:44.520> by<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
what colors are being output by the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.760 
what colors are being output by the
display<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.780> applies<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> profile

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
display and then it applies a profile

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.770 
display and then it applies a profile
that<00:00:47.250> corrects<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.090> make<00:00:48.270> sure<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.510> it's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that corrects it and make sure that it's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.200 
that corrects it and make sure that it's
as<00:00:48.930> close<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.710> true<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.190> life<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.700> possible

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
as close to true to life as possible

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
like an i1 display Pro so this is great

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.810 
like an i1 display Pro so this is great
if<00:01:34.229> you're<00:01:34.560> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.100> setting<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.610> lab

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
if you're going to be setting up a lab

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.319 
if you're going to be setting up a lab
or<00:01:36.060> if<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.540> quality<00:01:36.930> analysis<00:01:37.500> on

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
or if you want to do quality analysis on

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.950 
or if you want to do quality analysis on
monitors<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.540> coming<00:01:39.840> off<00:01:39.900> a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
monitors that are coming off a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.940

now<00:01:41.280> they're<00:01:41.490> both<00:01:41.640> suitable<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.299> even

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
now they're both suitable for even

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.149 
now they're both suitable for even
projector<00:01:43.020> calibration<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.009> take

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
projector calibration so you just take

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.130 
projector calibration so you just take
it<00:01:44.220> fold<00:01:44.549> down<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.729> little<00:01:45.030> stand<00:01:45.270> throw<00:01:45.990> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
it fold down the little stand throw it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.690 
it fold down the little stand throw it
on<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.530> table<00:01:46.710> point<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.250> projector<00:01:47.640> you

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
on your table point of the projector you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.910 
on your table point of the projector you
can<00:01:47.759> set<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.149> up<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.450> way<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:49.560> both

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
can set it up that way and they both

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.399 
can set it up that way and they both
have<00:01:50.310> ambient<00:01:51.210> light<00:01:51.390> monitoring<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.049> well<00:01:52.079> so

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
have ambient light monitoring as well so

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.170 
have ambient light monitoring as well so
it<00:01:52.500> means<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:52.950> only<00:01:53.100> set<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.579> once<00:01:53.880> in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it means you not only set it up once in

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.490 
it means you not only set it up once in
the<00:01:54.540> light<00:01:54.720> environment<00:01:55.200> you're<00:01:55.320> in

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
the light environment you're in

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.740 
the light environment you're in
but<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.520> know<00:01:56.640> day<00:01:56.820> turns<00:01:57.090> tonight<00:01:57.479> or<00:01:57.659> you

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
but as you know day turns tonight or you

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.389 
but as you know day turns tonight or you
turn<00:01:57.899> lights<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.469> off<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.829> will<00:01:59.189> maintain

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
turn lights on and off it will maintain

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.819 
turn lights on and off it will maintain
the<00:01:59.850> colors<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.270> accurately<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.259> by

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
the colors as accurately as it can by

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.459 
the colors as accurately as it can by
keeping<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.369> plugged<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.969> your<00:02:03.000> computer

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
keeping it plugged in to your computer

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.179 
keeping it plugged in to your computer
now<00:02:04.469> I'm<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.799> show<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.920> guys<00:02:05.130> how

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
now I'm going to show you guys how

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.010 
now I'm going to show you guys how
simple<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> set<00:02:06.390> up<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.840> these

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
simple it is to set up one of these

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.190 
simple it is to set up one of these
color<00:02:07.229> calibrators<00:02:07.890> step<00:02:08.489> one<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.599> plug

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
color calibrators step one is to plug

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.230 
color calibrators step one is to plug
the<00:02:10.349> USB<00:02:10.530> cable<00:02:11.129> into<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.879> port

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.940 

now<00:02:17.240> step<00:02:17.600> two<00:02:17.870> is<00:02:18.110> where<00:02:18.350> things<00:02:18.560> start<00:02:18.709> to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
now step two is where things start to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.100 
now step two is where things start to
get<00:02:19.130> really<00:02:19.190> complicated<00:02:19.940> we<00:02:20.569> downloaded<00:02:20.959> the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
get really complicated we downloaded the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.110 
get really complicated we downloaded the
latest<00:02:21.200> software<00:02:21.950> off<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.250> x-rite<00:02:22.700> website

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
latest software off the x-rite website

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.960 
latest software off the x-rite website
and<00:02:23.330> now<00:02:23.959> we<00:02:24.020> have<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.470> choose<00:02:24.770> once<00:02:25.459> we<00:02:25.640> run<00:02:25.790> it

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
and now we have to choose once we run it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.820 
and now we have to choose once we run it
whether<00:02:26.209> we<00:02:26.390> want<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.660> profile<00:02:26.990> a<00:02:27.020> display<00:02:27.590> or

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
whether we want to profile a display or

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.820 
whether we want to profile a display or
a<00:02:27.920> projector<00:02:28.760> whoo<00:02:29.290> okay<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.350> we're<00:02:30.620> going<00:02:30.740> to

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
a projector whoo okay so we're going to

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.430 
a projector whoo okay so we're going to
go<00:02:30.920> with<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.160> easy<00:02:31.370> setting<00:02:31.880> although

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
go with the easy setting although

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.570 
go with the easy setting although
particularly<00:02:33.440> with<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.709> i1<00:02:33.980> display<00:02:34.340> Pro

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
particularly with the i1 display Pro

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.310 
particularly with the i1 display Pro
there<00:02:34.790> are<00:02:34.880> lots<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.360> additional<00:02:35.930> advanced

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
there are lots of additional advanced

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.800 
there are lots of additional advanced
professional<00:02:37.040> settings<00:02:37.450> all<00:02:38.450> right<00:02:38.630> we're

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
professional settings all right we're

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.150 
professional settings all right we're
going<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:38.959> click<00:02:39.170> Next<00:02:39.200> we<00:02:39.739> have<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.950> measure

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
going to click Next we have to measure

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.949 
going to click Next we have to measure
the<00:02:40.310> ambient<00:02:40.760> light<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.090> it's<00:02:41.209> important<00:02:41.780> to

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
the ambient light so it's important to

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.260 
the ambient light so it's important to
have<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.620> color<00:02:42.830> monkey<00:02:43.220> sitting<00:02:43.550> somewhere

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
have the color monkey sitting somewhere

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.240 
have the color monkey sitting somewhere
near<00:02:44.630> your<00:02:44.810> display<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.800> it<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:46.070> get<00:02:46.190> a

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
near your display so that it can get a

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.740 
near your display so that it can get a
good<00:02:46.459> idea<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.970> what<00:02:47.150> your<00:02:47.270> ambient<00:02:47.630> light

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
good idea of what your ambient light

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.990 
good idea of what your ambient light
level<00:02:48.050> is<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.620> way<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:48.920> can<00:02:49.040> make<00:02:49.220> sure<00:02:49.430> it's

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
level is that way it can make sure it's

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.550 
level is that way it can make sure it's
getting<00:02:50.420> things<00:02:50.570> as<00:02:50.720> accurate<00:02:51.050> as<00:02:51.140> possible

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
getting things as accurate as possible

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.530 
getting things as accurate as possible
so<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.800> takes<00:02:51.980> only<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.430> moment<00:02:52.610> we<00:02:53.180> go<00:02:53.330> ahead

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
so that takes only a moment we go ahead

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.840 
so that takes only a moment we go ahead
and<00:02:53.690> click<00:02:53.900> Next<00:02:54.110> again<00:02:54.800> now<00:02:55.400> we<00:02:55.459> place<00:02:55.820> the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
and click Next again now we place the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.690 
and click Next again now we place the
color<00:02:56.150> monkey<00:02:56.540> on<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:57.260> display<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.190> we<00:02:58.400> don't

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
color monkey on the display so we don't

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.070 
color monkey on the display so we don't
want<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.000> have<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.300> ambient<00:02:59.720> diffuser

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
want to have the ambient diffuser

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.020 
want to have the ambient diffuser
covering<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.769> we<00:03:01.160> actually<00:03:01.340> use<00:03:01.820> the

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
covering it we actually use the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.160 
covering it we actually use the
counterweight<00:03:02.540> I'm<00:03:02.690> just<00:03:02.900> going<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.050> move

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
counterweight I'm just going to move

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.780 
counterweight I'm just going to move
around<00:03:03.500> here<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.830> guys<00:03:03.980> we<00:03:04.519> use<00:03:04.610> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
around here you guys we use the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.220 
around here you guys we use the
counterweight<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.510> make<00:03:05.660> sure<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:05.870> doesn't<00:03:06.050> go

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
counterweight to make sure it doesn't go

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.190 
counterweight to make sure it doesn't go
too<00:03:06.290> far<00:03:06.670> turn<00:03:07.670> this<00:03:07.880> around<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.390> put<00:03:08.480> the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
too far turn this around and put the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.560 
too far turn this around and put the
lens<00:03:09.530> directly<00:03:10.100> on<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.519> screen<00:03:10.670> don't<00:03:11.300> worry

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
lens directly on the screen don't worry

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.250 
lens directly on the screen don't worry
there<00:03:12.080> is<00:03:12.110> a<00:03:12.650> non<00:03:13.010> scratching<00:03:13.550> cover<00:03:13.760> here<00:03:14.030> and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
there is a non scratching cover here and

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.410 
there is a non scratching cover here and
it<00:03:15.260> gives<00:03:15.500> us<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:16.160> exact<00:03:16.610> location<00:03:17.209> where<00:03:17.239> it

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
it gives us the exact location where it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.539 
it gives us the exact location where it
wants<00:03:17.630> us<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.750> put<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.140> right<00:03:18.950> there<00:03:19.280> in<00:03:19.489> the

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
wants us to put it right there in the

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:20.050 
wants us to put it right there in the
middle

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
middle

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.130 
middle
after<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.959> we<00:03:21.140> click<00:03:21.290> Next<00:03:21.470> again

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
like a sunlit building once we move into

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.159 
like a sunlit building once we move into
the<00:04:44.050> after<00:04:44.320> so<00:04:44.470> even<00:04:45.010> a<00:04:45.190> nice<00:04:45.760> IPS<00:04:46.540> panel<00:04:46.990> like

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
the after so even a nice IPS panel like

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.500 
the after so even a nice IPS panel like
we're<00:04:47.350> using<00:04:47.560> here<00:04:47.860> today<00:04:48.010> can<00:04:48.730> benefit<00:04:49.300> from

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
we're using here today can benefit from

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.680 
we're using here today can benefit from
using<00:04:50.169> a<00:04:50.560> color<00:04:51.100> calibrator<00:04:51.730> even<00:04:52.510> an

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
using a color calibrator even an

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.840 
using a color calibrator even an
inexpensive<00:04:53.260> one<00:04:53.650> so<00:04:54.220> I<00:04:54.250> think<00:04:54.370> that<00:04:54.669> pretty

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
inexpensive one so I think that pretty

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.610 
inexpensive one so I think that pretty
much<00:04:55.030> wraps<00:04:55.270> up<00:04:55.450> our<00:04:55.600> conclusion<00:04:56.110> it's<00:04:56.320> not

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
much wraps up our conclusion it's not

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.600 
much wraps up our conclusion it's not
that<00:04:56.800> expensive<00:04:57.070> anymore

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
that expensive anymore

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.820 
that expensive anymore
you<00:04:57.970> get<00:04:58.150> visibly<00:04:58.570> better<00:04:58.840> results<00:04:59.350> even<00:04:59.500> if

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
you get visibly better results even if

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.260 
you get visibly better results even if
you're<00:05:00.010> an<00:05:00.130> amateur<00:05:00.460> user<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:01.200> ah<00:05:02.790> yes<00:05:03.790> it's<00:05:04.090> a

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
you're an amateur user and ah yes it's a

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.360 
you're an amateur user and ah yes it's a
great<00:05:04.750> value<00:05:05.050> compared<00:05:05.680> to<00:05:05.740> pre<00:05:06.100> calibrated

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
great value compared to pre calibrated

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.850 
great value compared to pre calibrated
displays<00:05:07.060> such<00:05:07.750> as<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.169> one<00:05:08.350> that's<00:05:08.620> actually

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
displays such as the one that's actually

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.530 
displays such as the one that's actually
right<00:05:09.370> over<00:05:09.669> there<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:10.210> Asus<00:05:10.870> Pro<00:05:11.260> Art<00:05:11.500> and

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
right over there the Asus Pro Art and

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.300 
right over there the Asus Pro Art and
yeah<00:05:13.540> I<00:05:13.570> mean<00:05:13.660> that<00:05:13.900> monitor<00:05:14.320> costs<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:14.979> extra

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
yeah I mean that monitor costs the extra

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.580 
yeah I mean that monitor costs the extra
amount<00:05:15.550> over<00:05:15.900> what<00:05:16.900> we're<00:05:17.020> paying<00:05:17.200> for<00:05:17.350> the

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
amount over what we're paying for the

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.590 
amount over what we're paying for the
display<00:05:17.919> plus<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.370> color<00:05:18.550> monkey<00:05:18.910> the

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
display plus the color monkey the

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.090 
display plus the color monkey the
important<00:05:20.020> thing<00:05:20.140> to<00:05:20.169> remember<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:20.680> guys<00:05:20.860> is

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
important thing to remember to guys is

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.159 
important thing to remember to guys is
the<00:05:21.400> color<00:05:21.610> quality<00:05:22.240> matters<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:22.690> can't<00:05:22.960> take

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
the color quality matters you can't take

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.230 
the color quality matters you can't take
any<00:05:23.440> cheap<00:05:23.890> monitor<00:05:24.430> throw<00:05:24.940> a<00:05:25.000> color

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
any cheap monitor throw a color

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.820 
any cheap monitor throw a color
calibrator<00:05:25.780> on<00:05:25.990> it<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:26.260> expect<00:05:26.560> it<00:05:26.710> to

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830
