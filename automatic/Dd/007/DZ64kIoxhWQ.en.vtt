found<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.280> be<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.430> little<00:02:19.700> too<00:02:19.940> tarty<00:02:20.450> flavor

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
found it to be a little too tarty flavor

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.630

together<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:28.160> you<00:02:28.220> make<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.489> weird<00:02:28.730> face

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
together and you make that weird face

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.210 
together and you make that weird face
because<00:02:29.690> it's<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.930> little<00:02:30.170> target<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:30.680> always

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
find that the banana for some reason

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.400 
find that the banana for some reason
takes<00:02:33.530> away<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.920> tardiness<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.989> the
