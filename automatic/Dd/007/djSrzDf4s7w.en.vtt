00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.970
 let's start with the hairstyle I'll 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.460
 do the collected that has the braid on 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.260
 the bangs and well let's prepare a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.230
 little piece of hair for the braid and a 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.570
 little piece of curly or wavy hair 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.240
 with the iron or whatever you want and what 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.759
 we separate and take that part and we do 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.239
 the pigtail very very very very high almost 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.520
 attached to the part that we have separated and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.170
 well here you are seeing the dangers 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.820
 that I got out of when I had the side 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.150
 shaved at least women with 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.600
 Forks 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.780
 we have to try that the collection of 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.190
 is very high and turned to the side 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.980
 where are we going to take the bangs 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.890
 I have cost a lot because I have 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.930
 too much but I have a lot and good 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.670
 we hold it with a rubber band in the power 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.820
 color because now we're going to cover it 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.440
 so it does not look and this is now 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.040
 is with a normal queue and we have it 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.350
 to go molding so that it stays 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.770
 how we want good to Lisa was one of 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.570
 my favorite characters the favorite 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.700
 Preferred were Italy that was finally 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.630
 preferred because he was a character 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.969
 of guts and well let's hold 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.340
 well you will not have this but I 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.340
 I have that gorgeous hair cut so 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.039
 I have to hide it well and good 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.880
 now we will take a tuft of hair and 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:43.189
 we hide the rubber 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.289
 the fringe do not worry and if you do not 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.899
 you have curly as you can do 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.350
 waves with the iron but this image to 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:54.560
 it's a hairstyle for curly hair because 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.350
 ariza has it that way and that does not inspire 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.909
 with him we are going to hide the rubber and 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.020
 let's go adjusting the hair so that 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.299
 it will appear more 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.799
 then we are going to take the piece of 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.229
 bangs that we have separated to 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.360
 principle would do a braid if 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.980
 you can do it as a root or normal and I 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.000
 I'll do normal because from there no 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.120
 he 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.860
 and well now let's make it 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.900
 we have to go adjusting it this is to go 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.840
 accommodating by casting the face accommodates the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.860
 take the head 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.989
 it's a plan like the video that 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.150
 I made hairstyles for curly hair 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.000
 rihanna but without bandana and a little 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.010
 easier this part of being one has been 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.610
 inspired by it we can use it 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.560
 for any good occasion to for 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.450
 when we want others that are and is a 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.970
 hairstyle that saves me when I have the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.470
 hair made a little rough to the melao 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.310
 chin 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.220
 good, well, we make ourselves the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.670
 braid we grab it with a fork 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.350
 and we arrange the hair and once accommodated 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.350
 the hair we already have our hairstyle 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.439
 here it looks like I have it subject and what 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.299
 The only thing we have to do is hold 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.549
 the hair a little bit to the right like that 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.829
 we need it to me directly that is 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.670
 I have a little bit of lacquer left and 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.190
 it's finished 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.209
 It is a super simple hairstyle and very 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.209
 comfortable very comfortable 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.310
 I'm a cow 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.680
 good as it does not seem like alÃ­cia we 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.460
 we have to put some big rings like 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.560
 she carries and I had this out there 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.530
 let's start with makeup with 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.090
 the first and good you know the first 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.750
 that he used that is the kiko that I made 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.760
 the green to eliminate the bosses 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.950
 well here you are going to see me the super face 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.980
 yellow but it's because I've taken a 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.980
 much much much darker tone for 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.700
 make her makeup inspired but 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.620
 so I like makeup for 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.319
 day of diary use our tone 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.200
 normal 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.439
 well let's cover our circles and 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.909
 throw a little breimer in the eyes and 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.769
 now I'm going to take the outline that I've 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:16.370
 caught a normal bronzer and I'm going to 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:19.810
 do what I'm going to apply a bit in the 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.810
 front and on the cheekbones 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.150
 the rouge that I used is a tone 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.760
 reddish so terrified that I thought 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.100
 the most convenient with this look with 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.420
 this shadow color toasted today like this the 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.450
 colour 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.890
 a bronze you could say let's go 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.780
 apply it 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.610
 on the mobile eyelid and we're not going to 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.500
 move from there only on the mobile eyelid and 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.810
 we did not upload it a bit and with a 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.020
 We will give you darker brown shadow 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.129
 right in the basin but without raising it 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.050
 just to define it 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.999
 I'm using that and then when 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.759
 we make it darker next to it and 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:59.069
 add a little depth as 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:02.279
 you see there were not anything up what 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:05.350
 only just in the basin and the gray color 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:08.020
 he applied it right in the little corner 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:12.280
 Always good smooths the line is done by 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.320
 inside good it's true sir be careful 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.460
 I forget 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.360
 let's apply a little shadow 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.690
 brown and under the eyelid 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.050
 down and a little peeled shadow on 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.150
 the lacrimal we are going to delineate well the 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.030
 water line also in the lacrimal and 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.770
 the upper water line and then we go 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.200
 to do a little bit of cat eyeliner 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.730
 what is she wearing? 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.500
 well here you are seeing my face because 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.200
 I hate to delineate me because they sting me 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.120
 very much the judges mourn me because 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.860
 picture a lot of ribs but 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.860
 very many is unbearable for me 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.509
 after this we are going to apply the stripe 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:59.310
 We're also stuck in the eyelashes 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:02.520
 to get to the lacrimal to do 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.280
 a very dark look and when I 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.710
 let's have a good grip, let's take a 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.840
 brochita and let's blur it but 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.270
 let's blur it by trying not to 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.960
 upload it up but erasing a 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.960
 little color 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:26.439
 after having blurred it with him with 

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:28.980
 an eyeliner or with the same pencil with the 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:32.100
 we have done the one in my life 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.880
 line 2 fuck sorry forgiveness let's go 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.290
 do the cat line 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.290
 and here I am doing 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.480
 we are going to comb our eyebrows and we are going to 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.550
 paint it I'm going to use a tone 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.470
 dark and they have the most eyebrows 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.350
 round so I got a little out of my 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.700
 natural line and I have painted them then the 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.970
 spain we will do again to blur 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:57.430
 and now we 're going to agree a bit 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:02.020
 the eyelashes and we add the mascara as 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:03.850
 always and this is the the finished look I've 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.500
 added a normal piquito and I hope that 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:09.240
 I really liked the video to give 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.240
 like and subscribe chao
