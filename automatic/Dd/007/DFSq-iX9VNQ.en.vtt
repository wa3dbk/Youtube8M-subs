00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:10.019
 this consideration may be the beta keys kita 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:14.340
 peter georgi we start and I say 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.520
 today I am from 180 on I have 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.590
 me last tuesday two new soft 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.250
 boxes ordered that something so that a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.550
 gets better light in videos yes 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.619
 stated 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.590
 two days then you should be there 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.779
 So on Thursday at the latest comes 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.430
 on friday with is everywhere weeks 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.360
 passed and I have the softbox 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.320
 japanese me so why do you go something like that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.710
 the internet at 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.320
 of value so fast and free 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.510
 delivery services more quickly within 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.059
 two days if you actually have two 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.440
 years need 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.930
 yes and now i would have to or 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.640
 funny flashlight with movies the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.360
 I still separately in the face lights 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.920
 at all people live yes but that should 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.780
 actually not the topic today 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.300
 I really wanted something over 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.519
 speak another thing is about the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.290
 Classics of the studio Ghibli movies the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.080
 last firefly 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.159
 Unfortunately there is one in the movie 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.390
 pretty serious logic error and me 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.799
 I can not explain that either 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.229
 and i want to with this video too 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.240
 no way this movie hater otherwise have 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.670
 rather, on the contrary, I love this movie 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.360
 and that really counts to mine 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.310
 job studio ghibli movie ever and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.049
 that's why it makes me easy 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.549
 this logic error so finished ours 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.829
 crazy I can not do it 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:40.409
 explain and even respect spoiler 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.880
 I'll tell it again, whoever 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.799
 this film does not know and itself 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.290
 may not want spoilers 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.030
 should turn off on jesus video and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.590
 first watch the movie and then later 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.020
 if we can do it together 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.479
 most will talk about this logic 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.450
 yes it is about the just 14 years old 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.270
 offender try with a small one 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.079
 company sister csu in the world war too 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.479
 to survive 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.820
 and of course he will be the one 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.049
 Famine very big and they start 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.440
 to steal 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.170
 if then every now and then caught 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.830
 while beating up long at the police 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.400
 until then everything still okay because I 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:24.090
 logically not go and now come to 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.959
 this and yes he goes with his little one 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.370
 sister to doctor the doctor said yes me 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.590
 absolutely normal 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.530
 the little anna and just want to 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:40.830
 actually measured again and also measured 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:43.050
 once on channel asks his little one 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.900
 sister yavuz to eat me 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.360
 I'll get it all then she even says 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.629
 sushi is here and there and all at once 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.760
 said yes I always go to the bank picks 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.180
 the money and I get something delicious 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.180
 to eat 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.840
 where did he get the money on the account 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.209
 and why has it if not before 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.800
 brought and eat and then had to 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.900
 his little sister did not even 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.300
 suffer and otherwise almost experience 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.290
 So I can not explain that 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.349
 okay okay okay 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.900
 let's assume that his 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.409
 mother died that may be something 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.080
 inherited money from her has been playing there 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:27.629
 there is always a second question afterwards 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.940
 According to a farmer's master, after the film 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.129
 he himself knows that the money is not 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.290
 be the problem but the 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.120
 food itself you hardly have 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.459
 something yourself and can in itself 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.250
 do not sell anything to others and 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.410
 then I ask myself again the question 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.090
 who really could have done that 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.860
 she had all the stuff off though 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.580
 get there as well with such a 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.820
 fat melodrama and rice sushi too 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.990
 always brought everything and I can 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.280
 that does not explain why I'm the same 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.990
 The money would be made possible 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.350
 In any case, it is then products 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.330
 all too late future dies because 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.140
 she is too weak to eat anymore 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.630
 to be able to 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.760
 I'm definitely as deep as that 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.770
 seek to interpret how 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.450
 that the makers can possibly mean 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.390
 you can see where in a scene 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.000
 future lies on the ground and hers 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.370
 brother so stones are signaled yes 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.770
 Here you have a nice rice ball 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.990
 Here you are , I thought so 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.450
 moment okay maybe that too 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.580
 say told simply or universally 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.010
 the two have gone crazy and 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.650
 that was a kind of wishful thinking on the way 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.260
 strayed to the bank and then quiet and 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.300
 something great to eat but again at the end 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.100
 you can see that also this theory 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.700
 refuted because then you actually 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.410
 looks like melon lazy for that and the 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.890
 actually did not exist 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.890
 was touched 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.170
 I can not explain what's going on there 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.580
 I may have overlooked something or 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.110
 just not noticed 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.180
 write me that in any case in the 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.550
 comments or do you have a whole 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.050
 simple explanation for this will be on everyone 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.970
 fall interested in a little 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.250
 Start a discussion like that 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.940
 can think what happened there 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.030
 I can not explain it no matter how many times I am 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.310
 have seen this movie and right there 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.650
 is so well done is this me upset 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.610
 damn logic errors and I can 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.110
 you also do not explain 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.419
 and that's why I can not quite do it 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.390
 buy this movie that the 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.810
 Siblings and he actually stands 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.180
 later also because 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.940
 who would have the money on the account yes then 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.720
 just brought the food and 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:46.910
 died for jenny so please later 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:48.200
 but had written it anyway 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.580
 in the comments 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.650
 Of course I would like one over 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.919
 thumb happy if you often times such 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:58.610
 wanted to lead discussion with me and yes 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:01.400
 that's already in front of me and 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.639
 this sunday hardly my 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.100
 first own single consideration in the 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.370
 online shops and itunes google plans 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:13.010
 amazon wherever and on top of it 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.440
 next sunday 17 again then then 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.380
 is actually still the music video 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.430
 my single consideration and jan i am pleased 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.419
 me in any case 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.419
 and how she likes us 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.600
 nico 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.040
