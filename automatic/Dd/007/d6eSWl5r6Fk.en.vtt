 with part 2 I show you a few 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.880
 nice exercises that you can do outside 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.109
 You do not always need a gym off 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.070
 and one needs jim I will give you 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.660
 to tell something 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.640
 at the place but not always in jim 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.789
 nice weather just go out there 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.710
 There are so many great exercises too 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.870
 we as fitness athletes ours 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.239
 want to build body super outdoors 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.579
 Today I can show you one 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.320
 year the classic how to do it right 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.360
 that's why a whole video like 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.530
 Do you make babies or how do I make them 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.820
 maybe some will say the same 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.920
 he does it differently or something but I say 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.570
 you where it depends a little bit on it 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.129
 and next time I'll show you 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.190
 few other exercises you still very much 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.640
 can do well without appliances without 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 job 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.710
 So coming out so many of you joy 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.049
 or many in total ask me something 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.180
 do you think of free latics is of 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.790
 big trends and big hype that will 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.860
 I should not prefer to come right 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.110
 train without Jim instead of without 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.430
 Devices the guys pretend that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.500
 the lakes are so wide 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.210
 I do not think that muscle is right 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.619
 they have built up with 4x with 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.700
 felix can not therefore muscular 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.630
 Of course you will get your muscles 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.130
 claim 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.409
 you are defined you get a nice 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.119
 defined figure that's what you get 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.909
 but you do not get this one this way 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.880
 year this lhasa angelov body my 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.790
 I would not have body with only Felix 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.860
 but can build or build up 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.560
 Felix is a very very beautiful one 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.750
 supplement for weight training because we 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.430
 we train a lot of musculature 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.509
 maybe not so much in the gym 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.140
 So you're really training a lot 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.700
 functional movements where so much the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.290
 Auxiliary musculature is addressed 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.820
 where inner muscles are very strong 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.299
 the whole thing will be addressed 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.799
 Coordination between signal and and 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.630
 Receiver of the muscles a bit 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.969
 that's why it's trained 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.950
 very very good addition easy to 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.720
 our sport and with such a 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.700
 You just have to have wonderful weather 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.200
 go outside you can do the gym sometimes 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.489
 Just let it whiz 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.140
 we should still sport a bit 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.830
 make it go we go out today how 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.170
 said an exercise so soy classic 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.860
 really when fedex and although the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.910
 Babies babies is a very good exercise 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.319
 That's why we introduce it but it is 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.360
 also an exercise the many wrong 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.940
 if you do it right 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.800
 you really on almost the whole body 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.150
 be many legs with the butt with 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.769
 we really have a lot of the court 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.680
 abdominal muscles inner inner 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.930
 abdominal muscles in it 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.580
 if we have the breast in with it 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.890
 shoulders with back in have one 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.709
 a little less in it and it was one 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.329
 very nice exercise and i see her 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.250
 often very very wrong there are many 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.480
 prix latics courses or any 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.950
 Courses were not so specific 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.660
 attention is paid to the versions and 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.380
 then maybe you will see this 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.780
 typical one then goes down jumps 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.519
 make a liegestütz then jump up 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.079
 pushes up and jumps somehow 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.340
 high then everything always looks like this 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.160
 a bit weird one looks then that 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.120
 The main thing is you make many 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.599
 repetitions one makes because of many 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.819
 and there are just a few things that 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.350
 first if you go down so it is 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.970
 not good for the knees we burden too 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.889
 little strain on the whole thigh 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.239
 too little the butt 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.850
 we also go from an upper position 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.040
 high that sanzen so the exercise makes 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.489
 Only really make sense if you get it right 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.870
 I'll show you and do it right 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.459
 what you have to look out for a bit 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.780
 as I said there are certainly many latics 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.260
 Boys can do it even better 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.299
 to explain 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.620
 but for our community i can 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.970
 maybe very well and tell you 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.310
 a bit of what matters 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.389
 correct bertis or how I find that 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.950
 they may be right if he does 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.930
 now some moan but for me 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.480
 Make it work so well 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.760
 a little different that means he takes 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.150
 the legs like a squad that is 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.829
 you take them apart nicely 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.209
 of course, so do the toe tips 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.530
 do not necessarily have to be exactly forward 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.200
 show but like a squad 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.980
 saving back easily backs up 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.859
 press back 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.290
 properly activate the back that is 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.519
 a lightweight hollow cross make everything 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.470
 save as you would in scott 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.229
 want easy to position and then 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.489
 hands go between feet and 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.070
 this is the first step between the 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.090
 Feet and then you get the yes 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.860
 legs back 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.680
 that means he goes forward and put 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.830
 the legs forward that is convenient 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.070
 the first step after that made 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.970
 liegestütz position goes up pulls the 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.430
 legs forward 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.960
 since again in ascot position and then 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.229
 can you just now the clean sport 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.300
 or you can really do it too 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.690
 high jump or similar but do 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.599
 just from the squad and not many 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.640
 then go to put the legs here 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.349
 here somehow high and jumps up 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.020
 that's too much of a burden 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.550
 on the knees do not have a squad position 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.070
 or have no real movement 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.750
 as with the squat activated with it 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.419
 not so much muscle has one 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.490
 round back there 's the danger that I 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.289
 hurt really pay attention 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.000
 that you really have a johannes cords 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:13.200
 position also when going up 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.360
 that means scott position again 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.390
 clamped to the rear position 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.860
 scott position and you can do that 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.510
 high jump with the hands you can 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.640
 Do whatever you want and then go like that 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.590
 more then you really have a very 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.390
 very nice exercise that you very very good 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.640
 can also do repetitions 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.330
 So really right babies without 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.060
 The End 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.400
 But that really looks like the technology 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.140
 Do not suffer what makes us easy 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.820
 no sense 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.789
 many buy the videos do that 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.620
 if you do it wrong from the beginning 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:49.020
 you might really be up to it 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.159
 Balance will be the whole thing 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.690
 maybe not clean properly 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.880
 That's why they're watching you 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.760
 Proper technology really looks that way 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.270
 makes sense and then make fun 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.890
 a meaningful exercise is meaningful 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.070
 any case for outdoors for spherics 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:07.860
 workout and that's why it was one 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.900
 good exercise so from the things you 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.550
 can do outside by free latics work 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.440
 from Wendeburg also have several exercises 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.880
 subscribed to the channel writes 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.469
 get comments next time 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.920
 a few more exercises you 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.430
 very good outside 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.990
 on facebook is over and 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.550
 training nutrition system with there can 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.710
 you just insert the whole thing as well 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:31.110
 said to the workout what a good one 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.110
 addition is to stay tuned
