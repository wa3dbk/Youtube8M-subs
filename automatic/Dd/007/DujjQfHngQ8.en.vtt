actually really really enjoyed it I know

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.620 
actually really really enjoyed it I know
I<00:03:18.389> say<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.840> lot<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:19.440> one<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:20.010> think<00:03:20.630> it

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
I say that a lot but this one I think it

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.830 
I say that a lot but this one I think it
runs<00:03:22.049> around<00:03:22.200> $300<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.250> for<00:03:23.400> $300<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.450> do<00:03:24.660> get

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
runs around $300 and for $300 you do get

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.870 
runs around $300 and for $300 you do get
a<00:03:24.870> pretty<00:03:25.109> good<00:03:25.319> bass<00:03:25.560> sound<00:03:26.100> for<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.370> closed

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
a pretty good bass sound for a closed

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.559 
a pretty good bass sound for a closed
back<00:03:27.420> headphone<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.709> closed<00:03:29.280> back<00:03:29.579> so<00:03:30.450> it

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
back headphone it is closed back so it

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.270 
back headphone it is closed back so it
won't<00:03:30.780> necessarily<00:03:30.989> have<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.650> openness<00:03:32.130> of

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
won't necessarily have the openness of

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.490 
won't necessarily have the openness of
the<00:03:32.370> HD<00:03:32.760> 650<00:03:33.889> 600<00:03:34.889> but<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:36.060> does<00:03:36.420> have<00:03:37.109> a<00:03:37.139> good

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
the HD 650 600 but it does have a good

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.420 
the HD 650 600 but it does have a good
even<00:03:38.280> keeled<00:03:38.790> sound<00:03:39.299> which<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.870> really<00:03:40.430> kind

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
even keeled sound which is really kind

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.410 
even keeled sound which is really kind
of<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.549> hard<00:03:41.700> thing<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.940> do<00:03:42.209> with<00:03:43.019> headphones<00:03:44.420> in

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
of a hard thing to do with headphones in

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.360 
of a hard thing to do with headphones in
general<00:03:46.019> especially<00:03:46.380> when<00:03:46.950> they<00:03:47.069> come<00:03:47.220> too

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
general especially when they come too

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.819 
general especially when they come too
close<00:03:47.489> back<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.239> personally<00:03:49.019> from<00:03:49.560> my

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
close back so I personally from my

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.770 
close back so I personally from my
experience<00:03:50.489> felt<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.209> this<00:03:51.329> was<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> very

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
experience felt like this was a very

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.930 
experience felt like this was a very
flat<00:03:52.290> response<00:03:52.560> which<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.220> really<00:03:53.459> good<00:03:53.609> but

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
flat response which is really good but

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.690 
flat response which is really good but
still<00:03:54.120> had<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.269> great<00:03:54.620> bass<00:03:55.620> response<00:03:55.920> when<00:03:56.579> it

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
still had a great bass response when it

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.400 
still had a great bass response when it
needed<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.090> be<00:03:57.209> there<00:03:57.450> wasn't<00:03:57.690> inflated<00:03:58.290> at

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
needed to be there wasn't inflated at

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.770 
needed to be there wasn't inflated at
any<00:03:58.590> point<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.220> was<00:03:59.579> definitely<00:03:59.940> not<00:04:00.060> shy<00:04:00.420> on

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
any point and was definitely not shy on

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.920 
any point and was definitely not shy on
the<00:04:01.049> bass<00:04:01.230> either<00:04:01.560> but<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.519> definitely<00:04:02.930> grabs

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
the bass either but it definitely grabs

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.289 
the bass either but it definitely grabs
from<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.709> nice<00:04:04.889> low<00:04:05.220> spot<00:04:05.579> if<00:04:05.790> it's<00:04:06.000> in<00:04:06.180> the

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
from a nice low spot if it's in the

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.229 
from a nice low spot if it's in the
music<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:08.099> is<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.459> biggest<00:04:08.639> plus<00:04:08.940> for<00:04:09.120> an

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
music so that is the biggest plus for an

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.890 
music so that is the biggest plus for an
auditory<00:04:09.599> standpoint<00:04:10.169> you<00:04:11.130> will<00:04:11.370> see

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
auditory standpoint you will see

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.240 
auditory standpoint you will see
fidelity<00:04:12.900> upgrades<00:04:13.500> as<00:04:13.769> you<00:04:14.010> go<00:04:14.190> to

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
fidelity upgrades as you go to

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.940 
fidelity upgrades as you go to
headphones<00:04:14.849> like<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.120> 650<00:04:15.690> in<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.260> 600<00:04:16.709> and

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
headphones like the 650 in the 600 and

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.029 
headphones like the 650 in the 600 and
the<00:04:17.010> 800<00:04:17.489> obviously<00:04:18.030> they<00:04:18.959> do<00:04:19.500> have<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.769> better

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
the 800 obviously they do have a better

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.570 
the 800 obviously they do have a better
fidelity<00:04:20.400> than<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.180> does<00:04:21.419> so<00:04:21.630> overall<00:04:22.580> it's

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
fidelity than this does so overall it's

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.070 
fidelity than this does so overall it's
not<00:04:23.789> on<00:04:24.150> par<00:04:24.419> with<00:04:24.570> those<00:04:24.630> but<00:04:24.840> then<00:04:24.960> again

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
not on par with those but then again

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.560 
not on par with those but then again
they<00:04:25.349> cost<00:04:25.890> almost<00:04:26.250> twice<00:04:26.580> as<00:04:26.820> much<00:04:27.030> some<00:04:27.300> of

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
they cost almost twice as much some of

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.710 
they cost almost twice as much some of
-<00:04:28.170> obviously<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.860> 800<00:04:29.340> is<00:04:29.490> is<00:04:29.640> more<00:04:30.360> like<00:04:30.480> four

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
- obviously the 800 is is more like four

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
- obviously the 800 is is more like four
to<00:04:31.170> five<00:04:31.200> times<00:04:31.770> as<00:04:32.040> much<00:04:32.220> so<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.180> being<00:04:33.330> said

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
to five times as much so that being said

to five times as much so that being said
expectation<00:04:34.740> wise<00:04:34.890> 300<00:04:35.580> it's<00:04:35.730> right<00:04:35.970> on<00:04:36.120> par

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
expectation wise 300 it's right on par

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.870 
expectation wise 300 it's right on par
but<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.990> frequency<00:04:40.590> response<00:04:41.010> is<00:04:41.550> right

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
but the the frequency response is right

the<00:06:04.590> most<00:06:04.830> important<00:06:05.310> quality<00:06:05.700> I<00:06:05.730> think<00:06:05.850> that

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
the most important quality I think that

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.310 
the most important quality I think that
sound<00:06:06.480> should<00:06:06.720> always<00:06:06.840> be<00:06:07.080> the<00:06:07.200> most

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
sound should always be the most

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.290 
sound should always be the most
important<00:06:07.950> quality<00:06:08.250> but<00:06:08.820> one<00:06:09.090> that<00:06:09.240> you

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
important quality but one that you

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.700 
important quality but one that you
definitely<00:06:09.660> can't<00:06:09.870> overlook<00:06:10.200> because<00:06:10.380> if

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
definitely can't overlook because if

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.890
