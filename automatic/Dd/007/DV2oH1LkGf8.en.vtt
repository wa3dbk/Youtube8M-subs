00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.239
 good afternoon to everyone in this video i will show 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.849
 how to knit a perfect loop 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.980
 This loop is used for fishing 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.230
 it is also used for fastening 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.390
 rubber rope with bungee jumping 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.890
 which proves her perfect 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.290
 reliability proceed to practice and so 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.350
 first we take our rope and this end 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.750
 measure about 15-20 centimeters to his 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.469
 in order to be seen better take 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.019
 a little more now in this place 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:00.320
 doing this usual loop 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:04.640
 just showing like this and where the ropes are 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.470
 cross hold for fingers now 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:14.810
 This is the working end we start from above and 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.930
 miss it for the main cord here 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.990
 such a result 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.060
 now we intercept it from below and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:27.560
 we get a little more 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.380
 one loop but only smaller in size 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.500
 Now this end is starting again. 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.420
 top and skip it between big 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.770
 loop and small loop here 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.899
 so that's the way we put everything there 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.320
 now take from the inside out of the big loop 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:55.680
 delivered a small loop and in doing so 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.860
 hold for the main cord and for the worker 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.860
 end 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.360
 tighten the knot do not forget to moisten 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.110
 pulled a little and now let go 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.649
 work end and drag you on 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.649
 route 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.170
 social networks it just canis cut off 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.240
 thank you all for your attention subscribe 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.320
 Look at our channel a lot of interesting things. 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.320
