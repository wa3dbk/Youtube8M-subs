00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
okay and then that way when you're

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.500 
okay and then that way when you're
working<00:00:21.689> with<00:00:21.720> foil<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:23.010> easier<00:00:23.699> for<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.420> to

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
working with foil it's easier for it to

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.420 
working with foil it's easier for it to
come<00:00:24.720> off<00:00:24.900> okay<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.830> doesn't<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.250> hot

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
come off okay it doesn't it's hot

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.070

sometimes<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.210> get<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> little<00:00:27.630> bit<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.900> hard

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
sometimes you get a little bit of hard

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.040 
sometimes you get a little bit of hard
time<00:00:28.260> taking<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.680> off<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.760> makes<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.720> easier

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
time taking it off this makes it easier

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.229
