00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.180 
after the decoupage glue dries I have
decoupage<00:03:57.130> glue<00:03:57.310> just<00:03:57.970> water<00:03:58.300> down<00:03:58.630> about<00:03:59.440> two

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
decoupage glue just water down about two

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.800 
decoupage glue just water down about two
to<00:04:00.340> one<00:04:00.550> or<00:04:00.760> three<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.150> one

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
to one or three to one

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.170 
to one or three to one
and<00:04:02.230> with<00:04:02.380> water<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:03.220> I<00:04:03.280> mean<00:04:03.460> one<00:04:03.610> part<00:04:03.880> glue

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
and with water so I mean one part glue

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.020 
and with water so I mean one part glue
one<00:04:04.660> part<00:04:04.930> water<00:04:05.110> just<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:05.590> it's<00:04:05.710> a<00:04:05.770> nice

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
one part water just so it's a nice

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.690 
one part water just so it's a nice
consistency<00:04:10.590> needs<00:04:11.590> a<00:04:11.680> big<00:04:11.830> soft<00:04:12.070> brush<00:04:12.400> and

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
consistency needs a big soft brush and

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.960

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
of the texture on this and this is all

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.370 
of the texture on this and this is all
dry<00:04:37.090> now<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:37.540> you<00:04:37.600> can<00:04:37.750> see<00:04:37.900> how<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.050> colors

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
dry now and you can see how the colors

it's gonna cook up a little bit of

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.540 
it's gonna cook up a little bit of
texture<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:55.860> we<00:04:56.860> kind<00:04:57.040> of<00:04:57.130> break<00:04:57.310> up<00:04:57.490> the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
texture and we kind of break up the

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.880 
texture and we kind of break up the
pattern<00:04:58.030> from<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.240> tissue<00:04:58.450> paper<00:04:58.740> I'm<00:04:59.740> just

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890
