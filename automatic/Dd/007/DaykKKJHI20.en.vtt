00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 it was michele cruttiello well 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.279
 michele good evening found can be 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.230
 debora appointment not to be missed at 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.760
 23 special transfer market but obviously 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.080
 there is a little something we can say why 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.210
 of course what happened today 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.900
 especially as regards Mauritian 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.570
 isla 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.730
 if it is not yellow and orange because we are 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.949
 very close to red it is a bit like the ma 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.199
 at this time the situation starts at 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.039
 become really paradoxical and 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.189
 embarrassing is so because what he has 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.779
 brought this braking in the negotiation 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.099
 but first of all we need to do a 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.809
 very important step than in the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.149
 Yesterday they met at 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.579
 the offices of ghelfi here in Milan marco 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.410
 branch of the managing director 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.910
 delegate of juventus beppe marotta e 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.660
 the president of udino gino pozzo 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.039
 arrived from spain just to 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.450
 close the operation isla you are 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.390
 get up from a table and there was the agreement 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.610
 total on everything for the soccer player with the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.500
 footballer is among the three parts of course 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.230
 the main parts are juventus and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.899
 inter udinese only had to give the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.640
 just assent what he did though 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.610
 the most important thing is that anyway 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.890
 marotta said yes ok tomorrow it closes 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.500
 the agreement in practice was there today 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.720
 practically all the entourage here 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.960
 represents mauricio isla here in milan 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.340
 from from South American agent up to 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.619
 get to the Italian prosecutor who 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.540
 we read claudio vagheggi 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.009
 spoke exclusively to 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.900
 tuttomercatoweb was very clear 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.880
 said next year isla play o 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.140
 inter or juventus so if 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.689
 someone thinks 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.939
 translated that there may be a third 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.040
 forget option veil because 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.020
 absolutely nothing will accept anything 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.950
 of all this or the juventus o 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.390
 Inter history 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.790
 with the inter there is the agreement also because 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.340
 isla has made more passes to the club 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.329
 Inter has cut the salary 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.829
 however it has shown maximum 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.390
 availability and desire of his 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.159
 transfer to Milan today had to 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.720
 be the day of the signature lanza ha 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.979
 all a bit baffled by beating the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.930
 news that visits were in progress 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.200
 medical news that obviously is not 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.430
 was confirmed because of juventus 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.689
 She has never moved from the withdrawal of 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.640
 chatillon and mauricio isla 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.140
 at this point beppe marotta is 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.869
 attracting the rope a lot 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.390
 probably for a negotiation where the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.580
 word of juventus is given and then 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.000
 retreat perhaps if we have to say it 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.830
 the whole operation of 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.410
 Juventus club at this time not 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.290
 reflects exactly what it could 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.600
 be a bargain the hundred per cent 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.370
 one hundred that the inter is getting a little fed up 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.800
 although I believe that anyway 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.660
 possibility to close the negotiation 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.510
 may be there is still concrete 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.370
 in the meantime, however, the prosecutor of 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.890
 soccer player claudio vagheggi is doing 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.540
 back home then come back without the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.690
 signed mauricio isla contract with 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.850
 inter because you say it is not very clear 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.860
 the negotiation is that the juve is white a 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.690
 I explain why the juventus has black 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.190
 said yes then he sat at the table yesterday 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.570
 she went to the office of ghelfi with 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.310
 branch and gino well 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.050
 the deal was practically done today not 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.980
 you can say no what changed in the tour 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.130
 of 24 hours 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.650
 what has changed or have they thought of 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.000
 have an exterior in your hands and in this 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.140
 moment did not close the transaction in 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.840
 entry and therefore do not want to close 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.390
 an exit transaction or juventus 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.400
 is playing a market game that does not 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.660
 understood the inter did not understand 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.610
 the Udinese did not understand 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.200
 we have not understood itla and therefore a 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.110
 this point must wait a moment 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.940
 perhaps juventus wants to have the first 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.049
 certainty of having juan camilo zuniga in 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.700
 punch so it is certain that the inter will not go 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.709
 su juan camilo zuniga and then can 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.650
 release isla towards the inter this is 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.060
 the only reflection we can take 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.959
 certainly has nothing to do with it 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.519
 I apologize kolarova kolarov up to a 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.320
 certain point got to do with it has nothing to do with it 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.750
 we remember the mandate is always in 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.810
 possession of the lawyer beppe bozzo 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.700
 to date, however, the hottest name is that 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.390
 of isla another hot name is that of 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.769
 zuniga 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.940
 if a little cooled this not 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.610
 obviously means we don't have to be 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.930
 brigade on alexander kolarov 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.930
 thanks michele for this point
