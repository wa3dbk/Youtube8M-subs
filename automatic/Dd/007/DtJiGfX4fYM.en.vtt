everybody it's me right here or my
questions<00:00:17.350> 34<00:00:18.130> and<00:00:18.490> today<00:00:18.970> I've<00:00:19.060> been<00:00:19.180> working

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
questions 34 and today I've been working

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.420 
questions 34 and today I've been working
on<00:00:19.570> mocks<00:00:19.840> we'll<00:00:20.619> start<00:00:20.860> over<00:00:21.040> here<00:00:21.189> with<00:00:21.220> the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
on mocks we'll start over here with the

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.210 
on mocks we'll start over here with the
beachfront<00:00:21.640> type<00:00:22.119> mock<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:23.380> basic<00:00:23.830> idea<00:00:23.950> is

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
beachfront type mock so basic idea is

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.310 
beachfront type mock so basic idea is
you<00:00:24.490> got<00:00:24.610> a<00:00:24.640> beachfront<00:00:24.960> will<00:00:25.960> have<00:00:26.080> some

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
you got a beachfront will have some

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.390 
you got a beachfront will have some
Droid<00:00:26.619> carriers<00:00:27.220> like<00:00:27.850> these<00:00:28.240> probably

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
Droid carriers like these probably

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.800 
Droid carriers like these probably
invading<00:00:30.400> maybe<00:00:30.580> some<00:00:30.850> core<00:00:31.090> Alliance<00:00:31.539> pink

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
invading maybe some core Alliance pink

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.689 
invading maybe some core Alliance pink
turrets<00:00:32.080> but<00:00:32.290> they'll<00:00:32.470> be<00:00:32.619> invading<00:00:33.129> up<00:00:33.370> to

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
turrets but they'll be invading up to

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:34.729 
turrets but they'll be invading up to
the<00:00:33.790> beach<00:00:34.000> and

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
the beach and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.290 
the beach and
jords<00:00:35.739> it'll<00:00:36.040> kind<00:00:36.220> of<00:00:36.280> I<00:00:36.489> guess<00:00:36.699> it<00:00:36.940> will<00:00:37.030> kind

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
jords it'll kind of I guess it will kind

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.320 
jords it'll kind of I guess it will kind
of<00:00:37.449> resemble<00:00:37.930> d-day<00:00:38.580> of<00:00:39.580> all<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.879> things<00:00:40.120> that

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
of resemble d-day of all the things that

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.360 
of resemble d-day of all the things that
can<00:00:40.449> resemble<00:00:40.809> but<00:00:41.650> yeah<00:00:41.830> that's<00:00:42.070> what<00:00:42.340> that

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
can resemble but yeah that's what that

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.630 
can resemble but yeah that's what that
will<00:00:42.760> be<00:00:42.879> maybe<00:00:43.120> I'll<00:00:43.269> add<00:00:43.420> some<00:00:43.659> like

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
will be maybe I'll add some like

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.039 
will be maybe I'll add some like
barriers<00:00:45.640> here<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.150> don't<00:00:46.479> know<00:00:46.629> those<00:00:46.839> look

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.049 
barriers here I don't know those look

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:48.570 
barriers here I don't know those look
pretty<00:00:47.229> crappy<00:00:47.710> but<00:00:47.890> something<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.370> stop

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
pretty crappy but something to stop

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.369 
pretty crappy but something to stop
those<00:00:48.850> you<00:00:49.089> know<00:00:49.180> and<00:00:49.720> that<00:00:49.930> way<00:00:50.049> clones

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
those you know and that way clones

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.280 
those you know and that way clones
inside<00:00:51.129> of<00:00:51.309> my<00:00:51.430> trench<00:00:51.790> that<00:00:52.420> I've<00:00:52.540> built<00:00:52.750> in<00:00:53.080> I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
inside of my trench that I've built in I

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.780 
inside of my trench that I've built in I
think<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:53.860> trench<00:00:54.100> looks<00:00:54.309> pretty<00:00:54.549> cool

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
think the trench looks pretty cool

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.969 
think the trench looks pretty cool
especially<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.989> way<00:00:56.080> I<00:00:56.110> did<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.470> I<00:00:56.589> have<00:00:56.769> these

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
especially the way I did it I have these

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.030 
especially the way I did it I have these
little<00:00:57.280> grooves<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:58.600> every<00:00:58.989> other<00:00:59.170> brick<00:00:59.589> or

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
little grooves like every other brick or

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.710 
little grooves like every other brick or
whatever<00:01:00.309> so<00:01:00.640> those<00:01:00.820> look<00:01:01.210> pretty<00:01:01.540> cool

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
whatever so those look pretty cool

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.780 
whatever so those look pretty cool
they're<00:01:02.559> all<00:01:02.680> facing<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.040> same<00:01:03.129> way<00:01:03.460> so<00:01:03.519> my

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
they're all facing the same way so my

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.570 
they're all facing the same way so my
OCD<00:01:04.150> is<00:01:04.299> gone<00:01:04.750> oh<00:01:05.400> yeah

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
OCD is gone oh yeah

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.700 
OCD is gone oh yeah
so<00:01:06.850> I<00:01:06.880> also<00:01:07.240> put<00:01:07.570> these<00:01:07.720> little<00:01:07.990> railings<00:01:08.530> on

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
so I also put these little railings on

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.620 
so I also put these little railings on
on<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:09.189> little<00:01:09.369> stairways<00:01:09.729> that<00:01:10.000> I<00:01:10.060> built<00:01:10.299> to

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
on the little stairways that I built to

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.060 
on the little stairways that I built to
get<00:01:10.750> out<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.229> I<00:01:11.560> don't<00:01:11.619> know<00:01:11.799> if<00:01:11.890> I'm<00:01:11.979> gonna

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
get out and I don't know if I'm gonna

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.350 
get out and I don't know if I'm gonna
keep<00:01:12.280> those<00:01:12.460> or<00:01:12.640> not<00:01:12.760> I<00:01:12.880> don't<00:01:12.939> know<00:01:13.060> it<00:01:13.240> looks

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
keep those or not I don't know it looks

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.230 
keep those or not I don't know it looks
better<00:01:14.190> but<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.250> idea<00:01:15.520> is<00:01:15.610> I'm<00:01:15.850> also<00:01:16.000> gonna

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
better but the idea is I'm also gonna

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.480 
better but the idea is I'm also gonna
extend<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:16.810> three<00:01:17.020> more<00:01:17.140> base<00:01:17.350> plates<00:01:17.620> back<00:01:17.860> or

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
extend it three more base plates back or

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.210 
extend it three more base plates back or
like<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.900> base<00:01:20.110> plate<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.500> three<00:01:20.740> across<00:01:20.980> and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
like one base plate and three across and

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.790 
like one base plate and three across and
there<00:01:21.790> will<00:01:21.910> be<00:01:21.940> a<00:01:22.360> crash<00:01:22.870> gun<00:01:23.290> ship<00:01:23.620> or

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
there will be a crash gun ship or

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.050 
there will be a crash gun ship or
something<00:01:23.980> because<00:01:24.370> a<00:01:24.400> lot<00:01:24.550> of<00:01:24.640> you<00:01:24.790> wanted<00:01:25.000> to

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
something because a lot of you wanted to

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.730 
something because a lot of you wanted to
see<00:01:25.300> crash<00:01:25.990> landing<00:01:26.440> mocks<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:29.530> over<00:01:29.680> here

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
see crash landing mocks then over here

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.890 
see crash landing mocks then over here
on<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:30.130> second<00:01:30.610> mark<00:01:30.760> I<00:01:30.880> brought<00:01:31.390> this<00:01:31.540> table

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
on the second mark I brought this table

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.590 
on the second mark I brought this table
in<00:01:31.990> here<00:01:32.140> from<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.800> garage<00:01:32.980> because<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:33.880> needed

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
in here from the garage because I needed

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.210 
in here from the garage because I needed
extra<00:01:34.870> space<00:01:35.290> to<00:01:35.560> build<00:01:35.680> on<00:01:35.890> because

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
extra space to build on because

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.130 
extra space to build on because
obviously<00:01:36.340> I<00:01:36.580> meant<00:01:36.760> enough<00:01:36.940> space<00:01:37.150> so<00:01:37.450> I

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
obviously I meant enough space so I

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.720 
obviously I meant enough space so I
brought<00:01:38.530> this<00:01:38.650> table<00:01:38.920> in<00:01:39.010> here<00:01:39.160> and<00:01:39.220> I<00:01:39.490> just

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
brought this table in here and I just

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.130 
brought this table in here and I just
thought<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.180> out<00:01:40.240> a<00:01:40.300> new<00:01:40.480> Mach<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:40.930> this<00:01:41.020> is

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
thought it out a new Mach and this is

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.510 
thought it out a new Mach and this is
what<00:01:41.230> I<00:01:41.320> came<00:01:41.380> up<00:01:41.590> with<00:01:41.650> because<00:01:41.980> a<00:01:42.100> lot<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.340> you

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
what I came up with because a lot of you

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.840 
what I came up with because a lot of you
wanted<00:01:42.940> a<00:01:43.150> a<00:01:43.330> swamp<00:01:43.720> mock<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.200> be<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.890> crash

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
wanted a a swamp mock and be a crash

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.250 
wanted a a swamp mock and be a crash
landing<00:01:46.120> I'm<00:01:46.330> sore<00:01:46.510> and<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:46.659> really<00:01:46.960> think<00:01:47.110> this

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
landing I'm sore and I really think this

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.140 
landing I'm sore and I really think this
Mach<00:01:47.530> turned<00:01:47.860> out<00:01:48.010> well<00:01:48.190> aside<00:01:48.670> from<00:01:48.730> the<00:01:48.940> part

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
Mach turned out well aside from the part

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.510 
Mach turned out well aside from the part
that<00:01:49.270> it's<00:01:49.390> really<00:01:49.630> flat<00:01:49.960> right<00:01:50.230> now<00:01:50.409> but<00:01:51.220> that

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
that it's really flat right now but that

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.160 
that it's really flat right now but that
should<00:01:51.850> be<00:01:51.970> able<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.210> be<00:01:52.330> changed<00:01:52.750> because<00:01:52.960> I

have<00:03:10.260> these<00:03:10.409> fires<00:03:11.069> type<00:03:11.579> colored<00:03:11.969> bricks

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
have these fires type colored bricks

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.470 
have these fires type colored bricks
that<00:03:12.389> I<00:03:12.510> can<00:03:12.689> use<00:03:13.310> like<00:03:14.310> two<00:03:14.519> shows<00:03:14.909> type<00:03:15.299> of

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
that I can use like two shows type of

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.409 
that I can use like two shows type of
flames<00:03:15.780> maybe<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.040> think<00:03:17.310> I'll<00:03:17.430> also<00:03:17.639> end

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
flames maybe and I think I'll also end

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.089 
flames maybe and I think I'll also end
up<00:03:18.569> tearing<00:03:18.840> all<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.439> moving<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.829> down

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
up tearing all that and moving it down

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.459 
up tearing all that and moving it down
lower<00:03:20.430> like<00:03:21.000> maybe<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:21.719> it's<00:03:21.840> only<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:22.169> one

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:22.469 
lower like maybe so it's only like one

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.849 
lower like maybe so it's only like one
or<00:03:22.650> two<00:03:23.209> plates<00:03:24.209> high<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.409> that<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.739> like

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
or two plates high so that it's like

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.059 
or two plates high so that it's like
more<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.549> an<00:03:26.729> indent<00:03:27.090> when<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.680> it's<00:03:28.680> crashed
