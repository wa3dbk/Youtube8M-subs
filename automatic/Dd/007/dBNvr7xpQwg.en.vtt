00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:12.495
Long distance detection
using electronic circuits

00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:16.036
is an invention brought
to the global public by MINEORO

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:28.123
This video will help you to better
understand the use of your FG90 or FG 80,

00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:33.511
a technology that has been developed
in southern Brazil for 27 years

00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:38.225
This manual can guarantee that
you will have success in your searches

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:43.700
and it is important that each step
of the process is executed accurately.

00:00:45.938 --> 00:00:48.886
Operation of the detector is based
on the search for ionic fields

00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:53.158
that interact with the electrostatic
field generated by the Earth's rotation

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:58.535
The ionic fields are generated in
space at all of the cardinal points

00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:02.781
and negative ions are detectable
on the locator's ionic camera.

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:08.691
That is, your detector has a
positively ionized camera,

00:01:08.718 --> 00:01:13.056
which searches for the negative ions of
objects buried in the soil for many years.

00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:17.040
Detecting from long distance
and at great depth.

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:22.661
First, it is important that you check the
accessories that come in the package.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.916
They are: - 1 directional substance locater

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.671
- 1 Center and Deep

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.058
- 1 measurement support

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.885
- 1 user manual

00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:34.290
- 1 transport bag

00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:36.043
- 1 measuring tape

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:42.240
Also remember to always take an extra
set of 12 non-rechargeable batteries.

00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:44.501
Use always Alkaline batteries.

00:01:45.136 --> 00:01:47.290
Be careful with the relative air humidity.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.400
The performance of the detector
is proportional to it.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.705
The lower the humidity,
the better the detection.

00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:57.370
It is useful to have a digital hygrometer.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.120
The ideal is for the relative
humidity to be lower than 70%.

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:10.270
Calibrating the FG90 is a decisive
process yet also very simple.

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:14.775
It must be done at the place that
you choose to conduct your search,

00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:18.636
preferentially outdoors and
far from electrical power lines.

00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:22.275
Place the detector in the
vertical position

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:25.215
holding the transport handle
with your right hand.

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:27.136
Before turning it on,

00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:31.110
place the Vernier, or that is, the
mechanical number counter at zero

00:02:31.456 --> 00:02:33.533
and turn on the device.

00:02:33.535 --> 00:02:36.186
Press the red battery-test button.

00:02:36.188 --> 00:02:38.673
It indicates the battery charge,

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:41.421
which must be from 13-18 V.

00:02:41.423 --> 00:02:44.896
&lt;i&gt;When the alkaline batteries
charge fall below 12V, change them.&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:50.298
&lt;i&gt;The 9V battery should only be replaced
when the digital display stops lighting up.&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:55.018
Point the compass to the SOUTH

00:02:57.666 --> 00:03:00.456
and turn the Vernier until you hear a beep.

00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:05.036
Slowly Return the counter

00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:08.620
until certifying that the detector has
stabilized, without beeping again.

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:13.406
Then, lower 10 more units to avoid
the detector being too sensitive.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.911
Once the detector has been calibrated

00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:18.911
you can now begin the search method.

00:03:19.013 --> 00:03:21.980
We recommend that you walk
with your back to the north

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.505
in a southerly direction.

00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:25.853
The area of projection
of the irradiated lines

00:03:25.953 --> 00:03:27.893
are in the shape of an elipse,

00:03:27.928 --> 00:03:31.436
causing the irradiated lines in
the northerly direction to be larger.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.880
Therefore, remember to whenever possible

00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:37.000
walk from NORTH to SOUTH.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.021
Walking in zigzag,

00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:43.720
move the locator 180 degrees
from right to left

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.158
and from left to right.

00:03:46.796 --> 00:03:48.841
This movement should not be very slow,

00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:50.325
and not to fast either.

00:03:50.326 --> 00:03:52.570
It should take approximately
1 and a half seconds.

00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:55.456
&lt;i&gt;Brusque movements can cause
the detector to beep randomly.&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.590
When you hear a BEEP,

00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:02.193
it is a signal that
something was detected.

00:04:02.195 --> 00:04:04.770
Pay careful attention in
the direction of the sound,

00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:07.506
because your detector is directional,

00:04:07.508 --> 00:04:11.043
and this will be the first indication
about what direction to follow.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.811
Based on this, walk according
to the orientation of the beep,

00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:21.336
walk towards the location of the object while
moving the detector in vertical position.

00:04:21.336 --> 00:04:24.523
From the moment you approach the object,

00:04:24.525 --> 00:04:27.235
the beep will be increasingly
aimed toward the ground.

00:04:27.886 --> 00:04:32.100
Continue walking until the sound comes
exactly from the direction of your feet.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.213
This means that you are positioned

00:04:35.215 --> 00:04:37.530
precisely above the object.

00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:39.731
Certify that upon passing this point,
the device is quiet both to the sides

00:04:39.831 --> 00:04:41.831
and to the front, confirming
the object's point of location.

00:04:41.946 --> 00:04:43.901
Do a mark in this region.

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:49.338
To confirm the center and determine
the depth of the object,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.045
you will need the measurement support

00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:55.165
and the Center and Deep accessory.

00:04:57.378 --> 00:05:01.450
Mount the locator on the support at
20 cm from the marked center,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.435
facing it in a Northerly direction,
with the locator's antenna pointed down.

00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:11.225
&lt;i&gt;If the detector starts to beep, reduce the
sensitivity at the Vernier, until it is silent.&lt;/i&gt;

00:05:13.025 --> 00:05:15.285
Holding the Center and Deep by the handle,

00:05:15.285 --> 00:05:17.543
make movements in the shape of a cross

00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:20.381
to confirm the center
marked by the detector.

00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:24.061
Upon locating it, the
detector will issue a beep.

00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:27.526
After the center is confirmed,

00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:30.778
slowly move it away in a
NORTHERLY direction.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.370
moving the Center and Deep from the
detector until you hear another beep.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.050
Mark this second region.

00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:45.510
The distance between the two points

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.590
is equal to the depth of the object found.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.720
Remember that the object is buried
where you marked the first cross,

00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:55.818
and that is wherer where you should dig.

00:05:57.511 --> 00:06:00.631
The object should be
removed with great caution,

00:06:00.731 --> 00:06:04.306
because it may be small and easy to lose.

00:06:06.063 --> 00:06:07.933
Be quite careful when digging,

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:09.490
and use the tape measure to guarantee

00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:12.995
that you control the
depth that you are digging.

00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:23.496
When you reach 5-10 cm before
the determined distance,

00:06:24.256 --> 00:06:27.730
place the last shovel of
earth in a separated location,

00:06:28.656 --> 00:06:31.141
to guarantee that the object is not lost.

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:38.091
With a tracking detector,

00:06:38.193 --> 00:06:39.720
or with your own hands,

00:06:39.721 --> 00:06:42.335
look for the object until you find it.

00:06:51.361 --> 00:06:52.938
Remember!

00:06:53.198 --> 00:06:56.886
Keep your cell phone turned off
when you are searching.

00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:00.528
Use shoes with rubber soles.

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:04.641
Avoid searching close to high tension wires.

00:07:08.946 --> 00:07:10.993
The drier the environment,

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:12.846
the better the performance of your detector.

00:07:14.255 --> 00:07:17.235
Sunny days facilitate the ionization.

00:07:17.878 --> 00:07:20.530
Always carry a spare set of batteries,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.678
and remember that they
can not be rechargeable.

00:07:23.358 --> 00:07:25.255
The best time for searching is

00:07:25.255 --> 00:07:27.420
between 8:30 and 11:30,

00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:29.880
or 13:30 and 17:00.

00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:33.131
No other accessory
(such as a tripod or earphone)

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:34.931
should be added to the detector,

00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:36.933
because this can affect its performance.

00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:41.636
When switched on, do not near
the detector to computers,

00:07:41.638 --> 00:07:44.551
TV or vehicles.

00:07:44.551 --> 00:07:47.031
It can damage your equipment.

00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:51.185
Correctly following these instructions,

00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:53.733
and if existing at the location,

00:07:53.935 --> 00:07:56.706
the chances of you finding objects is 100%.
