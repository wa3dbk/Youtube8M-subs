00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 ok so now we're going we're gone 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.420
 on hard in foam right actually what we 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.340
 will learn how to do it is 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.540
 increases although there was said even 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.830
 hayes but sometimes you'll see on 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.809
 knitting patterns he asks you 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.009
 to have more than 10 so made a wrong 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.859
 increase on each side often 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.730
 it's on each side to balance I 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.220
 will show you how it works 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 increases then unless they but 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.039
 we do not know and that we are 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.080
 we think the increases are 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.550
 does that on make them place so the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.750
 Garter stitch in reverse I 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.550
 do not understand how it can be done 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.689
 that's how it is performed for 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.199
 increase so ie how to 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.590
 go 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.980
 gilman we can have my wheels and that 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.960
 makes you dream 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.460
 you pass your needle exactly 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.840
 as in the garter stitch you passed it 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.280
 under your acute right needle under 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.800
 the 8 left in the loop 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:52.199
 you do a hop lap start hop 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:58.350
 to pass you 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:01.829
 I do not know anymore where you spend your 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.080
 needles would have started and then 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.580
 I will have done one 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.580
 yes we have one like that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:21.100
 I start again hop hop 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.400
 See what I'm using it or not 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.400
 start 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:34.060
 a tac place I pass except that I 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.460
 put back underneath I redo a turn I 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.830
 go through the loop 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.350
 I redo a turn I pass in the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.810
 loop and then I take my arm 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.860
 and I tell them that on that side it is 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.450
 important because otherwise it's like 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.030
 it's a place to come back it's the 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.110
 brothel where I'm not hyper pedagogue on 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.340
 this shot there and it's a bit like 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.320
 drive a canton asks to define 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.399
 how do we lead to genre galleys 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.200
 when you pay attention I start again 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.429
 no 4th beat it's more doing it 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.670
 while things are hyper natural 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:08.080
 when you normally do 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:08.789
 presto I take a turn I pass in the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.269
 loop 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:17.080
 and here we are we had three my on 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.190
 at six I know it's extraordinary this 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.630
 we're going to do is I'm going to do 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.000
 so there normally we act as if I 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.980
 was doing an increase 4 and so on 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.290
 the last three rows the three there and 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.130
 last three my sorry I'm going 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.130
 redo increases 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.680
 fake 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:56.340
 we will listen god me as for the word buzz in 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:58.459
 glimpse and here you know how to make 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.459
 increases
