00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
posture turn that swing fall on and then

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.149 
posture turn that swing fall on and then
try<00:01:37.789> and<00:01:37.819> execute<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:40.329> hopefully<00:01:41.329> looking<00:01:41.630> up

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
try and execute it hopefully looking up
