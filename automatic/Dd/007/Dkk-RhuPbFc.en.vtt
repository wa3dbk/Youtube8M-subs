working<00:04:03.600> on<00:04:03.720> crossovers<00:04:04.350> we<00:04:04.530> prefer<00:04:04.890> this<00:04:05.070> one

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
working on crossovers we prefer this one

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.670 
working on crossovers we prefer this one
because<00:04:05.640> their<00:04:05.790> continuous<00:04:06.420> they<00:04:06.990> get<00:04:07.170> 20<00:04:07.590> or

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
because their continuous they get 20 or

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.160 
because their continuous they get 20 or
30<00:04:07.920> crossovers<00:04:08.640> in<00:04:08.820> in<00:04:09.060> less<00:04:09.660> than<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:09.990> minute

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
30 crossovers in in less than a minute

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.710 
30 crossovers in in less than a minute
and<00:04:10.500> then<00:04:10.830> we're<00:04:11.370> Nolan<00:04:11.700> rich<00:04:11.910> fatigued<00:04:12.300> erase

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
and then we're Nolan rich fatigued erase

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.660 
and then we're Nolan rich fatigued erase
and<00:04:12.930> play<00:04:13.080> keep-away<00:04:13.440> there<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:14.490> we're<00:04:14.580> going

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
and play keep-away there so we're going

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.760 
and play keep-away there so we're going
to<00:04:14.760> move<00:04:14.940> through<00:04:15.270> about<00:04:15.750> five<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.530> six

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
to move through about five to six

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.880 
to move through about five to six
minutes<00:04:16.980> in<00:04:17.520> each<00:04:17.670> station<00:04:18.440> keep<00:04:19.440> those<00:04:19.680> kids
