00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:17.390
 Hello I'm here already did see 250 in the flex 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:27.509
 the post in this pronounced video that has 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.239
 doubt about getting a motorcycle 10 and I 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.710
 Wishing you got into football, you guys there. 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:41.640
 When I went to buy I had a question. 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:47.750
 I did the test on the wave in cbb and got 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.750
 This is an exceptional bike. 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.429
 This bike here 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:11.000
 the personnel know already comes equipped with brake 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:14.420
 to disk in the back wet for you 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.320
 See I 'm with her, do it at nine. 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.159
 months 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:25.240
 I have walked 15,000 kilometers with her I 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:30.530
 moto has a great performance on the track 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:34.429
 I live in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.050
 I already went to Sao Paulo with her I measured 300 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.050
 kilometers to go back 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.929
 I went with my wife for 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.929
 track 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.840
 I walk with her on top 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:59.000
 she makes an average of 28 kilometers per 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:04.270
 alcohol and the average of 32 to 33 in the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.270
 depends on the way you love and 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.430
 in the cold times you are now a little 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.590
 cold for 12 liters of petrol and 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.310
 complete high to facilitate 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.090
 take 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.470
 If you have time the normal temperature can 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.470
 sun for the loss of brother 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.140
 that's it moÃ§ada super stable bike 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.829
 You seem to be giving a point. 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.989
 I told you so 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.989
 I just have to talk about this bike. 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:49.549
 I'm super satisfied when the only one 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.069
 I do not think I had a problem. 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:57.200
 she could have left with six gears 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:59.569
 but the 300 also left with 5 more only this 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.560
 the soil the rest may find that it is a 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.560
 great bike
