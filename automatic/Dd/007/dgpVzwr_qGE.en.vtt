00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the Dallas Cowboys who was kind of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.700 
the Dallas Cowboys who was kind of
underachieved<00:00:57.449> his<00:00:57.660> career<00:00:57.989> looking<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
underachieved his career looking to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.380 
underachieved his career looking to
start<00:00:58.949> anew<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> New<00:00:59.699> York<00:00:59.730> Giants<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
start anew with the New York Giants and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.970 
start anew with the New York Giants and
they<00:01:00.510> also<00:01:00.660> added<00:01:00.899> David<00:01:01.350> Wilson<00:01:01.500> during<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
they also added David Wilson during the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920 
they also added David Wilson during the
offseason<00:01:02.609> they<00:01:02.910> got<00:01:03.090> Rueben<00:01:03.390> Randle<00:01:03.539> but

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
offseason they got Rueben Randle but

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.140 
offseason they got Rueben Randle but
lost<00:01:04.199> Mario<00:01:04.650> Manningham<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.880> think<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
lost Mario Manningham and I think the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.880 
lost Mario Manningham and I think the
big<00:01:06.540> thing<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.960> season<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.290> gonna<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.590> Eli

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
big thing this season is gonna be if Eli

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
big thing this season is gonna be if Eli
Manning<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.369> play<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.760> Eli<00:01:09.000> Manning<00:01:09.299> in

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
Manning can play like the Eli Manning in

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
Manning can play like the Eli Manning in
the<00:01:09.479> playoffs<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.140> he<00:01:10.650> needs<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> help<00:01:11.159> carry

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the playoffs and he needs to help carry

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.160 
the playoffs and he needs to help carry
this<00:01:11.520> team<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> lot<00:01:12.119> more<00:01:12.330> than<00:01:12.510> nine<00:01:12.689> wins<00:01:12.960> I

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
this team to a lot more than nine wins I

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.929 
this team to a lot more than nine wins I
do<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.799> nine<00:01:14.100> wins<00:01:14.430> winning<00:01:14.790> this

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
do not see nine wins winning this

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.880 
do not see nine wins winning this
division<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.450> year<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.560> all

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
division this year I think that all

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.249 
division this year I think that all
teams<00:01:17.220> drastically<00:01:17.850> improved<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.540> think<00:01:19.080> that

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
teams drastically improved I think that

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.390 
teams drastically improved I think that
the<00:01:19.350> Giants<00:01:19.680> maybe<00:01:19.860> didn't<00:01:20.040> improve<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.369> much

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the Giants maybe didn't improve as much

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.340 
the Giants maybe didn't improve as much
as<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> other<00:01:20.880> teams<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.330> division<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.290> I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
as the other teams in the division but I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.870 
as the other teams in the division but I
think<00:01:22.680> Philly<00:01:22.950> definitely<00:01:23.369> upgraded<00:01:23.790> their

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
think Philly definitely upgraded their

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.600 
think Philly definitely upgraded their
front<00:01:24.119> 7<00:01:24.540> Washington<00:01:25.229> obviously<00:01:25.680> has<00:01:25.830> RG<00:01:26.250> 3

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
front 7 Washington obviously has RG 3

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.130 
front 7 Washington obviously has RG 3
and<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.060> Cowboys<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:27.750> really

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
and the Cowboys when they really

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.870 
and the Cowboys when they really
upgraded<00:01:28.590> their<00:01:28.680> secondary<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.460> year<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
upgraded their secondary this year and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
upgraded their secondary this year and
that's<00:01:30.299> part<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.659> why<00:01:30.810> I'm<00:01:30.990> having<00:01:31.290> Dallas<00:01:31.770> is

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that's part of why I'm having Dallas is

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560 
that's part of why I'm having Dallas is
possibly<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.700> sleepers<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.329> year

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
possibly one of my sleepers this year

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.030 
possibly one of my sleepers this year
because<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.900> think<00:01:34.049> they<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.439> some<00:01:34.770> very<00:01:34.920> good

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
because I think they have some very good

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.039 
because I think they have some very good
pieces<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.640> offense<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.540> expect<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> see

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
pieces on offense and I expect to see

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.719 
pieces on offense and I expect to see
their<00:01:37.259> defense<00:01:37.650> kind<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.070> come<00:01:38.220> together<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
their defense kind of come together as a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.890 
their defense kind of come together as a
whole<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.299> they<00:01:39.360> obviously<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
whole because they obviously have to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.109 
whole because they obviously have to
Marcus<00:01:40.350> where<00:01:40.560> Anthony<00:01:40.860> Spencer<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.729> they

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
Marcus where Anthony Spencer and they

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.280

seven now they have some defensive

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.670

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.679 
backfield helped to really strengthen

David Wilson I really want to see how he
plays<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.019> year<00:02:49.079> because<00:02:49.349> I<00:02:49.709> think<00:02:50.159> he<00:02:50.310> has

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
plays this year because I think he has

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.099 
plays this year because I think he has
the<00:02:50.549> potential<00:02:50.849> to<00:02:51.000> take<00:02:51.180> away<00:02:51.419> carries<00:02:51.780> Ramon

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
the potential to take away carries Ramon

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.899 
the potential to take away carries Ramon
Bradshaw<00:02:52.680> be<00:02:52.889> more<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.250> featured<00:02:53.579> back<00:02:53.760> in

Bradshaw be more the featured back in
this<00:02:54.060> offense<00:02:54.450> possibly<00:02:55.319> we'll<00:02:55.470> see<00:02:55.620> how<00:02:55.709> that

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
this offense possibly we'll see how that

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.979 
this offense possibly we'll see how that
goes<00:02:56.040> initially<00:02:56.639> but<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:57.450> David<00:02:57.780> Willis<00:02:57.930> I

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
goes initially but I like David Willis I

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.629 
goes initially but I like David Willis I
like<00:02:58.139> his<00:02:58.319> skill<00:02:58.590> set<00:02:58.859> I<00:02:59.069> think<00:02:59.280> they're<00:02:59.549> gonna

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
like his skill set I think they're gonna

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.649 
like his skill set I think they're gonna
that's<00:02:59.879> gonna<00:03:00.000> help<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.359> rushing

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
that's gonna help with the rushing

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.119 
that's gonna help with the rushing
attack<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.079> year<00:03:01.349> but<00:03:01.560> still<00:03:01.680> lets<00:03:01.889> me<00:03:01.980> focus

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
attack this year but still lets me focus

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.409 
attack this year but still lets me focus
on<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.430> passing<00:03:02.790> attack<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.209> game<00:03:03.389> I

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
on the passing attack in this game I

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.479 
on the passing attack in this game I
think<00:03:03.569> because<00:03:04.139> I<00:03:04.409> really<00:03:04.889> like<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.220> front

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
think because I really like the front

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.069 
think because I really like the front
four<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.819> New<00:03:06.120> York<00:03:06.329> everybody<00:03:06.569> does<00:03:06.930> of

Witten<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:19.799> doubtful<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.370> don't<00:03:20.549> think<00:03:20.699> he

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
Witten is doubtful I don't think he

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.580 
Witten is doubtful I don't think he
plays<00:03:21.090> today<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.720> they<00:03:22.169> don't<00:03:22.319> really<00:03:22.470> have<00:03:22.560> a

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
plays today and they don't really have a

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.259 
plays today and they don't really have a
lot<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.799> tight<00:03:23.250> ends<00:03:23.519> behind<00:03:23.669> them<00:03:23.970> actually

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
lot of tight ends behind them actually

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.729 
lot of tight ends behind them actually
the<00:03:24.359> silently<00:03:24.720> alert<00:03:24.930> day<00:03:25.079> because<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.470> the

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
the silently alert day because of the

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.770 
the silently alert day because of the
the<00:03:25.979> depth<00:03:26.220> issue<00:03:26.430> at<00:03:26.819> tight<00:03:27.359> end<00:03:27.389> obviously

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
the depth issue at tight end obviously

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.509 
the depth issue at tight end obviously
no<00:03:28.049> Martellus<00:03:28.470> Bennett<00:03:28.500> anymore<00:03:29.099> this<00:03:29.280> year

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
no Martellus Bennett anymore this year

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.920 
no Martellus Bennett anymore this year
and<00:03:29.669> so<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.000> think<00:03:30.120> Romo<00:03:30.449> is<00:03:30.510> gonna<00:03:30.720> be<00:03:30.780> really

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
and so I think Romo is gonna be really

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.469 
and so I think Romo is gonna be really
more<00:03:31.079> dependent<00:03:31.739> on<00:03:31.829> his<00:03:32.010> receivers<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:32.849> Dez

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:33.479 
more dependent on his receivers and Dez

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.240 
more dependent on his receivers and Dez
Bryant<00:03:33.900> last<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.169> had<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.319> great<00:03:34.620> season<00:03:34.949> I

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
Bryant last you had a great season I

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.099 
Bryant last you had a great season I
expect<00:03:35.879> him<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.060> have<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.239> big<00:03:36.479> year<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:36.750> year

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
expect him to have a big year this year

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.930 
expect him to have a big year this year
as<00:03:37.169> long<00:03:37.319> as<00:03:37.440> he<00:03:37.560> stays<00:03:37.590> healthy<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.400> stays

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
as long as he stays healthy and stays

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.399 
as long as he stays healthy and stays
out<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.120> trouble<00:03:39.209> off<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.750> field<00:03:40.019> because

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
out of trouble off the field because

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.710 
out of trouble off the field because
also<00:03:40.859> with<00:03:41.310> both<00:03:42.150> these<00:03:42.269> teams<00:03:42.449> have

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
also with both these teams have

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.509 
also with both these teams have
receivers<00:03:43.169> you<00:03:43.379> can<00:03:43.500> never<00:03:43.620> count<00:03:44.099> on<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.400> be

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
receivers you can never count on to be

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.069 
receivers you can never count on to be
fully<00:03:44.760> healthy<00:03:45.030> Hakeem<00:03:45.510> Nicks<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.930> Miles

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
fully healthy Hakeem Nicks and Miles

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.349 
fully healthy Hakeem Nicks and Miles
Austin<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:47.010> think<00:03:47.370> with<00:03:47.549> know<00:03:47.849> Jason

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
Austin and I think with know Jason

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.059 
Austin and I think with know Jason
Witten<00:03:48.629> in<00:03:48.720> this<00:03:48.870> game<00:03:49.139> assuming<00:03:49.650> he<00:03:49.739> doesn't

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
Witten in this game assuming he doesn't

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.699 
Witten in this game assuming he doesn't
play<00:03:50.280> Dez<00:03:50.879> Bryant<00:03:51.389> is<00:03:51.540> my<00:03:51.690> x-factor<00:03:52.500> for<00:03:52.530> the

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
play Dez Bryant is my x-factor for the

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.409 
play Dez Bryant is my x-factor for the
Dallas<00:03:53.040> Cowboys<00:03:53.069> if<00:03:53.669> they're<00:03:53.849> gonna<00:03:54.030> win<00:03:54.269> this

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
Dallas Cowboys if they're gonna win this

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:54.710 
Dallas Cowboys if they're gonna win this
game

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
game

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.140 
game
I<00:03:54.900> think<00:03:55.409> Dez<00:03:55.590> Bryant<00:03:56.040> has<00:03:56.189> a<00:03:56.340> big<00:03:56.579> game<00:03:56.819> over<00:03:57.120> a

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
I think Dez Bryant has a big game over a

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.819 
I think Dez Bryant has a big game over a
hundred<00:03:57.449> yards<00:03:57.629> and<00:03:57.900> one<00:03:58.079> or<00:03:58.199> two<00:03:58.319> touchdowns

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
hundred yards and one or two touchdowns

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.319 
hundred yards and one or two touchdowns
and<00:03:59.069> I<00:03:59.340> think<00:03:59.579> we're<00:03:59.669> almost<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.970> be<00:04:00.060> looking

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
and I think we're almost to be looking

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.030 
and I think we're almost to be looking
for<00:04:00.510> him<00:04:00.599> a<00:04:00.689> lot<00:04:00.900> because<00:04:01.079> even<00:04:01.530> Jason<00:04:01.859> Witten

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
for him a lot because even Jason Witten

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.800 
for him a lot because even Jason Witten
had<00:04:02.159> 79<00:04:02.699> catches<00:04:03.090> last<00:04:03.209> him<00:04:03.449> if<00:04:03.540> he<00:04:03.629> doesn't

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
had 79 catches last him if he doesn't

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.750 
had 79 catches last him if he doesn't
play<00:04:04.049> it's<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.379> major<00:04:04.709> blow<00:04:05.099> to<00:04:05.129> this<00:04:05.340> offense

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
play it's a major blow to this offense

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.520 
play it's a major blow to this offense
that's<00:04:06.000> always<00:04:06.239> relied<00:04:06.629> heavily<00:04:06.659> on<00:04:07.049> Jason

that's always relied heavily on Jason

that's always relied heavily on Jason

main focuses on in this game probably
and<00:04:14.009> then<00:04:14.099> tomorrow<00:04:14.250> Murray<00:04:14.729> Felix<00:04:15.150> Jones<00:04:15.419> to

see<00:04:15.750> how<00:04:15.810> much<00:04:15.930> they<00:04:16.109> get<00:04:16.199> a<00:04:16.259> look<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.709> don't

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
see how much they get a look I don't

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.039 
see how much they get a look I don't
expect<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.699> rushing<00:04:18.060> games<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.539> really<00:04:18.690> take

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
expect the rushing games to really take

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.120 
expect the rushing games to really take
over<00:04:19.349> this<00:04:19.470> game<00:04:19.680> at<00:04:19.859> all

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
over this game at all

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.979 
over this game at all
DeMarco<00:04:20.729> Murray<00:04:20.909> is<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.090> good<00:04:21.329> running<00:04:21.510> back<00:04:21.779> I

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
DeMarco Murray is a good running back I

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.750 
DeMarco Murray is a good running back I
think<00:04:22.500> that<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.830> Giants<00:04:23.340> have<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.490> good

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
think that the Giants have a good

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.940 
think that the Giants have a good
potential<00:04:24.389> attacker<00:04:24.779> a<00:04:24.960> dual<00:04:25.200> threat

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
potential attacker a dual threat

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.650 
potential attacker a dual threat
the<00:04:26.070> Cowboys<00:04:26.490> have<00:04:26.640> a<00:04:26.670> pretty<00:04:26.910> good<00:04:27.090> front<00:04:27.330> 7

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
the Cowboys have a pretty good front 7

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.780 
the Cowboys have a pretty good front 7
although<00:04:27.840> no<00:04:27.990> J<00:04:28.200> Ratliff<00:04:28.650> tonight<00:04:29.040> and<00:04:29.310> the

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
although no J Ratliff tonight and the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.370 
although no J Ratliff tonight and the
Giants<00:04:30.240> stay<00:04:30.390> I<00:04:30.420> have<00:04:30.690> always<00:04:30.870> been<00:04:31.110> suspect

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
Giants stay I have always been suspect

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.500 
Giants stay I have always been suspect
with<00:04:31.710> their<00:04:31.830> linebackers<00:04:32.520> but<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.150> Dallas

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
with their linebackers but the Dallas

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.450 
with their linebackers but the Dallas
offensive<00:04:33.930> line<00:04:34.080> is<00:04:34.260> simply<00:04:34.590> not<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:34.830> great

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
offensive line is simply not that great

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.400 
offensive line is simply not that great
and<00:04:35.670> so<00:04:35.700> I<00:04:35.790> can't<00:04:36.120> see<00:04:36.300> DeMarco<00:04:36.750> Murray<00:04:36.990> taking

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
and so I can't see DeMarco Murray taking

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.890 
and so I can't see DeMarco Murray taking
over<00:04:37.650> this<00:04:37.800> game<00:04:38.130> although<00:04:38.400> I<00:04:38.880> he<00:04:39.630> could<00:04:39.780> be<00:04:39.870> a

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
over this game although I he could be a

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.390 
over this game although I he could be a
sleeper<00:04:40.140> in<00:04:40.260> this<00:04:40.410> game<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.740> really<00:04:40.980> be<00:04:41.100> the<00:04:41.250> X

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
sleeper in this game to really be the X

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.860 
sleeper in this game to really be the X
Factor<00:04:41.820> but<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.060> think<00:04:42.360> it's<00:04:42.450> gonna<00:04:42.540> be<00:04:42.630> Dez

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
Factor but I think it's gonna be Dez

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.690 
Factor but I think it's gonna be Dez
Bryant<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:43.560> then<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:43.980> New<00:04:44.190> York<00:04:44.370> side<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.640> the

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
Bryant and then the New York side of the

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.850 
Bryant and then the New York side of the
ball<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:44.910> say<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.360> comes<00:04:45.600> down<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.900> Eli<00:04:46.440> Manning

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
ball I say it comes down to Eli Manning

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.470 
ball I say it comes down to Eli Manning
he<00:04:46.920> has<00:04:47.040> to<00:04:47.190> limit<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.580> turnovers<00:04:47.760> no

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
he has to limit the turnovers no

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.180 
he has to limit the turnovers no
interceptions<00:04:49.020> in<00:04:49.320> this<00:04:49.470> game<00:04:49.680> it's<00:04:49.860> a<00:04:49.950> big

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
interceptions in this game it's a big

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.860 
interceptions in this game it's a big
game<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.910> I<00:04:51.000> think<00:04:51.090> if<00:04:51.450> there<00:04:51.600> isn't<00:04:51.720> really

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
game and I think if there isn't really

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.360 
game and I think if there isn't really
much<00:04:52.020> of<00:04:52.170> a<00:04:52.350> running<00:04:52.590> game<00:04:52.710> going<00:04:53.040> for<00:04:53.070> New

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
much of a running game going for New

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.830 
much of a running game going for New
York<00:04:53.700> that<00:04:54.000> they're<00:04:54.120> gonna<00:04:54.240> have<00:04:54.420> to<00:04:54.450> air<00:04:54.660> the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
York that they're gonna have to air the

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.390 
York that they're gonna have to air the
ball<00:04:54.960> out<00:04:55.140> and<00:04:55.290> have<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.530> go<00:04:55.680> deep<00:04:56.010> and<00:04:56.190> when

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
ball out and have to go deep and when

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.100 
ball out and have to go deep and when
they<00:04:56.490> do<00:04:56.550> so<00:04:57.000> Eli<00:04:57.360> Manning<00:04:57.630> can't<00:04:57.900> throw

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
they do so Eli Manning can't throw

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.840 
they do so Eli Manning can't throw
interceptions<00:04:58.320> in<00:04:58.860> those<00:04:58.950> situations<00:04:59.610> he<00:04:59.730> has

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
interceptions in those situations he has

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.130 
interceptions in those situations he has
to<00:04:59.970> be<00:05:00.030> able<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.180> find<00:05:00.420> his<00:05:00.540> receivers<00:05:00.930> either

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
to be able to find his receivers either

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.510 
to be able to find his receivers either
throw<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.380> ball<00:05:01.650> where<00:05:01.800> nobody<00:05:02.130> else<00:05:02.280> can<00:05:02.400> get

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
throw the ball where nobody else can get

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.250 
throw the ball where nobody else can get
him<00:05:02.640> besides<00:05:02.910> Victor<00:05:03.240> Cruz<00:05:03.510> and<00:05:03.720> Hakeem<00:05:03.990> Nicks

him besides Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.410 
him besides Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks
he<00:05:04.710> needs<00:05:04.920> to<00:05:05.100> avoid<00:05:05.250> Brandon<00:05:05.970> Carr<00:05:06.180> and

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
he needs to avoid Brandon Carr and

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.000 
he needs to avoid Brandon Carr and
Morris<00:05:06.750> Claiborne<00:05:07.020> then<00:05:07.680> on<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.830> New<00:05:07.950> York

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
Morris Claiborne then on the New York

Morris Claiborne then on the New York
side<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.400> ball<00:05:08.550> again<00:05:08.880> I'll<00:05:09.270> be<00:05:09.450> watching

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
side of the ball again I'll be watching

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.300 
side of the ball again I'll be watching
for<00:05:09.870> that<00:05:10.020> front<00:05:10.290> for<00:05:10.470> I<00:05:10.530> want<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:10.860> see<00:05:11.010> tuck

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310

for that front for I want to see tuck
and<00:05:11.520> Jason<00:05:11.850> pierre-paul<00:05:12.000> I<00:05:12.570> want<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:12.960> see<00:05:13.020> if

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
and Jason pierre-paul I want to see if

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.390 
and Jason pierre-paul I want to see if
we<00:05:13.110> can<00:05:13.230> get<00:05:13.320> after<00:05:13.440> Romo<00:05:13.770> maybe<00:05:13.980> force<00:05:14.250> an

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
we can get after Romo maybe force an

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.070 
we can get after Romo maybe force an
interception<00:05:14.850> maybe<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.210> forced<00:05:15.630> fumble<00:05:15.990> and

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
interception maybe a forced fumble and

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.720 
interception maybe a forced fumble and
get<00:05:16.200> a<00:05:16.230> short<00:05:16.530> field<00:05:16.800> for<00:05:17.040> an<00:05:17.130> easy<00:05:17.490> touchdown

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
get a short field for an easy touchdown

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.000 
get a short field for an easy touchdown
drive<00:05:18.300> but<00:05:18.780> I<00:05:18.810> think<00:05:19.170> today's<00:05:19.410> game<00:05:19.680> comes

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
drive but I think today's game comes

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.620 
drive but I think today's game comes
down<00:05:20.280> to<00:05:20.490> big<00:05:20.670> plays<00:05:20.940> in<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.180> passing<00:05:21.600> game

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
down to big plays in the passing game

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.870 
down to big plays in the passing game
and<00:05:21.960> turnovers<00:05:22.860> I<00:05:22.980> expect<00:05:23.340> this<00:05:23.520> game<00:05:23.820> to

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
and turnovers I expect this game to

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.760 
and turnovers I expect this game to
possibly<00:05:24.420> be<00:05:24.570> a<00:05:24.600> shootout<00:05:25.020> both<00:05:25.290> teams<00:05:25.560> can

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
possibly be a shootout both teams can

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.720 
possibly be a shootout both teams can

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
tonight I am predicting a Giants victory

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.580 
tonight I am predicting a Giants victory
because<00:05:33.210> they<00:05:33.360> are<00:05:33.420> at<00:05:33.690> home<00:05:34.020> that<00:05:34.230> banner<00:05:34.470> is

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
because they are at home that banner is

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.780 
because they are at home that banner is
gonna<00:05:34.740> drop<00:05:35.040> they're<00:05:35.190> gonna<00:05:35.280> be<00:05:35.400> all<00:05:35.460> psyched

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
gonna drop they're gonna be all psyched

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.460 
gonna drop they're gonna be all psyched
up<00:05:35.970> by<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.120> defending<00:05:36.450> Super<00:05:36.570> Bowl<00:05:36.690> champions

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
up by the defending Super Bowl champions

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.840 
up by the defending Super Bowl champions
and<00:05:37.560> I<00:05:37.770> think<00:05:37.830> that<00:05:38.160> front<00:05:38.430> four<00:05:38.670> could

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
and I think that front four could

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.250 
and I think that front four could
overwhelm<00:05:39.090> Tony<00:05:39.450> Romo<00:05:39.720> tonight<00:05:39.990> and<00:05:40.110> cause

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
overwhelm Tony Romo tonight and cause

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.360 
overwhelm Tony Romo tonight and cause
some<00:05:40.440> turnovers<00:05:40.890> that<00:05:40.980> can<00:05:41.070> be<00:05:41.160> very

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
some turnovers that can be very

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.100 
some turnovers that can be very
game-changing<00:05:42.090> but<00:05:42.210> I<00:05:42.270> expect<00:05:42.540> a<00:05:42.600> close<00:05:42.840> game

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
game-changing but I expect a close game

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.650 
game-changing but I expect a close game
a<00:05:43.350> 34<00:05:44.250> to<00:05:44.430> 31<00:05:44.880> victory<00:05:45.210> for<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:45.420> New<00:05:45.480> York
