 Luis Potosí recorded the birth of 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.559
 three specimens of white tigers of 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.360
 flares gives us a lot of taste because 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.580
 we have already had two offspring 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.310
 in this zoo children of this 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.040
 same copy that were born in 2008 and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.020
 in 2009 and now 2012 we have the 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.820
 surprise that these pups are colored 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.369
 white that unlike the last time 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.380
 the tigers were red 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.270
 birth of these tigers 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.360
 flare whites happened the past 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.640
 Tuesday May 22 are in perfect 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.520
 conditions the female gave birth on its own 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.290
 did not require support was nothing else was 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.570
 was watching the copy that everything 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.030
 come out perfect the pups are 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.810
 feeding very well they are taking weight 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.480
 are they looked very healthy is a 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.160
 mother that we have very tender very 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.560
 loving and that is something that to us 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.110
 It gives us a lot of peace because we can 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.790
 say that this is going to be a success in the 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.470
 development of the specimens 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.750
 birth in captivity is one of the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.520
 measures that the mexquitic zoo has 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.110
 carried out for the conservation of 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.100
 the species in danger of extinction 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.900
 is 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.610
 the extinction book the species 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.159
 we are trying to put 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.979
 our seeds as for the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.259
 conservation actually there are in many 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.759
 zoos is the white tiger not in 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.100
 everything is taking place the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.229
 reproduction and I think this is an achievement 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.610
 that has the san luis zoo 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.830

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.289
