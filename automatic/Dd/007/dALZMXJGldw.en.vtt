radiation therapy patients will first
have<00:00:15.290> to<00:00:15.410> come<00:00:15.590> in<00:00:15.740> for<00:00:15.980> what's<00:00:16.129> called<00:00:16.279> a

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
have to come in for what's called a

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.450 
have to come in for what's called a
simulation<00:00:16.970> scan<00:00:17.570> that<00:00:18.080> is<00:00:18.259> a<00:00:18.289> CT<00:00:18.800> scan<00:00:19.160> but

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
simulation scan that is a CT scan but

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.189 
simulation scan that is a CT scan but
instead<00:00:20.269> of<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:20.570> scan<00:00:20.810> that<00:00:20.839> you've<00:00:21.079> received

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
instead of the scan that you've received

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.259 
instead of the scan that you've received
in<00:00:21.499> the<00:00:21.589> past<00:00:21.769> this<00:00:22.339> is<00:00:22.490> a<00:00:22.519> scan<00:00:22.880> where<00:00:23.119> your

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
in the past this is a scan where your

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.450 
in the past this is a scan where your
body<00:00:23.509> is<00:00:23.779> in<00:00:23.900> what<00:00:24.050> we<00:00:24.079> call<00:00:24.349> a<00:00:24.380> cradle<00:00:24.859> which

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
body is in what we call a cradle which

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.210 
body is in what we call a cradle which
is<00:00:25.609> a<00:00:25.640> Styrofoam<00:00:26.300> mold<00:00:26.749> which<00:00:27.589> essentially

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
is a Styrofoam mold which essentially

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.159 
is a Styrofoam mold which essentially
decreases<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.089> amount<00:00:29.179> of<00:00:29.419> motion<00:00:29.900> that<00:00:30.109> you

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
decreases the amount of motion that you

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.229 
decreases the amount of motion that you
have<00:00:30.560> as<00:00:30.949> you're<00:00:31.699> getting<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:31.939> radiation

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
have as you're getting the radiation

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.819 
have as you're getting the radiation
treatment<00:00:32.870> that's<00:00:33.020> very<00:00:33.260> important<00:00:33.739> because

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
treatment that's very important because

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.770 
treatment that's very important because
we<00:00:34.070> need<00:00:34.219> to<00:00:34.280> make<00:00:34.430> sure<00:00:34.460> that<00:00:34.609> your<00:00:35.329> body<00:00:35.510> is

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
we need to make sure that your body is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.840 
we need to make sure that your body is
in<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.020> same<00:00:36.260> exact<00:00:36.590> position<00:00:36.770> when<00:00:37.640> we<00:00:37.730> do

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
in the same exact position when we do

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.189 
in the same exact position when we do
the<00:00:37.940> planning<00:00:38.120> is<00:00:38.539> when<00:00:38.690> you<00:00:38.780> actually<00:00:38.930> get

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
the planning is when you actually get

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.740 
the planning is when you actually get
the<00:00:39.320> radiation<00:00:39.829> treatment<00:00:40.629> after<00:00:41.629> the

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
the radiation treatment after the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.080 
the radiation treatment after the
simulation<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.710> will<00:00:42.739> go<00:00:43.010> home<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:43.579> we'll

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
simulation you will go home and we'll

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.340 
simulation you will go home and we'll
continue<00:00:44.269> to<00:00:44.570> work<00:00:44.690> on<00:00:44.930> your<00:00:45.050> radiation

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
continue to work on your radiation

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.900 
continue to work on your radiation
treatment<00:00:45.530> over<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.100> next<00:00:46.370> one<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:46.699> a<00:00:46.760> half

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
treatment over the next one and a half

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.450 
treatment over the next one and a half
or<00:00:47.090> two<00:00:47.120> weeks<00:00:47.510> after<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.440> scan<00:00:48.679> is<00:00:48.710> complete

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
or two weeks after the scan is complete

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.250 
or two weeks after the scan is complete
the<00:00:49.670> images<00:00:50.030> are<00:00:50.210> sent<00:00:50.570> over<00:00:50.690> into<00:00:51.230> a

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
the images are sent over into a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.229 
the images are sent over into a
treatment<00:00:51.559> planning<00:00:52.039> system<00:00:52.519> essentially<00:00:53.120> we

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
treatment planning system essentially we

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.000 
treatment planning system essentially we
first<00:00:53.480> we'll<00:00:53.719> go<00:00:53.899> ahead<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:54.230> conquer<00:00:54.769> out<00:00:54.920> the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
first we'll go ahead and conquer out the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.790 
first we'll go ahead and conquer out the
tumor<00:00:55.429> and<00:00:55.820> we'll<00:00:56.359> come<00:00:56.539> up<00:00:56.570> with<00:00:56.719> a<00:00:57.260> a

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
tumor and we'll come up with a a

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.549 
tumor and we'll come up with a a
combination<00:00:58.579> of<00:00:58.640> radiation<00:00:59.239> beams<00:00:59.570> to<00:01:00.260> treat

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
combination of radiation beams to treat

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.639 
combination of radiation beams to treat
the<00:01:00.769> tumor<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.519> at<00:01:02.089> the<00:01:02.179> same<00:01:02.359> time<00:01:02.660> limit<00:01:03.379> the

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
the tumor and at the same time limit the

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.620 
the tumor and at the same time limit the
radiation<00:01:04.339> dose<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.940> normal<00:01:05.210> tissues

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
radiation dose to the normal tissues

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.560 
radiation dose to the normal tissues
clearly<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.680> normal<00:01:07.070> tissues<00:01:07.579> are<00:01:07.970> getting<00:01:08.450> a

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
clearly the normal tissues are getting a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.170 
clearly the normal tissues are getting a
much<00:01:08.840> lower<00:01:09.140> dose<00:01:09.290> of<00:01:09.890> radiation<00:01:10.250> compared<00:01:11.090> to

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
much lower dose of radiation compared to

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.359 
much lower dose of radiation compared to
the<00:01:11.299> tumor<00:01:11.570> itself<00:01:11.869> it's<00:01:12.710> essentially<00:01:13.189> like

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
the tumor itself it's essentially like

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.249 
the tumor itself it's essentially like
using<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.939> lot<00:01:13.970> of<00:01:14.180> different<00:01:14.450> lights<00:01:14.930> coming

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
using a lot of different lights coming

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.530 
using a lot of different lights coming
in<00:01:15.439> from<00:01:15.650> multiple<00:01:16.009> directions<00:01:16.540> converging

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
in from multiple directions converging

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.510 
in from multiple directions converging
in<00:01:17.630> one<00:01:17.659> area<00:01:18.049> but<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.829> area<00:01:19.100> around<00:01:19.159> the

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
in one area but the area around the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.770 
in one area but the area around the
lights<00:01:19.700> are<00:01:19.850> actually<00:01:20.119> not<00:01:20.270> getting<00:01:20.540> much

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
lights are actually not getting much

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.600 
lights are actually not getting much
light<00:01:21.049> radiation<00:01:21.680> works<00:01:22.009> in<00:01:22.189> very<00:01:22.369> much<00:01:22.549> a

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
light radiation works in very much a

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.969 
light radiation works in very much a
similar<00:01:22.939> way<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:23.750> therapists<00:01:24.290> again<00:01:24.560> review

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
similar way the therapists again review

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.859 
similar way the therapists again review
the<00:01:25.070> plan<00:01:25.340> make<00:01:26.090> sure<00:01:26.299> it's<00:01:26.509> been<00:01:26.630> done

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
the plan make sure it's been done

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.350 
the plan make sure it's been done
properly<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.710> then<00:01:28.189> they<00:01:28.369> import<00:01:28.850> that<00:01:29.000> into

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
properly and then they import that into

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.319 
properly and then they import that into
the<00:01:29.540> radiation<00:01:30.049> treatment<00:01:30.469> machine<00:01:31.329> then

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
the radiation treatment machine then

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:33.670 
the radiation treatment machine then
it's<00:01:32.630> time<00:01:32.840> for<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.259> come<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:33.560> get

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
it's time for you to come and get

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.240 
it's time for you to come and get
treatment

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
treatment

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
treatment
when<00:01:35.940> you<00:01:36.060> come<00:01:36.300> in<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.630> your<00:01:36.720> treatment

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
when you come in for your treatment

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.080 
when you come in for your treatment
you're<00:01:37.620> gonna<00:01:37.710> again<00:01:38.070> lay<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.580> radiation

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
you're gonna again lay on the radiation

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.630 
you're gonna again lay on the radiation
treatment<00:01:39.240> table<00:01:40.140> there's<00:01:41.100> gonna<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.460> some

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
treatment table there's gonna be some

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.730 
treatment table there's gonna be some
images<00:01:42.090> taken<00:01:42.330> of<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.780> body<00:01:42.990> specifically

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
images taken of your body specifically

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.920 
images taken of your body specifically
something<00:01:43.950> called<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.370> cone<00:01:44.640> beam<00:01:44.940> CT<00:01:44.970> scan

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
something called a cone beam CT scan

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.290 
something called a cone beam CT scan
this<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.740> yet<00:01:46.920> another<00:01:47.040> CT<00:01:47.640> scan<00:01:47.940> but<00:01:48.120> it's<00:01:48.240> a

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
this is yet another CT scan but it's a

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.440 
this is yet another CT scan but it's a
very<00:01:48.510> low<00:01:48.780> dose<00:01:49.080> of<00:01:49.350> radiation<00:01:49.940> those<00:01:50.940> images

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
very low dose of radiation those images

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.910 
very low dose of radiation those images
are<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:51.750> overlaid<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.560> your<00:01:52.710> treatment

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
are then overlaid with your treatment

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.520 
are then overlaid with your treatment
planning<00:01:53.310> scan<00:01:53.760> and<00:01:54.180> at<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.600> point<00:01:54.930> we<00:01:55.380> work

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
planning scan and at that point we work

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.130 
planning scan and at that point we work
very<00:01:55.560> closely<00:01:56.160> with<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:56.810> physicists<00:01:57.810> yeah

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
very closely with the physicists yeah

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.230 
very closely with the physicists yeah
that<00:01:58.320> looks<00:01:58.470> good<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.830> well<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.460> therapist

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
that looks good as well as the therapist

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.750 
that looks good as well as the therapist
they're<00:02:00.510> aligning<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.320> bone<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:01.980> to<00:02:02.610> make

they're aligning to bone here to make

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.790 
they're aligning to bone here to make

perfectly merged it is absolutely

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.960 
perfectly merged it is absolutely
critical<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.830> matching<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
millimeters to make sure that we target

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.220 
millimeters to make sure that we target
the<00:02:14.400> tumor<00:02:14.580> accurately<00:02:15.270> if<00:02:15.510> we<00:02:15.720> miss<00:02:15.990> the

the tumor accurately if we miss the
tumor<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:17.010> means<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.400> we're<00:02:17.550> treating

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
tumor that means that we're treating

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.730 
tumor that means that we're treating
normal<00:02:18.150> tissues<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.020> results<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.530> more

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740

feel comfortable that they're merged

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.340 
feel comfortable that they're merged
properly<00:02:23.760> we<00:02:24.120> then<00:02:24.330> pay<00:02:24.570> attention<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
properly we then pay attention to the

this is your last feel then you'll be

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.840 
this is your last feel then you'll be
done<00:02:48.720> we<00:02:49.230> don't<00:02:49.410> give<00:02:49.650> any<00:02:49.739> chemotherapy<00:02:50.610> with

the radiation treatment but we'll often

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.350 
the radiation treatment but we'll often
patients<00:02:53.400> will<00:02:53.670> receive<00:02:54.090> chemotherapy

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
patients will receive chemotherapy

in order to limit side effects we

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.009 
in order to limit side effects we
usually<00:02:59.610> don't<00:02:59.790> want<00:03:00.030> any<00:03:00.209> chemotherapy<00:03:00.450> to

after the radiation treatment and this

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.430 
after the radiation treatment and this
is<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.640> try<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.850> limit<00:03:06.420> any<00:03:06.660> side<00:03:06.930> effects<00:03:07.260> that

treatments together patients tend to

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.310 
treatments together patients tend to
have<00:03:11.070> less<00:03:11.489> side<00:03:11.760> effects<00:03:12.180> than<00:03:12.450> what<00:03:12.870> we<00:03:13.019> used

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
have less side effects than what we used

have less side effects than what we used
to<00:03:13.470> see<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:13.890> standard<00:03:14.310> radiation<00:03:14.850> therapy

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
to see with standard radiation therapy

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.030 
to see with standard radiation therapy
which<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.570> given<00:03:15.840> over<00:03:15.959> five<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.530> six<00:03:16.769> weeks

which is given over five to six weeks
generally<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.910> most<00:03:18.030> common<00:03:18.420> complaint<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.810> a

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
generally the most common complaint is a

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.110 
generally the most common complaint is a
little<00:03:19.110> bit<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.290> fatigue<00:03:19.440> or<00:03:20.160> tiredness<00:03:20.760> and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
little bit of fatigue or tiredness and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.000 
little bit of fatigue or tiredness and
maybe<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.780> little<00:03:21.989> bit<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.260> nausea<00:03:22.380> but<00:03:22.860> we'll

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
maybe a little bit of nausea but we'll

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.770 
maybe a little bit of nausea but we'll
give<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.250> medicine<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.820> try<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.060> prevent<00:03:24.420> that

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.330 

so<00:03:27.780> therefore<00:03:28.260> patients<00:03:28.620> don't<00:03:28.980> typically

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
so therefore patients don't typically

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.220 
so therefore patients don't typically
experience<00:03:29.970> some<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.720> common<00:03:31.080> side

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
experience some of the common side

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.479 
experience some of the common side
effects<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.650> we<00:03:31.830> see<00:03:32.010> with<00:03:32.160> standard

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
effects that we see with standard

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.699 
effects that we see with standard
radiation<00:03:32.760> which<00:03:33.660> include<00:03:34.049> nausea<00:03:34.260> and

vomiting and diarrhea and other things

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.080 
vomiting and diarrhea and other things
the<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.170> only<00:03:37.410> real<00:03:37.860> risk<00:03:38.160> with<00:03:38.519> stereotactic

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
the the only real risk with stereotactic

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.630 
the the only real risk with stereotactic
body<00:03:39.360> radiation<00:03:39.870> therapy<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:41.070> long<00:03:41.280> term

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
body radiation therapy is the long term

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.790 
body radiation therapy is the long term
risk<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.150> again<00:03:42.840> because<00:03:43.200> we're<00:03:43.349> giving<00:03:43.590> such

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
risk and again because we're giving such

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.500 
risk and again because we're giving such
a<00:03:43.830> high<00:03:44.099> dose<00:03:44.400> over<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.790> short<00:03:45.000> period<00:03:45.240> of<00:03:45.390> time

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
a high dose over a short period of time

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.890 
a high dose over a short period of time
tissues<00:03:46.930> may<00:03:47.909> long-term<00:03:48.909> experience<00:03:49.689> some

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
tissues may long-term experience some

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.199 
tissues may long-term experience some
side<00:03:50.110> effects<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.739> those<00:03:51.340> can<00:03:51.519> be<00:03:51.549> ulcers<00:03:52.060> or

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
side effects and those can be ulcers or

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.660 
side effects and those can be ulcers or
other<00:03:52.390> things<00:03:52.720> so<00:03:53.170> in<00:03:53.530> general<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:54.340> biggest

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
other things so in general the biggest

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.750 
other things so in general the biggest
risk<00:03:54.939> is<00:03:55.209> is<00:03:55.680> possibly<00:03:56.680> an<00:03:56.799> ulcer<00:03:57.159> or<00:03:57.189> damage

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
risk is is possibly an ulcer or damage

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.789 
risk is is possibly an ulcer or damage
to<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.000> small<00:03:58.239> bowel<00:03:58.480> or<00:03:58.840> sometimes<00:03:59.560> maybe

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
to the small bowel or sometimes maybe

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.610 
to the small bowel or sometimes maybe
damage<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.549> kidneys<00:04:00.909> but<00:04:01.209> in<00:04:01.930> general<00:04:02.379> we

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
damage to the kidneys but in general we

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.259 
damage to the kidneys but in general we
have<00:04:02.739> not<00:04:02.920> really<00:04:03.250> seen<00:04:03.459> these<00:04:03.700> side<00:04:03.940> effects

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
have not really seen these side effects

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.059 
have not really seen these side effects
from<00:04:04.390> patients<00:04:04.870> up<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.019> this<00:04:05.230> point<00:04:05.500> but<00:04:06.040> again

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
from patients up to this point but again

from patients up to this point but again
future<00:04:06.760> research<00:04:07.060> is<00:04:07.269> needed<00:04:07.390> to<00:04:07.540> follow<00:04:07.840> that

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
future research is needed to follow that

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.479 
future research is needed to follow that
follow<00:04:08.200> patients<00:04:08.409> closer<00:04:08.920> over<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.280> longer

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
follow patients closer over a longer

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.710
