00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.790
 for the transition from conventional to 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.900
 The automatic milking can be many 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.790
 Aspects speak 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.950
 often they are as individual as that 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.950
 plants themselves produce the milk 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.360
 because I'm in the barn the same time 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.550
 But more time for the cows 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.620
 before I did the buwog and the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.540
 milkstand because megawatt also the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.490
 main work in the barn and current 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.610
 main work the observation and the 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:54.480
 socket cleaning milking takes over in york 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:56.190
 rpo with the modernization of their 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.990
 operations and the medium term 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.239
 pending takeover of the yard by 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.790
 son ewald chose the son 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.329
 for the multi box systems one by gea 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.329
 farm technologies 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.930
 we are currently planning a 2 box with the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.950
 you what is possible from allowing look 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.810
 But we do not want the goal from us 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.540
 they mostly lose that way 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.340
 little stress like more altitude and 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.780
 too little stress like men summoned 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.030
 It is calm and relaxed in the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.950
 barn of family respectively to the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.950
 Controlled animal traffic leaves the animals 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.369
 self-determined run eat and rest 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.369
 Report 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.050
 around the milking robot checks the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.180
 preselection make the right one after 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:02:14.540
 Selection separates conspicuous animals in 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:02:16.490
 the treatment area with the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.140
 holistic barn concept that the 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.880
 Specialists in bonen for the 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.640
 developed milk farm in the black forest 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.490
 could the gea farm technologies family 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.430
 soon completely convincing example 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.950
 became the third series of the already 1999 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.250
 created a playpen perfectly over a 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.630
 bridge solution finally integrated 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.850
 spoke more financial 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.850
 Considerations for the investment in the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.000
 It is said that 20 of the animals are herd 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.670
 responsible for about 80 of the work 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.830
 are for the care of this special 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.400
 needs cows offers a make center 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.090
 the m 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.470
 as a turning and hinge point ideal condition 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.209
 that with the milking robot for 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.130
 The heels are also comfortable with the 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.140
 hand hanging on cherishes family 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.250
 ewald on the design of the ma 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.310
 especially what we like very much 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.970
 the cause that recognize 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.060
 the ghv huge advantage he attaches to the 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.970
 conventional 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.830
 first takes the milker sits is anna 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.340
 motto as if by hand 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.760
 then the cleaning comes in the zÃ¼rcher in it 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.440
 and it logs in ccp renault if 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.500
 this is completed the Markish 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.500
 hang on the ku and catch that 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.950
 Remember and is where the stand 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.560
 actually becomes of human hands 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.630
 attaches cleaned and there will be easy 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.840
 whey and we really liked that 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.360
 say that every cow has to do with it 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.000
 So you have to let some before 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.959
 he noticeably no problem of those 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.600
 90 100 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.049
 the lonza all notice some indian 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.850
 giant incident addition to the high throughput 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.520
 counts for hubert ewald one 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.530
 excellent milk quality of his animals 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.780
 eat from the clean food table 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.580
 and he has an eye for processing 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.580
 and choice of material of his milking robot 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.780
 So I have to tell the robot one 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:44.419
 Processing of robot itself is 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.150
 first class i have a brother where in 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.940
 the industry he works in is in progress 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.840
 switch is exact is almost like in the 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.659
 medicine 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.360
 she had those who welded 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:59.419
 processing of the robot very nice 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.030
 so I am there as well as quality and also 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.340
 the material here certainly very stable 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:09.650
 robust would have liked very well 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.630
 So everything v2a so the processes and 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.340
 Everything so I do very well and what 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.680
 we need is a very good one 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.659
 Customer service are really happy 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.370
 over it from the good experience more flexible 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.770
 working hours and more effective 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.539
 hubert ewald has the workflow 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.090
 meanwhile own a name 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.090
 created for the automatic mac system 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:42.879
 read in front 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.879
 without that would be perfect
