00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.140 

and<00:01:43.390> we<00:01:44.320> follow<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.710> GPS<00:01:45.040> for<00:01:45.430> now<00:01:45.550> taking<00:01:45.940> it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
and we follow the GPS for now taking it

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.950 
and we follow the GPS for now taking it
easy<00:01:46.300> going<00:01:46.570> around<00:01:46.930> this<00:01:47.080> corner<00:01:47.410> here<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
easy going around this corner here the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.170 
easy going around this corner here the
important<00:01:50.410> thing<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:50.800> to<00:01:50.860> not<00:01:51.460> go<00:01:51.700> so<00:01:51.940> fast

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
important thing is to not go so fast

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.370 
important thing is to not go so fast
that<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.510> truck<00:01:52.810> can't<00:01:53.110> make<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.530> turn<00:01:58.380> now

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
that the truck can't make the turn now

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.490 
that the truck can't make the turn now
here's<00:01:59.920> where<00:02:00.100> we<00:02:00.160> go<00:02:00.340> off<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.670> GPS<00:02:01.000> route

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
here's where we go off the GPS route

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.080 
here's where we go off the GPS route
you're<00:02:02.500> gonna<00:02:02.620> get<00:02:02.800> off<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.130> gas<00:02:03.250> as<00:02:03.580> soon<00:02:03.970> as

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
you hit the grass here and that should

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.630 
you hit the grass here and that should
slow<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:07.000> down<00:02:07.270> enough<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.630> make<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.170> turn

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
slow you down enough to make the turn

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.220 
slow you down enough to make the turn
but<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.820> may<00:02:10.090> have<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.360> tap<00:02:10.630> your<00:02:10.780> brakes<00:02:10.930> once

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
but you may have to tap your brakes once

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:22.110 
but you may have to tap your brakes once
just<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.620> make<00:02:11.740> sure<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:21.400> one<00:02:21.610> thing<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:21.970> watch

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
just to make sure the one thing to watch

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.910 
just to make sure the one thing to watch
out<00:02:22.360> for<00:02:22.570> here<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:22.990> that<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.320> don't<00:02:23.590> turn<00:02:23.770> up

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
out for here is that you don't turn up

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.590 
out for here is that you don't turn up

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
the road as the truck goes behind this

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.600 
the road as the truck goes behind this
tree<00:02:25.870> here<00:02:26.110> because<00:02:26.890> there's<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.130> good<00:02:27.340> chance

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
tree here because there's a good chance

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.280 
tree here because there's a good chance
that<00:02:27.760> you'll<00:02:28.000> hit<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.390> telephone<00:02:28.720> pole<00:02:28.900> at

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
that you'll hit that telephone pole at

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:50.250 
that you'll hit that telephone pole at
the<00:02:29.320> side<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.800> road

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.080 

we're<00:02:51.260> back<00:02:51.380> on<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.680> GPS<00:02:52.099> path<00:02:52.400> for<00:02:52.640> now<00:02:52.760> until

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
we're back on the GPS path for now until

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.390 
we're back on the GPS path for now until
we<00:02:53.390> get<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.660> this<00:02:53.750> point<00:02:54.080> here<00:02:54.380> we're<00:02:55.280> gonna
