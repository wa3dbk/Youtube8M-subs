I<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> key<00:02:39.580> with<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.850> ankle<00:02:40.150> boot<00:02:40.360> is

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
I think the key with the ankle boot is

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.260 
I think the key with the ankle boot is
just<00:02:40.990> kind<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.500> creating<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.090> edgy<00:02:43.090> look

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
that really is pulled together but a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.920 
that really is pulled together but a
little<00:02:45.430> bit<00:02:45.520> classic<00:02:45.970> still<00:02:46.270> especially<00:02:46.600> for

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
little bit classic still especially for

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.750
