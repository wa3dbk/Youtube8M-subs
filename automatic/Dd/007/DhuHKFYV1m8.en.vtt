00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.209
 let's even words today with the 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.160
 president of uruguay josé mujica who 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.900
 is located in the city ​​of caracas the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.550
 capital of venezuela in the segments 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.130
 previous of our program and we have 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.619
 heard his reflections on 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.689
 venezuela from the role of chávez de la 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.180
 integration and in these last minutes 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.189
 today of this space we are going to ask 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.750
 for the other aspects in this case more 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.340
 intimately related to 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.470
 statements that he has given in another 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 moment with your own country with 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.940
 political circumstances of Uruguay 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.200
 president you said live with little 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.690
 echoes that position not in the time that 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.239
 I live is not an old author 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.460
 he told me that imperialism in the last 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.530
 stage of capitalism I disagree 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.490
 this one that I know is called the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.860
 consumerism 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.950
 which may be the final stage of the 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.040
 human civilization 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.950
 if we keep pulling pulling and pulling and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.400
 cristian pulling and we add the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.740
 nature and then we worry about 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.560
 the ecological problems problem 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.070
 ecological consequences 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.740
 the waste of thing is one I do 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.369
 tourism new monument for poverty 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:31.369
 I am outraged by wasting spending 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.369
 useless things and spend human energy 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.440
 but what I raise is not new 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.560
 definition of poverty there séneca 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.250
 to live it read the technique there in the 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.940
 background of the story this is an old 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.650
 because I repeat it again when you 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.070
 purchases 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.040
 do not buy with money purchases with the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.150
 time of your life that you had to spend 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.909
 to earn that money 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:08.509
 and it 's money fell from heaven 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.759
 for the fruit of an inheritance, do not doubt 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.830
 that someone 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.970
 spending time of his life so that 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.970
 money will accumulate 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.939
 it means that when you are 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.660
 buying are you buying not with currency 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:24.510
 with human life time 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.489
 so 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.900
 in this world in which to live in gardón 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.260
 at the rib in others 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.939
 you do not have to be a parasite 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.830
 then we have to have a quota of 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:38.090
 work 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.000
 but life tells us only to work 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.940
 life like that is short and life is 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.370
 to live it and to live it you have to have 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.280
 time and it has to be free time 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.709
 now if you work eight hours and also 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.810
 then you get another job and another 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.239
 work and your son can not see it anymore 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.740
 your darling either and danny more and at 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.830
 end will end an old tire made 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.110
 and if you live life 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.590
 and that's when I tell people 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.930
 living in the baggage common sense 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.660
 so 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.200
 but good people are the crazy 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.500
 pay fee buy pim pam it seems to me that 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.940
 happier 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.940
 president the extension
