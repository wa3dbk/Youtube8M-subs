00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.929
 Hello, I 'm jp from r2 and 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.570
 requests on our channel that you 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.370
 just saw I'll teach you to install 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.520
 a sinister motherboard within a 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.029
 monster cabinet I already left the cabinet 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.580
 and the board provided a cpu and memory in the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.109
 board and the front wires passing through 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.720
 behind the cabinet 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.890
 starting from the front aldo that is in the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.750
 left corner 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.149
 note that the connector has a hole 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.280
 covered and Alpine is absent on the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.100
 same position this is the chamfer of the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.360
 connector to prevent it from being judged 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.450
 way bisexual 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.550
 Now it's the turn of the USB port to notice that 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.550
 this time shamrock is in the corner of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.160
 club next to son gnd is important 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.559
 remember that a front USB connected 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.320
 wrongly changes the side voltages and can 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.899
 damage the devices in it 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.649
 ie it will burn your pen drive everything 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.589
 The following is usb 3.0's connector 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.119
 contains more pins than 2.0 and are 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.220
 smaller and closer 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.070
 the result of this work lies in the base 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.610
 the plastic housing and on one side of the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.070
 club 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.100
 I'm going to take this trash here to stay 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.409
 easy to bleed buttons and LEDs 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.600
 the motherboard sinister have a scheme 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.369
 standard connectors and an example 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.740
 printed on the board had for any 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.210
 cloud can connect everything right without 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.060
 afraid to be happy 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.650
 starting with the power sw which is a button 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.390
 to turn on the computer 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.909
 following the diagram printed on the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.880
 motherboard it goes in that position here that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.020
 I'm calling I'm going to reset sw 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.450
 below power 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.670
 note that it is on the left side of pi 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.950
 in the guide that only serves to be without 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.860
 no club even a tip is to start 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.110
 by sw swapping on boards that do not have the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.930
 printed diagram in the default schema 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.290
 he always sits next to the pine forever 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.690
 alone 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:04.070
 this is the hd led connector it goes 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.440
 the left side of the reset sw and finally 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.229
 in this part the two children alone 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.910
 power led pay attention to the polarities 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.830
 not printed because if they are inverted 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.830
 oled will not light 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.780
 but do not worry if this happens 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.780
 Your computer will not explode. 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.390
 Now I'll connect the boladão fan 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.390
 120 mm cabinet in cipher 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.980
 I installed the source to pass the elk 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.629
 12 volts behind the cabinet has the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.030
 cloud out there that says it's wrong 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.549
 install the power supply before screwing the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.560
 plate but this is just another fallacy 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.560
 of these brats knees 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.250
 now that everything is already in place it's just 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.090
 place the card inside the case to 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.849
 connect the latest cases 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.280
 do not forget to connect the auxiliary 12 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.160
 volts from the motherboard and take care 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.170
 do not be dragging the plate here 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.870
 now is the time to do the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.640
 Cable management also known 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.069
 as the ménage à trois 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.739
 if some cables overlap 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.080
 arrange them to be parallel in 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.480
 position the rear panel of the 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.769
 motherboard in the mirror that should already be 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.769
 enclosed in the cabinet 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.470
 The tip is now to put a screw in the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.930
 hole in the top corner that has already 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.030
 serves to hold the card while you 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.570
 pulls the excess wire that is on the side 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.570
 from the inside 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.500
 it is important that they are not 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.480
 superimposed so as not to raise the plate 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.350
 when the other screws are 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.350
 tight 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.280
 see how well they hid 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.200
 say goodbye to that crazy filly 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.200
 which looks like a rattlesnake's nest 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.390
 now it is only to accuse remembering that neither 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.670
 all cabinets have holes in the 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.070
 folds of the back plate and 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.260
 need the space the pain to accommodate the 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.660
 take care to place the 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.610
 spacers only in places where 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.160
 I knew well with the holes of your plate 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.450
 this cloud can cause scratches and 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.060
 short 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.150
 last and not least the 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.520
 24-pin main power maiden 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.009
 this should also dive by the plate 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.110
 hot and emerge through the hole 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.479
 and this is how you put a motherboard 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.509
 in a monstrous cabinet and 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:51.080
 slow monster liked the olic and follow the
