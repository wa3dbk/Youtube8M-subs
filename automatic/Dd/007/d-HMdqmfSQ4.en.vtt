 rather light for these players born with a heavy weight 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.460
 creation to transmission and yet make sure of the more 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 interesting 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.230
 the administration its history never in the hands 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.210
 they have a priori it must win it deschamps is all traced

 Holds a glimpse of the year

 but the hazards of personal life and also slightly to the ticket 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.960
 green even if early in the evening 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.869
 very interested down to earth france's proposed of course happy 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:15.929
 because we are impatient for the deaf 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:18.929
 and we realize very quickly that the author writes precisely 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.050
 so that's going to be a big narrative orange revolution but as for 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.269
 to master perfectly forming a clot 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.659
 and not in the way of showing things to show the limits on 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:30.389
 characters 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.149
 all the psychological concatenations 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:36.149
 to be shown in a very competitive way 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:46.009
 so with these attacks placed on another bush warrant he did have to choose 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.559
 mathematical presentation decided Flemish parties interesting a 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:50.469

 at 46 36 holes 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.480
 on the contrary very good turn are not all 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.829
 I never never 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.279
 and that's good to grab a new genre so here is 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.599
 intentionally it's still they are something that he 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.009
 must respect the good food the culinary art it's part of our 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.419
 culture and beautiful bill acted like Japanese ad if we talk about 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:25.379
 French gastronomy this is obvious to everyone this one is 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.549
 in any case it can not be improvised that it is something that one learns 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.249
 in the long run and training schools I will always be there and that 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:33.839
 you 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.549

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.489
 then m 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.489
 but yesterday the mayor and his master worry is not something that can be learned 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.009
 a bit like that by snapping fingers 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:51.099
 we're not going to you the way the singer suffers with the very black gold voice 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.670
 well that turns this mandate 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.799
 that is to say that even at the base of the city of valenciennes 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.169
 allard know that obviously 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.169
 but 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.779
 by fabien letennier other things like that 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.809
 but from there to know the state question of taste 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:12.460
 Switzerland wants to leave 300 m 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.540
 sometimes we will realize that in a bar in the city then bad 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.930
 obviously remember that david fish showed very specific things 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.850
 this case but you have to base yourself barack obama the doggies the book 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.050
 for its part that I do not care it's the evening it is about a meter jean 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.629
 fernandez for the sector Friday evening 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.229
