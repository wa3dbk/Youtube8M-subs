00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
looks to be the 777 a Gavin finer is one

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.800 
looks to be the 777 a Gavin finer is one
of<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:03.680> machines<00:01:03.830> that<00:01:04.190> was<00:01:04.570> involved<00:01:05.570> in<00:01:05.690> the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.139 
of the machines that was involved in the
incident<00:01:05.899> I<00:01:06.229> did<00:01:06.619> see<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:06.950> one<00:01:07.130> sled<00:01:07.460> out<00:01:07.820> of

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
incident I did see the one sled out of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:09.670 
incident I did see the one sled out of
turn<00:01:08.330> four<00:01:08.660> kind<00:01:08.899> of<00:01:08.960> go<00:01:09.050> down<00:01:09.170> into<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.440> bail

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
turn four kind of go down into the bail

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.440 
turn four kind of go down into the bail
are<00:01:10.040> down<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.490> inside<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.000> into<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.270> snow

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
are down to the inside and into the snow

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.210 
are down to the inside and into the snow
and<00:01:11.479> I'm<00:01:11.690> wondering<00:01:11.869> if<00:01:13.060> if<00:01:14.060> Gavin<00:01:14.990> finer<00:01:15.259> had

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
and I'm wondering if if Gavin finer had

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.300 
and I'm wondering if if Gavin finer had
gotten<00:01:16.430> into<00:01:16.759> that<00:01:16.910> so<00:01:17.210> uh<00:01:18.009> you<00:01:19.009> know<00:01:19.039> will

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
gotten into that so uh you know will

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.029 
gotten into that so uh you know will
kind<00:01:19.520> of<00:01:19.640> be<00:01:19.940> able<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.560> take<00:01:21.560> a<00:01:21.590> little<00:01:21.800> bit<00:01:21.979> of

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
kind of be able to take a little bit of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.010 
kind of be able to take a little bit of
a<00:01:22.190> look<00:01:22.430> at<00:01:22.940> it<00:01:23.000> here<00:01:23.420> if<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.690> look<00:01:23.869> at<00:01:23.990> the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
a look at it here if you look at the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.109 
a look at it here if you look at the
jumbotron<00:01:24.770> folks<00:01:25.460> you'll<00:01:25.670> be<00:01:25.789> able<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:25.940> take<00:01:26.090> a

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
jumbotron folks you'll be able to take a

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.690 
jumbotron folks you'll be able to take a
look<00:01:26.330> at<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.479> replay<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:28.160> incident<00:01:28.550> that

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
look at a replay of the incident that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.130 
look at a replay of the incident that
occurred<00:01:29.090> down<00:01:29.990> there<00:01:30.200> in<00:01:30.350> turn<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:32.140> we'll

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
occurred down there in turn to and we'll

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.520 
occurred down there in turn to and we'll
see<00:01:33.320> exactly<00:01:33.680> what<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.220> was<00:01:34.430> that<00:01:35.530> that

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
see exactly what it was that that

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.219 
see exactly what it was that that
occurred<00:01:37.340> with<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:38.209> wreck<00:01:38.450> we're<00:01:38.929> trying<00:01:39.080> to

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
occurred with that wreck we're trying to

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.730 
occurred with that wreck we're trying to
cue<00:01:39.410> it<00:01:39.500> up<00:01:39.590> here

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
cue it up here

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.830 
cue it up here
I'm<00:01:42.520> thinking<00:01:42.790> that<00:01:43.030> we<00:01:43.090> had<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.360> one<00:01:43.479> machine

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
I'm thinking that we had the one machine

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.139 
I'm thinking that we had the one machine
to<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:44.140> inside<00:01:44.590> call<00:01:44.979> it<00:01:45.189> kind<00:01:45.790> of<00:01:45.850> got<00:01:45.939> hooked

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
to the inside call it kind of got hooked

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.240 
to the inside call it kind of got hooked
on<00:01:46.329> the<00:01:46.450> inside<00:01:46.780> I'm<00:01:46.960> wondering<00:01:47.320> if<00:01:47.409> he<00:01:47.979> didn't

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
on the inside I'm wondering if he didn't

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.310 
on the inside I'm wondering if he didn't
slide<00:01:48.399> his<00:01:48.610> tail<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:48.850> out<00:01:49.210> and<00:01:49.450> in<00:01:49.869> of<00:01:50.170> course

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
slide his tail and out and in of course

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.060 
slide his tail and out and in of course
Gavin<00:01:51.250> binary<00:01:51.659> Gavin<00:01:52.659> minor<00:01:52.840> kind<00:01:53.140> of<00:01:53.229> got<00:01:53.350> the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
Gavin binary Gavin minor kind of got the

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.710 
Gavin binary Gavin minor kind of got the
brunt<00:01:54.310> end<00:01:54.610> of<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:54.939> will<00:01:55.090> take<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:55.270> look<00:01:55.509> at<00:01:55.689> it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
brunt end of that will take a look at it

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.080 
brunt end of that will take a look at it
here

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.240 

look<00:01:59.750> at<00:01:59.929> it<00:02:00.109> yeah<00:02:00.229> looks<00:02:00.500> like<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:00.829> one<00:02:00.979> sled

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
look at it yeah looks like that one sled

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.340 
look at it yeah looks like that one sled
just<00:02:01.490> lost<00:02:01.729> out<00:02:02.270> didn't<00:02:02.689> know<00:02:02.990> where<00:02:03.170> for
