00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.230
 hi to all and leechers and if naxos 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.760
 today we find ourselves not for 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.520
 a glitch video not for a 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.460
 gameplay but well and truly for a video 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.520
 contest and yes so a contest that 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.470
 I decided to do to thank already 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.610
 my subscribers from their presence of their 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.230
 two here to thank them for 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.350
 thank everyone wholesale and so 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.620
 also for opening a chain that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.220
 is going to be called buy cd key which this 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.870
 channel and that the youtube channel of the site 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.010
 bought that leave points like who 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.820
 is a site that sells games 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 dematerialized so cd keys that 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.000
 you can activate either on steam or 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.430
 origin or other platforms 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.650
 so this site sells games at very low 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.270
 price and so I'm sort of 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.129
 partners with them I take care of their 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.079

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.329

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:15.540

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:19.649
 given a key cd a crazy cd key 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.569

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.390

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.090
 to run such games it's 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.950
 not really a pc of gamer 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.780
