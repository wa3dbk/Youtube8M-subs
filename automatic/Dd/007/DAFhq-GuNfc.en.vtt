00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 good to all be with a new 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.220
 arc tutorial this time so you have 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.830
 good performance since it is a game 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.510
 which is quite poorly optimized and good 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.849
 the first thing we are going to do is the steam 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.620
 ok let's go to the game properties 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.970
 set launch options and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.600
 we put this vale 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.950
 this is the basic script sm 4 increases the 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.279
 game performance although it seems that 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.990
 it goes a little bit darker let's say something 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.939
 that nothing happens we can change the 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.560
 gamma is already here and this I think is 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.000
 so that it uses all the cores of 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.380
 our processor since I do not think 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.630
 it is well optimized for what use eight 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.340
 nuclei and I do not know if really with this it 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.690
 will solve it I have it since I think 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.829
 that the processor is not 8 but good 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.840
 there is this will give us at least 20 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.950
 fps in the lowest setting so 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.140
 it feels pretty good 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.390
 in fact this the following I think that 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.040
 It's a foolish thing but you go down this 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.860
 program suggests in the description speed 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.350
 fun since surely that is hot 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.880
 much the gpu with this game of 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.830
 heaters as you see is at 60 degrees 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.489
 also now I have many 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.170
 while playing and well surely the 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.080
 such fan speed comes to you 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.940
 that's more or less like that, it's going to go up 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.860
 the temperature a lot maybe you have 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.080
 a good refrigeration myself right now 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.280
 I have the computer very apart and apart 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.890
 and how it was done I have been playing a lot 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.509
 then it heats up a lot 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.460
 how you see has already risen to 62 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.290
 then the best you can do then 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.580
 although you wear a little more the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.009
 fan thing that I think you do not go 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.009
 to notice while playing at least 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.840
 100% cell is worth it because if not it is that you 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.680
 will reach a very high temperature and 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.000
 the problem that when there is a 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.950
 such high temperature loses a lot 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.110
 performance thing that maybe some notes 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.220
 they conceive a lot playing and I also think 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.930
 that it is preferable that the fan be 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.509
 he wore a little before he writes 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.759
 the graph does not so this program is worth 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.560
 highly recommended if you know another way 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.650
 of doing it like that but I think 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.140
 quite recommendable 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.260
 then the last thing we're going to do 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.910
 that is not from the game itself is here it's worth 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.490
 lowered also this program what put 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.100
 in the description of x history where 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.840
 we can limit the fps I have it to 30 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.910
 since to record a lot doing it with a 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.440
 30 would raise the quality of the game but 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.030
 put it where you like it I would put it 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.520
 30 because for example to me normally 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.920
 new 60 50 but as I give a drop to 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.420
 40 or 30 I noticed it a lot instead 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.670
 as free to 30 constantly new 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.850
 notes so if you do not go overly 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.180
 well you go here it's worth it's just open 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.930
 the program is lashed and the limits 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.640
 to 30 mark is the same as last already in 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.170
 the game itself I do not know why I was 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.920
 has put in a window thing that does not make me 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.920
 thank you 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.550
 OK, very good 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.760
 good the configuration that I would put 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.560
 personally this and these two to the minimum 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.210
 it's something that you're not going to notice anything I 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.340
 at least do not notice at all have these 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.290
 with this at the lowest 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.209
 then the rest I would leave everything in 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.040
 medium and shadows in low shadows 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.989
 is what you least will notice me so 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.700
 least I do not notice it almost I would leave them 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.410
 under obviously if you want the best 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.730
 performance was to put everything to the minimum 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.930
 but for example with this look how it 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.030
 go 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.590
 and it looks awful you do not have to have it 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.510
 A) Yes 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.280
 it should be much sharper but we lose 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.980
 many pesos I would put it more or less 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.480
 here is a point where we have a 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.510
 optimal performance but the game looks 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.640
 pretty good the viewing distance me 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.099
 I recommend that you continue on a server that 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.040
 in which there is medium or high pvp although 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.720
 lose performance if not then low on a 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.580
 pvp you will not notice it so much but in 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.590
 serious this leave it in the middle of here I 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.450
 it would leave everything turned off there is nothing 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.620
 really it shows a lot and if 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.750
 you want a little more quality 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.250
 Losing little performance the textures 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.989
 high but less the configuration 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.910
 I would leave it as I have it 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.690
 you can go down if you still have bad with 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.810
 everything in bass I would put 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.790
 this resolution is worth 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.760
 Notice what you notice and it will go quite 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.610
 better then as a point I would put 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.340
 this as you can see it looks a bit like the 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.810
 fucking ass when you have it too low 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.459
 change to have it very far know 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.640
 quite better and at the time of shooting 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.550
 well 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.530
 rather better this is the optional step 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.090
 worth this step you do not have to do it 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.190
 Unless you still go bad 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.319
 game and really if you still do badly 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.959
 I already recommend you to reimburse it but if 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.660
 even with those I preferred to play sacrificing 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.640
 the game itself I put a couple of 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.859
 files that you can download are worth the 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.500
 tennis are more and I find them here 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.930
 are these two files what you have to 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.740
 to do is replace those that you already have 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.350
 these two you have here the route you look at the 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.600
 video now and the copy and replaced these 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.150
 two you are going to gain a lot of performance 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.380
 but it's going to look very dark to us 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.840
 is going to give some bus with lighting 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.300
 the torches are not going to light the fire 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.160
 it's not going to light up, we're going to lose 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.440
 much of the game but if still 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.390
 you want to do it I do not recommend it 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.210
 in case you do it and leave 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.729
 Very dark 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.030
 you do this you give to calibrate 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.960
 color and raise the gamma to butt but ya 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.759
 I say I do not recommend it but good 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.770
 and well this is all I have to 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.080
 tell you so you can do better if I take out 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.310
 something else I will tell you and if you have 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.419
 some idea for a video or something that 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.919
 you need to put it on the 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.919
 comments thank you very much and subscribe
