let's<00:01:50.940> look<00:01:51.030> at<00:01:51.120> this<00:01:51.330> look<00:01:51.510> a<00:01:51.570> bar<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.050> first

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
let's look at this look a bar one first

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.850 
let's look at this look a bar one first
bass<00:01:53.100> drum<00:01:53.340> gets<00:01:53.460> played<00:01:53.730> on<00:01:53.880> 1e<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.470> downbeat

of<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:55.980> and<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.370> e<00:01:56.400> straight<00:01:56.970> afterwards<00:01:57.360> and

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
of one and the e straight afterwards and

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.910 
of one and the e straight afterwards and
then<00:01:57.840> we've<00:01:57.990> got<00:01:58.080> another<00:01:58.140> bass<00:01:58.440> drum<00:01:58.620> note<00:01:58.770> on

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
then we've got another bass drum note on

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800 
then we've got another bass drum note on
the<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.520> beat<00:01:59.820> one<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.210> before<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.510> San<00:02:00.690> John

back<00:02:00.990> beyond<00:02:01.290> two<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.800> then<00:02:02.600> rather

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
back beyond two and then rather

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.660 
back beyond two and then rather

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.120 
between it's sort of bleeding a little
bit<00:02:27.209> towards<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.690> next<00:02:28.050> six<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.590> next<00:02:28.920> eighth

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
bit towards the next six the next eighth

sense if listen to the song and try to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.030 
sense if listen to the song and try to
play<00:02:33.390> long<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.900> you'll<00:02:34.170> sort<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.500> naturally

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
play long to it you'll sort of naturally

pick<00:02:35.220> up<00:02:35.370> his<00:02:35.550> swing<00:02:35.730> but<00:02:36.420> yeah<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:37.410> worth

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
pick up his swing but yeah it's worth

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.400 
pick up his swing but yeah it's worth
understanding<00:02:38.760> at<00:02:39.270> least<00:02:39.320> that<00:02:40.320> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
understanding at least that the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.449 
understanding at least that the
difference<00:02:40.680> between<00:02:40.770> straight<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.250> swung<00:02:41.430> it

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
difference between straight and swung it

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.590 
difference between straight and swung it
and<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.790> should<00:02:41.970> learn<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.209> eventually

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
and you should learn that eventually

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.340 
and you should learn that eventually
anyway<00:02:42.959> just<00:02:43.290> from<00:02:43.470> playing<00:02:43.830> lots<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.280> music

so<00:02:46.350> based<00:02:46.590> on<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.860> earth<00:02:47.010> beat<00:02:47.340> -<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.760> then<00:02:47.880> we

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
so based on the earth beat - and then we

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.490 
so based on the earth beat - and then we
got<00:02:48.060> two<00:02:48.300> more<00:02:48.450> bass<00:02:48.660> drum<00:02:48.840> notes<00:02:49.019> on<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.290> and

slowly<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.010> bar<00:02:56.340> sounds<00:02:56.700> like<00:02:56.880> this<00:02:58.550> two<00:02:59.550> and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
slowly that bar sounds like this two and
