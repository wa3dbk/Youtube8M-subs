00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
the experiences when you come to like a

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.569 
the experiences when you come to like a
little<00:00:43.780> gesture<00:00:44.050> room<00:00:44.260> like<00:00:44.409> this<00:00:44.440> there's<00:00:45.399> I

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
que Esther's here and that's because it

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.209 
que Esther's here and that's because it
doesn't<00:00:52.329> have<00:00:52.359> as<00:00:52.659> high<00:00:52.899> of<00:00:53.229> a<00:00:53.530> spawn<00:00:53.799> rate<00:00:53.979> as

did some grinding in supply mode not

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.250
