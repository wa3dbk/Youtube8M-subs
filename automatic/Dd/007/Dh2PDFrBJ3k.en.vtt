00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
let's get rolling alright so the first

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.959 
let's get rolling alright so the first
step<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.269> take<00:00:12.540> any<00:00:13.380> gel<00:00:14.040> brow<00:00:14.309> color<00:00:14.580> you

step is to take any gel brow color you

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.810 
step is to take any gel brow color you
want<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.450> am<00:00:16.199> using<00:00:16.440> quite<00:00:16.890> natural<00:00:17.340> Paint<00:00:17.609> Pot

but if you have darker brows than me

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.250 
but if you have darker brows than me
obviously<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.730> could<00:00:20.880> use<00:00:21.029> dip<00:00:21.330> down<00:00:21.539> even<00:00:22.020> by

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
obviously you could use dip down even by

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.140 
obviously you could use dip down even by
Mac<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.769> fluid<00:00:23.100> line<00:00:23.250> or<00:00:23.490> whatever<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.939> have

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
in an angled brush and I'm just going to

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.640 
in an angled brush and I'm just going to
start<00:00:26.910> about<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.300> quarter<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.019> way<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.380> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
start about a quarter of the way in and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.520 
start about a quarter of the way in and
do<00:00:29.189> small<00:00:29.429> feathered<00:00:30.150> brush<00:00:30.449> strokes

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.010 

now<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.130> key<00:00:38.490> is<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.820> not<00:00:39.150> pick<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.780> lot<00:00:39.990> of

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
now the key is to not pick up a lot of

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.650 
now the key is to not pick up a lot of
product<00:00:40.670> because<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.880> made<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.330> mistake

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
product because I made that mistake

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.100 
product because I made that mistake
before<00:00:43.230> when<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> was<00:00:44.130> trying<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.670> learn<00:00:44.880> how<00:00:45.110> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
before when I was trying to learn how to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.940 
before when I was trying to learn how to
do<00:00:46.640> gel<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:48.630> my<00:00:48.750> brows<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.470> would<00:00:49.680> load<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
do gel for my brows and I would load the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.430 
do gel for my brows and I would load the
brush<00:00:50.370> up<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.790> that<00:00:51.360> didn't<00:00:51.780> help<00:00:51.930> at<00:00:52.110> all<00:00:52.230> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
brush up and that didn't help at all it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.189 
brush up and that didn't help at all it
just<00:00:52.470> looked<00:00:52.890> overly<00:00:53.610> fake<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.210> not<00:00:54.390> good<00:00:55.080> at

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
just looked overly fake and not good at

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.799 
just looked overly fake and not good at
all<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.879> now<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.270> kind<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.720> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
all and so now that we kind of have the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.229 
all and so now that we kind of have the
arch<00:00:58.080> going<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.400> gonna<00:00:59.670> move<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
arch going on I'm just gonna move on to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.860 
arch going on I'm just gonna move on to
the<00:01:00.420> other<00:01:00.629> brow<00:01:01.580> and<00:01:02.580> again<00:01:02.970> starting<00:01:03.629> about

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the other brow and again starting about

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:23.700 
the other brow and again starting about
a<00:01:03.900> quarter<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.500> way<00:01:04.830> in

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.890 

and<00:01:24.250> again<00:01:24.520> remember<00:01:24.940> that<00:01:24.970> eyebrows<00:01:25.660> are

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
and again remember that eyebrows are

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.830 
and again remember that eyebrows are
supposed<00:01:26.230> to<00:01:26.320> be<00:01:26.500> sisters<00:01:26.800> not<00:01:27.400> twins<00:01:27.660> so<00:01:28.660> it's

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
supposed to be sisters not twins so it's

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.860 
supposed to be sisters not twins so it's
okay<00:01:29.260> if<00:01:29.380> they<00:01:29.560> aren't<00:01:29.800> perfectly<00:01:30.580> even<00:01:33.870> the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
okay if they aren't perfectly even the

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.300 
okay if they aren't perfectly even the
next<00:01:35.410> step<00:01:35.760> is<00:01:36.760> taking<00:01:37.330> that<00:01:37.500> any<00:01:38.500> brow<00:01:38.860> pencil
