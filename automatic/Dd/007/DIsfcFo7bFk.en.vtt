 So I made a stop not inclined deletion must be imbued with the assumption that the pre-departure 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:37.069
 With all the shouting stopped when the incident woke up the educational situation positively 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:40.099
 This is the program I created 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:47.490

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:56.910
 When the situation is happening, the neighboring friend guild becomes the stomach and the reminder. 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.710
 Dia consultation will dry up the agenda 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.710

 I'll go out for the first time. It's kind of awkward and difficult. Stop when your friends are sleeping . 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.650
 Now that we have to continue to naturally momentarily stop 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:29.070

 In the meantime, the children talk about the slick to reflect on themselves . 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.690

 If such victims do when I need to resolve this situation beoleojyeoteul 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.810
 It is a good example to be able to raise the ability to grow. 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.870
 I think. 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.940
 If the assailant is in the same situation, I do not think he knows the victim's mind. 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.630
 So, the victim's position is very pleasant to learn from the demonstration 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.890
 Board of Directors 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:09.270

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:35.730
