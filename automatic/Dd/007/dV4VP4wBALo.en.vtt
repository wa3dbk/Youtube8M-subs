00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
take four emeralds on the size like not

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.890 
take four emeralds on the size like not
the<00:02:36.349> corners<00:02:36.829> just<00:02:37.220> decide<00:02:37.609> for<00:02:37.909> the<00:02:38.209> zombies

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
the corners just decide for the zombies

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.470 
the corners just decide for the zombies
you<00:02:39.109> wanna<00:02:39.290> take<00:02:39.530> eight<00:02:39.859> a<00:02:40.159> rotten<00:02:40.730> flesh<00:02:41.120> and

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
you wanna take eight a rotten flesh and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.960 
you wanna take eight a rotten flesh and
last<00:02:42.109> but<00:02:42.379> not<00:02:42.620> least<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.459> recipe<00:02:43.909> is

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
last but not least the recipe is

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.449 
last but not least the recipe is
actually<00:02:44.180> not<00:02:44.659> given<00:02:45.079> in<00:02:45.349> the<00:02:45.560> past<00:02:45.859> in<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
actually not given in the past in the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.360 
actually not given in the past in the
main<00:02:46.609> path<00:02:46.879> but<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.139> blaze<00:02:48.409> DNA<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.340> I

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
main path but it's the blaze DNA so I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.099 
main path but it's the blaze DNA so I
guess<00:02:49.639> that's<00:02:49.909> gonna<00:02:50.030> be<00:02:50.269> a<00:02:50.299> mystery<00:02:50.989> for

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
guess that's gonna be a mystery for

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.860 
guess that's gonna be a mystery for
today<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:52.400> if<00:02:52.579> you're<00:02:52.730> wondering<00:02:53.180> well<00:02:53.359> I<00:02:53.599> got

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
today so if you're wondering well I got

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.289 
today so if you're wondering well I got
the<00:02:54.109> DNA<00:02:54.349> what<00:02:55.069> do<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.280> do<00:02:55.340> with<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:55.609> next<00:02:55.849> well

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
the DNA what do I do with it next well

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.429 
the DNA what do I do with it next well
here<00:02:56.599> you<00:02:56.810> go

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
here you go

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.770 
here you go
you<00:02:57.709> want<00:02:57.889> to<00:02:57.950> take<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.280> DNA<00:02:58.609> and<00:02:59.030> place<00:02:59.510> it

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
you want to take the DNA and place it

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.960 
you want to take the DNA and place it
next<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.170> an<00:03:00.319> egg<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.829> normal<00:03:01.430> egg<00:03:01.579> touch<00:03:01.819> a

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
next to an egg a normal egg touch a

next to an egg a normal egg touch a
chicken<00:03:02.480> alais<00:03:02.870> for<00:03:03.200> example<00:03:03.650> here<00:03:03.829> I<00:03:03.859> took

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
chicken alais for example here I took

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.369 
chicken alais for example here I took
the<00:03:04.250> UH<00:03:04.370> sort<00:03:04.639> of<00:03:04.730> DNA<00:03:04.909> place<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.689> and<00:03:05.840> next<00:03:06.290> to

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
the UH sort of DNA place it and next to

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.289 
the UH sort of DNA place it and next to
the<00:03:06.470> egg<00:03:06.590> on<00:03:06.889> the<00:03:06.920> crafting<00:03:07.519> table<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:08.000> you

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
the egg on the crafting table and you

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.479 
the egg on the crafting table and you
will<00:03:08.480> get<00:03:08.689> the<00:03:08.989> spawn<00:03:09.349> house<00:03:09.560> or<00:03:09.769> or<00:03:09.889> or<00:03:10.099> spawn

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
will get the spawn house or or or spawn

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.210 
will get the spawn house or or or spawn
whatever<00:03:10.849> DNA<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.359> use<00:03:11.599> so<00:03:12.260> pretty<00:03:12.769> useful

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
whatever DNA you use so pretty useful

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.970 
whatever DNA you use so pretty useful
mod<00:03:13.459> in<00:03:13.609> my<00:03:13.730> opinion<00:03:14.299> I<00:03:15.079> mean<00:03:15.470> there's<00:03:15.829> always

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
mod in my opinion I mean there's always

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.550 
mod in my opinion I mean there's always
improvement<00:03:16.819> for<00:03:17.030> that<00:03:17.329> for<00:03:17.540> example<00:03:17.810> there

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
improvement for that for example there

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.050 
improvement for that for example there
could<00:03:18.739> be<00:03:18.799> like<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.310> would<00:03:19.489> be<00:03:19.519> cool<00:03:19.790> if<00:03:19.849> there

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
could be like it would be cool if there

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.759 
could be like it would be cool if there
would<00:03:20.180> be<00:03:20.209> an<00:03:20.449> under<00:03:20.870> drag<00:03:21.169> it<00:03:21.379> would<00:03:21.500> be<00:03:21.620> cool

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
would be an under drag it would be cool

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.129 
would be an under drag it would be cool
there<00:03:22.010> would<00:03:22.129> be<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.310> blaze<00:03:22.819> recipe<00:03:23.599> but<00:03:23.930> it

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
there would be a blaze recipe but it

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.909 
there would be a blaze recipe but it
could<00:03:24.319> be<00:03:24.470> reused<00:03:24.799> in<00:03:25.010> my<00:03:25.190> opinion<00:03:26.230> ssp<00:03:27.230> it's

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
could be reused in my opinion ssp it's

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.470 
could be reused in my opinion ssp it's
really<00:03:28.220> useful<00:03:28.609> I<00:03:28.669> guess<00:03:28.849> if<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.090> just<00:03:29.180> want

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
really useful I guess if you just want

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.409 
really useful I guess if you just want
to<00:03:29.569> make<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.720> farm<00:03:30.109> or<00:03:30.349> something<00:03:30.709> in<00:03:30.919> your

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
to make a farm or something in your

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.879 
to make a farm or something in your
survival<00:03:32.419> let's<00:03:32.750> play<00:03:32.840> or<00:03:33.349> whatever

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
survival let's play or whatever

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.490 
survival let's play or whatever
so<00:03:34.250> anyways<00:03:34.669> I'd<00:03:35.000> rate<00:03:35.269> this<00:03:35.299> man<00:03:35.690> I'd<00:03:36.019> give<00:03:36.379> it

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
so anyways I'd rate this man I'd give it

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.879 
so anyways I'd rate this man I'd give it
a<00:03:36.590> seven<00:03:36.620> point<00:03:37.609> a<00:03:37.879> 5<00:03:38.389> out<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.720> 10<00:03:38.900> because<00:03:39.319> it
