00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.620
 Hey guys 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.870
 staff training here again we have 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.910
 the nutritional week and I'll show you 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.280
 how to make delicious egg white pancakes 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.350
 It can be done relatively quickly 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.140
 Tastes delicious and what you need 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.810
 is protein powder milk eggs need 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.430
 cinnamon and a bit of apple sauce 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.720
 I now have the finished april to go 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.000
 because I just do not care 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.250
 to prepare it fresh each time 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.079
 if you want fresh, you take a five 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.020
 pounding apples and then you have too 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.000
 I had to have delicious apple now 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.829
 It must be tasty here 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.780
 but also recognizes other companies 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.640
 and I will not do much now 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.329
 prepare when small slices 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.670
 to cut 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.739
 but you can also crush that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.000
 they are still strong and as human 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.120
 develop and taste the way I feel 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.289
 well I think I know wanted a 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.190
 little gift from my brother 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.230
 thanks again to you is very delicious 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.840
 with cookies and cream it means no 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.999
 Advertising is a casein powder 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.649
 but you can also take other things like that 

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.789
 I will prepare everything now 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.179
 and then it goes on 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:16.020
 it continues I 've prepared - 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:18.840
 and ground or cut the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.849
 paralysis are very fine shows that one 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.950
 it really works out very well 

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:24.479
 simply cut with a knife 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.799
 as I said, the pieces are still to play 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:32.240
 otherwise stay a bit more protein 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.189
 I have now cleaned in powder and 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.659
 that's 250 I'm really doing now 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.689
 good portions 250g protein powder then 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.989
 are this 50 grams must come 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:51.899
 We'll do that in the end 

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:53.789
 We take three eggs afterwards 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.309
 somehow here the always trend with the 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.639
 eggs first yellow and once clear and 

00:01:56.309 --> 00:02:00.450
 What I mean by the way is more protein 

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:03.190
 held 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.830
 That's why we should the environment 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.130
 I think that's a waste 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.940
 then we do not have the milk that much 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.560
 but you definitely need it 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.430
 abundant in liquid I am doing now 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.020
 first so pipapo 250 milliliters in 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:27.260
 yes, I'm none of that any right 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.760
 here so people it goes on I have that 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.000
 we have already prepared here 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.640
 such a sticky mass slightly liquid yes 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.870
 that was about 500 milliliters 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.600
 means the double at the ai weiwei has 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.760
 me 250 grams about 500 milliliters 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.140
 As I said, we have to do the scanning 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.720
 First, not so much else else 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.840
 you too liquid and then you have to 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.209
 even more protein powder but less 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.560
 beginning 3 1 we had time to dance 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.600
 often forgotten now I do here as a 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.670
 small spoon of wine and then we have 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.950
 I have this beautiful mass of nuts 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:11.330
 already done and that 's the point 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.560
 further I have is already angeschmissen 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.030
 now at the highest level i will 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.010
 Turn right down with me is that the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.230
 six with you maybe only the 3 me 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.959
 I'm going down to the four now 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.049
 so that later on, not only from the outside 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:29.860
 burns a bit bit 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.860
 said something margarine 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.290
 beautiful defend them nothing 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.880
 sticking on I have one now 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.020
 relative large pan that is it 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:50.080
 Will not be too many cakes then 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.810
 we have matured here with small trowel 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:59.540
 and best in the middle 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:01.690
 the club the project i leave you 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.690
 beautiful 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.480
 we fry the maxim and then 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.480
 it continues 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.310
 pancakes the first capgemini some 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.650
 it works now when I'm doing a video 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.640
 it's worked out 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:24.260
 left to long but it works now 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.880
 I'll get you started first 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.800
 pancake I keep going 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.630
 make the rest of the time 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.850
 look how much different and then 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.280
 I turn to such people again 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.920
 I 'm done I have six good ones 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.690
 pancakes and went relatively 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.360
 all in all about twenty 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.350
 minutes 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:48.100
 we summarized 250 again 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.220
 grams of protein powder 500 milliliters of milk 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.330
 then 50 grams paralysis three eggs and one 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.060
 little to the animal does not need that 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.850
 funny that would again somewhere in the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.960
 description or something to add 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:05.530
 of course, try as you see 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.590
 have also become relatively large 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.150
 Above all, this must be perfect 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.200
 still pieces are so i love you 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.480
 then have a little something to 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.830
 just nibble genius as you said 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.840
 You can also paint the list though 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.410
 then somehow it goes in the taste and 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.300
 if almost more 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.449
 That's it, you can you 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.800
 again - open the bad 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.749
 So no more sugar or so again 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.349
 To make it extremely tastes really 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:36.400
 sweet enough now just tell me how 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.189
 you liked that I'm interested 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.089
 that really is out of writing in now 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.279
 the comments 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.569
 and that's it if you were 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:46.120
 again ask to have any 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.379
 training things nutrition matters or 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.960
 to write some supplements 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.330
 just as always in the comments 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.979
