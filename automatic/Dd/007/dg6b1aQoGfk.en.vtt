00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.490 

make<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:51.020> on<00:01:51.110> this<00:01:51.259> tier<00:01:53.110> long<00:01:54.110> as<00:01:54.259> you<00:01:54.350> might

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
make it on this tier long as you might

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.530 
make it on this tier long as you might
have<00:01:54.590> noticed<00:01:54.979> earlier<00:01:55.700> I've<00:01:55.939> removed<00:01:56.329> the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
have noticed earlier I've removed the

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.810 
have noticed earlier I've removed the
rock<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.710> cork<00:01:57.920> bark<00:01:58.189> from<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.549> front

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
rock the cork bark from the front

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.889 
rock the cork bark from the front
because<00:01:59.000> I've<00:01:59.360> decided<00:01:59.920> it's<00:02:00.920> not<00:02:01.100> big<00:02:01.280> enough

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
because I've decided it's not big enough

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.920 
because I've decided it's not big enough
so<00:02:02.899> basically<00:02:03.350> on<00:02:03.799> this<00:02:04.070> side<00:02:04.369> on<00:02:04.930> the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
so basically on this side on the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.560 
so basically on this side on the
right-hand<00:02:06.229> side<00:02:06.759> of<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.880> fortress<00:02:08.390> of

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
pretty much to the rest of the forest to

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.420 
pretty much to the rest of the forest to
make<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.380> look<00:02:30.560> like<00:02:30.709> it<00:02:30.889> should<00:02:30.919> actually<00:02:31.220> be

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
make it look like it should actually be

make it look like it should actually be
there<00:02:32.290> there's<00:02:33.290> going<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.500> base<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.680> like<00:02:33.919> a

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:33.949 
there there's going to base it like a

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:38.879 
there there's going to base it like a
channel<00:02:35.470> down<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.650> center<00:02:37.040> there<00:02:37.220> into<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
channel down the center there into the

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.120 
channel down the center there into the
doors

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
doors

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.020 
doors

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
about the shaky camera and this side and

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.099 
about the shaky camera and this side and
it's<00:02:47.690> gonna<00:02:47.810> be<00:02:47.989> pretty<00:02:48.230> similar<00:02:48.560> similar<00:02:49.220> and

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
it's gonna be pretty similar similar and

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.470

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
along here but be honest I'm not sure

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.020 
along here but be honest I'm not sure
how<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.780> incorporate<00:02:54.169> it<00:02:54.889> into<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:55.400> side<00:02:55.699> yet

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
how to incorporate it into this side yet

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.490 
how to incorporate it into this side yet
because<00:02:56.359> of<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.980> small<00:02:57.980> tower<00:02:58.280> there<00:02:59.500> which

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
because of the small tower there which

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.680 
because of the small tower there which
does<00:03:01.040> not<00:03:01.250> want<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.579> come<00:03:01.760> off<00:03:01.910> because<00:03:02.299> it's

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
does not want to come off because it's

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.680 
does not want to come off because it's
boxing<00:03:03.230> on<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:04.430> I<00:03:04.459> really<00:03:05.060> do<00:03:05.209> need<00:03:05.389> to<00:03:05.449> leave

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
boxing on so I really do need to leave

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.060 
boxing on so I really do need to leave
it<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:05.989> so<00:03:06.199> I<00:03:06.260> gotta<00:03:06.440> figure<00:03:06.620> out<00:03:06.739> what<00:03:06.980> I'm

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
it on so I gotta figure out what I'm

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.610 
it on so I gotta figure out what I'm
gonna<00:03:07.160> do<00:03:07.400> about<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:07.880> side<00:03:08.180> yet<00:03:08.470> I'm<00:03:09.470> not

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
gonna do about this side yet I'm not

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.140 
gonna do about this side yet I'm not
sure<00:03:10.299> what<00:03:11.299> we'll<00:03:11.480> see

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
sure what we'll see

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.229 
sure what we'll see
so<00:03:14.150> yeah<00:03:14.739> it's<00:03:15.739> hard<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.250> imagine<00:03:16.730> what<00:03:17.030> this

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
so yeah it's hard to imagine what this

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.890 
so yeah it's hard to imagine what this
thing's<00:03:17.449> gonna<00:03:17.600> look<00:03:17.720> like<00:03:18.790> any<00:03:19.790> years<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.329> mean

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
thing's gonna look like any years I mean

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.560 
thing's gonna look like any years I mean
having<00:03:21.139> that<00:03:21.290> over<00:03:21.530> level<00:03:21.919> there<00:03:22.359> in<00:03:23.359> the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
having that over level there in the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.909 
having that over level there in the
center<00:03:23.930> of<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.079> screen<00:03:24.260> now

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
center of the screen now

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.140 
center of the screen now
I<00:03:24.949> could<00:03:25.790> always<00:03:25.940> mount<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.959> defence<00:03:27.290> laser

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
I could always mount the defence laser

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.590 
I could always mount the defence laser
on<00:03:29.150> they<00:03:29.620> free<00:03:30.620> up<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.829> bit<00:03:30.979> of<00:03:31.070> room<00:03:31.250> here<00:03:31.600> then

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
on they free up a bit of room here then

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.180 
on they free up a bit of room here then
of<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.780> building<00:03:33.199> but<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.680> be<00:03:33.919> honest

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
of the building but to be honest

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.430 
of the building but to be honest
unlocking<00:03:34.699> the<00:03:34.760> idea<00:03:35.120> I've<00:03:35.209> got<00:03:35.419> a<00:03:35.449> large<00:03:35.959> open

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
unlocking the idea I've got a large open

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.219 
unlocking the idea I've got a large open
space<00:03:36.709> there<00:03:37.010> but<00:03:37.220> also<00:03:37.400> with<00:03:37.970> some<00:03:38.229> other

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:39.229 
space there but also with some other

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.710 
space there but also with some other
towers<00:03:39.739> or<00:03:39.889> battlements<00:03:40.519> alchemy<00:03:41.150> doing<00:03:41.570> all

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
towers or battlements alchemy doing all

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.140 
towers or battlements alchemy doing all
the<00:03:41.840> way<00:03:41.959> around<00:03:42.199> the<00:03:42.380> edge<00:03:42.729> the<00:03:43.729> whole<00:03:43.850> point

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
the way around the edge the whole point

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.240 
the way around the edge the whole point
of<00:03:44.269> it<00:03:44.389> really<00:03:44.570> was<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:44.930> get<00:03:45.079> more<00:03:45.290> surface

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
of it really was to get more surface

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.580 
of it really was to get more surface
area<00:03:46.430> for<00:03:46.790> mobiles

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
area for mobiles

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.610 
area for mobiles
so<00:03:48.590> it's<00:03:48.859> a<00:03:48.979> very<00:03:49.100> playable<00:03:49.540> fortress<00:03:50.620> was

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
so it's a very playable fortress was

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.439 
so it's a very playable fortress was
getting<00:03:51.889> a<00:03:51.949> little<00:03:52.160> bit<00:03:52.280> cramped<00:03:52.760> up<00:03:52.940> this<00:03:53.239> top

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
getting a little bit cramped up this top

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.000 
getting a little bit cramped up this top
