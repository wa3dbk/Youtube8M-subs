here<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.750> I'm<00:02:41.990> finding<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.890> few<00:02:43.040> things<00:02:43.310> but<00:02:43.490> I

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
here and I'm finding a few things but I

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.060 
here and I'm finding a few things but I
came<00:02:44.210> upon<00:02:44.360> what<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.170> like<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.410> call<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.620> junky

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
came upon what I like to call a junky

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.270 
came upon what I like to call a junky
circle<00:02:46.570> you<00:02:47.570> notice<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.110> tree<00:02:48.500> has<00:02:48.740> all<00:02:48.920> the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
circle you notice this tree has all the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.090 
circle you notice this tree has all the
leaves<00:02:49.460> pulled<00:02:50.150> away<00:02:50.740> Leafs<00:02:51.740> on<00:02:51.890> three

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
leaves pulled away Leafs on three

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.950 
leaves pulled away Leafs on three
quarters<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.670> sides<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.540> it's

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
quarters of the sides and it's

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.650 
quarters of the sides and it's
believable<00:02:54.380> by<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.310> Iroquois<00:02:56.240> that<00:02:56.510> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
believable by the Iroquois that the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.960 
believable by the Iroquois that the
jeonggi's<00:02:57.050> are<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.500> caretakers<00:02:58.160> forests

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
jeonggi's are the caretakers forests

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.230 
jeonggi's are the caretakers forests
streams<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.650> on<00:03:00.880> when<00:03:01.880> they<00:03:01.970> get<00:03:02.120> together

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
streams and so on when they get together

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.790 
streams and so on when they get together
at<00:03:02.510> night<00:03:02.660> they<00:03:02.780> dance<00:03:03.050> around<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.470> tree<00:03:03.620> like

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
at night they dance around a tree like

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.590 
at night they dance around a tree like
this<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.220> wears<00:03:04.400> off<00:03:04.640> believes<00:03:05.300> away<00:03:05.540> so

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
this and it wears off believes away so

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.510 
this and it wears off believes away so
here's<00:03:05.900> here's<00:03:06.590> evidence<00:03:06.830> on<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.220> jeonggi

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
here's here's evidence on the jeonggi

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.710 
here's here's evidence on the jeonggi
circle<00:03:07.910> right<00:03:08.030> here<00:03:09.460> see<00:03:10.460> and<00:03:10.940> third<00:03:11.510> off

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
circle right here see and third off

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.180 
circle right here see and third off
right

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
right

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.850 
right
around<00:03:13.730> there

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
around there

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.420 
around there
so<00:03:15.400> I'll<00:03:15.550> call<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.030> junky<00:03:16.360> tree<00:03:17.430> pretty

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
so I'll call that a junky tree pretty

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.710 
so I'll call that a junky tree pretty
neat<00:03:18.580> when<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.760> find<00:03:19.030> things<00:03:19.210> like<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:19.570> in

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
neat when you find things like this in

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.830 
neat when you find things like this in
the<00:03:19.780> forest

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.390 

well<00:03:23.410> looks<00:03:23.620> like<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:23.800> got<00:03:23.950> something<00:03:24.190> else

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
well looks like I got something else

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.309 
well looks like I got something else
here<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.090> don't<00:03:25.270> know<00:03:25.510> if<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:25.870> gonna

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
here and I don't know if this is gonna

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.290 
here and I don't know if this is gonna
be<00:03:26.500> all<00:03:26.680> there<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.220> like<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.790> when<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:27.940> see<00:03:28.180> them

a table probably in the ground there

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.460 
a table probably in the ground there
I'll<00:03:48.160> put<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.520> back<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:52.200> that's<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.290> way<00:03:53.410> it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
goes and find them all hole but it is

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.590 
goes and find them all hole but it is
exciting<00:03:57.730> when<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:57.910> see<00:03:57.940> them<00:03:58.180> lay<00:03:58.300> in<00:03:58.420> there

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
the bottles I found in the hike this

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.590 
the bottles I found in the hike this
morning<00:04:09.730> as<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:11.400> Iroquois<00:04:12.400> won<00:04:12.700> just<00:04:13.239> really

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
morning as the Iroquois won just really

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.449 
morning as the Iroquois won just really
like<00:04:13.810> these<00:04:14.019> and<00:04:14.800> I<00:04:14.890> don't<00:04:15.040> know<00:04:15.160> I'm<00:04:15.310> why

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
like these and I don't know I'm why

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.979 
like these and I don't know I'm why
you're<00:04:15.610> gonna<00:04:15.700> see<00:04:15.940> this<00:04:16.090> but<00:04:16.239> they're<00:04:16.450> it's<00:04:16.930> a

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
you're gonna see this but they're it's a

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.690 
you're gonna see this but they're it's a
nice<00:04:17.169> amber<00:04:17.560> glass<00:04:19.410> in<00:04:20.410> this<00:04:20.560> bottle<00:04:21.040> it's<00:04:21.519> so

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
nice amber glass in this bottle it's so

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.780 
nice amber glass in this bottle it's so
thick<00:04:22.090> it's<00:04:22.810> gotta<00:04:23.020> weigh<00:04:23.200> six<00:04:24.100> seven<00:04:24.580> times

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
thick it's gotta weigh six seven times

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.400 
thick it's gotta weigh six seven times
more<00:04:25.060> than<00:04:25.240> what<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.389> normal<00:04:25.479> beer<00:04:26.080> bottle

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
more than what a normal beer bottle

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.710 
more than what a normal beer bottle
would<00:04:26.530> weigh<00:04:26.710> just<00:04:27.040> as<00:04:27.910> this<00:04:28.090> coke<00:04:28.360> bottles

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
would weigh just as this coke bottles

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.469 
would weigh just as this coke bottles
get<00:04:28.930> really<00:04:29.770> thick<00:04:30.070> glass<00:04:30.310> in<00:04:30.520> it<00:04:30.669> too<00:04:30.850> so<00:04:31.090> you

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
get really thick glass in it too so you

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.880 
get really thick glass in it too so you
can<00:04:31.540> tell<00:04:31.720> they're<00:04:31.840> older<00:04:32.169> ones<00:04:32.380> because<00:04:32.710> they

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
can tell they're older ones because they

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.300 
can tell they're older ones because they
didn't<00:04:33.729> spare<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:33.970> glass<00:04:34.979> but<00:04:35.979> that<00:04:36.100> cleaned

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
didn't spare the glass but that cleaned

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.120 
didn't spare the glass but that cleaned
up<00:04:36.460> good<00:04:36.640> love<00:04:37.180> coke<00:04:37.390> bottles<00:04:37.860> then<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:38.919> felt<00:04:39.100> a

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
up good love coke bottles then I felt a

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.409 
up good love coke bottles then I felt a
little<00:04:39.250> patent<00:04:39.610> medicine<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.180> was<00:04:40.240> just

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
little patent medicine it was just

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.409 
little patent medicine it was just
laying<00:04:40.600> there<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.590> leaf<00:04:41.860> litter<00:04:42.039> as<00:04:42.550> a
