00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.279
 to everyone in this tutorial we're going to 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:08.129
 Learn to release a Nokia Lumia 800 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.540
 by code imei the code needed to 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.130
 free it we provide it in the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.170
 e-mail address free 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.210
 mobile arrays dotcom or else we 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.960
 you can contact by whatsapp or in 62 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.550
 62 27 35 2 while we have the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.989
 release code the process that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.619
 we have to do to free the mobile 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:27.869
 is first to put a sim card 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.669
 another operator in this case we have a 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.979
 phone that is from the company orange 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.519
 so we're going to put a card for him 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:34.519
 vodafone operator 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.350
 we turn it on 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.320
 this method is totally safe not today 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.210
 valid the guarantee does not cause any 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.220
 failure and will not erase any data from 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.050
 phone 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.629
 is the official release of the manufacturer 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.770
 if you have phones blocked by the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.420
 operator for unpaid loss we do not 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.880
 we can help with that we do not 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.960
 write with her 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.820
 well the first of the would ask in case 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.130
 that he had the sim card would be his 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.930
 pin code in this case we have put a 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.530
 card that took us to the pin code 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.679
 then directly what he asks us is 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.740
 the network blocking pin for not coming out 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.119
 very well focus it is not to be confused with 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.979
 pin card if 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.899
 put a card that does have code 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.270
 pin first you will have to write the pin 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.220
 the card and then he will ask us this what 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.710
 that comes out now is the network pin that 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.030
 they leave us the attempts to put it well 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.099
 Nothing, we will simply have to 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.099
 write the release code here 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.440
 logically this code that I'm 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.750
 putting alone serves to release this 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.230
 phone that each phone carries a 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.230
 different code 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.580
 click on accept 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.420
 and it is already accepted recognizes us the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.180
 SIM card 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.039
 and already the phone would be prepared 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.039
 to be used with any operator
