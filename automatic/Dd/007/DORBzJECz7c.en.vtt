although<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.900> was<00:02:34.170> much<00:02:34.590> bulkier<00:02:35.220> like<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.850> said

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
although it was much bulkier like I said

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.140 
although it was much bulkier like I said
it's<00:02:36.300> believed<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.260> one<00:02:37.620> was<00:02:37.800> 8.4<00:02:38.640> ounces

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.060 
it's believed that one was 8.4 ounces
and<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.630> one<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:39.959> four<00:02:40.200> point<00:02:40.380> eight<00:02:40.620> ounces

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
and this one is four point eight ounces

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.820 
and this one is four point eight ounces
