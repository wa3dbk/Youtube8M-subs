 this video has been reached 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.469
 surely you worry that they are 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.809
 doing your cats while you are not 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.449
 at home well because you 've gone an end to 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.070
 week and has left them alone or because 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.109
 You're on vacation and a family's 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.539
 is taking care but only during a 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.880
 and you want to see how it happens in the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.619
 rest of the time it can also be that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.199
 have a new cat and you want to know 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.789
 how is it adapting to the house or if it 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.529
 It's okay for cats that already 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.440
 you had before 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.170
 I use this camera is called link 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.000
 and it's a camera via wifi I suppose 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.200
 there will be more models in the market but 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 This is quality and in easy grasses 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.010
 put here but configuration vale 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.990
 then we will install them very 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.840
 I'll facilitate and I'll show you how it's done 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:58.150
 the camera 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.150
 and as you can see is a tiny design 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.559
 and you can orientate with enough 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.559
 ease for one area or another 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.250
 and you also carry 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.480
 the cable that will make the camera 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.360
 receive electricity a network cable a 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.700
 configuration cable that is going to 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.010
 use only the first time because the 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.600
 camera has a small wifi 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.520
 screws if we want to screw the 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.740
 that I do not have it screwed 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.550
 I have like that because the base is 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.550
 pretty firm 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.670
 and finally the instructions and the cd 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.259
 of installation is a very easy CD of 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.939
 use of these that have a 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.220
 simple configuration that you give to 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.979
 next next next and in 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.180
 little time that we have installed a 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.520
 Once we have followed all the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.979
 CD instructions we have to choose 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.070
 the place where we are going to put it I have 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.380
 placed in an upper corner of the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.810
 smell of the room that is the room 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.820
 where cats spend more time from 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.360
 this angle you see a lot of the 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.209
 room you see the fireplace you see the 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.310
 outside window you can not see the sofas that 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.560
 is where there are some getting on the bed of the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.350
 dog and here we have everything quite 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.280
 controlled even if they come to someone to 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.800
 Steal 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.860
 as you can see me the melody of the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.590
 page of my the link that is the model 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.300
 of camera that I am using and 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.459
 we are seeing what happens in my room 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.709
 live in the camera that we just 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.989
 put here we see the dog that is where 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.750
 I mainly oriented this camera 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.210
 and here we see one of my cats 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.150
 we can configure several options like 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.560
 for example, to notify the mobile phone when 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.320
 email if it detects a 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.140
 movement in a room and also 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.840
 We can install several cameras in one 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.930
 same dwelling or in different and 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.520
 put them in our user and see what 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.200
 is happening in every room in the 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.240
 moment that we want to know that 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.050
 what are you 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.700
 this particular model also has 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.620
 a mobile application 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.290
 which is very good in case we are going to travel 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.819
 and we're not going to take the laptop or if 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.620
 simply at any time that 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.220
 let's be on the street and have a connection 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.110
 to Internet 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.110
 we want to see what is happening 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.760
 and nothing
