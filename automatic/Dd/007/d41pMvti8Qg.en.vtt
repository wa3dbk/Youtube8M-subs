keep the last zombie I'm gonna keep the
avogadro<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:04.860> he's<00:01:05.040> gonna<00:01:05.129> go<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.489> turn<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
avogadro then he's gonna go and turn the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.580 
avogadro then he's gonna go and turn the
power<00:01:05.970> off<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.570> can't<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.869> parens<00:01:07.350> I

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
power off because we can't have parens I

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.770

believe we can't have power on to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
believe we can't have power on to
complete<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.920> that's<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.310> he's<00:01:11.460> doing

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
avogadro here he's gonna run over from

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060 
avogadro here he's gonna run over from
power<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> place<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.200> two<00:01:16.350> turbines<00:01:16.830> and

running<00:03:38.419> for<00:03:38.629> player<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.139> tried<00:03:39.349> to<00:03:39.379> do<00:03:39.590> the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
running for player and tried to do the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.979 
running for player and tried to do the
lamp<00:03:39.889> post<00:03:40.129> first<00:03:40.489> so<00:03:41.269> maybe<00:03:41.450> it's<00:03:41.660> not<00:03:41.750> even

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
lamp post first so maybe it's not even

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.720 
lamp post first so maybe it's not even
necessary<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.709> have<00:03:42.889> actually<00:03:43.519> power

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
necessary to have actually power

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.240 
necessary to have actually power
Theophilus<00:03:44.269> but<00:03:44.810> regardless<00:03:45.200> we<00:03:45.560> wanted<00:03:46.160> to

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
Theophilus but regardless we wanted to

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.020 
Theophilus but regardless we wanted to
go<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.879> lamp<00:03:47.060> post<00:03:47.359> and<00:03:47.650> fire<00:03:48.650> them<00:03:48.919> up<00:03:49.040> so

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
go to the lamp post and fire them up so

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.430 
go to the lamp post and fire them up so
we're<00:03:50.180> gonna<00:03:50.269> do<00:03:50.480> it<00:03:50.599> one<00:03:50.720> at<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:50.900> time<00:03:51.109> I'm

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
we're gonna do it one at a time I'm

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.949 
we're gonna do it one at a time I'm
gonna<00:03:51.530> do<00:03:51.769> mine<00:03:52.669> first<00:03:52.699> over<00:03:53.389> here<00:03:53.629> to<00:03:53.840> the

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
gonna do mine first over here to the

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.229 
gonna do mine first over here to the
right<00:03:54.139> from<00:03:54.949> where<00:03:55.340> we<00:03:55.489> were<00:03:55.639> at<00:03:55.669> the<00:03:55.790> pylon

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
right from where we were at the pylon

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:06.470 
right from where we were at the pylon
and<00:03:56.389> then<00:03:56.900> axel<00:03:57.290> is<00:03:57.349> gonna<00:03:57.500> do<00:03:57.650> his

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.699 

all<00:04:07.480> right<00:04:07.659> so<00:04:07.780> we<00:04:07.870> got<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.080> two<00:04:08.230> vertices<00:04:08.530> of

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
all right so we got the two vertices of

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.050 
all right so we got the two vertices of
the<00:04:08.920> scalene<00:04:09.310> we<00:04:09.430> got<00:04:09.549> to<00:04:09.640> complete<00:04:09.909> the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
the scalene we got to complete the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.789 
the scalene we got to complete the
tertiary<00:04:10.269> node<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:10.959> axles<00:04:11.379> gonna<00:04:11.560> put<00:04:11.769> down

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
tertiary node so axles gonna put down

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:20.009 
tertiary node so axles gonna put down
his<00:04:12.670> turbine<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:18.549> that's<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:19.209> good<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:19.810> I

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
his turbine and that's it good that I

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.140 
his turbine and that's it good that I
think<00:04:20.380> he<00:04:20.500> said<00:04:20.739> tri-coat<00:04:21.190> trek<00:04:21.639> all<00:04:21.820> semester

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
think he said tri-coat trek all semester

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.030 
think he said tri-coat trek all semester
whatever<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.870> hell<00:04:23.050> he<00:04:23.169> said<00:04:23.199> the<00:04:23.530> device<00:04:23.800> is

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
whatever the hell he said the device is

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.780 
whatever the hell he said the device is
now<00:04:24.190> complete

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
now complete

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.490 
now complete
but<00:04:25.030> that's<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:25.389> that's<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.690> end<00:04:25.930> that's<00:04:26.199> the

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
but that's it that's the end that's the

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.530 
but that's it that's the end that's the
end<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:26.949> it<00:04:27.100> just<00:04:27.310> means<00:04:27.550> that<00:04:28.330> we've

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
end and it just means that we've

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.379 
end and it just means that we've
completed<00:04:29.100> we've<00:04:30.100> completed<00:04:30.639> doctor<00:04:31.060> Maxis

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
completed we've completed doctor Maxis

audio from doctor Maxis that we haven't
heard<00:05:14.440> before<00:05:14.620> simply<00:05:15.460> because<00:05:15.849> we've<00:05:16.510> never

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
heard before simply because we've never

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.860 
heard before simply because we've never

the completing the tertiary node you can

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.520 
the completing the tertiary node you can
get<00:05:24.310> that<00:05:24.460> even<00:05:24.760> before<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.450> avogadro<00:05:26.169> stage

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
get that even before the avogadro stage

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.000 
get that even before the avogadro stage
if<00:05:26.830> you<00:05:27.160> put<00:05:27.580> a<00:05:27.970> turbine<00:05:28.660> down<00:05:29.020> by<00:05:29.620> one<00:05:29.830> of<00:05:29.950> the

if you put a turbine down by one of the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.640 
if you put a turbine down by one of the
lamp<00:05:30.250> posts<00:05:30.700> before<00:05:31.660> you<00:05:32.139> complete<00:05:32.530> the

lamp posts before you complete the
avogadro<00:05:33.250> part<00:05:33.599> then<00:05:34.599> you<00:05:35.410> can<00:05:35.590> actually<00:05:35.919> get

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
avogadro part then you can actually get

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.800 
avogadro part then you can actually get

said maybe it does carry on and I'm so
open-minded<00:05:47.590> about<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:48.280> possibility<00:05:48.970> that

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
open-minded about the possibility that

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.760 
open-minded about the possibility that

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770

further<00:05:51.070> and<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:52.090> we're<00:05:52.330> still<00:05:52.599> gonna<00:05:52.750> look

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960

for<00:05:53.169> things<00:05:53.349> but<00:05:53.650> I<00:05:53.889> think<00:05:54.310> I<00:05:54.490> think<00:05:55.030> this<00:05:55.150> may

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
for things but I think I think this may
