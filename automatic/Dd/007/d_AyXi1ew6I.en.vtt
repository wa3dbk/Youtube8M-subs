two<00:03:59.519> screws<00:03:59.790> loose<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.410> this<00:04:01.410> is<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.650> perfect

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
two screws loose and this is the perfect

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.120 
two screws loose and this is the perfect
example<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.730> that<00:04:02.810> they<00:04:03.810> just<00:04:03.989> all<00:04:04.139> did<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.709> on

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
example of that they just all did a on

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.970 
example of that they just all did a on
twice<00:04:05.930> they<00:04:06.930> didn't<00:04:07.200> need<00:04:07.319> to<00:04:07.410> do<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.680> second

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
twice they didn't need to do it a second

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.860 
twice they didn't need to do it a second
time<00:04:08.010> but<00:04:08.370> just<00:04:08.579> because<00:04:08.760> they<00:04:09.030> wanted<00:04:09.389> to<00:04:09.450> and

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
time but just because they wanted to and

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.550 
time but just because they wanted to and
then<00:04:10.799> now<00:04:11.609> we're<00:04:11.910> Culver<00:04:12.480> City<00:04:12.690> stairs<00:04:12.989> which

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
then now we're Culver City stairs which

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.470 
then now we're Culver City stairs which
is<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.769> sprint<00:04:14.280> climb<00:04:14.519> which<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:14.819> even<00:04:15.060> harder

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
is a sprint climb which is even harder

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.599 
is a sprint climb which is even harder
than<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.660> odd<00:04:15.870> hurts<00:04:16.139> even<00:04:16.289> more<00:04:16.519> even<00:04:17.519> though

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
than a odd hurts even more even though

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.039 
than a odd hurts even more even though
it<00:04:17.700> shorter<00:04:18.090> but<00:04:18.180> yous<00:04:18.329> going<00:04:18.599> all<00:04:18.720> out<00:04:18.750> the

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
it shorter but yous going all out the

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.370 
it shorter but yous going all out the
whole<00:04:19.200> time<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:20.570> now<00:04:21.570> they<00:04:21.750> went<00:04:21.959> back<00:04:22.109> down

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.450 
which is hard too because it's so steep
and<00:04:24.780> because<00:04:25.229> they<00:04:25.320> want<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.560> do<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:26.039> again
