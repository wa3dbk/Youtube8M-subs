00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
acting and nobody's body mechanics works

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.710 
acting and nobody's body mechanics works
and<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.770> really<00:01:23.450> understand<00:01:24.450> many

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
many things to to be good in animation

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.800 
many things to to be good in animation
so<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:29.340> focus<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.850> designing<00:01:30.180> animation

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
so just not focus on designing animation

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.060 
so just not focus on designing animation
because<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.170> think<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.470> enough<00:01:31.710> no<00:01:31.829> no<00:01:31.950> no

good understanding in perspective help

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.120 
good understanding in perspective help
you<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.180> frame<00:01:43.049> better<00:01:43.380> because<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> know<00:01:44.009> how

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
you to frame better because you know how

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.719 
you to frame better because you know how
its<00:01:44.280> works<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:46.380> bit<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.890> compositing<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
its works and a bit of compositing to

can help because you know how the
layering<00:01:50.939> process<00:01:51.390> will<00:01:52.049> work<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.860> so

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
layering process will work and and so

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.800 
layering process will work and and so
when<00:01:53.310> somebody<00:01:53.640> comes<00:01:53.700> through<00:01:54.119> there<00:01:54.600> is

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
different job that is around animation

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.810 
different job that is around animation
to<00:02:05.210> become<00:02:06.210> better<00:02:06.390> animator
