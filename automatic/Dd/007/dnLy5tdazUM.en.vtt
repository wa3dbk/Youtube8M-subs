 emulators for those who don't know what they are 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.480

 installation nothing at the link there 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.770
 let's put it in the description of this 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.230
 video once the file is downloaded 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.910

 link to a site where I am 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.890
 present many Roma for cpa then 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.320
 download into a house and put it in one 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.080
 your sd card folder or 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.700
 internal phone memory 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.799
 once done this then we open 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.749
 the application is we will find ourselves in front 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.899
 this screen here with all the various 

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:11.969
 folders let's click on the folder 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.280
 where are our games and 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:19.369
 here is that they will appear will suffice 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:23.009
 then click the game to start it 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.229
 then it is then we respect a second 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.670
 here is how it is presented 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.520
 screen of our mason and the keys 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.490
 lrl directional projects key a and b 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.439
 start and select elementary really runs 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.539
 very well both on high phones 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.740
 band but also on those of low 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.030
 band 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.630
 let's go see no po 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.659
 this is an author's settings 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.219
 here they are then the first thing you do 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.350
 advice to do is go to the section 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:57.689
 advanced is on cartwright set type 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.680
 put the fsi 128k setting this 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.020
 because if you put what it is 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.270
 by default sera leaves test either 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.370
 automatic some Roma may not 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.229
 starting while putting flash 128 i 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.000
 everyone will leave the truck safely 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.940
 games 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.680
 if we go to uniek we can activate or 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.930
 disable various settings between 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.189
 which also 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.409
 the emulation of tricks but also the car 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.180
 you are beautiful then when you come out of the 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.519
 game the phone will save 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.250
 automatically the game and when 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.500
 you will reopen that game the game 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.159
 will start from the point where you had it 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.260
 left and fast food speed after I will make you 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.609
 see a little what it is and then which 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.540
 various positions that you anyway 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:44.420
 you can go and see then how 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.780
 I was saying this emulator first 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.040
 has and the edulator of tricks ed 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.500
 and password 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.019
 this we say this function serves to 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.909
 speed up game emulation ed 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.120
 here is indeed that the game goes a lot 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:03.810
 faster than the normal engine features 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.060
 of the function of safe and fast love 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.159
 so you can save the game well 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.489
 ten slots naturally including this one 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:14.579
 here pique and load the game when 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.629
 also wants therefore or in this case me 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.480
 in fact I have the health of the car 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.859
 salvage or other slots and in a 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.970
 click and we find ourselves at the point that 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:25.690
 we had saved 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.680
 it's possible from the latest updates 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.380
 connect two devices that have 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.320
 of the same application so you tall yourself 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.180
 never then is of the same as the same 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.310
 play and play together as if 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:45.189
 how it must really be 2 that you 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.230
 clicking on the remote link and selecting 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.959
 the connection you want to apply 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.060
 so it can via wifi but you will have to be 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.500
 connected to the same wifi network while 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.799
 with bluetooth and just turn on 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.840
 bluetooth in a phone and then 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.760
 clicking on bluetooth server activated 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.829
 the bluetooth create myths would do which 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.659
 server while in the other the other coast 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.849
 friend will have to go click product 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.650
 client then the phone between the search 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.780
 of devices with bluetooth turned on 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.959
 click the one that interests you 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.730
 and your phone will appear 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.449
 friend then click on it and call yes 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.940
 will automatically connect to exit 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.860
 from the game just click on klose 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.460
 and here we are at the 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.919
 main screen then what to say about 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.660
 this emulator is really well done 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.180
 in continuous updating and they are 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.020
 always coming out new functions like 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.870
 now it's almost perfect it almost doesn't miss 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.810
 nothing could possibly improve 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.979
 let's say a little in design but it's there anyway 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.979
 still a long time 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.789
 Thank you for viewing by 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.979
 any doubt comment on sign up 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.760
 and put a nice like the next da
