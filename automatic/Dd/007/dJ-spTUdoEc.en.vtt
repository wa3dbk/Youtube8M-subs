00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.680
 Hello to you again Andrei sku butt and 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.750
 Today I will be half the engine off 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.860
 my honda 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:17.279
 here's how you see I already removed the plastic on 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.779
 muffler wheel to be comfortable 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.480
 get to the engine and take it off 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.699
 I will pointee it because I have 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.090
 taps crankshaft when I put 75 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.780
 kg here put it on it and heard 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.780
 all the same, this sound decided to change everything 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.410
 in general, now it will be necessary 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:45.329
 melt pull crankshaft bearings 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:50.250
 change and all that now I will show 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.989
 how to remove the engine here for 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.719
 In order to remove it you need this one 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:06.900
 tool 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:08.850
 do like this seems ready oh he 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.659
 fell but it's okay i'm here 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.650
 spread out 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.710
 so he was soft warm that's not very 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.810
 quickly everything turned out so I split 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:25.140
 the engine has already removed the variator 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.290
 clutch immediately that's all done 1 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.060
 sledgehammer and very easy now let's see 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.930
 my piston condition 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.439
 so somewhere she flew away and he just 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:42.030
 No, but it seems like candy here 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.460
 they all lie we have one but this 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.810
 nothing terrible . constantin even with 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:53.009
 candy instead of the piston in the cylinder 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.549
 good very high quality bearings 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.280
 already you choked here a little bit ring 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.140
 so they need to be changed and colin shaft 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.040
 also under 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:11.590
 so here we have an electricity generator he 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:17.400
 white doesn't want to stick out 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:23.709
 leaned out in very good condition 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:26.950
 just about oh a little crumbled no 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:31.480
 it doesn't matter anymore 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.280
 I will change the oil in it in order to 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.510
 put everything in place 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:47.040
 new channel bearings need everything first 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:47.040
 at collect so here 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.420
 then throw in a box with a rag not 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:06.530
 so that for him there were soft and clean here 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.530
 so here 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.250
 add some bolts new bearings 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.360
 candy for good department work and 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.960
 new knee 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:37.500
 now you need everything carefully 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:40.800
 mix like that for good frequency 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:47.750
 add multiply gasoline with oil here 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:52.740
 so here everything is mixed up everything is ready 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:04:00.000
 there was a final touch 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:05.700
 here's a step and then here and so here and 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.250
 Now the most crucial moment here 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:14.130
 so apnuli a little 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:16.820
 everything is bent over here is our engine already 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.820
 assembled 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.450
 thanks to this method the channel rises 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:30.620
 immediately very clearly spinning easily 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:38.600
 no distortions like this 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:42.520
 water worth here look what he immediately 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.860
 clear became all collected everything turns 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:50.360
 there is compression 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:54.020
 big crankshaft in place everything is now 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:59.410
 you can put on this scooter and about be 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:03.650
 ride here I installed the engine 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.620
 collected from the crankshaft with candy 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:12.770
 so handsome now i'm his 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:15.449
 I will start like this and then like this 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:20.039
 so here 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:22.529
 everything works well nowhere knocks 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.349
 Generally do not fly out of the muffler because 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:29.150
 what is there a special reticulum catches 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.150
 pistons here 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.919
 gas responsiveness is the rarest 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:51.310
 all you can now break in ruin 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.940
 all in the address photorec repair your 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:58.560
 mopeds as I strongly advise you 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.560
