00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the actual spinning track wheel to more

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.200 
the actual spinning track wheel to more
of<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.590> microswitch<00:01:23.100> sensitive<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> your

of a microswitch sensitive to your
finger<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:25.200> nice<00:01:25.439> user<00:01:25.710> interface

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
finger it's a very nice user interface

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.210 
finger it's a very nice user interface
but<00:01:27.420> i<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.049> they<00:01:28.290> very<00:01:28.619> much<00:01:28.740> lacked

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220

the<00:01:31.950> GUI<00:01:32.070> interface<00:01:32.600> it's<00:01:33.600> very<00:01:33.780> flat<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.590> me

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the GUI interface it's very flat for me

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.679 
the GUI interface it's very flat for me
it<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:34.979> very<00:01:35.340> reminiscent<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.210> using<00:01:36.600> an

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
it was very reminiscent of using an

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the time you're going to find yourself

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.649 
the time you're going to find yourself
