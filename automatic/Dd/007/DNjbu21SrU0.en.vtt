do the entry cuz super sick but the only
thing<00:02:21.349> is<00:02:21.819> it's<00:02:22.819> not<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:24.200> greatest<00:02:24.349> eager

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
thing is it's not the greatest eager

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.809 
thing is it's not the greatest eager
it's<00:02:25.790> about<00:02:25.879> it<00:02:26.150> but<00:02:27.019> other<00:02:27.319> than<00:02:27.500> that
