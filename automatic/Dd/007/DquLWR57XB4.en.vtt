00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.929 

it's<00:01:37.909> connected<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.940> there

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:55.340

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.490 

won't<00:01:55.920> get<00:01:56.190> it<00:01:56.600> flat<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:58.470> got<00:01:58.770> it<00:02:00.200> ready<00:02:01.200> to

matter come here
and<00:02:25.860> then<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:27.000> solder<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.480> one

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.399 

-<00:02:32.470> there<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:34.360> then<00:02:34.480> give<00:02:34.629> it<00:02:34.659> a<00:02:34.750> talk

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
- there and then give it a talk

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.080 
- there and then give it a talk
so<00:02:35.830> you're<00:02:35.950> giving<00:02:36.159> a<00:02:36.190> bit<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.489> tiny<00:02:36.790> talk

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
so you're giving a bit of a tiny talk

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.430 
so you're giving a bit of a tiny talk
don't<00:02:37.599> -<00:02:37.780> rip<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.080> off<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:40.390> do<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.720> test<00:02:41.110> I

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
don't - rip it off just do a test I

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.460 
don't - rip it off just do a test I
think<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.799> one<00:02:41.950> needs<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.250> little<00:02:42.519> bit<00:02:43.470> never

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
think that one needs a little bit never

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.080 
think that one needs a little bit never
better

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
better

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.640 
better
joy<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:48.280> grab<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.150> do<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:49.420> one<00:02:49.569> again

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
joy so grab that and do that one again

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.339 
joy so grab that and do that one again
and<00:02:50.650> see<00:02:50.890> if<00:02:50.920> it's<00:02:51.190> quite<00:02:51.430> right<00:02:52.560> unless<00:02:53.560> tight

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
and see if it's quite right unless tight

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.210 
and see if it's quite right unless tight
that's<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:58.409> first<00:02:59.409> part

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
that's the first part

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.900 
that's the first part
so<00:03:00.579> those<00:03:00.819> are<00:03:01.209> two<00:03:01.239> motor<00:03:05.430> wires<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.700> being

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
so those are two motor wires of being

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.860 
so those are two motor wires of being
change<00:03:07.329> round<00:03:09.870> now<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.930> tricky<00:03:11.530> bit<00:03:12.870> into

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
change round now the tricky bit into

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.780 
change round now the tricky bit into
shot<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:16.180> put<00:03:16.450> this<00:03:16.629> off<00:03:17.340> I'll<00:03:18.340> point<00:03:18.609> them

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
shot you put this off I'll point them

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.210 
shot you put this off I'll point them
out<00:03:18.940> if<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.569> don't<00:03:19.780> manage<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.319> actually<00:03:20.530> do<00:03:21.069> it

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
out if I don't manage to actually do it

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.140 
out if I don't manage to actually do it
in<00:03:21.430> one<00:03:21.640> go<00:03:21.900> at<00:03:22.900> least<00:03:23.049> you'll<00:03:23.349> know<00:03:23.940> I've<00:03:24.940> got

in one go at least you'll know I've got

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.800 
in one go at least you'll know I've got
some<00:03:25.420> mad<00:03:25.599> little<00:03:25.840> pointers<00:03:26.349> a<00:03:26.530> little<00:03:27.810> whole

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
for reversing server you can actually

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:18.860 
for reversing server you can actually
buy<00:04:07.829> one<00:04:07.859> for<00:04:08.340> about<00:04:11.060> ten<00:04:12.060> pound<00:04:17.539> it<00:04:18.539> means

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
buy one for about ten pound it means

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:26.650 
buy one for about ten pound it means
that<00:04:19.139> have<00:04:19.259> an<00:04:19.410> extra<00:04:23.330> bits<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.570> your<00:04:24.810> aircraft

that have an extra bits in your aircraft

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.589 
that have an extra bits in your aircraft
right<00:04:27.660> let's<00:04:27.870> get<00:04:28.020> into<00:04:28.139> a<00:04:28.199> better<00:04:28.380> position

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.180 
right let's get into a better position
right<00:04:30.630> I've<00:04:30.900> time<00:04:31.320> yourself<00:04:31.560> for<00:04:31.949> eight

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
right I've time yourself for eight

see<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.330> off<00:05:06.479> that<00:05:06.750> wire<00:05:06.990> there<00:05:08.960> for<00:05:09.960> taking

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
see the off that wire there for taking

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.570 
see the off that wire there for taking
off<00:05:11.479> cut<00:05:12.479> this<00:05:12.599> in<00:05:12.780> half<00:05:12.810> here<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:15.900> see<00:05:16.139> that

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
off cut this in half here you see that

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.640 
off cut this in half here you see that
there<00:05:17.900> you<00:05:18.900> look<00:05:19.050> closer

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
there you look closer

there you look closer
coming<00:05:20.010> closer<00:05:20.479> cut<00:05:21.479> that<00:05:21.599> in<00:05:21.780> half<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:23.479> then

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
coming closer cut that in half and then

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.899 
coming closer cut that in half and then
splice<00:05:25.349> that<00:05:25.380> one<00:05:25.889> with<00:05:26.099> you<00:05:26.220> over<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:26.729> the

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
splice that one with you over and the

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:31.730 
splice that one with you over and the
other<00:05:27.289> the<00:05:28.289> other<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:30.020> what<00:05:31.020> you<00:05:31.110> do<00:05:31.289> all<00:05:31.590> you

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
other the other that what you do all you

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.070 
other the other that what you do all you
doing<00:05:31.889> is<00:05:32.070> swapping<00:05:32.340> that<00:05:32.729> to<00:05:33.449> that<00:05:33.840> outside

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
doing is swapping that to that outside

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.500 
doing is swapping that to that outside
want<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.770> live<00:05:34.919> it<00:05:35.039> outside<00:05:35.430> one<00:05:35.760> so<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:36.389> can

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
want to live it outside one so you can

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.149 
want to live it outside one so you can
either<00:05:36.659> do<00:05:36.870> it<00:05:36.900> where<00:05:37.199> those<00:05:37.380> these<00:05:37.710> are<00:05:38.009> which

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 
either do it where those these are which

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:40.129 
either do it where those these are which
is<00:05:38.310> a<00:05:38.340> bit<00:05:38.490> difficult<00:05:38.699> to<00:05:39.090> reach<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:39.810> you<00:05:39.990> can

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
is a bit difficult to reach and you can

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.670 
is a bit difficult to reach and you can
melt<00:05:40.349> them<00:05:40.880> the<00:05:41.880> plastic<00:05:42.509> if<00:05:42.990> you<00:05:43.259> will<00:05:43.470> get

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
melt them the plastic if you will get

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.760 
melt them the plastic if you will get
this<00:05:43.800> wrong<00:05:44.479> but<00:05:45.479> if<00:05:45.599> you<00:05:45.780> just<00:05:46.020> just<00:05:46.380> cut<00:05:46.620> it

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
this wrong but if you just just cut it

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.070 
this wrong but if you just just cut it
there<00:05:47.220> you<00:05:47.490> could<00:05:47.669> just<00:05:47.699> do<00:05:48.270> it<00:05:48.389> outside<00:05:48.570> the

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
there you could just do it outside the

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.250 
there you could just do it outside the
actual<00:05:49.259> below<00:05:49.650> plastic<00:05:50.250> crown

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
actual below plastic crown

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.900 
actual below plastic crown
container<00:05:53.130> servo<00:05:53.880> container<00:05:55.370> as<00:05:56.370> you<00:05:56.550> can<00:05:56.730> see

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
container servo container as you can see

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.680 
container servo container as you can see
I've<00:05:57.030> melted<00:05:57.300> a<00:05:57.540> bit<00:05:57.570> there<00:05:57.930> actually<00:05:58.610> but

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
I've melted a bit there actually but

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.030 
I've melted a bit there actually but
what<00:06:00.690> if<00:06:00.870> we've<00:06:01.020> got<00:06:01.170> the<00:06:01.260> screws<00:06:01.620> that<00:06:01.830> should

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
what if we've got the screws that should

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.240 
what if we've got the screws that should
be<00:06:02.160> arriving<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:02.610> I'll<00:06:02.700> tape<00:06:02.940> it<00:06:03.120> up<00:06:04.220> anyway

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
be arriving and I'll tape it up anyway

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.160 
be arriving and I'll tape it up anyway
little<00:06:05.520> if<00:06:05.610> that<00:06:05.760> gives<00:06:05.940> a<00:06:06.000> good<00:06:06.120> example<00:06:06.270> why

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
little if that gives a good example why

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.010 
little if that gives a good example why
it'd<00:06:08.160> be<00:06:08.340> better<00:06:08.550> just<00:06:08.700> sometimes<00:06:09.510> to<00:06:09.720> splice

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
it'd be better just sometimes to splice

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.130 
it'd be better just sometimes to splice
it<00:06:10.350> you<00:06:10.710> can<00:06:10.890> do<00:06:11.010> it<00:06:11.040> easier<00:06:11.490> with<00:06:11.930> the<00:06:12.930> bigger

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
it you can do it easier with the bigger

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:19.970 
it you can do it easier with the bigger
servos<00:06:13.770> there<00:06:16.550> that's<00:06:17.550> it<00:06:18.440> came<00:06:19.440> off<00:06:19.590> alright

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
servos there that's it came off alright

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.380 
servos there that's it came off alright
and<00:06:20.310> now<00:06:20.460> all<00:06:20.610> we<00:06:20.640> do<00:06:20.850> is<00:06:20.880> swap<00:06:21.240> those<00:06:21.390> round

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
and now all we do is swap those round

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.210 
and now all we do is swap those round
pulling<00:06:24.390> that<00:06:24.510> one<00:06:24.720> round<00:06:25.020> and<00:06:25.530> hopefully<00:06:26.190> I

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
pulling that one round and hopefully I

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.100 
pulling that one round and hopefully I
can<00:06:26.340> do<00:06:26.580> this<00:06:26.760> within<00:06:27.000> one<00:06:27.480> minute

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
can do this within one minute

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.080 
can do this within one minute
watch<00:06:28.830> me<00:06:29.070> beeper<00:06:29.430> goes<00:06:29.670> and<00:06:30.000> that's<00:06:30.960> time<00:06:31.290> off

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
watch me beeper goes and that's time off

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.490 
watch me beeper goes and that's time off
but<00:06:33.090> you<00:06:33.150> can<00:06:33.330> see<00:06:33.510> with<00:06:33.660> the<00:06:33.780> principle<00:06:34.380> and

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
but you can see with the principle and

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.690 
but you can see with the principle and
what<00:06:34.620> I've<00:06:35.270> what<00:06:36.270> I'm<00:06:36.390> doing<00:06:36.840> I<00:06:37.580> think<00:06:38.580> I'll

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
what I've what I'm doing I think I'll

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.530 
what I've what I'm doing I think I'll
meet<00:06:38.940> it

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.060 

I'm<00:06:42.540> probably<00:06:42.840> gonna<00:06:43.020> need<00:06:43.320> another<00:06:43.530> couple

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
I'm probably gonna need another couple

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.360 
I'm probably gonna need another couple
of<00:06:44.220> minutes<00:06:44.550> so<00:06:45.000> I<00:06:45.260> might<00:06:46.260> call<00:06:46.500> that<00:06:46.530> time

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:55.010 

I'll<00:06:50.370> let<00:06:50.490> you<00:06:50.730> know<00:06:50.940> if<00:06:51.300> I<00:06:51.510> succeeded<00:06:54.020> by

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
I'll let you know if I succeeded by

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:01.310 
I'll let you know if I succeeded by
commenting<00:06:55.710> below<00:06:57.260> or<00:06:58.260> both<00:06:59.690> now<00:07:00.690> just<00:07:01.110> push

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
commenting below or both now just push

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.260 
commenting below or both now just push
that<00:07:01.590> action<00:07:01.920> into<00:07:02.070> position<00:07:02.670> I'm<00:07:02.910> not<00:07:03.030> going

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
that action into position I'm not going

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.800 
that action into position I'm not going
to<00:07:03.360> do<00:07:03.510> it<00:07:04.820> what<00:07:05.820> you<00:07:05.880> do<00:07:06.090> is<00:07:06.120> is<00:07:06.330> some<00:07:06.510> little

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
to do it what you do is is some little

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.440 
to do it what you do is is some little
even<00:07:07.260> more<00:07:07.610> smaller<00:07:08.610> all<00:07:09.330> that<00:07:09.570> my<00:07:09.720> reach<00:07:11.450> push

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.450 
even more smaller all that my reach push

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.300 
even more smaller all that my reach push
that<00:07:12.570> down<00:07:12.780> a<00:07:12.840> bit

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.240 

I<00:07:15.370> think<00:07:15.790> that<00:07:15.940> might<00:07:16.120> do<00:07:16.360> it<00:07:16.890> now<00:07:17.890> it's<00:07:18.070> better

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.250 
I think that might do it now it's better

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.670 
I think that might do it now it's better
to<00:07:18.400> use<00:07:18.430> the<00:07:18.700> tweezers<00:07:19.170> produce<00:07:20.170> some<00:07:20.380> so<00:07:20.500> I'm

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 
to use the tweezers produce some so I'm

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.290 
to use the tweezers produce some so I'm
gonna<00:07:20.770> get<00:07:20.950> some<00:07:21.130> smaller<00:07:21.430> tweezers<00:07:22.030> to<00:07:22.150> do

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300 
gonna get some smaller tweezers to do

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:29.309 
gonna get some smaller tweezers to do
