plants now red hot pokers are originally
from<00:00:16.619> South<00:00:16.859> Africa<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:17.910> they<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:18.390> handle

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
from South Africa so they can handle

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.019 
from South Africa so they can handle
quite<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.199> bit<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.590> cold<00:00:19.980> temperature<00:00:20.550> people

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
quite a bit of cold temperature people

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.130 
quite a bit of cold temperature people
tell<00:00:21.210> me<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.449> they<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.720> grow<00:00:21.900> them<00:00:22.050> in

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
tell me that they can grow them in

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.960 
tell me that they can grow them in
Minnesota<00:00:22.650> even<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.279> all<00:00:23.369> they<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.730> mulch

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
Minnesota even and all they do is mulch

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.670 
Minnesota even and all they do is mulch
them<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.240> little<00:00:24.510> bit<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.900> they<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.199> handle<00:00:25.439> a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
them a little bit so they can handle a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.040 
them a little bit so they can handle a
lot<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:26.039> cold<00:00:26.250> weather<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:27.390> story<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.779> like

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
lot of cold weather and a story I like

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.570 
lot of cold weather and a story I like
to<00:00:28.199> remember<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.769> they<00:00:28.890> were<00:00:28.949> found<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.369> South

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
to remember is they were found in South

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.569 
to remember is they were found in South
Africa<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.240> 1600s<00:00:31.109> 1500s<00:00:31.859> even<00:00:32.160> they

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
Africa in the 1600s 1500s even they

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.889 
Africa in the 1600s 1500s even they
brought<00:00:32.820> them<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.090> England<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.630> they<00:00:33.719> only

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
brought them to England and they only

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.090 
brought them to England and they only
grew<00:00:34.140> them<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.380> greenhouses<00:00:34.800> because

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
grew them in the greenhouses because

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.770 
grew them in the greenhouses because
they<00:00:35.219> assumed<00:00:35.520> everything<00:00:35.910> had<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.360> grow<00:00:36.570> in

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
they assumed everything had to grow in

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.720 
they assumed everything had to grow in
greenhouses<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.649> was<00:00:37.860> from<00:00:38.040> South<00:00:38.190> Africa

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
greenhouses that was from South Africa

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.200 
greenhouses that was from South Africa
and<00:00:38.910> then<00:00:39.570> into<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> 1700s<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.520> farmer

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
and then into the 1700s a farmer

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.049 
and then into the 1700s a farmer
actually<00:00:42.860> accidentally<00:00:43.860> left<00:00:44.219> some<00:00:44.460> outside

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
actually accidentally left some outside

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.420 
actually accidentally left some outside
and<00:00:45.480> they<00:00:45.930> survived<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.559> winter<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.280> they

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and they survived the winter so they

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.279 
and they survived the winter so they
realized<00:00:47.910> then<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.719> lot<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.140> South

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
realized then that a lot of South

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.410 
realized then that a lot of South
African<00:00:49.800> plants<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.399> grow<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.850> England<00:00:51.270> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
African plants can grow in England and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.750 
African plants can grow in England and
colder<00:00:51.780> climates<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.829> took<00:00:53.010> them<00:00:53.100> 200<00:00:53.579> years

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
colder climates so took them 200 years

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.299 
colder climates so took them 200 years
to<00:00:53.910> figure<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.300> out<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:55.170> I'm<00:00:55.590> always<00:00:55.890> amazed

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
to figure it out so I'm always amazed

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.279 
to figure it out so I'm always amazed
that<00:00:56.340> they're<00:00:56.730> such<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> tough<00:00:57.239> plant<00:00:57.539> now

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
that they're such a tough plant now

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 
that they're such a tough plant now
red-hot<00:00:58.530> pokers<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.219> these<00:00:59.399> big<00:00:59.670> candy<00:01:00.300> corn

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
red-hot pokers get these big candy corn

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.630 
red-hot pokers get these big candy corn
type<00:01:00.899> flowers<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.680> them<00:01:01.800> they're<00:01:01.980> red<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
type flowers on them they're red and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.850 
type flowers on them they're red and
yellow<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.199> hummingbirds<00:01:04.199> love<00:01:04.650> them

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
yellow and hummingbirds love them

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.690 
yellow and hummingbirds love them
they're<00:01:05.040> probably<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.400> number<00:01:05.460> one

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
they're probably my number one

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.780 
they're probably my number one
hummingbird<00:01:06.390> plant<00:01:06.720> next<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.650> crocosmia<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
hummingbird plant next to crocosmia and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.719 
hummingbird plant next to crocosmia and
they're<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.900> root<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.890> when<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.310> growing

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
they're just a root so when I'm growing

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.789 
they're just a root so when I'm growing
them<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.630> don't<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:12.990> need<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> whole

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
them you don't really need to do a whole

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.710 
them you don't really need to do a whole
lot<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.400> don't<00:01:14.820> need<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.030> transplant<00:01:15.659> them

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
lot you don't need to transplant them

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.670 
lot you don't need to transplant them
very<00:01:15.930> often<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.439> love<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.280> crowded<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
very often they love to be crowded and

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.100 
very often they love to be crowded and
as<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.830> said<00:01:20.100> they're<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.000> rootstock<00:01:21.240> so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
as I said they're just a rootstock so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.690 
as I said they're just a rootstock so
you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.350> even<00:01:22.590> separate<00:01:23.009> them<00:01:23.250> out<00:01:23.369> very

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you can even separate them out very

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.660 
you can even separate them out very
easily<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.930> they'll<00:01:25.409> multiply<00:01:25.619> quickly<00:01:26.400> so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
easily so they'll multiply quickly so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.370 
easily so they'll multiply quickly so
over<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.180> years<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.869> separate<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
over the years you can separate a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.929 
over the years you can separate a
mountain<00:01:28.799> five<00:01:29.040> ten<00:01:29.340> years<00:01:29.369> from<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
mountain five ten years from now and

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.999 
mountain five ten years from now and
you'll<00:01:30.060> get<00:01:30.180> lots<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.689> lots<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.990> starts<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.950> as

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you'll get lots and lots of starts so as

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.770 
you'll get lots and lots of starts so as
long<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.310> you've<00:01:32.430> got<00:01:32.460> some<00:01:32.850> root<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.390> some

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
long as you've got some root and some

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
long as you've got some root and some
stem<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.799> start<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> new<00:01:35.400> plant<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
stem you can start a new plant and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.880 
stem you can start a new plant and
saying<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.869> I've<00:01:37.140> even<00:01:37.470> found<00:01:37.619> little

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
saying that I've even found little

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.380 
saying that I've even found little
pieces<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.430> root<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.790> planted<00:01:39.150> them<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
pieces of root and planted them and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.899 
pieces of root and planted them and
they've<00:01:39.540> made<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.280> make<00:01:41.490> sure<00:01:41.520> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
they've made it so just make sure that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.580 
they've made it so just make sure that
the<00:01:42.060> roots<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.420> covered<00:01:42.630> up<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> greens

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the roots are covered up but the greens

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.940 
the roots are covered up but the greens
exposed<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:45.079> they're<00:01:46.079> pretty<00:01:46.320> tough<00:01:46.649> these

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
exposed and they're pretty tough these

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.490 
exposed and they're pretty tough these
we<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.310> transplanted<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.180> too<00:01:48.420> long<00:01:48.600> ago<00:01:48.659> so

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
we just transplanted not too long ago so

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.480 
we just transplanted not too long ago so
I<00:01:49.530> think<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.890> might<00:01:50.040> take<00:01:50.250> them<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> couple

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
I think it might take them a couple

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.389 
I think it might take them a couple
years<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.180> really<00:01:51.479> look<00:01:51.720> good<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.200> get

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
years to really look good and get

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.120 
years to really look good and get
growing<00:01:54.049> but<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.380> love<00:01:55.649> them<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:55.979> they're

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
growing but I just love them and they're

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.700 
growing but I just love them and they're
easy<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.610> divide<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.509> used<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.290> think<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.590> they

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
easy to divide I used to think that they

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.109 
easy to divide I used to think that they
were<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.070> grandma's<00:01:59.430> flower<00:01:59.729> because<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
were just a grandma's flower because I

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.510 
were just a grandma's flower because I
saw<00:02:00.299> them<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> lot<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.810> older<00:02:01.170> ladies<00:02:01.520> yards

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
saw them in a lot of older ladies yards

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.249 
saw them in a lot of older ladies yards
but<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:03.390> I've<00:02:03.570> realized<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
but now I've realized that the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.289 
but now I've realized that the
hummingbirds<00:02:04.770> love<00:02:05.040> them<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.759> love<00:02:05.790> them

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
hummingbirds love them and I love them

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.119 
hummingbirds love them and I love them
and<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.509> they're<00:02:07.200> one<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.619> joys<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.069> my

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
and that they're one of the joys of my

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.700 
and that they're one of the joys of my
garden
