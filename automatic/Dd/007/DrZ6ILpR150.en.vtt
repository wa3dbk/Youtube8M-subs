00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
combat like this we can't really tell

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.079 
combat like this we can't really tell
whether<00:00:37.559> or<00:00:37.679> not<00:00:37.769> the<00:00:37.890> rotary<00:00:38.370> air<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:39.089 
whether or not the rotary air or the

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.569 
whether or not the rotary air or the
neither<00:00:39.539> is<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.929> best<00:00:40.170> they<00:00:40.769> are<00:00:40.890> very<00:00:40.920> close

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
neither is the best they are very close

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.700 
neither is the best they are very close
but<00:00:42.359> the<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:42.750> thing<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.019> speaks<00:00:43.440> for<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
but the one thing that speaks for the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.349 
but the one thing that speaks for the
needler<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.460> course<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.940> fact<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.179> you

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
needler is of course the fact that you

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.750 
needler is of course the fact that you
have<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.749> much<00:00:45.929> more<00:00:46.199> ammo<00:00:46.440> now<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.339> may<00:00:47.579> want

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
have so much more ammo now you may want

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.340 
have so much more ammo now you may want
to<00:00:47.850> turn<00:00:47.969> down<00:00:48.030> your<00:00:48.179> volume<00:00:48.329> because<00:00:49.079> there

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
to turn down your volume because there

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.779 
to turn down your volume because there
is<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.039> little<00:00:50.280> bit<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.579> noise

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
is going to be a little bit of noise

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.979 
is going to be a little bit of noise
coming<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.320> few<00:00:52.440> seconds<00:00:52.800> here<00:00:53.989> over

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
coming in just a few seconds here over

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.709 
coming in just a few seconds here over
basically<00:00:55.589> as<00:00:55.739> even<00:00:56.460> as<00:00:56.609> we<00:00:56.789> normally<00:00:57.269> are<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
basically as even as we normally are and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.579 
basically as even as we normally are and
it's<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:59.179> this<00:01:00.179> is<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> normal<00:01:00.719> pace<00:01:01.199> only

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
it's like this is the normal pace only

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:15.850 
it's like this is the normal pace only

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:24.380 
been that for at least three or four
months

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.280 

damn<00:02:25.390> nice<00:02:25.989> one<00:02:26.379> yeah<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.959> big<00:02:29.139> difference

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
damn nice one yeah the big difference

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.520 
damn nice one yeah the big difference
between<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.340> rotary<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:31.629> the<00:02:32.019> needler<00:02:32.349> is

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
between the rotary and the needler is

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.780 
between the rotary and the needler is
that<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.889> have<00:02:33.239> 50<00:02:34.239> plus<00:02:34.599> velocity<00:02:35.560> on<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
that you have 50 plus velocity on the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.300 
that you have 50 plus velocity on the
default<00:02:37.239> gum<00:02:37.510> this<00:02:38.469> makes<00:02:38.769> it<00:02:38.889> easier<00:02:39.249> to

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
default gum this makes it easier to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.759 
default gum this makes it easier to
target<00:02:40.000> easy<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.450> lead<00:02:40.629> but<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.409> do<00:02:41.560> less

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
target easy to lead but you do less

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.589 
target easy to lead but you do less
damage<00:02:41.799> you<00:02:42.459> need<00:02:42.609> to<00:02:42.670> maintain<00:02:42.849> your<00:02:43.180> aim<00:02:43.359> on

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
damage you need to maintain your aim on

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.300 
damage you need to maintain your aim on
your<00:02:43.629> target<00:02:43.989> for<00:02:44.319> a<00:02:44.349> longer<00:02:44.620> period<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.250> time

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
your target for a longer period of time

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.240 
your target for a longer period of time
during<00:02:45.939> this<00:02:46.840> gameplay<00:02:47.170> we<00:02:47.500> did<00:02:47.650> not<00:02:47.829> try<00:02:48.189> the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
during this gameplay we did not try the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.979 
during this gameplay we did not try the
river<00:02:48.549> but<00:02:49.060> if<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.269> really<00:02:49.450> want<00:02:49.659> to<00:02:49.719> see<00:02:49.810> some

will be in the description another thing

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.360 
will be in the description another thing
that<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.019> very<00:03:05.199> different<00:03:05.829> now<00:03:05.889> that<00:03:06.010> we're

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
that is very different now that we're

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.610 
that is very different now that we're
using<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.760> needler<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.269> how<00:03:07.599> you<00:03:07.659> are<00:03:08.199> forced

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
using the needler is how you are forced

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.119 
using the needler is how you are forced
to<00:03:08.680> dodge<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:10.060> little<00:03:10.510> movements<00:03:11.439> that<00:03:11.590> was<00:03:12.099> a

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
to dodge the little movements that was a

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.179 
to dodge the little movements that was a
very<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.459> useful<00:03:13.299> before<00:03:13.719> then<00:03:14.530> work<00:03:14.799> as<00:03:14.949> well

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
very a useful before then work as well

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.599 
very a useful before then work as well
because<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.540> higher<00:03:16.719> both<00:03:17.169> velocity<00:03:17.739> your

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
because of the higher both velocity your

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.459 
because of the higher both velocity your
opponent<00:03:18.969> is<00:03:19.060> just<00:03:19.599> going<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.840> hit<00:03:19.989> you<00:03:20.079> anyway

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:20.469 
opponent is just going to hit you anyway

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.409 
opponent is just going to hit you anyway
and<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:21.099> sustained<00:03:21.489> fire<00:03:21.699> from<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.060> bigger

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
and the sustained fire from the bigger

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.050 
and the sustained fire from the bigger
magazine<00:03:22.840> size<00:03:23.019> of<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.919> needler<00:03:24.280> sometimes

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
magazine size of the needler sometimes

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.670 
magazine size of the needler sometimes
the<00:03:25.150> time<00:03:25.329> you<00:03:25.659> get<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.930> feeling<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.260> even

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
the time you get the feeling that even

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.469 
the time you get the feeling that even
if<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:26.919> do<00:03:27.129> really<00:03:27.579> good<00:03:27.699> watching<00:03:28.060> maneuvers

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:28.479 
if you do really good watching maneuvers

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.330 
if you do really good watching maneuvers
you<00:03:28.689> don't<00:03:28.959> get<00:03:29.169> enough<00:03:29.379> momentum<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.979> throw

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
you don't get enough momentum to throw

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.309 
you don't get enough momentum to throw
your<00:03:30.579> opponent<00:03:30.609> off<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.840> has<00:03:32.079> of<00:03:32.290> course

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
your opponent off it has of course

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.349 
your opponent off it has of course
always<00:03:32.680> been<00:03:32.979> really<00:03:33.159> hard<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.549> throw<00:03:33.939> back

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
always been really hard to throw back

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:40.160 
always been really hard to throw back
you<00:03:34.509> off

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:04:01.850 

you

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.340 

night

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
night

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:28.280 
night
oh<00:04:04.820> my<00:04:05.820> god

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.870 

yeah<00:04:29.180> yeah<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.210> fucked<00:04:30.960> that<00:04:31.020> up<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.260> pizza<00:04:31.880> yeah

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
yeah yeah I fucked that up a pizza yeah

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.060 
yeah yeah I fucked that up a pizza yeah
so<00:04:33.690> now<00:04:33.810> for<00:04:33.840> quite<00:04:34.170> a<00:04:34.230> while<00:04:34.380> let<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.860> site

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
so now for quite a while let the site

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.700 
so now for quite a while let the site
has<00:04:35.220> been<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.550> superior<00:04:36.060> air-to-air<00:04:36.540> ESF<00:04:37.470> and

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
has been the superior air-to-air ESF and

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.670 
has been the superior air-to-air ESF and
the<00:04:38.280> Y<00:04:38.460> as<00:04:38.700> we<00:04:38.910> are<00:04:39.090> not<00:04:39.240> balancing<00:04:39.690> this<00:04:39.930> we

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
the Y as we are not balancing this we

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.160 
the Y as we are not balancing this we
don't<00:04:40.770> know<00:04:40.950> but<00:04:41.580> maybe<00:04:42.150> it's<00:04:42.480> the<00:04:42.810> striker

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
don't know but maybe it's the striker

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.890 
don't know but maybe it's the striker
that<00:04:43.350> has<00:04:43.770> confused<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:44.820> numbers<00:04:45.210> for<00:04:45.540> the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
that has confused the numbers for the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.110 
that has confused the numbers for the
developers<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.680> that's<00:04:47.250> why<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:47.550> looks<00:04:47.880> like

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
developers and that's why it looks like

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.240 
developers and that's why it looks like
the<00:04:48.660> m18<00:04:49.110> rotary<00:04:49.500> is<00:04:49.680> better<00:04:49.950> than<00:04:50.100> it

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
the m18 rotary is better than it

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.070 
the m18 rotary is better than it
actually<00:04:50.370> is<00:04:50.640> now<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.390> imbalance<00:04:51.960> between

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
actually is now the imbalance between

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.190 
actually is now the imbalance between
the<00:04:52.410> site<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.010> Massey<00:04:53.460> is<00:04:53.670> the<00:04:54.480> same<00:04:54.750> once

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
the site and the Massey is the same once

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.680 
the site and the Massey is the same once
you<00:04:55.350> switch<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:55.890> default<00:04:56.250> guns<00:04:56.520> anyway<00:04:57.420> I'm

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
you switch the default guns anyway I'm

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.960 
you switch the default guns anyway I'm
going<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.230> upload<00:04:58.290> more<00:04:58.830> yes<00:04:59.400> I've<00:04:59.580> gameplay
