Kiki and grab a yellow polymer clay ball
and<00:00:25.580> flatten<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.699> down<00:00:27.470> we're<00:00:28.470> gonna<00:00:28.560> create

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
and flatten it down we're gonna create

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.669 
and flatten it down we're gonna create
it<00:00:29.070> into<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> star<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.900> figured<00:00:31.560> out

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
it into a star so this is I figured out

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.860 
it into a star so this is I figured out
this<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.579> best<00:00:32.790> way<00:00:32.969> for<00:00:33.239> me<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.390> make<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
this was the best way for me to make a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.380 
this was the best way for me to make a
star<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.500> if<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> star<00:00:35.280> mold<00:00:35.579> go

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
star but if you have a star mold go

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.240 
star but if you have a star mold go
ahead<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.870> use<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.260> instead<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:37.770> I'm<00:00:38.100> just

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
ahead and use that instead but I'm just

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.549 
ahead and use that instead but I'm just
gonna<00:00:38.430> Pierce<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> ends<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.320> just

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
gonna Pierce it on the ends and just

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.860 
gonna Pierce it on the ends and just
kind<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.800> work<00:00:41.010> my<00:00:41.190> way<00:00:41.219> around<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
kind of work my way around and the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.410 
kind of work my way around and the
angles<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.680> star<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.460> try<00:00:44.789> my<00:00:44.940> best<00:00:45.120> to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
angles of the star and try my best to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.270 
angles of the star and try my best to
create<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.800> symmetrical<00:00:47.489> as<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.879> possibly<00:00:48.450> can

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
create as symmetrical as I possibly can

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.850

also paint the face after you bake the
polymer<00:02:25.700> clay<00:02:26.000> but<00:02:26.240> I<00:02:26.270> decided<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:26.810> do<00:02:26.960> it<00:02:27.050> this

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
polymer clay but I decided to do it this

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.490 
polymer clay but I decided to do it this
way<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:28.190> secure<00:02:28.640> my<00:02:28.850> star<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.570> Kiki

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
way and to secure my star and Kiki

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.620 
way and to secure my star and Kiki
together<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.190> will<00:02:31.490> go<00:02:31.670> ahead<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.090> put<00:02:32.270> some<00:02:32.480> of

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
together I will go ahead and put some of

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.180 
together I will go ahead and put some of
this<00:02:32.720> TLS<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.530> then<00:02:33.800> place<00:02:34.700> my<00:02:35.800> charm<00:02:36.800> on<00:02:36.980> top

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
this TLS and then place my charm on top

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.570 
this TLS and then place my charm on top
of<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.520> I<00:02:37.760> could<00:02:38.450> have<00:02:38.480> put<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> eye<00:02:38.900> pin<00:02:39.200> out

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
of it I could have put the eye pin out

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.360 
of it I could have put the eye pin out
before<00:02:40.580> but<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.330> decided<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.959> do<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:42.230> after<00:02:42.980> so

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
go ahead and put the eye pin with it

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.410 
go ahead and put the eye pin with it
wherever<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.560> find<00:02:45.830> best<00:02:46.520> and<00:02:46.910> bake<00:02:47.180> your

then I just kind of pushed back either

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.340 
then I just kind of pushed back either
side<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.760> I'm<00:03:26.030> just<00:03:26.090> gonna<00:03:26.299> press<00:03:26.570> it<00:03:26.630> on<00:03:26.959> one

side and I'm just gonna press it on one

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.259 
side and I'm just gonna press it on one
side<00:03:27.560> of<00:03:27.620> her<00:03:27.830> head<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.250> then<00:03:28.310> do<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.239> other

side of her head and then do the other
side<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.790> then<00:03:31.790> using<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.660> same<00:03:32.870> Oh<00:03:33.140> using

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
side and then using the same Oh using

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.410 
side and then using the same Oh using
the<00:03:34.040> cuticle<00:03:34.430> stick<00:03:34.519> I<00:03:34.730> pressed<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.180> in<00:03:35.299> the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
the cuticle stick I pressed it in the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.539 
the cuticle stick I pressed it in the
same<00:03:35.630> but<00:03:35.930> using<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.650> same<00:03:36.680> method<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.250> used

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
same but using the same method I used

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.970 
same but using the same method I used
for<00:03:37.820> Kiki's<00:03:38.209> big<00:03:38.480> star<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:39.019> made<00:03:39.470> this<00:03:39.680> little

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
for Kiki's big star I made this little

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.890 
for Kiki's big star I made this little
star<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:40.610> basically<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.180> same<00:03:41.330> thing<00:03:41.540> is<00:03:41.690> that

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
star so basically the same thing is that

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.960 
star so basically the same thing is that
that<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:42.200> used<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.620> polymer<00:03:42.950> clay<00:03:43.070> tool<00:03:43.370> to

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
that I used the polymer clay tool to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.070 
that I used the polymer clay tool to
kind<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.209> shape<00:03:44.390> it<00:03:44.570> a<00:03:44.630> little<00:03:44.810> bit<00:03:44.959> better

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
kind of shape it a little bit better
