00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
with the first decrease role you'll end

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.870 
with the first decrease role you'll end
up<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> hundred<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.930> ten<00:02:10.229> stitches<00:02:10.880> now

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880

stitches<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:55.700> will<00:02:55.940> have<00:02:56.180> created<00:02:56.990> our

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
stitches and that will have created our

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:07.160 
stitches and that will have created our
floppy<00:02:57.860> brim<00:02:58.250> for<00:02:58.730> our<00:02:58.880> hat
