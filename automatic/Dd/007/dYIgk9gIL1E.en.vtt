 Well, generally here in the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.620
 city ​​I live in the city because we are 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.750
 only 15 minutes away from what is the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.120
 federal district 20 minutes at a time 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.640
 is not good is already considered and apart from 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.290
 the urban spot the part of the city 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.570

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.640

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.440
 influence who in the city is not so 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.840
 big band but in what they are 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.400
 the villages, because practically 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.510
 they are born with their true and low instrument 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.720

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.160
