underscore border style and the school I
think<00:02:36.900> I've<00:02:37.459> briefly<00:02:38.459> touched<00:02:38.760> on<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.209> border

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
think I've briefly touched on the border

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.380

style property in titanium in my text
field<00:02:42.630> video<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.200> think<00:02:43.799> it's<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:43.980> 14th<00:02:44.700> or

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
field video I think it's the 14th or

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.360 
field video I think it's the 14th or
15th<00:02:45.510> one<00:02:46.049> when<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.560> was<00:02:46.590> creating<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.220> simple

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
15th one when I was creating a simple

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.900 
15th one when I was creating a simple
form<00:02:48.049> so<00:02:49.049> if<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.349> forgot<00:02:49.739> about<00:02:49.829> board<00:02:50.220> border

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
form so if you forgot about board border

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.089 
form so if you forgot about board border
scowl<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.299> basically<00:02:51.660> how<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.140> text<00:02:52.920> field

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
scowl it's basically how the text field

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.309 
scowl it's basically how the text field
with<00:02:53.250> border<00:02:53.579> looks<00:02:53.819> by<00:02:54.450> default<00:02:54.660> there's

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.570 
on the android version so if using
android<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.860> basic<00:04:47.860> layout<00:04:48.010> might<00:04:48.430> be

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
android the basic layout might be

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.670 
android the basic layout might be
slightly<00:04:48.820> different<00:04:49.169> ok<00:04:50.169> so<00:04:50.230> I'm<00:04:50.380> going<00:04:50.530> to

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
slightly different ok so I'm going to

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.700 
slightly different ok so I'm going to
stop<00:04:50.860> my<00:04:51.040> simulator<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.150> going<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.169> look<00:04:53.500> at

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
stop my simulator and going to look at

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.219 
stop my simulator and going to look at
which<00:04:54.700> one<00:04:54.910> should<00:04:55.030> I<00:04:55.090> look<00:04:55.270> at<00:04:55.450> the<00:04:55.540> URL<00:04:55.750> one

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
which one should I look at the URL one

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.760 
which one should I look at the URL one
so<00:04:56.650> this<00:04:56.830> is<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:58.050> keyboard<00:04:59.050> or<00:04:59.430> URL<00:05:00.430> keyboard

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
so this is a keyboard or URL keyboard

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.330 
so this is a keyboard or URL keyboard
layout<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:04.810> keyboard<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.410> type<00:05:05.560> is<00:05:05.890> going
