00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
 to all of you that you hope is 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.330
 great because I bring you another tutorial 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.090
 nail art which is quite pretty 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.290
 nail decoration you know and is one 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.780
 I saw a few months ago and llos or so 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.539
 internet and I said I have not yet 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.740
 I saw no girl so Spanish 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.980
 but hey is not the one who gives that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.230
 a lot of nail things online 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.199
 of things as they are and nothing sent me 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.470
 of the bon pretty website is everything 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:36.140
 we'll leave it below I remember and nothing 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.940
 they sent me the powder this one 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.890
 Well, I'm going to open it, although in the 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.670
 video now what are you going to see open is that 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.640
 comes 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 this was coming to burst 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.320
 this color in particular is very clear 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.090
 but they had a lot more if you want 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.960
 Take a look or look in other websites 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.370
 that you want I show you the web of this 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.690
 because they are the ones who sent them to me 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.010
 so you can see that I have not investigated 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.640
 a lot and nothing remains is that it looks super 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.700
 weak this color 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.860
 but I was scared when choosing I was 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.450
 spotted a little bit by touching my eye 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.450
 with so much black that I wear today 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.800
 but I hope you can appreciate it 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:24.030
 I tell you , it's very, very weak 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:27.030
 I did it this way to teach you what 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.950
 I really tried it two weeks ago 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.660
 or so not to come to the video like this 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.420
 new and the truth is that I liked 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.040
 a lot in the dark has to stay 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.650
 precious in black this has to be 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.050
 so probably ask for one in black 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.030
 because it is very very nice and good nothing 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.640
 more I'll leave you with the tuto if 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.980
 you want to see how it is made to stay 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.930
 to use as I told you this enamel 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.590
 Kiko because as I do not have a glaze 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.570
 equal to the powder I recommend that 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.670
 be a lighter tone because I already tried it 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.970
 with a darker tonito and the truth is 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.240
 that if it is not covered by by completely 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.640
 it does not stay is not pretty so nothing 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.000
 I'm going to give two capes if you want you can 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.660
 leave it alone in one but it seems that it takes 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.730
 a little more consistency with two but 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.740
 I tell you what you want so nothing 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.930
 I wait for it to dry and good 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.290
 thought I'm going to put on this top coat of 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.970
 opi quick drying then we have 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.420
 taught the second layer has remained of the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.750
 small 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.340
 but we have no mystery 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.819
 just keep in mind that although 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.150
 you give the layers that you want to give you already know 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.239
 as you most like the kit is that 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.980
 in the last layer is therefore what 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.770
 leave there is drying there so that 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.569
 adhere well the hairs the fluff 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.340
 whatever I already have the little boat open 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.220
 that has been taught before that as you see 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.560
 comes to burst is full and the technique 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.560
 What I do is pose 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.200
 I'm moving a little bit so that 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.390
 impregnate well well for everything is that it 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.200
 It is so full and what I do now is 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.380
 squeeze so that it opens up well to 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.810
 everything and so one by one with all 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.240
 then do not worry about the excess what 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:21.240
 let's go withdrawing when it's more 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.240
 bag and that I will continue with the others 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.750
 this is not fun 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.040
 if you want you can sprinkle type like 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.620
 the caviar manicure but it's not so 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.800
 easy to pick up these little hairs so 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.000
 loose then I think that it 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.630
 waste a lot more product already 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.700
 as everyone wants and manages and now 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.500
 once the excess is removed a little 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.270
 it is not completely removed either 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.130
 just a little bit to finish already 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.070
 let it dry gonna stick 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.130
 lamp and hand in this little bell 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.560
 These are good for gels 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.660
 these grape what happens that way 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.709
 that helped me to dry a little bit 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.270
 before so nothing very cool so what 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.870
 I put it to dry a little bit more 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.870
 soon 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.880
 and once it is already entourage 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.530
 I have still removed a little bit of excess 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:21.290
 well with your fingers but nothing still very 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.080
 aggressive so to speak and how it is very 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.610
 softly you can barely notice but with a 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.610
 brush and here that I have 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.960
 nail remover this is synthetic 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.500
 so that it does not spoil what I'm going to 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.020
 to do is to remove a little bit of 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.910
 then you can appreciate well the 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.560
 excess 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.210
 that is not very impregnated 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.360
 if we are going to take everything we have 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.360
 fact 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:56.110
 and nothing with love this is a little 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:59.740
 catch the trick and with that more more 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.390
 soda for gays and better as you see how 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.850
 if you want to do it with a swab and 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.060
 is that with this I manage or I manage very 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.060
 all right 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.160
 and well nothing like that remains I hope that 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:17.370
 I can appreciate well with 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.040
 with this light is very very discreet with 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.830
 this color for which you have the skin 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.870
 more brunette then it will be better but 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.570
 the truth is that I like the effect is 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.090
 rare I like good what you thought 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.310
 I hope you liked the truth 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.320
 that has no problems are not so 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.060
 bulging like the caviar manicure that 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.310
 although it did not bother me but I know that 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.490
 some so if I made you as very 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.440
 rough these are much finite and a 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.360
 once removed the excess then if you go 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.640
 the hands darken a little bit with the 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.820
 water but then dries up because it's not 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.980
 How much do I tell my father 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.630
 he did not like anything is to leave I say 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.300
 Look, he made the ugliest thing in my mother 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.280
 Look, I started to laugh that I could not anymore 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.260
 I really say I think you do not like it 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.880
 by the color so clear says yes I believe 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:07.890
 what is that 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:11.130
 I've been told by my father's good love 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.960
 nothing good and I say to you I hope that you 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.310
 I liked it if you had already tried it 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.380
 you have seen, you can leave it to me 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.110
 comments and I do not know if you like this 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.990
 the other already I say the only one the only 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.700
 paste it is that is that it stains 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.060
 easily and clearly if you apply a 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.920
 top code over it loses everything all the 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.320
 glamor gets that bright and man 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.820
 the little color yes but the roll is lost 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.890
 this one as well 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:40.310
 velvet facebook links and 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.650
 twitter down in the box you know that 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.440
 there is a floor to leave photos that you can see 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.270
 things that I teach to improvement and before that 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.600
 then in the videos those little things that 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.940
 Well, we talk about these things and nothing 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.200
 more than many thanks for watching - the 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.200
 in another video chao
