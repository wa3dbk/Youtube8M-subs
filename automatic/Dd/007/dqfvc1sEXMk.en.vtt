00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
think about the design I mean like the

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.349 
think about the design I mean like the
design<00:03:56.410> itself<00:03:56.680> do<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:57.579> like<00:03:57.790> how<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.030> looks

design itself do you like how it looks
with<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.780> camera<00:03:59.260> in<00:03:59.530> just<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.160> way<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:00.459> looks

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639

with the camera in just the way it looks
I<00:04:00.760> mean<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:01.060> still<00:04:01.540> represents<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:02.500> way<00:04:02.620> the

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
I mean it still represents the way the

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.220 
I mean it still represents the way the
Nexus<00:04:03.190> devices<00:04:03.489> look<00:04:03.970> but<00:04:04.359> the<00:04:04.510> just<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.900> plain

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.559 
Nexus devices look but the just a plain
flat<00:04:05.590> look<00:04:05.980> on<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.250> front<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:07.030> back<00:04:07.239> is<00:04:07.540> a

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
flat look on the front the back is a

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.970 
flat look on the front the back is a
little<00:04:07.690> different<00:04:08.349> but<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.590> course<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.799> don't

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980
