00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.100
 video of me today I have for you 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.930
 a bremer kroll 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.570
 since i was in wien last week 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.330
 has has seen and the man in front of me and 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.690
 I already know it and I want you 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.279
 Now just show what's up 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.560
 currently at primark is so much fun 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.060
 in the video my first part are these 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.369
 shoes and if you last 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.519
 primacall has also seen that 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.439
 recognize patterns from the wedge heel here 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.359
 and I had just last time 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.120
 bought the matching beach bag 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.190
 So this black and white striped 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.680
 I think patterns are great too 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.930
 super cool and if you are then 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.120
 you can get the simpler outfits 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.760
 Just put it on and put it on 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.350
 Spice it up really well then 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.250
 then we'll look at the front here 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 zebras are almost completely open in principle 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.090
 The front is made of suede 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 then it's just so fast where you are 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.010
 is then just to do so with the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.739
 shoes stuck my second parts 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.860
 stood this bikini and it is the same 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.250
 cut like a bandeau tops 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.470
 or bra is just like that in the zebra 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.520
 Look and I mean zebras too 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.470
 to be able to recognize 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.479
 here in front of it it is so 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.939
 a bit rippled where next to the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.060
 then come out in the one you then 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.509
 around the neck and back here has 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.670
 just yes, such a closure theo itself 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.729
 actually quite normal now has 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.100
 no special cut thanks to the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.189
 statement chain because I somehow in 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.900
 Each primacall has a statement chain 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.119
 buy so i always buy somehow there 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.899
 which because you actually great 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.360
 are noble 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.810
 and this time i signed up for one 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.020
 Plainer decided because I just 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.930
 almost just so more klunker owns say 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.600
 me now and this actually quite 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.719
 cool so here's a bigger one 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.340
 triangle and here two smaller ones and me 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.050
 Do not know if it's in the camera 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.200
 recognizes 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.660
 But here I just have this triangle 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.580
 or meet crop has just here 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.860
 such a row with strasssteinchen bosses 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.410
 are from the accessory department then 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.980
 still mitskommen and once 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.350
 here in gold where then here is such a sweet 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.640
 Herzchen is one of the things 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.680
 wider is where then a bar with 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.680
 such a few pearls 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.980
 I'll say it and then another 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.210
 where such a floral pattern is on as well 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.590
 I have a few more silver ones 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.960
 I took that with me now 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.930
 but already worn and indeed 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.020
 in the resin here once so one 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:50.120
 he has triangle on both sides and me 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.820
 just opened one of the ring completely 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.300
 to where then it looks as it would be 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:00.410
 So blitzer on it then here in the has in 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.510
 in the front a triangle and one looks like 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.120
 like two rings on top of each other 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.160
 I had to wear sunglasses 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.950
 of course with such a 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.570
 sunglasses junkie and that's how it is 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.580
 I have a mirrored until now 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.500
 not yet and this year this 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.470
 year in the trend because of that had to 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.420
 such a necessarily with and mine 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.709
 current favorite glasses just has 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:30.230
 that's exactly what I'm saying 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:33.110
 this whether this form and it just so the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:38.890
 The temple is made of this beige say 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:42.590
 So one way or the other, I have a pinkish light 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.320
 and is just mirrored and yes he has 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.850
 so a bit whimsical reader then 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.550
 I wanted that to the clothes and there 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.050
 Then I had to wear a leather leggins 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.300
 I already have one but I always have 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.450
 fear that my other will break 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.140
 so as a tube so to speak and indeed 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.800
 to another 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.560
 plant a bit more and that is just 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.410
 a little matter matter I have them in the 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.310
 size 36 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:13.500
 and that's pretty long 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.959
 she fits me really well so from the 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.510
 wide and so fits perfectly and the 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.640
 does not slip because my other 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.100
 sometimes does not slip a bit stupid 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.100
 and it's actually perfect, though 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.290
 has just been a length just very 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.820
 long you might have to look 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.610
 I also thought about it 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.690
 I once again a how to dress riva 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.980
 make leggings so who has lust 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.970
 like in the comments or gives the 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.190
 video and thumbs up 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.190
 then I know that and then I will 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.710
 something again driven 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.740
 so maybe now, too 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.230
 a bit more summery then thank you 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.020
 however, to this blazer and to that 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:59.330
 blazer just the special that the fabric 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.560
 consists of a kind of how rough wallpaper 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.580
 and I'll show you again from 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.520
 Names if you do not now 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.580
 can imagine what I mean and has 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.310
 so wear it up here and to the 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.220
 I do not care about anything special 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.640
 So the bags are not really the 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.220
 are swept and has just years 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.229
 waisted cut as well as a blazer 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.960
 just cut is there I want 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:28.020
 you still show a thing from the h &amp; m 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.380
 And it is this jacket here 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.479
 and you have this year so again 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.460
 I often saw it and wanted it too 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.590
 necessarily buy one and then have 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.190
 luckily i found one more on the slope 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:45.090
 that was even from 25 to 10 euro 10 euro 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.680
 reduces hammer bargain and im 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.710
 So I'm just a bit 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.700
 longer so goes to depot about 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.900
 I would say and I give them this 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.250
 fluffy consists of this 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.840
 fluffy fabric and so it was 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.270
 awesome and that still has here 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.610
 so two bags that you can all now 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.380

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.570
