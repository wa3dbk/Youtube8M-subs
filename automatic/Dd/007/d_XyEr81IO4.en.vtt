00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 once again we are with you friends 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.620
 this is a new video from the series of 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.150
 the videos turn on this occasion 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.429
 I will explain how to make a correct 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.370
 diagnostic of a hard disk using 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.580
 this magnificent tool for which 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.210
 let's go to the menu of rotate let's go to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.150
 programs 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.539
 carl dix and then the program 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.759
 victory 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.460
 this program has many 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.039
 very interesting features in this 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.820
 occasion we will see the test 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:39.410
 surface and we'll see a bit on what 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.589
 consists here we are with the legend and 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.239
 the legend consists of several colors 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:48.110
 show the blocks according to the state of 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:51.440
 reading access as we see the most 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.500
 important to see are the green color the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.640
 orange red and blue with a 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.930
 Equis blue with an X is a 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.140
 sector completely damaged the red that 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.600
 it takes a pretty amount 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.479
 important of milliseconds in accessing 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.650
 the information the orange 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:18.640
 It may take 600 or a little longer 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:22.690
 and green 160 milliseconds or a little 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.200
 more in accessing information a disk 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:30.310
 Hard optimal conditions for normal 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.410
 will show a color like this clear without 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.360
 without the green without those greens that go 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.840
 appearing 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.390
 okay then here we see a sector 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.770
 of the hard disk we could say that it is 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.039
 healthy when it shows these grays 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.890
 the first and second gray then that disk 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.820
 drive is in good condition but when they 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.789
 is presenting green and orange colors 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.859
 Well, we are already talking about an album that 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:03.530
 It has many sectors that fall much 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.530
 access performance in reading 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.350
 now we will show an area of â€‹â€‹this disc 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.390
 hard that 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.390
 show considerable damage 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.400
 we will be 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.519
 and then we started to see blocks of 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.969
 orange and green color and this 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.800
 it would remove a lot of performance if we ride 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.810
 an operating system there 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.420
 in the case that we have sectors 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.000
 damaged that in this case on this disk 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.390
 hard I do not have a sector totally 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.700
 damaged that can not be accessed but if 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.180
 we want to eliminate what we should do 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.000
 is the following before starting the test 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.550
 of surface instead of ignoring 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.880
 we'll give it to you 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:56.110
 that is to erase and when we already have that 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:00.310
 selected option we only start the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.430
 surface test and we let you do your 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.820
 I work when I find a sector 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.120
 damaged will show it with a sign of 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.690
 admiration and then when I eliminate it 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.980
 it will show it equally colored 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.040
 blue 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.579
 but with a letter w 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.159
 and there we will know that the damaged sector has 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:27.310
 been removed from the fad 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:30.310
 that is, it will no longer appear in 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.989
 the following surface tests neither ni 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.950
 the operating system that we assemble 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.379
 will enter will find out that there is a sector 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.890
 damaged there physically naturally 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:44.620
 it will always be on the disk but no longer 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.129
 It will be no problem, I hope you have 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.470
 liked the information if they want some 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.599
 specific information do not hesitate in 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.359
 order it here below the video in the 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.230
 comments if you like to subscribe to 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:01.930
 my channel and put in the video that you 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.220
 I thank you for having me 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.220
 listened and until another
