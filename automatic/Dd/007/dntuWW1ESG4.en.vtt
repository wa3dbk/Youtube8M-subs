00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.870
 I hope you see a good one 

00:00:03.289 --> 00:00:07.299
 selection 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.560
 regardless of what we do in the 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.380
 griddle 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.250
 I do not want to talk much about the 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.250
 salt because 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.630
 but I hope it's a selection 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.780
 strong 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.610
 that is respected 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:29.040
 because paraguay when I speak of paraguay 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.230
 when I observed Paraguay during all 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.520
 the previous time 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.640
 pasadena 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.050
 the nation 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.900
 that word respect 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.280
 the whole session for the easiest thing 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.980
 it's how a seal is like a brand 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.079
 own 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.579
 in Paraguayan soccer the soccer player 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.650
 Paraguayan then I 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:04.650
 I intend to xalapa moral 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:06.940
 that the first thing that is justly achieved 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.850
 if we started to start 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.510
 all the courts here and outside wants 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.470
 say that Paraguay already has something of the 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.220
 that is very important to me 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.260
 and from there good can fly 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.310
 that's enough to think about a tris 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.700
 Argentine moment 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.600
 I do not think that they do not assure you 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.540
 evidently limiting a 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.900
 very high percentage the possibility of 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.900
 up already 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.260
 Argentina 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.610
 nine months the club has others another 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.590
 important picture that can win you 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.470
 team match can win you 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.120
 but obviously what 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.120
 in the retina 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.180
 in general terms 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.980
 I tell you what 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.190
 the two parties are different highlight 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.370
 that they do not know they do not imagine everything 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.370
 what 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.819
 Argentina already and the Argentine team and its 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.950
 current form venezuela here 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.260
 the Venezuelan team and its way of playing 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.139
 because there is also a close background 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.359
 recent games usually draw out 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:28.579
 minus four Colombians throughout the 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.579
 Uruguay and look at two places 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.860
 It is very complicated 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.200
 so they are different parties the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.910
 we have to face surely of 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.110
 different way but good the first 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.960
 it is argentina as it appears and then 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.430
 also come to Venezuela and 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.680
 we are working imagining and 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:54.360
 analyzing absolutely everything that is 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.640
 so in everything that is 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.550
 we plan games we are 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.580
 doing daily at this time I 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.690
 I got off the ladder I'm working 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.690
 We are working together 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.390
 the six points you can say that if 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.750
 we achieved 40 also only the person the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.750
 selection 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.710
 if we get 4 tied with Argentina 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.270
 and winning the mentions is good 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.460
 upside down not so much 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.460
 why not be a great director
