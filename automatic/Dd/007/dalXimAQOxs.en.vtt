is another fantastic mass filler for the

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.890 
is another fantastic mass filler for the
upper<00:01:40.090> chest<00:01:40.300> so<00:01:40.510> I'm<00:01:40.570> going<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:40.720> demonstrate

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900

upper chest so I'm going to demonstrate
how<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.290> do<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.729> it's<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:48.940> lot<00:01:49.060> more<00:01:49.090> stable

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
how to do it and it's a lot more stable

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.300 
how to do it and it's a lot more stable
than<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.990> regular<00:01:50.380> inclined<00:01:50.680> bench<00:01:50.860> press<00:01:51.190> so

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
than the regular inclined bench press so

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.560 
than the regular inclined bench press so
you<00:01:51.369> should<00:01:51.580> be<00:01:51.670> able<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.820> go<00:01:51.940> really<00:01:52.240> heavy<00:01:52.360> on

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
you should be able to go really heavy on

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.180 
you should be able to go really heavy on
this<00:01:52.720> build<00:01:53.080> some<00:01:53.290> great<00:01:53.410> mass<00:01:53.710> in<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.010> upper

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190

motion the whole time a lot of guys in
their<00:02:02.530> bench<00:02:02.710> pressing<00:02:03.130> will<00:02:03.280> stop<00:02:03.520> at<00:02:03.670> the

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
their bench pressing will stop at the

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.460 
their bench pressing will stop at the
top<00:02:03.940> like<00:02:04.149> this<00:02:04.270> in<00:02:04.450> your<00:02:04.540> recipe<00:02:04.840> few<00:02:05.050> seconds
