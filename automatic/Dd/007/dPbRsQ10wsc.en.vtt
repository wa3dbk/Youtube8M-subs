demonstration of a new way came up to

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.080 
demonstration of a new way came up to
use<00:00:12.500> some<00:00:13.070> compression<00:00:13.340> wrap<00:00:13.580> so<00:00:13.880> the<00:00:13.969> edge<00:00:14.059> of

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
use some compression wrap so the edge of

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.299 
use some compression wrap so the edge of
mobility<00:00:14.389> bands<00:00:14.780> it's<00:00:15.679> a<00:00:15.740> mag<00:00:15.920> here<00:00:16.099> are<00:00:16.189> some

wrap<00:00:42.829> it<00:00:42.980> before<00:00:43.070> I'd<00:00:43.370> say<00:00:43.579> if<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.760> makes<00:00:43.940> a

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
wrap it before I'd say if that makes a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.639 
wrap it before I'd say if that makes a
difference<00:00:46.839> because<00:00:47.839> at<00:00:48.109> it<00:00:48.260> there's<00:00:48.499> not<00:00:48.620> a

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
difference because at it there's not a

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.989 
difference because at it there's not a

in<00:01:16.070> general<00:01:16.100> what<00:01:16.640> we're<00:01:16.820> looking<00:01:17.060> for<00:01:17.090> is

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
in general what we're looking for is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.800 
in general what we're looking for is
just<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:18.020> get<00:01:18.980> some<00:01:19.160> skin<00:01:19.670> movement<00:01:20.210> here<00:01:20.570> and

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
just to get some skin movement here and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.730 
just to get some skin movement here and
stimulates<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:22.070> lot<00:01:23.060> of<00:01:23.150> receptors<00:01:23.720> to<00:01:24.590> give

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
stimulates a lot of receptors to give

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.680 
stimulates a lot of receptors to give
that<00:01:24.920> great<00:01:25.250> information<00:01:25.550> so<00:01:26.180> it<00:01:26.270> can<00:01:26.390> release

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
that great information so it can release

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.990 
that great information so it can release
the<00:01:26.900> lock<00:01:27.140> down<00:01:27.170> on<00:01:27.560> this<00:01:27.740> motion<00:01:28.010> that's

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
the lock down on this motion that's

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.380 
the lock down on this motion that's
assuming<00:01:29.300> he<00:01:29.690> doesn't<00:01:29.810> have<00:01:30.080> any<00:01:31.070> true<00:01:31.760> joint

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
assuming he doesn't have any true joint

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.170 
assuming he doesn't have any true joint
mobility<00:01:32.750> issues<00:01:33.440> or<00:01:33.730> he's<00:01:34.730> not<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:34.910> slow

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180

mobility issues or he's not a slow
responder<00:01:35.510> in<00:01:36.230> terms<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.710> actual<00:01:37.100> form<00:01:37.400> or

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
responder in terms of actual form or

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:49.300 
responder in terms of actual form or
wrist<00:01:38.120> mobility

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.710 

definitely<00:01:50.310> more<00:01:50.460> extension<00:01:50.940> here<00:01:51.150> because<00:01:51.600> I

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
definitely more extension here because I

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.270 
definitely more extension here because I
feel<00:01:51.900> bad<00:01:52.890> yeah<00:01:53.400> so<00:01:54.300> there's<00:01:55.140> definitely<00:01:55.890> more

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
feel bad yeah so there's definitely more

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.980 
feel bad yeah so there's definitely more
extension<00:01:56.760> he<00:01:56.880> only<00:01:57.000> had<00:01:57.240> maybe<00:01:57.480> about<00:01:57.720> five

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
extension he only had maybe about five

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.050 
extension he only had maybe about five
times<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.290> grazer<00:01:58.530> wrist<00:01:58.830> extension<00:01:59.190> he<00:01:59.910> has

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
times a grazer wrist extension he has

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.800 
times a grazer wrist extension he has
more<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.230> they<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.470> definitely<00:02:01.770> keep<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.130> on

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
more so they can definitely keep this on

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.010 
more so they can definitely keep this on
some<00:02:03.810> variations<00:02:04.410> again<00:02:05.280> since<00:02:05.780> much<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.810> what

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
some variations again since much of what

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.440 
some variations again since much of what
we<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.890> very<00:02:08.009> similar<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.399> taping<00:02:08.910> much<00:02:09.300> of

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
we do so very similar to taping much of

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.700 
we do so very similar to taping much of
what<00:02:09.570> we<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.170> actually<00:02:11.120> just<00:02:12.590> since<00:02:13.590> a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
what we do is actually just since a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.890 
what we do is actually just since a
sensation<00:02:14.580> through<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> skin<00:02:15.150> skin

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
sensation through the skin skin

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.630 
sensation through the skin skin
movements<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.590> skin<00:02:16.830> lifting<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.460> case

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
movements and skin lifting in this case

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.260 
movements and skin lifting in this case
it's<00:02:17.850> compression<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.110> i<00:02:19.640> can<00:02:20.640> actually<00:02:20.970> take

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
it's compression so i can actually take

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.140 
it's compression so i can actually take
his<00:02:21.840> skin<00:02:22.290> as<00:02:22.470> its<00:02:23.040> compressed<00:02:23.520> as<00:02:23.820> i'm<00:02:24.090> doing

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
his skin as its compressed as i'm doing

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.720 
his skin as its compressed as i'm doing
the<00:02:24.330> median<00:02:24.720> nerve<00:02:24.930> glide<00:02:25.470> i<00:02:25.830> can<00:02:26.550> actually

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
the median nerve glide i can actually

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.280 
the median nerve glide i can actually
pull<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.420> opposite<00:02:27.690> direction<00:02:27.810> for<00:02:28.230> a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
pull in the opposite direction for a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.390 
pull in the opposite direction for a
little<00:02:28.410> bit<00:02:28.530> more<00:02:28.709> stretch<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.220> let

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
little bit more stretch if you let

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.590 
little bit more stretch if you let
remember<00:02:29.900> because<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:31.260> i<00:02:31.440> was<00:02:31.590> actually<00:02:31.709> doing

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
remember because if i was actually doing

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.010 
remember because if i was actually doing
supination<00:02:33.600> i<00:02:34.050> can<00:02:34.680> twist<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.510> skin<00:02:36.510> under

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
supination i can twist the skin under

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.980 
supination i can twist the skin under
the<00:02:37.050> band<00:02:37.350> in<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> opposite<00:02:38.010> direction<00:02:38.959> or<00:02:39.959> i

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
the band in the opposite direction or i

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.510 
the band in the opposite direction or i
can<00:02:40.110> kind<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.350> combine<00:02:40.590> those<00:02:40.890> techniques<00:02:41.310> for

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
can kind of combine those techniques for

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.310 
can kind of combine those techniques for
a<00:02:41.580> little<00:02:41.730> bit<00:02:41.910> more<00:02:42.180> stretch<00:02:42.480> twist<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
a little bit more stretch twist the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.420 
a little bit more stretch twist the
opposite<00:02:43.680> direction<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.310> also<00:02:44.970> pull<00:02:46.430> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
opposite direction and also pull you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.220 
opposite direction and also pull you
feel<00:02:47.610> stretch<00:02:47.820> with<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.120> yeah<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.110> i'm

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
feel stretch with that yeah so that i'm

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.490 
feel stretch with that yeah so that i'm
just<00:02:49.440> doing<00:02:49.740> a<00:02:49.980> tissue<00:02:50.550> mobilization<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.750> a

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
just doing a tissue mobilization and a

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:15.540 
just doing a tissue mobilization and a
kind<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:53.040> twist<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:57.590> let's<00:02:58.590> bun<00:02:58.800> wrap

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.860 

here<00:03:16.550> we<00:03:16.820> will<00:03:17.860> do<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:19.420> post-test<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.630> again

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
here we will do a post-test and again

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.710 
here we will do a post-test and again
I've<00:03:21.830> uses<00:03:22.160> on<00:03:22.280> supper<00:03:22.550> other<00:03:22.760> patients<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:23.480> use

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
I've uses on supper other patients I use

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.590 
I've uses on supper other patients I use
this<00:03:23.840> on<00:03:23.990> myself<00:03:24.170> a<00:03:24.800> lot<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.340> times<00:03:25.550> if<00:03:26.540> you

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
this on myself a lot of times if you

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.270 
this on myself a lot of times if you
have<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> very<00:03:27.080> very<00:03:27.320> comfortable<00:03:27.500> paresthesia

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
have a very very comfortable paresthesia

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.570 
have a very very comfortable paresthesia
this<00:03:28.970> actually<00:03:29.510> reduces<00:03:30.320> that<00:03:30.560> we're<00:03:31.370> almost

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
this actually reduces that we're almost

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.270 
this actually reduces that we're almost
eliminated<00:03:32.240> in<00:03:32.510> some<00:03:32.690> cases<00:03:32.950> thus<00:03:33.950> the

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
eliminated in some cases thus the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.100 
eliminated in some cases thus the
movement<00:03:34.940> itself<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.480> narrow<00:03:35.690> dynamic

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
movement itself the narrow dynamic

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.660 
movement itself the narrow dynamic
movement<00:03:36.440> itself<00:03:36.680> is<00:03:36.890> much<00:03:37.070> more<00:03:37.220> comfortable

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
movement itself is much more comfortable

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.550 
movement itself is much more comfortable
and<00:03:38.180> closer<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.630> get<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.930> arrange<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.410> more

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
and closer to get to arrange the more

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.670 
and closer to get to arrange the more
likely<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:40.010> are<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.220> have<00:03:40.820> lasting

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
likely you are to have lasting

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:50.680 
likely you are to have lasting
improvements<00:03:42.680> in<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.400> range<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:43.850> motion<00:03:49.690> so

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
improvements in the range of motion so

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.880 
improvements in the range of motion so
definitely<00:03:51.590> so<00:03:51.950> much<00:03:52.130> better<00:03:52.370> okay<00:03:52.940> mm-hmm

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
definitely so much better okay mm-hmm

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.070 
definitely so much better okay mm-hmm
all<00:03:54.890> right
