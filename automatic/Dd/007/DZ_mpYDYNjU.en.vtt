 these two gadgets the truth is very 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.710
 good for me they 're good they give me some 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.570
 well they work for me I like the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.270
 there are really people who do not like to have 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.490
 this on the desk in here in my case 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.560
 yes I like it but well , I'll come 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.690
 to share and if they are interested then 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.820
 you can download this time 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.900
 I'm going to share this called 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.190
 cpu and well then I like them as they can 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.890
 see them marking the graph as 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.480
 using your cpu let's say if we click 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.850
 here in intel 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.329
 because it gives us all the information of 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.100
 our team completely everything here 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:12.119
 It is like the meter and the network 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.660
 well here for example it gives us what 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.070
 We are using our connection 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.220
 let's say if we are uploading a video 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.440
 from here we can realize how many 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.270
 speed we are going up and also 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.479
 well at the speed that we are going down 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.400
 like this program is useful because 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:34.020
 we can tell if any program 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.930
 is using the internet and good in 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.220
