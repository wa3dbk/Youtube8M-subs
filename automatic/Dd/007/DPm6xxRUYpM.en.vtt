00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
there see that Street it's right over

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.980 
there see that Street it's right over
there<00:01:27.890> that's<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:29.100> car<00:01:29.750> something<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.899> was

yeah<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:16.020> something<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.349> get<00:02:16.500> like<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> real

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
yeah it's something to get like a real

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.580 
yeah it's something to get like a real
accurate<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:18.720> know<00:02:18.840> measurements<00:02:19.349> my<00:02:19.500> eyes

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
accurate you know measurements my eyes

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.860 
accurate you know measurements my eyes
your<00:02:19.709> home<00:02:19.830> like<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.099> be<00:02:20.220> like<00:02:20.340> I've<00:02:20.490> watched

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
six point seven for miles

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.940

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
but I guess I don't have that all right

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.370 
but I guess I don't have that all right
so<00:02:28.950> okay

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
so okay

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.670

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
I'm a little freaked out number of times

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.990 
I'm a little freaked out number of times
