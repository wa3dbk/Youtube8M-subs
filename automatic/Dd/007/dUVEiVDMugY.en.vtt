00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.279 
megapixel has a dual LED flash and let's
see<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.380> could<00:04:49.530> do<00:04:49.680> video<00:04:49.949> at<00:04:50.520> 21<00:04:51.180> 60<00:04:51.690> at<00:04:51.930> 30

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
see it could do video at 21 60 at 30

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.920 
see it could do video at 21 60 at 30
frames<00:04:52.560> per<00:04:52.650> second<00:04:53.130> or<00:04:53.340> 1080p<00:04:54.060> at<00:04:54.509> 30<00:04:54.840> frames

per<00:04:55.350> second<00:04:55.940> another<00:04:56.940> unique<00:04:57.180> thing<00:04:57.240> about

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
per second another unique thing about

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.390 
per second another unique thing about
this<00:04:58.620> phone<00:04:58.919> you<00:04:59.310> could<00:05:00.180> turn<00:05:00.419> it<00:05:00.660> on<00:05:01.220> from<00:05:02.220> the

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
this phone you could turn it on from the

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.120 
this phone you could turn it on from the
back<00:05:02.639> this<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.690> power<00:05:03.900> button<00:05:04.050> so<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:04.830> guess

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
back this is the power button so I guess

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.520 
back this is the power button so I guess
they<00:05:05.280> placed<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.729> there<00:05:06.020> because<00:05:07.020> they<00:05:07.320> found

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
they placed it there because they found

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.620 
they placed it there because they found
that<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:08.070> lot<00:05:08.580> of<00:05:08.610> people<00:05:09.030> hold<00:05:09.210> their<00:05:09.389> phones

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
that a lot of people hold their phones

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.680 
that a lot of people hold their phones
like<00:05:09.780> this<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.320> so<00:05:11.310> my<00:05:11.930> index<00:05:12.930> finger<00:05:13.760> is<00:05:14.760> on

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
like this and so my index finger is on

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
like this and so my index finger is on
it<00:05:16.410> so<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:16.949> could<00:05:17.190> press<00:05:17.940> it<00:05:18.090> to<00:05:18.210> turn<00:05:18.449> on<00:05:18.710> see

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
it so you could press it to turn on see

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.050 
it so you could press it to turn on see
they've<00:05:20.639> also<00:05:20.880> placed<00:05:21.449> the<00:05:21.930> volume<00:05:22.440> buttons

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
they've also placed the volume buttons

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.760 
they've also placed the volume buttons
above<00:05:24.060> and<00:05:24.300> below<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:24.660> power<00:05:25.080> button<00:05:25.699> so

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
above and below the power button so

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.939 
above and below the power button so
there<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.860> go<00:05:29.070> climb<00:05:29.639> down<00:05:29.880> volume<00:05:30.330> up<00:05:30.690> on<00:05:31.020> the

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949 
there you go climb down volume up on the

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
5s my iPhone 5s so I guess the quad-core

5s my iPhone 5s so I guess the quad-core
processor<00:06:17.070> just<00:06:17.099> uses<00:06:18.060> up<00:06:18.210> more<00:06:18.419> power<00:06:19.039> the

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
processor just uses up more power the

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.320 
processor just uses up more power the
cool<00:06:20.280> thing<00:06:20.610> with<00:06:21.000> having<00:06:21.930> a<00:06:22.110> larger<00:06:22.650> screen

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330

especially an Android device is the
multi<00:06:30.979> multitasking<00:06:31.979> so<00:06:32.760> this<00:06:33.389> one<00:06:33.690> you<00:06:34.530> could

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
multi multitasking so this one you could
