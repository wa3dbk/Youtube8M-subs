00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.630
 hello very good without it serving as 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.400
 precedent today we bring the analysis of 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.290
 a terminal but of this that I have here 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.969
 in my little doll it's about the fidh 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.019
 views released a few months ago but 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.000
 that we wanted to take advantage of 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.680
 analyze and see how it works with the 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.230
 application that fitbit also launched for 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.220
 when it was relatively recently before 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.900
 to start I will answer those that 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.240
 sure many will be asking what 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.130
 It is what serves the sign making 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.660
 well the face visit us more 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.910
 less than a bracelet that monitors 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.640
 our daily physical activity watching 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.230
 aspects how passos floors up on 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.450
 time you 've been active in calories 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.880
 burned distance and even quality 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.030
 of sleep all these functions after two 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.829
 weeks of use can ensure that the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.540
 makes quite accurately even 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.040
 last since it is capable of a way 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.440
 amazing to detect the time that I 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.180
 the bed goes and I woke up has 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.890
 a small screen as you see I used to 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.270
 the one in which we can also see the 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.100
 something that I appreciate that they have 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.079
 included and that we can see giving two 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.220
 touches on the same bracelet or 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.570
 by pressing the button that you have on the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.550
 further wherein lateral as 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.019
 let's go pressing on it too 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.820
 we will see the different aspects that I have 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.930
 commented before as steps calories and 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.610
 the rest 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.930
 It is also possible to configure alarms for 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.310
 for example, waking up 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.580
 silent with the vibration of the 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.690
 bracelet but that until I get used to 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.890
 he assured that it is a one sensation a little 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.690
 agonizing because it seems that I 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.130
 They tightened the wrist but as I say 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.630
 it was only those first days 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.820
 We will also receive the violation 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.620
 when when for example what do we do 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.050
 our goal of steps or kilometers 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.240
 fixed and finally all the functions 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.430
 to register an exercise session 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.750
 timed independently that 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.490
 we can do by holding down the 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.900
 side button until it vibrates and that 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.270
 we will press again when we have 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.619
 finished that activity we already know 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.300
 what it is now time to see what 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.310
 are the building materials of 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.340
 this facebook charts the bracelet in this 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.080
 case this is made of a material 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.490
 similar to that of the belts of the 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.250
 sports watches called by the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.780
 deficits like flexible elastomer but 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.610
 which is nothing more than a rough plastic 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.500
 good quality the truth also has 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.119
 with a metallic touch on the part of the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.259
 outer part of the coupling that I liked 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.540
 at the beginning so that as we 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.100
 the days passed I realized that no 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.200
 it was as well embedded as you can 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.580
 check for yourselves something that 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.620
 it did not give me a good feeling of 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.120
 construction of the bracelet the closure 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.080
 also stainless steel and after these 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.760
 testing days as it ensures 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.890
 it's quite safe thanks to the two 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.150
 small metal hooks so 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.200
 quite complicated that we can 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.210
 open so easily 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.040
 The fiber is available in several 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.810
 several small sizes big yours 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.550
 big and we can also find it 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.770
 on the feedback page in several 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.260
 colors bordeaux blue shades or as the 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.880
 that I have in black to do this 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
 section, it must be recognized that the 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.210
 device is like doll 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.640
 pleasant to the touch and quite easy to 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.290
 using the date as said before is a 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.790
 a bracelet that measures physical activity 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.900
 so if we sweat low of 8 you do not go 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.060
 to have no problem because it is 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.500
 Water resistant will not either 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.900
 necessary to take off the seven low wash 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.370
 hands or shower process 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.220
 synchronizes automatically and in a way 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.900
 wireless via bluetooth 4.0 and that 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.090
 we can use in an android terminal 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.010
 ios and obviously in our windows 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.170
 phone one of the fundamental challenges of 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.490
 the record is undoubtedly his firm battery and 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.709
 promises an autonomy of up to seven 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.720
 days in something that could confirm 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.340
 in my case it even arrived at eight days 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.410
 and that it gave him a lot of use 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.180
 intensive all these days now 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.010
 for the moment they showed how they are collected 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.620
 all that data that collects the chips 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.570
 in the application that the office beat to 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.110
 end of January for the platform 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.110
 windows 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.240
 even though I just said that it was 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.710
 released at the end of January the version 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.660
 for windows the summer was launched 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.220
 happened so I wanted to refer that 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.260
 it was at the end of January when it appeared 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.760
 as a universal application while 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.790
 also available the history windows 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.770
 now we are going with the application to 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.390
 get in 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.950
 once inside we see that the application 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.620
 It has a pretty nice design and 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.210
 minimalist where the protagonist without 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.550
 doubt the graphics like the ones we see 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.170
 Here we find what 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.690
 the steps that I have done throughout this 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.340
 week but we can also find 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.370
 the kilometers the calories burned the 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.240
 plants climbed minutes of activity 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.240
 and also the hours of sleep 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.049
 as you see we will see regular meeting if we 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.849
 we go to one of them we can see in the 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.579
 sleep statistics the time that 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.900
 I needed to sleep abc restless or 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.900
 I wake up sometimes 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.250
 if we slide to the right 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.630
 We found to share with friends 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.620
 that we can search through facebook 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.620
 or via e - mail 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.849
 here we find the challenges and also 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.540
 to share with friends that 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.340
 let's have 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.390
 and in such a way we can register 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.820
 exercise that we can record 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.820
 manually for example weights 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.370
 but we can also monitor a 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:57.210
 exercise the walk a walk 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.610
 set an alarm like I said 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.289
 before, even if it's a bit tasteful 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.300
 the first days 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.669
 King after the dream record a food 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.939
 that we can do it manually or 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.569
 through a photograph an email to a 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.569
 barcode 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.180
 a little more 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.270
 register the water or register a 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.689
 food also well up here the one 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.160
 small look at the application of 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.690
 facebook for windows phones 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.520
 before finishing the necessary analysis 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.650
 talk about your stock price click 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.630
 is available from 130 euros in the 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.890
 own feedback page and Now 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.150
 concludes with the aspects that most 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.190
 I liked the ones in which less than 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.080
 device the best is without a doubt that 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.610
 then the data that the cards collect 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.160
 are really reliable are not the 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.630
 relative to sleep as I said at the beginning 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.520
 other times another positive aspect of your 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.650
 battery that reaches even 7 days 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.060
 of autonomy as I said although there is a 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.400
 small drawback and that is that 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.470
 it's a microusb connector but a 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.910
 own charger find aspects 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.410
 negative of the device to start 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.700
 for the screen that although it looks great 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.080
 in my case the stretch has been rotated 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.760
 to the left something that I think 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.740
 quite strange and a little annoying 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.090
 second its price since to me 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.800
 personally, I find it expensive for 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.260
 just perform a monitoring of the 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.840
 physical activity in my case would be with 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.030
 the model that starts fitbit church h of 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.010
 that for only a few more has 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.780
 heart rate sensor little more up 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.190
 that the deficit device analysis 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.170
 I hope you liked it and you will tell me 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.400
 in the comments as well as any 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.229
 another question or question about pizzas 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.979
 nothing else we will see each other again 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.979
 see you soon
