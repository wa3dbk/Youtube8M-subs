00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
to have 302 damage so it's inherently

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.479 
to have 302 damage so it's inherently

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
about the crucible so they have this new

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.130 
about the crucible so they have this new
thing<00:03:57.519> called<00:03:57.549> slaughter<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.510> here<00:03:58.959> are<00:03:59.109> the

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
thing called slaughter and here are the

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.559 
thing called slaughter and here are the
rules<00:03:59.470> it's<00:03:59.890> live<00:04:00.190> right<00:04:00.220> now<00:04:00.880> actually<00:04:01.120> and

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
rules it's live right now actually and

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.960 
rules it's live right now actually and
in<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.260> event<00:04:02.380> of<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.799> massacre<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:03.519> guess<00:04:03.790> that

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
in the event of a massacre I guess that

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.640 
in the event of a massacre I guess that
means<00:04:04.120> one<00:04:04.390> team<00:04:04.660> just<00:04:04.900> blows<00:04:05.200> out<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.440> other

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
means one team just blows out the other

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.860 
means one team just blows out the other
team<00:04:05.890> all<00:04:06.100> parties<00:04:06.910> are<00:04:06.940> returned<00:04:07.420> to<00:04:07.569> orbit

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
team all parties are returned to orbit

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.199 
team all parties are returned to orbit
at<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.380> conclusion<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.250> match<00:04:09.489> so<00:04:09.819> it's

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
at the conclusion of the match so it's

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.699 
at the conclusion of the match so it's
kind<00:04:10.389> of<00:04:10.420> like<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:10.600> make<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.079> take<00:04:11.319> it<00:04:11.470> thing

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
kind of like I make it take it thing

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.160 
kind of like I make it take it thing
like<00:04:11.980> if<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.549> get<00:04:12.730> destroyed<00:04:13.150> it's<00:04:13.600> you're

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
like if you get destroyed it's you're

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.900 
like if you get destroyed it's you're
not<00:04:14.290> going<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.530> keep<00:04:14.769> playing<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.310> same<00:04:15.340> bad

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
not going to keep playing the same bad

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.640 
not going to keep playing the same bad
enemy<00:04:16.389> you're<00:04:16.600> gonna<00:04:16.690> find<00:04:16.989> another<00:04:17.320> match

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
enemy you're gonna find another match

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.250 
there and same goes for the winter so
team-based<00:04:20.889> playlists<00:04:21.700> are<00:04:21.880> going<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.900> be<00:04:23.020> in

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
team-based playlists are going to be in

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.770 
team-based playlists are going to be in
this<00:04:23.470> kind<00:04:23.740> of<00:04:23.770> slaughter<00:04:24.159> event<00:04:25.060> here<00:04:25.330> if<00:04:25.450> one

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
this kind of slaughter event here if one

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.420 
this kind of slaughter event here if one
team<00:04:26.110> is<00:04:26.320> grossly<00:04:26.590> under<00:04:26.950> poor

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
team is grossly under poor

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.680 
team is grossly under poor
underperforming<00:04:28.090> so<00:04:28.270> they're<00:04:28.419> getting

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
underperforming so they're getting

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.740 
underperforming so they're getting
destroyed<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:30.250> session<00:04:30.639> is<00:04:30.759> dissolved<00:04:31.570> in

destroyed the session is dissolved in
favor<00:04:32.259> of<00:04:32.410> matchmaking<00:04:33.130> which<00:04:33.400> sounds<00:04:33.850> like

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
favor of matchmaking which sounds like

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.850 
favor of matchmaking which sounds like
there's<00:04:34.539> some<00:04:34.630> kind<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:34.990> tipping<00:04:35.470> point<00:04:35.680> some

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949

coming<00:05:33.190> back<00:05:33.370> Lord<00:05:33.729> Saladin<00:05:34.210> returned<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:35.199> the

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
coming back Lord Saladin returned to the

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.529 
coming back Lord Saladin returned to the
tower<00:05:35.530> on<00:05:35.830> December<00:05:36.400> 16th<00:05:36.880> which<00:05:37.090> is<00:05:37.240> a<00:05:37.270> week

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
tower on December 16th which is a week

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.110 
tower on December 16th which is a week
from<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:38.470> dark<00:05:38.710> below<00:05:38.889> launch<00:05:39.340> so<00:05:39.970> I<00:05:40.000> think

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
from the dark below launch so I think

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.560 
from the dark below launch so I think
that's<00:05:40.590> 11<00:05:41.590> days<00:05:41.770> away<00:05:41.949> and<00:05:42.310> he'll<00:05:42.760> reset<00:05:43.360> the

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
that's 11 days away and he'll reset the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.300 
that's 11 days away and he'll reset the
event<00:05:43.900> standings<00:05:44.440> just<00:05:44.620> like<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:44.830> new<00:05:45.070> season

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
event standings just like a new season

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.730 
event standings just like a new season
so<00:05:45.729> the<00:05:45.820> reps<00:05:46.030> going<00:05:46.240> to<00:05:46.300> be<00:05:46.419> reset<00:05:46.870> he'll<00:05:47.440> give

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
so the reps going to be reset he'll give

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.529 
so the reps going to be reset he'll give
you<00:05:47.949> level<00:05:48.520> 31<00:05:49.120> inventory<00:05:49.720> so<00:05:50.440> that<00:05:50.680> is<00:05:50.860> really

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
you level 31 inventory so that is really

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.060 
you level 31 inventory so that is really
interesting<00:05:52.539> there<00:05:52.720> it's<00:05:52.840> not<00:05:52.990> 32<00:05:53.289> it's<00:05:53.590> 31

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
interesting there it's not 32 it's 31

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.379 
interesting there it's not 32 it's 31
and<00:05:54.340> I<00:05:54.490> think<00:05:54.550> that's<00:05:54.760> because<00:05:54.909> they're<00:05:55.210> not

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
and I think that's because they're not

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.200 
and I think that's because they're not
releasing<00:05:55.690> the<00:05:55.900> hard<00:05:56.229> mode<00:05:56.440> raid<00:05:57.280> yet<00:05:58.000> on
