our controller review is the scuf gaming

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.890 
our controller review is the scuf gaming
control<00:00:10.320> FBS<00:00:11.010> competition<00:00:11.969> with<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> wired

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
control FBS competition with a wired

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.230 
control FBS competition with a wired
controller<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.679> think<00:00:13.980> at<00:00:14.250> least<00:00:14.429> amber<00:00:14.969> we're

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
controller I think at least amber we're

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.510 
controller I think at least amber we're
gonna<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> little<00:00:15.990> review<00:00:16.320> today<00:00:16.859> alright

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
gonna do a little review today alright

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.029 
gonna do a little review today alright
so<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.660> upside<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.289> pretty<00:00:19.529> much<00:00:19.710> looks

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
so on the upside this pretty much looks

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.429 
so on the upside this pretty much looks
like<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> regular<00:00:20.789> controller<00:00:21.359> even<00:00:22.140> though<00:00:22.260> it

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
like a regular controller even though it

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.099 
like a regular controller even though it
actually<00:00:22.650> does<00:00:23.420> regenerate<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> little<00:00:24.930> less

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
actually does regenerate a little less

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.990 
actually does regenerate a little less
dirt<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.710> think<00:00:25.980> because<00:00:26.279> he<00:00:26.400> got<00:00:26.550> like<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
dirt I think because he got like and

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.089 
dirt I think because he got like and
aunt<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.779> sweat<00:00:28.109> grip<00:00:28.500> or<00:00:28.740> something<00:00:29.039> like

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
aunt the sweat grip or something like

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.980 
aunt the sweat grip or something like
that<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.369> material<00:00:30.210> here<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.420> can't<00:00:30.750> really

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
that or material here I can't really

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.290 
that or material here I can't really
notice<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.949> will<00:00:32.130> regenerate<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
notice it but it will regenerate a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.900 
notice it but it will regenerate a
little<00:00:33.690> less<00:00:33.899> dirtier<00:00:34.590> got<00:00:35.190> my<00:00:35.280> if<00:00:35.430> best<00:00:35.700> free

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
little less dirtier got my if best free

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.910 
little less dirtier got my if best free
cure<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.420> if<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.570> don't<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.230> you

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
cure so if you don't have that then you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.139 
cure so if you don't have that then you
know<00:00:38.010> I'll<00:00:38.100> never<00:00:38.129> mind<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.700> it's<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
know I'll never mind that it's just a

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.540 
know I'll never mind that it's just a
little<00:00:39.450> makes<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.350> longer<00:00:40.590> pretty<00:00:41.040> much<00:00:41.190> like

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
little makes it longer pretty much like

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.639 
little makes it longer pretty much like
my<00:00:41.700> penis<00:00:41.940> okay<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.930> see<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:43.350> these<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
my penis okay so you see here these a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.830 
my penis okay so you see here these a
little<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.160> little<00:00:44.550> lamb<00:00:44.760> additions<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
little like little lamb additions on the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.110 
little like little lamb additions on the
trigger<00:00:46.140> buttons<00:00:46.620> which<00:00:46.890> pretty<00:00:47.610> much<00:00:47.700> makes

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
trigger buttons which pretty much makes

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.229 
trigger buttons which pretty much makes
you<00:00:48.329> able<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:49.129> say<00:00:50.129> my<00:00:50.280> auto<00:00:50.489> fire<00:00:50.820> more

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
you able to say my auto fire more

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.540 
you able to say my auto fire more
rapidly<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.770> kind<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.370> like

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
rapidly and that you can kind of be like

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.600 
rapidly and that you can kind of be like
this<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.960> here<00:00:55.280> you<00:00:56.280> don't<00:00:56.399> have

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
this so as you see here you don't have

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.790 
this so as you see here you don't have
to<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:56.879> all<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.149> way<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.960> these<00:00:58.379> kind<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
to go all the way in and these kind of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.590 
to go all the way in and these kind of
stops<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.280> from<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.579> all<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> way<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
stops you from going all the way in and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.229 
stops you from going all the way in and
then<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.070> find<00:01:02.280> more<00:01:02.460> rapidly<00:01:02.879> like

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
then you can find more rapidly like

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.080 
then you can find more rapidly like
semi-auto<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.589> with<00:01:04.949> these<00:01:05.129> little<00:01:05.460> like

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
semi-auto so with these little like

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.980 
semi-auto so with these little like
screw<00:01:06.630> buttons<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.650> adjust<00:01:07.770> how

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
screw buttons here you can adjust how

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.500 
screw buttons here you can adjust how
how<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> trigger<00:01:10.470> button<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.280> goes<00:01:12.180> into

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
how the trigger button like goes into

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.240 
how the trigger button like goes into
your<00:01:12.570> controller<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.290> how<00:01:13.500> long<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.070> goes

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
your controller like how long it goes

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.010 
your controller like how long it goes
into<00:01:14.520> your<00:01:14.610> control<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.869> like

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
into your control you can have it like

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.499 
into your control you can have it like
this<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.390> this

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
this and you can have like this and this

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.270 
this and you can have like this and this
and<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.259> adjust<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:19.890> I've<00:01:20.040> got

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and this you can adjust it and I've got

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.749 
and this you can adjust it and I've got
mine<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> maximum<00:01:22.610> furthest<00:01:23.610> away

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
mine on like the maximum furthest away

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
mine on like the maximum furthest away
from<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.330> actual<00:01:24.600> controller<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.500> i<00:01:25.799> don't

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
from the actual controller so i don't

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.429 
from the actual controller so i don't
really<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:28.290> this

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
really like that but it's a I think this

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.039 
really like that but it's a I think this
like<00:01:30.020> setting<00:01:31.020> suits<00:01:31.290> me<00:01:31.500> pretty<00:01:31.829> nicely<00:01:32.220> and

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
like setting suits me pretty nicely and

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.840 
like setting suits me pretty nicely and
and<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.619> see<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:35.130> these<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.579> like

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and as you can see here these are like

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.600 
and as you can see here these are like
two<00:01:36.180> rectangular<00:01:36.869> big<00:01:37.619> buttons<00:01:38.009> which<00:01:38.310> are

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
two rectangular big buttons which are

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.160 
two rectangular big buttons which are
additional<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> controller<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.990> these

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
additional to controller like these

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.450 
additional to controller like these
aren't<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> actual<00:01:40.920> microsoft

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
aren't on the actual microsoft

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.950 
aren't on the actual microsoft
controller<00:01:41.820> these<00:01:42.090> are<00:01:42.270> only<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> scuf

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
controller these are only on the scuf

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.780 
controller these are only on the scuf
controllers<00:01:43.500> at<00:01:43.649> least<00:01:43.829> from<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.640> know

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
controllers at least from what I know

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.999 
controllers at least from what I know
off<00:01:45.119> about<00:01:45.450> them<00:01:45.750> they're<00:01:46.590> additional

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
off about them they're additional

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.999 
off about them they're additional
bottoms<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.579> them<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:48.930> well<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.710> would

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
bottoms and them I think well this would

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.580 
bottoms and them I think well this would
be<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.369> knife<00:01:50.610> bottom<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.200> would<00:01:52.439> be

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
be the knife bottom so and this would be

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.499 
be the knife bottom so and this would be
the<00:01:52.799> jump<00:01:53.070> button<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.640> when<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.240> hold<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the jump button so when you hold the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.810 
the jump button so when you hold the
control<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.610> got<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
control like this and you got the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.789 
control like this and you got the
buttons<00:01:57.390> underneath<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.990> controller<00:01:58.439> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
buttons underneath this controller you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.700 
buttons underneath this controller you
can<00:01:58.829> come<00:01:59.189> out<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.729> knife<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.200> jump

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
can come out like knife and the jump

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.459 
can come out like knife and the jump
while<00:02:02.070> still<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> knack<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.780> fingers<00:02:04.259> on

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
while still have a knack like fingers on

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.109 
while still have a knack like fingers on
the<00:02:04.680> actual<00:02:04.950> bumper<00:02:05.219> stake<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:05.909> you

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the actual bumper stake here so you

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.490 
the actual bumper stake here so you
don't<00:02:06.299> really<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> leave<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.409> you

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
don't really have to leave it and you

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.109 
don't really have to leave it and you
can<00:02:07.680> still<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.429> takes<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.700> little<00:02:08.849> while

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
can still like it takes a little while

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.609 
can still like it takes a little while
to<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.509> used<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.080> but<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.500> actually

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
to get used to it but you can actually

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.630 
to get used to it but you can actually
panic<00:02:11.220> life

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
panic life

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.760 
panic life

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.750 
that's just so tired of it so I bought
this<00:02:24.150> controller<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:26.160> know<00:02:26.280> now<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.490> can

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
being paid for this alright so the pros

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.630 
being paid for this alright so the pros
