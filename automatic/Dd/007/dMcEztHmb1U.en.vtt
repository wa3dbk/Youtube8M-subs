growing up in Florida my favorite thing
to<00:00:28.310> do<00:00:28.460> was<00:00:28.700> to<00:00:28.730> strap<00:00:29.390> on<00:00:29.420> fins<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.140> a<00:00:30.200> mask

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
to do was to strap on fins and a mask

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.040 
to do was to strap on fins and a mask
and<00:00:30.800> go<00:00:31.280> explore<00:00:31.760> the<00:00:31.880> patch<00:00:32.029> reefs<00:00:34.780> back<00:00:35.780> then

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
and go explore the patch reefs back then

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.869 
and go explore the patch reefs back then
the<00:00:36.199> reefs<00:00:36.350> were<00:00:36.530> healthier<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.220> they<00:00:37.820> were

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
the reefs were healthier and they were

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.010 
the reefs were healthier and they were
filled<00:00:38.300> with<00:00:38.390> fish

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
experience this wandering beauty and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.150 
experience this wandering beauty and
that's<00:00:45.019> why<00:00:45.290> I<00:00:45.320> work<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:45.680> protect<00:00:45.860> these<00:00:46.159> reefs

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.619 

it's<00:00:51.160> easy<00:00:51.460> not<00:00:51.730> to<00:00:51.820> pay<00:00:51.910> attention<00:00:51.940> to<00:00:52.390> things

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
it's easy not to pay attention to things

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.510

that are happening underwater it's hard

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.420 
that are happening underwater it's hard
to<00:00:54.610> see<00:00:54.790> so<00:00:55.600> it's<00:00:56.050> important<00:00:56.770> for<00:00:56.890> us<00:00:56.949> to<00:00:57.220> be

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
to see so it's important for us to be

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.830 
to see so it's important for us to be

parrotfish

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.170 
parrotfish
are<00:01:17.250> important<00:01:18.250> because<00:01:18.369> they<00:01:18.759> graze<00:01:19.000> the

are important because they graze the

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.639 
are important because they graze the
algae<00:01:19.509> off<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.780> reef<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.229> that's<00:01:20.350> how<00:01:20.530> they

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
algae off the reef and that's how they

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:26.100 
algae off the reef and that's how they
protect<00:01:21.009> coral<00:01:23.940> allowing<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:25.270> lot<00:01:25.690> of<00:01:25.720> fishing

for the corals to grow and that's really
