00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and I saw my bald head it was the most

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.910 
and I saw my bald head it was the most
visually<00:02:27.720> jarring<00:02:28.080> thing<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> face<00:02:28.860> of

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
visually jarring thing on the face of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.940 
visually jarring thing on the face of
the<00:02:29.220> earth<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.880> go<00:02:30.030> from<00:02:30.360> long<00:02:30.720> curly<00:02:31.140> hair<00:02:31.170> to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
the earth to go from long curly hair to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.310 
the earth to go from long curly hair to
an<00:02:32.100> immediate<00:02:32.690> drastic<00:02:33.690> change

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
an immediate drastic change

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.680 
an immediate drastic change
I<00:02:34.350> no<00:02:34.620> longer<00:02:34.740> recognized<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:36.060> reflection

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
I no longer recognized the reflection

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.010 
I no longer recognized the reflection
because<00:02:37.560> my<00:02:37.740> hair<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.070> such<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> big<00:02:38.610> part<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.090> me

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
because my hair is such a big part of me

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.290 
because my hair is such a big part of me
not<00:02:40.620> having<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.190> not<00:02:41.250> seeing<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.910> was<00:02:42.060> very

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
not having it not seeing it was very

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.160 
not having it not seeing it was very
weird<00:02:42.740> I<00:02:43.740> also<00:02:44.160> felt<00:02:44.490> very<00:02:44.580> vulnerable<00:02:45.540> and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
weird I also felt very vulnerable and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.610 
weird I also felt very vulnerable and
exposed<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:48.750> just<00:02:48.930> something<00:02:49.230> I've<00:02:49.320> always

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
exposed it's just something I've always

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.320 
exposed it's just something I've always
had<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:51.440> have<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.800> newfound<00:02:53.310> respect<00:02:53.760> for

had and I have a newfound respect for
people<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.960> have<00:02:55.110> alopecia<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:56.430> are<00:02:56.550> going

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
people that have alopecia that are going

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.880 
people that have alopecia that are going
through<00:02:57.240> chemo<00:02:57.930> any<00:02:58.580> sort<00:02:59.580> of<00:03:00.140> hair<00:03:01.140> loss<00:03:01.380> it's

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.390 
through chemo any sort of hair loss it's
an<00:03:02.610> interesting<00:03:03.150> journey<00:03:04.140> for<00:03:04.470> me<00:03:04.770> at<00:03:04.920> least<00:03:04.980> I

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
an interesting journey for me at least I

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.090 
an interesting journey for me at least I
just<00:03:06.000> had<00:03:06.210> all<00:03:06.390> these<00:03:06.570> insecurities<00:03:07.350> even

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
just had all these insecurities even

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.320 
just had all these insecurities even
though<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.190> talked<00:03:08.580> about<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.940> talk<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.300> cheap

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
though I talked about it talk is cheap

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.360

and<00:03:09.780> being<00:03:10.350> about<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.740> is<00:03:10.830> completely

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
and being about it is completely

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.340 
and being about it is completely
different<00:03:11.580> than<00:03:11.790> talking<00:03:12.000> about<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.690> at

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
different than talking about it and at

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
those thoughts still enter I got to get

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.800 
those thoughts still enter I got to get
over<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.250> but<00:03:29.790> those<00:03:29.880> spots<00:03:30.180> entered<00:03:30.480> my<00:03:30.600> mind

over it but those spots entered my mind

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.990 
over it but those spots entered my mind
I<00:03:30.960> felt<00:03:31.170> very<00:03:31.320> vulnerable<00:03:31.560> very<00:03:32.310> weak<00:03:32.610> because

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
I felt very vulnerable very weak because

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.860 
I felt very vulnerable very weak because
the<00:03:33.330> idea<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:34.160> baldness<00:03:35.180> for<00:03:36.180> me<00:03:36.270> I<00:03:36.300> learned<00:03:36.540> is

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
the idea of baldness for me I learned is

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.520 
the idea of baldness for me I learned is
like<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.890> sign<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:39.380> vulnerability<00:03:40.380> and

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
like a sign of vulnerability and

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.460 
like a sign of vulnerability and
weakness<00:03:40.640> when<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.790> have<00:03:42.240> a<00:03:42.270> newborn<00:03:42.480> they're

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
weakness when you have a newborn they're

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.620 
weakness when you have a newborn they're
vulnerable<00:03:44.010> they're<00:03:44.820> bald<00:03:45.209> when<00:03:45.480> you're

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
vulnerable they're bald when you're

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.510 
vulnerable they're bald when you're
aging<00:03:46.140> when<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.350> lose<00:03:46.560> your<00:03:46.680> hair<00:03:46.950> that's

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
aging when you lose your hair that's
