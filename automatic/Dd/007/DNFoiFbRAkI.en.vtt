00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.690
 everything I had there 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.350
 everything that is trusting in front of you will take time but the worst are 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.830
 those advertisements of any type of food 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.039
 there is always going well 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.649

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 ef 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.630
 in fact you can also check when you have not much that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.440
 to invent 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.430
 You do not know what else to do, do you tactical? 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.430
 dying of boredom 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.529

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:15.169
 but in the area clovis has you eating and cetaf metaphor 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.779

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.279
 principle that we take a pot

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:43.089
 very romantic in xerÃ©m from the igas period 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.389
 all the gaps that have seen our body 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.779
 go at the time of the slaughter that come 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.779

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.459
 they will not do it 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.269
 and I predict that in the future everyone will be going around or better eating 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.009
 rhinando at the same time 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.529
