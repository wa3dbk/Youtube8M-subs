00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:03.730 
I want to show you how to assemble the

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.340 
I want to show you how to assemble the
RAM<00:00:04.000> -<00:00:04.330> B<00:00:04.720> -<00:00:05.549> 166<00:00:06.549> looking<00:00:07.270> such<00:00:07.509> an<00:00:07.690> Cup<00:00:07.899> face

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.350 
RAM - B - 166 looking such an Cup face

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.860 
RAM - B - 166 looking such an Cup face
with<00:00:08.680> diamond<00:00:09.100> plate<00:00:09.389> first<00:00:10.389> thing<00:00:10.630> you<00:00:10.690> need

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
with diamond plate first thing you need

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.440 
with diamond plate first thing you need
to<00:00:10.900> do<00:00:11.139> is<00:00:11.710> take<00:00:12.040> the<00:00:12.280> lock<00:00:12.759> and<00:00:12.910> suction<00:00:13.269> cup

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
to do is take the lock and suction cup

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.859 
to do is take the lock and suction cup
base<00:00:13.660> which<00:00:13.929> you<00:00:13.960> see<00:00:14.290> here<00:00:14.620> and<00:00:14.799> connect<00:00:15.869> the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
base which you see here and connect the

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.019 
base which you see here and connect the
diamond<00:00:17.320> plate<00:00:17.500> to<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:17.770> top<00:00:18.009> so<00:00:18.730> what<00:00:18.880> that

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
diamond plate to the top so what that

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.970 
diamond plate to the top so what that
does<00:00:19.270> is<00:00:19.329> gives<00:00:19.689> a<00:00:19.840> mounting<00:00:20.349> base<00:00:20.529> with<00:00:20.950> a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
does is gives a mounting base with a

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.450 
does is gives a mounting base with a
ball<00:00:21.310> to<00:00:21.970> begin<00:00:22.300> your<00:00:22.450> mouth<00:00:22.630> so<00:00:23.380> taking<00:00:24.340> the

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
ball to begin your mouth so taking the

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.400 
ball to begin your mouth so taking the
existing<00:00:24.669> hardware<00:00:25.090> you<00:00:25.660> simply<00:00:26.050> put<00:00:26.259> those

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
existing hardware you simply put those

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.069 
existing hardware you simply put those
through<00:00:26.800> the<00:00:26.860> diamond<00:00:27.220> plate<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:27.930> into<00:00:28.930> the

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
through the diamond plate and into the

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.229 
through the diamond plate and into the
hole<00:00:29.259> that's<00:00:29.619> on<00:00:29.919> the<00:00:30.340> lock<00:00:30.520> and<00:00:30.700> suction<00:00:31.029> cup

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
hole that's on the lock and suction cup

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.550 
hole that's on the lock and suction cup
so<00:00:31.989> there's<00:00:32.169> one<00:00:32.439> and<00:00:33.720> there's<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:35.380> other

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
so there's one and there's the other

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.190 
so there's one and there's the other
I'll<00:00:36.280> just<00:00:36.520> tighten<00:00:36.790> those<00:00:37.000> down

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.780 

and<00:00:41.200> what<00:00:41.320> these<00:00:41.440> do<00:00:41.680> is<00:00:41.710> actually<00:00:42.100> create<00:00:42.580> a

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
and what these do is actually create a

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.820 
and what these do is actually create a
better<00:00:43.090> thread<00:00:43.510> or<00:00:43.780> create<00:00:44.200> the<00:00:44.380> thread<00:00:44.650> as

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
better thread or create the thread as

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.560 
better thread or create the thread as
they're<00:00:45.040> screwed<00:00:45.370> down<00:00:45.520> so<00:00:45.910> initially<00:00:46.450> the

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
they're screwed down so initially the

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.870 
they're screwed down so initially the
hole<00:00:46.720> is<00:00:46.870> a<00:00:46.930> little<00:00:47.170> bit<00:00:47.260> smaller<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:48.550> as<00:00:48.730> you

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
hole is a little bit smaller and as you

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.860 
hole is a little bit smaller and as you
tighten<00:00:49.240> this<00:00:49.300> down

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
tighten this down

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.870 
tighten this down
and<00:00:50.290> just<00:00:50.560> lock<00:00:50.740> this<00:00:50.890> down<00:00:51.130> so<00:00:51.400> it<00:00:51.490> stays<00:00:51.730> in

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
and just lock this down so it stays in

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.000 
and just lock this down so it stays in
place<00:00:52.090> and<00:00:52.450> you<00:00:53.140> tighten<00:00:53.350> this<00:00:53.500> down<00:00:53.560> it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
place and you tighten this down it

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.510 
place and you tighten this down it
creates<00:00:54.460> a<00:00:54.670> thread<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:55.210> grip<00:00:56.040> these<00:00:57.040> screws

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
creates a thread and grip these screws

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.690 
creates a thread and grip these screws
are<00:00:57.790> long<00:00:58.180> enough<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:59.350> go<00:00:59.560> in<00:00:59.770> and<00:00:59.980> still<00:01:00.460> take

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
are long enough to go in and still take

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.000 
are long enough to go in and still take
great<00:01:01.030> hold<00:01:01.360> one<00:01:02.050> thing<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.350> note<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.739> they

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
great hold one thing to note that they

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.250 
great hold one thing to note that they
are<00:01:03.540> just<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:05.110> right<00:01:05.140> size<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.960> smaller

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
are just the right size for this smaller

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.240 
are just the right size for this smaller
ball<00:01:08.620> so<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.159> design<00:01:09.490> for<00:01:09.760> this<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.380> RAM<00:01:11.620> one

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
ball so the design for this the RAM one

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.850 
ball so the design for this the RAM one
inch<00:01:12.460> diameter<00:01:12.760> ball<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:14.020> that's<00:01:14.380> how<00:01:14.680> much

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
inch diameter ball so that's how much

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.980 
inch diameter ball so that's how much
force<00:01:15.550> they<00:01:15.760> can<00:01:15.820> take<00:01:16.180> what<00:01:16.450> connector<00:01:16.870> for

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
force they can take what connector for

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.960 
force they can take what connector for
the<00:01:17.049> diamond<00:01:17.440> plate<00:01:17.620> answer<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.729> suction

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
the diamond plate answer to the suction

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.060 
the diamond plate answer to the suction
cup<00:01:19.240> so<00:01:19.960> that's<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.350> suction<00:01:20.710> cup<00:01:20.890> now

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
cup so that's the suction cup now

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.090 
cup so that's the suction cup now
connected<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:22.180> diamond<00:01:22.840> plate<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:24.040> you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
connected to the diamond plate now you

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.000 
connected to the diamond plate now you
just<00:01:24.549> connect<00:01:24.880> in<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.540> arm<00:01:25.810> which<00:01:26.290> I've<00:01:26.500> the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
just connect in the arm which I've the

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.370 
just connect in the arm which I've the
time<00:01:27.220> so<00:01:27.549> let's<00:01:27.760> just<00:01:27.909> loosen<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.299> off<00:01:28.479> two

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
time so let's just loosen that off two

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.260 
time so let's just loosen that off two
ways<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:29.680> connected<00:01:30.190> it<00:01:30.400> acts<00:01:31.030> like<00:01:31.150> a

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
ways you connected it acts like a

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.950 
ways you connected it acts like a
scissors<00:01:31.860> there<00:01:32.860> or<00:01:33.070> I<00:01:33.670> should<00:01:33.970> say<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.390> peg<00:01:34.659> and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
scissors there or I should say a peg and

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.440 
scissors there or I should say a peg and
that<00:01:35.950> one<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.190> can<00:01:36.310> go<00:01:36.490> over<00:01:36.610> that<00:01:36.729> head<00:01:37.090> or

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
that one you can go over that head or

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.870 
that one you can go over that head or
you<00:01:37.869> can<00:01:38.080> do<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:38.409> way<00:01:38.470> but<00:01:39.369> you<00:01:39.490> can<00:01:39.640> see

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
you can do it this way but you can see

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.420 
you can do it this way but you can see
whichever<00:01:40.210> way<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.450> put<00:01:40.720> on<00:01:40.990> doable<00:01:41.290> grip<00:01:41.740> to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
whichever way you put on doable grip to

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.700 
whichever way you put on doable grip to
one<00:01:42.640> side<00:01:42.970> and<00:01:43.659> then<00:01:43.750> I<00:01:43.780> had<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.200> open<00:01:44.500> socket

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
one side and then I had the open socket

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.980 
one side and then I had the open socket
on<00:01:45.010> the<00:01:45.100> other<00:01:45.250> here<00:01:45.549> just<00:01:46.510> loose<00:01:46.689> enough<00:01:46.960> to

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
on the other here just loose enough to

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.179 
on the other here just loose enough to
put<00:01:47.320> in<00:01:48.600> tighten<00:01:49.600> down<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:50.080> side<00:01:50.350> arm<00:01:50.740> here

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
put in tighten down the side arm here

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.149 
put in tighten down the side arm here
and<00:01:51.400> as<00:01:51.729> you<00:01:51.880> tighten<00:01:52.119> that<00:01:52.450> tighter<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.990> gets

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and as you tighten that tighter it gets

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.740 
and as you tighten that tighter it gets
it<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.369> more<00:01:54.580> grip<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:54.970> has<00:01:55.119> on<00:01:55.299> those<00:01:55.450> balls

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
it the more grip it has on those balls

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.649 
it the more grip it has on those balls
so<00:01:56.080> locking<00:01:57.070> in<00:01:57.159> such<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.369> cut<00:01:57.700> base<00:01:57.939> now<00:01:58.360> I<00:01:58.390> have

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
so locking in such a cut base now I have

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.460 
so locking in such a cut base now I have
two<00:01:59.610> one<00:02:00.610> inch<00:02:00.759> diameter<00:02:01.150> ball<00:02:01.600> joints<00:02:02.140> here

made of marine grade aluminum except the
plastic<00:02:25.719> base<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.650> once<00:02:26.859> you've<00:02:26.980> got<00:02:27.129> it<00:02:27.219> in<00:02:27.370> a

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
plastic base and once you've got it in a

sight<00:02:29.799> on<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.849> that's<00:02:30.969> it<00:02:31.209> it's<00:02:31.420> locked<00:02:31.689> in

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
sight on and that's it it's locked in

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.099 
sight on and that's it it's locked in
place<00:02:32.219> so<00:02:33.219> that's<00:02:34.000> how<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.359> RAM<00:02:34.719> -<00:02:34.989> B<00:02:35.349> -<00:02:36.840> 166<00:02:37.840> is
