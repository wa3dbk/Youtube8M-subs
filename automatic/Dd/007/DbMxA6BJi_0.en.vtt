00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.349
 then it would remain 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.349
 the 3D graphic interface that was introduced for per view though 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.009

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.289
 the small notation to enable are you need a graphics card 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.890
 ancona - on 256 megabytes of memory 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.090

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.610
 the screen opens up to half the previous text 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.460

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.640
