00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.460 
for probably about two years now
I'm<00:01:56.580> not<00:01:56.730> gonna<00:01:56.880> lie<00:01:57.090> they<00:01:57.360> did<00:01:57.690> break<00:01:58.110> once

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
I'm not gonna lie they did break once

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.190 
I'm not gonna lie they did break once
the<00:01:59.460> cord<00:01:59.790> but<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.480> brought<00:02:00.720> them<00:02:00.810> back<00:02:00.870> to<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the cord but I brought them back to the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.070 
the cord but I brought them back to the
store<00:02:01.410> and<00:02:01.470> they<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.280> gave<00:02:02.370> me<00:02:02.430> new<00:02:02.580> ones<00:02:03.080> as

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
store and they just gave me new ones as

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.630 
store and they just gave me new ones as
far<00:02:04.140> as<00:02:04.440> blocking<00:02:04.680> out<00:02:04.920> background<00:02:05.460> noises

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
far as blocking out background noises

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.090 
far as blocking out background noises
I'd<00:02:06.360> say<00:02:06.630> these<00:02:06.930> probably<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.410> an<00:02:07.680> 8<00:02:07.830> out<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:07.980> 10

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
I'd say these probably do an 8 out of 10

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.620 
I'd say these probably do an 8 out of 10
job<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:10.400> don't<00:02:11.400> hear<00:02:11.580> music<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.180> background

I don't hear my workout partner in the

weights<00:02:19.910> if<00:02:20.910> you're<00:02:21.120> worried<00:02:21.420> about<00:02:21.920> if<00:02:22.920> you

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
weights if you're worried about if you

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.500 
weights if you're worried about if you
want<00:02:23.310> headphones<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.760> are<00:02:23.850> gonna<00:02:24.030> block<00:02:24.330> up

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
want headphones that are gonna block up

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.780 
want headphones that are gonna block up
noise<00:02:24.690> completely<00:02:25.290> they<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.340> actually

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
noise completely they have actually

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.360 
noise completely they have actually
recently<00:02:27.060> came<00:02:27.990> out<00:02:28.200> with<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.380> new<00:02:28.560> pair<00:02:28.800> that

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
recently came out with a new pair that

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.590 
recently came out with a new pair that
are<00:02:29.580> noise<00:02:30.360> cancelling<00:02:30.780> however<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.800> cost<00:02:32.040> is

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
are noise cancelling however the cost is

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.860 
are noise cancelling however the cost is
raised<00:02:34.730> these<00:02:35.730> headphones<00:02:36.030> retail<00:02:36.660> about

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
raised these headphones retail about

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.370 
raised these headphones retail about
between<00:02:37.830> I'd<00:02:38.100> say<00:02:38.280> 60<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.770> 129<00:02:40.770> dollars<00:02:42.380> the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
between I'd say 60 to 129 dollars the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.410 
between I'd say 60 to 129 dollars the
noise<00:02:43.650> cancelling<00:02:44.130> ones<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.700> think<00:02:45.240> there<00:02:45.390> are

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
noise cancelling ones I think there are

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.360 
noise cancelling ones I think there are
about<00:02:45.540> 350<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:48.150> mean<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.810> don't<00:02:48.989> think<00:02:49.470> to

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
about 350 so I mean I don't think to

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.979 
about 350 so I mean I don't think to
block<00:02:50.610> out<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> little<00:02:51.030> extra<00:02:51.239> noise<00:02:51.600> it's

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
block out a little extra noise it's

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.930 
block out a little extra noise it's
worth<00:02:52.290> paying<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:53.040> couple<00:02:53.400> hundred<00:02:53.550> dollars

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
worth paying a couple hundred dollars

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.930 
worth paying a couple hundred dollars
extra<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:55.340> couple<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.400> things<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.640> would<00:02:56.760> do<00:02:56.910> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
extra a couple of things I would do to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.300 
extra a couple of things I would do to
make<00:02:57.209> these<00:02:57.450> headphones<00:02:57.660> better<00:02:58.310> would

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
make these headphones better would

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.910 
make these headphones better would
probably<00:02:59.700> be<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.600> make<00:03:00.750> them<00:03:00.870> Wireless<00:03:01.290> they

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
probably be to make them Wireless they

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.740 
probably be to make them Wireless they
do<00:03:01.980> come<00:03:02.190> with<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.370> clip<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.150> clip<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.630> your

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
do come with a clip to clip on your

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.220 
do come with a clip to clip on your
shirt<00:03:03.989> that's<00:03:04.560> really<00:03:04.800> helpful<00:03:05.160> but<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:06.230> would

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
shirt that's really helpful but I would

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.190 
shirt that's really helpful but I would
make<00:03:07.410> them<00:03:07.590> Wireless<00:03:08.810> another<00:03:09.810> thing<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.140> would

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
make them Wireless another thing I would

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.920 
make them Wireless another thing I would
possibly<00:03:10.769> do<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.340> make<00:03:12.090> them<00:03:12.239> noise<00:03:12.420> canceling

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
possibly do is make them noise canceling

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.860 
possibly do is make them noise canceling
however<00:03:13.730> like<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.850> said<00:03:15.090> they<00:03:15.299> they've<00:03:15.630> already

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
however like I said they they've already

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.810 
however like I said they they've already
come<00:03:16.260> up<00:03:16.290> with<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.500> new<00:03:16.680> version<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.610> noise

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
come up with a new version that is noise

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.539 
come up with a new version that is noise
cancelling<00:03:19.040> what<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.070> recommend<00:03:20.459> these

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
cancelling what I recommend these

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.949 
cancelling what I recommend these
headphones<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:21.030> course<00:03:21.360> I'd<00:03:21.480> recommend<00:03:21.870> these

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
headphones of course I'd recommend these

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.590 
headphones of course I'd recommend these
headphones<00:03:22.380> for<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.400> price<00:03:23.760> range<00:03:24.090> you're

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
headphones for the price range you're

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.750 
headphones for the price range you're
not<00:03:24.810> gonna<00:03:24.989> find<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.320> better<00:03:25.350> headphone<00:03:26.160> for

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
not gonna find a better headphone for
