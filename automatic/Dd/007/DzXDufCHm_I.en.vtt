 rival to rich franklin that we already saw 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:20.820
 the faces with him in the past and good 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.310
 you have to watch it especially in the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.510
 first moments of combat because the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.940
 Uncle goes a lot and will try 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.059

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.440
 respect brown belt but if I with 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:53.579
 10 or 11 years old was already a yellow belt 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.370
 karate if you walk and put to pray that you 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.690
 It 's going to take could have put 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.290
 that you know how to sew buttons or what you play 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.650
 the nintendo or that you have spent the dark 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.470
 souls without getting killed but how do you put 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.810
 in a fight for the title of the weights 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.050
 ufc media how do you put yourself 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.370
 brown belt good there we are seeing 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.570
 the presentation of the footprint of the tiger 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.810
 specialist in taekwondo 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.080
 there we see it has gained a great base 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.990
 of fans and won the ultimate tournament 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.800
 fighter and nowadays we are 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:39.550
 champions of the average weights of the ufc 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:43.500
 with two victorious defenses let's see 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.500
 here what happens in the third 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.200
 as always the tiger is in 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.630
 a spectacular way 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.310
 there is the stroll of rigor giving the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.340
 back to rich franklin 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.250
 who is 46 years old and has not bothered 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.759
 in taking off the black belt mother looks 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.800
 what a vague uncle, but if that is already 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.140
 it becomes easy to get out of taking the 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.420
 black belt what a disaster 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.500
 what a mess 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.500
 bruce buffer 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.980
 here we have the Chinese I could gone Chinese 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.200
 cudeiro 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.099
 and well this is going to happen I'm going 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.720
 to pass because we have already seen 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:35.480
 enough times everything ready everything ready 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:40.370
 the third title defense begins 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:44.569
 begins very hesitant Rick Franklin 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.670
 but you are brown belt come come to 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.810

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.750
 face that I give you 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.730
 I'm going to leave you already quite mature 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.730
 after this string of blows 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.710
 come after this fight you have to 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.510

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.360
 that you're going to take off your black belt 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.750

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.610

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.070
 we are cooking on a slow fire 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.340
 rich franklin also knows how to make 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:34.450
 Perfect fried eggs are not part 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:38.670
 never and I do not understand why he has not put 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.860
 that virtue in his presentation 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.020
 he does not let me throw it away and instead he 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.490
 puts that brown belt where I 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.080
 you go 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:51.700
 where are you going with that belt color? 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.520

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.180
 animated to the ground to the ground 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.940
 we have to recover more bad moments 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.640
 moment for that bad moment get up 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.920
 Get up

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.930
 de nes garcía we have gone through a 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.930
 moment a little bit delicate but 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.140
 immediately we have recovered and 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.210
 dodging two hits and putting two 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.630
 Kicking sure and there was the uncle 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:05:02.410
 Grogui was thinking brown belt 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:05.740
 I'm not scary, you're not afraid and good 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:09.249
 you said some that after doing 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:13.160
 several title defenses 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:16.490
 they give the option to gain weight 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.650
 and we will see to see yes 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.650
 if you give us that possibility 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.770
 there is third title defense 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.740
 the brand already only talks about the ufc 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.740

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.820

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.940

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.690
 and thanks to that because right now it 's 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:47.150
 García has sponsors to spare 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.150
 all brands want to sign with him 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:52.879

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.879

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.690
 who Garcia is going to face against 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.570
 a light heavyweight this could be the 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:10.160
 opportunity that we are looking for 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.890
 rank up 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.690

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.810
