going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.820> temper<00:01:45.240> them<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> hot<00:01:46.229> milk

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
going to temper them with the hot milk

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.039 
going to temper them with the hot milk
mixture<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.610> adding<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.119> little<00:01:48.540> bit<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
mixture just adding a little bit of the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.710 
mixture just adding a little bit of the
milk<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> time<00:01:49.950> whisking<00:01:50.460> constantly<00:01:50.720> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
milk at a time whisking constantly to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.429 
milk at a time whisking constantly to
gently<00:01:52.170> warm<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.009> eggs<00:01:53.659> by<00:01:54.659> doing<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.200> we

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
gently warm the eggs by doing this we

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.130 
gently warm the eggs by doing this we
prevent<00:01:55.799> scrambling<00:01:56.549> getting<00:01:57.450> big<00:01:57.659> chunks<00:01:58.049> of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
prevent scrambling getting big chunks of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.800 
prevent scrambling getting big chunks of
gross<00:01:58.439> eggs<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.070> our<00:01:59.159> mixture<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.880> then<00:02:00.659> we

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
gross eggs in our mixture and then we

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.319 
gross eggs in our mixture and then we
can<00:02:00.960> add<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.380> all<00:02:01.619> back<00:02:02.009> into<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.670> pot<00:02:02.909> so

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
can add it all back into the pot so

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.539 
can add it all back into the pot so
adding<00:02:03.930> all<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.500> egg<00:02:04.649> yolks<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.340> cream

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
adding all the egg yolks the cream

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.190 
adding all the egg yolks the cream
everything<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.299> just<00:02:06.509> tempered<00:02:06.899> back

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
everything that we just tempered back

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.770 
everything that we just tempered back
into<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> pot<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.129> I'm<00:02:08.849> going<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.209> cook<00:02:09.479> this

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
into the pot and I'm going to cook this

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.949 
into the pot and I'm going to cook this
over<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> medium<00:02:10.709> heat<00:02:11.220> until<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:12.510> coats<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
over a medium heat until it coats the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.680 
over a medium heat until it coats the
back<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.500> spoon<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:15.000> important<00:02:15.599> to

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
back of the spoon and it is important to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.229 
back of the spoon and it is important to
use<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.410> digital<00:02:17.040> thermometer<00:02:17.370> here<00:02:17.879> because

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
use a digital thermometer here because

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.990 
use a digital thermometer here because
it<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.569> ensures<00:02:18.810> accuracy<00:02:19.739> we<00:02:20.489> want<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.790> cook

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
it just ensures accuracy we want to cook

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000 
it just ensures accuracy we want to cook
it<00:02:21.150> until<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.569> about<00:02:21.980> 175<00:02:22.980> degrees

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
it until it's about 175 degrees

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.199 
it until it's about 175 degrees
Fahrenheit

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
Fahrenheit

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.330 
Fahrenheit
and<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.629> is<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> perfect<00:02:25.260> temperature<00:02:25.709> so

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
and this is a perfect temperature so

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.880 
and this is a perfect temperature so
that<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.700> rich<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.599> creamy<00:02:27.780> it's<00:02:28.560> not<00:02:28.680> too

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
that it's rich and creamy it's not too

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.610 
that it's rich and creamy it's not too
thin<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:29.790> not<00:02:29.970> going<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.660> overcook<00:02:31.230> it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
thin and it's not going to overcook it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.890 
thin and it's not going to overcook it
and<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.760> takes<00:02:33.000> about<00:02:33.120> five<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.750> seven

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
and that takes about five to seven

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.240 
and that takes about five to seven
minutes<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.709> want<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.920> make<00:02:35.040> sure<00:02:35.069> that

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
minutes you want to make sure that

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.780 
minutes you want to make sure that
you're<00:02:35.400> stirring<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.879> entire<00:02:36.239> time<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.790> once

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
you're stirring the entire time and once

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.390 
you're stirring the entire time and once
that's<00:02:39.030> reached<00:02:39.300> 175<00:02:40.200> degrees<00:02:40.590> we're<00:02:41.099> going

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
that's reached 175 degrees we're going

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.470 
that's reached 175 degrees we're going
to<00:02:41.610> strain<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.599> into<00:02:42.959> an<00:02:43.739> ice<00:02:43.950> bath<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.819> just

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
to strain it into an ice bath I just

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.059 
to strain it into an ice bath I just
have<00:02:45.629> a<00:02:45.660> bigger<00:02:45.989> bowl<00:02:46.260> there<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.709> bottom

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
have a bigger bowl there on the bottom

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.369 
have a bigger bowl there on the bottom
has<00:02:47.280> ice<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.780> just<00:02:49.019> strained<00:02:49.260> it

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
has ice in it and I just strained it

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.040 
has ice in it and I just strained it
into<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.739> bowl<00:02:49.920> inside<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:51.420> see<00:02:51.599> those<00:02:51.720> tiny

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
into the bowl inside and see those tiny

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.050 
into the bowl inside and see those tiny
little<00:02:52.200> pieces<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:52.980> egg<00:02:53.280> even<00:02:53.730> though<00:02:53.910> we

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
little pieces of egg even though we

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.509 
little pieces of egg even though we
tempered<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.660> we<00:02:55.200> still<00:02:55.680> get<00:02:56.099> little<00:02:56.340> tiny

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
tempered it we still get little tiny

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.339 
tempered it we still get little tiny
pieces<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:56.940> egg<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.450> that's<00:02:57.599> why<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:57.930> strain

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
pieces of egg and that's why we strain

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.839 
pieces of egg and that's why we strain
it<00:02:58.379> just<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.860> make<00:02:59.010> sure<00:02:59.159> we<00:02:59.280> have<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> really

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
it just to make sure we have a really

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.040 
it just to make sure we have a really
nice<00:03:00.290> creamy<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.650> smooth<00:03:02.099> ice<00:03:02.400> cream

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
stirring while in the ice bath helps us

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.449 
stirring while in the ice bath helps us
cool<00:03:05.970> down<00:03:06.269> quicker<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:07.110> want<00:03:07.349> to<00:03:07.620> let<00:03:08.370> it

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
cool down quicker you want to let it

pop it in the fridge for at least four

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.809 
pop it in the fridge for at least four
hours<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.409> like<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.099> actually<00:03:20.250> chill<00:03:20.670> this

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
hours I like to actually chill this

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.270 
hours I like to actually chill this
overnight<00:03:21.209> because<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.050> find<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:22.980> shows

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
overnight because I find that it shows

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.039 
overnight because I find that it shows
better<00:03:23.550> in<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.879> ice<00:03:24.030> cream<00:03:24.269> maker<00:03:24.540> if<00:03:24.870> it's

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
better in the ice cream maker if it's

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.910 
better in the ice cream maker if it's
ultra<00:03:25.950> cold<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.840> while<00:03:28.019> that's<00:03:28.200> chilly<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.830> we

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
ultra cold so while that's chilly and we

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.940 
ultra cold so while that's chilly and we
have<00:03:29.190> some<00:03:29.549> time<00:03:29.819> to<00:03:29.849> make<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:31.080> strawberry

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
have some time to make the strawberry

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.130 
have some time to make the strawberry
mix<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:32.819> going<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.209> be<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> roasted

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
mix this is going to be a roasted

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.740 
mix this is going to be a roasted
strawberry<00:03:34.799> ice<00:03:35.069> cream<00:03:35.129> and<00:03:35.849> so<00:03:36.390> let's<00:03:36.599> get

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
strawberry ice cream and so let's get

another batch of roasted strawberries so

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.300 
another batch of roasted strawberries so
what<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.989> see<00:03:58.170> here<00:03:58.409> is<00:03:58.530> only<00:03:58.680> half<00:03:59.099> the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
what you see here is only half the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.940 
what you see here is only half the
amount<00:03:59.400> that

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
amount that

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.760 
amount that
recipe<00:04:00.340> actually<00:04:00.459> calls<00:04:00.670> for<00:04:01.410> so<00:04:02.410> I'm<00:04:02.500> just

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
recipe actually calls for so I'm just

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.470 
recipe actually calls for so I'm just
coating<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:03.190> strawberries<00:04:03.640> with<00:04:03.849> sugar<00:04:04.150> and

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
coating the strawberries with sugar and

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.250 
coating the strawberries with sugar and
balsamic<00:04:05.470> vinegar<00:04:06.180> give<00:04:07.180> it<00:04:07.269> a<00:04:07.330> nice<00:04:07.540> toss

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
balsamic vinegar give it a nice toss

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.309 
balsamic vinegar give it a nice toss
and<00:04:08.349> then<00:04:08.500> we're<00:04:08.650> roasting<00:04:08.830> it<00:04:09.280> low<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:09.730> slow

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
and then we're roasting it low and slow

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.970 
and then we're roasting it low and slow
so<00:04:11.319> that<00:04:11.349> means<00:04:11.970> 300<00:04:12.970> degrees<00:04:13.360> Fahrenheit<00:04:13.980> for

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
so that means 300 degrees Fahrenheit for

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.710 
so that means 300 degrees Fahrenheit for
about<00:04:17.190> 30<00:04:18.190> minutes<00:04:18.430> or<00:04:19.000> until<00:04:19.239> the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
about 30 minutes or until the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.479 
about 30 minutes or until the
strawberries<00:04:20.320> have<00:04:20.500> released<00:04:20.769> their<00:04:21.010> juices

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
strawberries have released their juices

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.740 
strawberries have released their juices
and<00:04:21.820> are<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:23.740> know<00:04:23.800> nice<00:04:24.040> and<00:04:24.070> soft<00:04:27.240> once<00:04:28.240> they

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
and are you know nice and soft once they

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.800 
and are you know nice and soft once they
come<00:04:29.110> out<00:04:29.380> of<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.590> oven<00:04:30.360> they<00:04:31.360> should<00:04:31.630> look

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
come out of the oven they should look

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.230 
come out of the oven they should look
something<00:04:32.080> like<00:04:32.290> this<00:04:32.680> and<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.639> kind<00:04:33.820> of<00:04:33.970> makes

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
something like this and it kind of makes

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.050 
something like this and it kind of makes
its<00:04:34.479> own<00:04:34.600> syrup<00:04:35.290> which<00:04:35.710> is<00:04:35.740> just<00:04:36.280> perfect<00:04:36.940> to

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
its own syrup which is just perfect to

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.270 
its own syrup which is just perfect to
go<00:04:37.210> into<00:04:37.419> ice<00:04:37.570> cream<00:04:37.900> I'm<00:04:38.410> going<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.740> mash<00:04:39.010> them

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
go into ice cream I'm going to mash them

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.860 
go into ice cream I'm going to mash them
up<00:04:39.370> with<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.580> potato<00:04:39.970> masher<00:04:40.300> you<00:04:40.630> could<00:04:40.780> also

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
up with a potato masher you could also

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.650 
up with a potato masher you could also
use<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.290> back<00:04:41.440> of<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.680> fork<00:04:42.010> until<00:04:42.970> they<00:04:43.270> are

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
use the back of a fork until they are

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.140 
use the back of a fork until they are
just<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:44.169> consistency<00:04:44.950> I<00:04:45.220> like<00:04:45.550> so<00:04:45.850> I<00:04:45.880> like<00:04:46.120> to

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.200 
the ice cream has a nice texture you can
mash<00:04:53.200> it<00:04:53.410> to<00:04:53.530> how<00:04:53.889> whatever<00:04:54.160> consistency<00:04:55.120> you

cream<00:04:58.720> attachment<00:04:59.380> that<00:05:00.040> Bowl<00:05:00.370> has<00:05:00.639> been

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
cream attachment that Bowl has been

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.469 
cream attachment that Bowl has been
freezing<00:05:01.630> for<00:05:02.350> at<00:05:02.710> least<00:05:03.070> 12<00:05:03.460> hours<00:05:03.639> super

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
freezing for at least 12 hours super

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.400 
freezing for at least 12 hours super
cold<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:05.050> my<00:05:05.560> ice<00:05:05.800> cream<00:05:06.130> custard<00:05:06.610> has<00:05:06.880> been

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
cold and my ice cream custard has been

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.810 
cold and my ice cream custard has been
refrigerating<00:05:08.410> overnight<00:05:09.130> so<00:05:09.400> everything's

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
refrigerating overnight so everything's

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.730 
refrigerating overnight so everything's
super<00:05:10.120> cold<00:05:10.600> that's<00:05:10.780> going<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.110> be<00:05:11.229> key<00:05:11.500> to

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
super cold that's going to be key to

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.909 
super cold that's going to be key to
making<00:05:11.919> sure<00:05:12.039> ice<00:05:12.520> cream<00:05:12.850> gets<00:05:13.120> nice<00:05:13.840> and

volumous<00:05:14.919> and<00:05:15.250> fluffy<00:05:16.000> and<00:05:16.270> doesn't<00:05:16.630> just<00:05:16.660> you

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
volumous and fluffy and doesn't just you

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.760 
volumous and fluffy and doesn't just you
know<00:05:17.590> keep<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:18.070> liquid<00:05:18.550> soupy<00:05:19.000> consistency<00:05:19.770> so

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
know keep a liquid soupy consistency so

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.790 
know keep a liquid soupy consistency so
after<00:05:21.130> about<00:05:21.250> 25<00:05:21.789> minutes<00:05:22.260> my<00:05:23.260> ice<00:05:23.410> cream<00:05:23.650> is

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
after about 25 minutes my ice cream is

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.950 
after about 25 minutes my ice cream is
almost<00:05:24.039> done<00:05:24.669> as<00:05:24.970> you<00:05:25.510> can<00:05:25.660> see<00:05:25.840> it's

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
almost done as you can see it's

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.129 
almost done as you can see it's
thickened<00:05:26.380> up<00:05:26.500> quite<00:05:26.860> a<00:05:26.889> bit<00:05:27.210> when<00:05:28.210> add<00:05:28.510> in<00:05:28.780> the

at<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.389> time

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
at a time

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.230 
at a time
and<00:05:32.410> you<00:05:33.280> want<00:05:33.460> to<00:05:33.550> do<00:05:33.700> this<00:05:33.850> during<00:05:34.030> the

and you want to do this during the
last-minute<00:05:35.100> training<00:05:36.100> because<00:05:37.030> that<00:05:37.479> way

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
last-minute training because that way

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.450

a lot of water content and you don't

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:55.140 
a lot of water content and you don't
