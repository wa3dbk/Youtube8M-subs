00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.469
 Now we'll talk about disconnected because 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.000
 the detached is essential to have a 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.460
 excellent cornering for which it goes 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.960
 focused the point where we need to 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.390
 arrive with the minimum paolo speed 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.609
 let's talk about this part of this one 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.890
 damn parting comes from one 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.679
 maximum speed to pass 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.000
 immediately at a minimum speed of 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:39.680
 entry curve movements movements 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.820
 they are always the same that is necessary 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:48.120
 brake in the most powerful way 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.500
 You can move the weight back by 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.360
 the movement by braking all the weight 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.620
 of the bike and the rider's weight from the end 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.379
 on the front wheel you need 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.800
 try to move to shift the weight 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.539
 later lightening the saddle e 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.210
 bringing itself defined as possible by doing 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.339
 force on the platforms extend the arms 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.189
 and lift the torso so that the air 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.560
 we help you to brake, so let's say this 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.990
 it is the technique but the technique is in 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.630
 function also at a point a bridge 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.799
 imaginary that one creates, let's say 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.600
 trying the track or with the previous laps 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.090
 to focus exactly where you need to 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.590
 to get slow to then have 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.520
 entry into the curve 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.040
 yes certainly the braking of the driving in 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.579
 track is perhaps the most difficult part there 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.890
 the most difficult part is knowing the part 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.299
 harder easier even for by 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.590
 year once any pilot 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.290
 stops going on the track for some 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.290
 time the last braking point that 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.390
 he knew when he stopped being lost e 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.729
 the automation always makes you do a 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.460
 little before then to return to that 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.530
 point and there is a question of one 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.680
 question of turning on the track and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.420
 return for miles on the track and 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.450
 slowly return to that point of 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.989
 limited braking well this is here 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.920
 technique and the theory of a sample but 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.510
 now I want to see it 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.510
 also applied to a neophyte 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:32.060
 we are talking about tarzan annoni then 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:37.460
 tarzan this detached what they are 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:40.040
 according to you the crucial points to enter 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.330
 cornering crucial points as you said 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.760
 first comes the detached 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.670
 then I followed his advice a little 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.200
 given paolo's case and it's not easy because 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.930
 however this way they already have brakes 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.310
 very powerful and counteract the speed 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.770
 with the only one with the arms you have to be 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.730
 a lot of the born I have to say anyway 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.730
 even fun
