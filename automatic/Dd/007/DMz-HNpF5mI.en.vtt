00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.470
 That's right, though 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.360
 It is from radiation exposure 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.360
 This is a stretch but it's persistent 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.149
 It is to 4q 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.149

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.870
 This is my intention 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.890
 It is far from old in the country with four district courts in the garden 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.840
 Certainly 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.260
 by the way 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.480
 One-two strike 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.490
 This is 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.410
 It changes this time 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.880
 Finally 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.880
 This day I made it public 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.990
 It is a royal family 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.990
 It has risen even to become a candidate of Yayoi 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.670
 It can not be said 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 I'm amazing the mechanics of the world 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.050

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.050
 Aside from the country 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.820
 Please be sure to wait 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.810
 Such at disney 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.940
 this 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.950
 Something like an antenna 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.520
 It's motional 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.460
 As shown in this figure 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.870
 Up 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.870

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.870
 I got about 4 but 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:13.309
 After that, it is an appointment only with Lana Zagreb 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.969
 Mr. Yoshihiko Cockpit is Vice President 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.669
 Kofu football opening 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.619
 I will pack here in the long run 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.499
 Cockpit is bad 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:36.619
 In office 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:38.869
 f1 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:42.439
 Local seems to be making a scoreboard with this 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.999
 It is this who is here 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:48.789

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.169
 I'm a person riding overnight 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.959

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.739

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.739
 I wonder what these guys are 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.469
 I can not focus on the base 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.909
 I agree 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.469
 6 months after 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.019
 Expected amount is not wrong, especially I can not wipe this face 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.739
 Even if this river southern Bell child is not convinced at all 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.359
 Fine 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.039
 What a feeling 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.039
 So everyone 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.009

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.769

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.939
 In the liquid fertilizer comment 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.939
 Please tell me 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:13.889
 It's this critical moment 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.229
 I'm dead but 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.840
 Sorry I can't break through 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.949
 In the same way 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.449
 This time so far
