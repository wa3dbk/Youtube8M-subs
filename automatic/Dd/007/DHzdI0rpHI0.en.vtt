Riddick unrated and these are all

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.580 
Riddick unrated and these are all
blu-ray<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.390> thought<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.690> came<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:09.959> DVD<00:02:10.319> but<00:02:10.560> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
blu-ray I thought it came with DVD but I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.319 
blu-ray I thought it came with DVD but I
guess<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.009> doesn't

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.429 

yeah<00:02:15.329> that's<00:02:15.540> kind<00:02:15.719> of<00:02:15.780> strange<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.109> thought<00:02:16.290> it

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
yeah that's kind of strange I thought it

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.559 
yeah that's kind of strange I thought it
came<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:16.709> DVD<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.549> I<00:02:17.579> guess<00:02:17.849> ultraviolet

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
came with DVD but I guess ultraviolet

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.369 
came with DVD but I guess ultraviolet
isn't<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.079> bad<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.530> don't<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:21.379> never

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
isn't that bad I don't have a I never

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.440 
isn't that bad I don't have a I never
use<00:02:22.769> DVDs<00:02:22.980> anyways<00:02:23.609> when<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:23.849> use<00:02:24.030> get<00:02:24.299> these

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
use DVDs anyways when I use get these

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.910 
use DVDs anyways when I use get these
anyways<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.139> I<00:02:25.170> thought<00:02:25.409> of<00:02:25.530> what<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.769> came

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
anyways but I thought of what it came

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.899 
anyways but I thought of what it came
with<00:02:26.129> them<00:02:28.040> it's<00:02:29.040> basically<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.609> just<00:02:29.790> has

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
with them it's basically it just has

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.599 
with them it's basically it just has
like<00:02:30.150> what<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.930> ratings<00:02:31.319> are<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:32.010> each<00:02:32.189> movie

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
like what the ratings are of each movie

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.800 
like what the ratings are of each movie
in<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.939> case<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.349> see<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.530> again<00:02:35.810> it

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
in the case you can see that again it

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.990 
in the case you can see that again it
just<00:02:36.989> has<00:02:37.109> the<00:02:37.230> ratings<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.829> each<00:02:37.950> one<00:02:38.219> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
just has the ratings of each one the
