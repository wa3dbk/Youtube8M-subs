today we're gonna be talking about the
mini-map<00:00:14.519> right<00:00:14.849> now<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.690> mini-map<00:00:16.020> is

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
mini-map right now the mini-map is

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.480 
mini-map right now the mini-map is
something<00:00:16.529> that's<00:00:16.680> been<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:16.949> every<00:00:17.310> single

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
something that's been in every single

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.310 
something that's been in every single
called<00:00:17.820> 2d<00:00:18.060> dating<00:00:18.539> back<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.080> first

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
called 2d dating back to the first

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200 
called 2d dating back to the first
colony<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.830> I've<00:00:19.949> ever<00:00:20.160> played<00:00:20.460> which<00:00:21.060> is

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
colony that I've ever played which is

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.790 
colony that I've ever played which is
called<00:00:21.420> tutitu<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.109> I'm<00:00:22.350> pretty<00:00:22.500> sure<00:00:22.710> it

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
called tutitu so I'm pretty sure it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.689 
called tutitu so I'm pretty sure it
might<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.010> been<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.279> first<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.580> but<00:00:23.670> I

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
might have been in the first one but I

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.640 
might have been in the first one but I
never<00:00:23.880> played<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.840> won't<00:00:25.050> go<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.380> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
never played it so I won't go on and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.839 
never played it so I won't go on and
limb<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.830> say<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:26.519> been<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.760> every

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
limb and say that but it's been in every

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.220 
limb and say that but it's been in every
single<00:00:27.150> call<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.300> D<00:00:27.510> since<00:00:27.750> then<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.109> every

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
single call to D since then in every

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.410 
single call to D since then in every
multiplayer<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.250> most<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.359> probably

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
multiplayer and most of you probably

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.600 
multiplayer and most of you probably
just<00:00:31.050> think<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.349> your<00:00:31.470> mini-map<00:00:31.859> as<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
just think of your mini-map as that

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.100 
just think of your mini-map as that
little<00:00:33.000> box<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.570> top<00:00:33.750> left<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.050> your

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
little box on the top left of your

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.690 
little box on the top left of your
screen<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.500> shows<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.070> direction<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.610> which

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
screen that shows the direction in which

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.430 
screen that shows the direction in which
you're<00:00:35.910> aiming<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.420> where<00:00:36.960> your<00:00:37.079> opponents

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
you're aiming and where your opponents

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.920 
you're aiming and where your opponents
are<00:00:37.500> coming<00:00:37.739> from<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.370> lot<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.540> probably

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
are coming from so a lot of you probably

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.950 
are coming from so a lot of you probably
only<00:00:40.290> use<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.340> determine<00:00:41.820> where<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
only use that to determine where the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.389 
only use that to determine where the
action<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.500> down<00:00:43.710> where<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.070> should<00:00:44.280> be

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
action is going down where you should be

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.250 
action is going down where you should be
and<00:00:44.700> what<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.940> should<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.239> watching<00:00:45.450> now

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and what you should be watching now

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.369

and if you don't have a good mini-map
awareness<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.380> will<00:01:28.409> probably<00:01:29.040> not<00:01:29.700> succeed

as<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.619> competitor<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.490> thought<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.759> would

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
as a competitor and I thought this would

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.789 
as a competitor and I thought this would
be<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> good<00:01:33.270> video<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.960> pay<00:01:34.229> attention<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
be a good video so pay attention and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.219 
be a good video so pay attention and
let's<00:01:35.189> get<00:01:35.280> into<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> basics<00:01:35.960> all<00:01:36.960> right<00:01:37.079> so

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
let's get into the basics all right so

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.840 
let's get into the basics all right so
some<00:01:37.439> basic<00:01:37.590> things<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.340> need<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.700> know

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
some basic things that you need to know

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.270 
some basic things that you need to know
are<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:40.079> be<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.560> aware<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.799> your<00:01:40.950> mini-map

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
are to be more aware of your mini-map

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.310 
are to be more aware of your mini-map
every<00:01:41.640> time<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.000> spawn<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.200> in

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
every time you spawn you can do this in

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440 
every time you spawn you can do this in
a<00:01:43.380> public<00:01:43.680> match<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.159> ranked<00:01:44.369> play<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.820> would

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
a public match in a ranked play I would

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.609 
a public match in a ranked play I would
recommend<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> ranked<00:01:46.020> play<00:01:46.140> every<00:01:46.380> time<00:01:46.409> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
recommend a ranked play every time you

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.020 
recommend a ranked play every time you
spawn<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.860> should<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.159> peeking<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:47.939> your

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
spawn you should be peeking at your

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
spawn you should be peeking at your
mini-map<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:48.600> away<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.320> should<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.649> seeing

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
mini-map right away you should be seeing

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.260 
mini-map right away you should be seeing
where<00:01:50.040> your<00:01:50.159> teammates<00:01:50.460> are<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> map<00:01:51.030> now

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
anything with my team I would just go

anything with my team I would just go
ahead<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.790> glance<00:02:20.000> in<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.150> mini-map<00:02:20.480> every

time I was falling and I try to fill
those<00:02:22.490> little<00:02:22.760> gaps<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.390> try<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.900> help<00:02:24.080> my

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200

and<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.330> found<00:02:26.570> that<00:02:26.780> doing<00:02:27.020> that<00:02:27.260> gave<00:02:27.680> me<00:02:27.860> a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
and I found that doing that gave me a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.220 
and I found that doing that gave me a
routine<00:02:28.520> where<00:02:29.150> now<00:02:29.390> I'm<00:02:29.750> it's<00:02:30.080> just

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
routine where now I'm it's just

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.530 
routine where now I'm it's just
instinctual<00:02:30.680> it's<00:02:31.430> habit<00:02:31.790> where<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.090> check<00:02:32.420> my

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
instinctual it's habit where I check my

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.480 
instinctual it's habit where I check my
mini-map<00:02:32.900> in<00:02:33.140> almost<00:02:33.530> every<00:02:33.770> situation<00:02:33.950> so

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
mini-map in almost every situation so

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.130 
mini-map in almost every situation so
make<00:02:35.090> sure<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.300> guys<00:02:35.390> do<00:02:35.600> that<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.960> it'll

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
you guys need to know is after you learn

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.630 
you guys need to know is after you learn
how<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.110> spawn<00:02:42.440> up<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.770> fill<00:02:42.920> those<00:02:43.070> gaps<00:02:43.130> on

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
how to spawn up and fill those gaps on

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.850 
how to spawn up and fill those gaps on
the<00:02:43.730> map<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.300> need<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.540> learn<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:45.020> rotation<00:02:45.680> so

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
the map you need to learn a rotation so

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.700 
the map you need to learn a rotation so
basically<00:02:46.700> when<00:02:47.360> you're<00:02:47.480> playing<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.900> CTF<00:02:48.410> or<00:02:48.680> a

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
basically when you're playing a CTF or a

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.390 
basically when you're playing a CTF or a
hardpoint

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
hardpoint

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.210 
hardpoint
or<00:02:49.490> even<00:02:49.850> an<00:02:49.940> uplink<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:51.470> applies<00:02:51.950> more<00:02:52.160> to

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
or even an uplink this applies more to

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.950 
or even an uplink this applies more to
CTF<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.790> hardpoint<00:02:53.180> but<00:02:53.390> there<00:02:53.750> will<00:02:53.810> be<00:02:53.870> a

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
CTF and hardpoint but there will be a

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.600 
CTF and hardpoint but there will be a
rotation<00:02:54.140> on<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.710> map<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.100> whenever<00:02:55.310> you

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
rotation on the map so whenever you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.550 
rotation on the map so whenever you
spawn<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.210> you<00:02:56.690> fill<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.020> gap<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.440> you

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
spawn and you fill that gap and you

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.350 
spawn and you fill that gap and you
learn<00:02:57.710> how<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:57.890> do<00:02:58.190> this<00:02:58.340> effectively<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.300> you

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
learn how to do this effectively and you

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.190 
learn how to do this effectively and you
get<00:02:59.510> pretty<00:02:59.720> good<00:02:59.780> at<00:02:59.930> it

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
get pretty good at it

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.800 
get pretty good at it
you<00:03:00.710> should<00:03:00.980> then<00:03:01.640> learn<00:03:01.910> how<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.240> rotate<00:03:02.660> so

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
you should then learn how to rotate so

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.180 
you should then learn how to rotate so
whenever<00:03:02.960> a<00:03:03.110> teammate<00:03:03.470> dies<00:03:03.620> because<00:03:03.860> it's

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
whenever a teammate dies because it's

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.710 
whenever a teammate dies because it's
inevitable<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.970> Call<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.150> Duty<00:03:05.330> players<00:03:05.600> are

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
inevitable and Call of Duty players are

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.240 
inevitable and Call of Duty players are
gonna<00:03:05.840> die<00:03:06.020> your<00:03:06.530> teammates<00:03:06.860> are<00:03:06.950> gonna<00:03:07.070> die

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
gonna die your teammates are gonna die

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.320 
gonna die your teammates are gonna die
and<00:03:07.280> you're<00:03:07.580> gonna<00:03:07.700> have<00:03:07.850> to<00:03:07.940> fill<00:03:08.150> those<00:03:08.270> gaps

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
and you're gonna have to fill those gaps

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.630 
and you're gonna have to fill those gaps
so<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:09.380> should<00:03:09.590> be<00:03:09.710> constantly<00:03:10.340> paying

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
so you should be constantly paying

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.980 
so you should be constantly paying
attention<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.060> mini-map<00:03:11.390> anytime<00:03:11.810> some

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
attention to mini-map anytime some

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.050 
attention to mini-map anytime some
action<00:03:12.350> is<00:03:12.470> going<00:03:12.620> down<00:03:12.890> or<00:03:13.370> anytime<00:03:13.610> in<00:03:14.000> the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
action is going down or anytime in the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.700 
action is going down or anytime in the
kill<00:03:14.270> feed<00:03:14.450> somebody<00:03:14.750> dies<00:03:15.080> you<00:03:15.110> should<00:03:15.590> be

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
kill feed somebody dies you should be

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.260 
kill feed somebody dies you should be
getting<00:03:16.130> ready<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.490> fill<00:03:16.670> that<00:03:16.820> gap<00:03:16.880> and

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
getting ready to fill that gap and

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.910 
getting ready to fill that gap and
getting<00:03:17.780> ready<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.140> rotate<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.680> next

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
getting ready to rotate to the next

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.020 
getting ready to rotate to the next
position<00:03:19.010> that<00:03:19.370> needs<00:03:19.520> to<00:03:19.610> be<00:03:19.730> filled<00:03:19.940> so

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
position that needs to be filled so

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.910 
position that needs to be filled so
basically<00:03:20.420> what<00:03:20.630> this<00:03:20.750> means<00:03:20.990> is<00:03:21.170> if<00:03:21.350> you<00:03:21.800> have

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
basically what this means is if you have

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.840 
basically what this means is if you have
been<00:03:22.070> effectively<00:03:22.430> holding<00:03:22.670> down<00:03:22.760> your

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
been effectively holding down your

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.370 
been effectively holding down your
position<00:03:23.240> or<00:03:23.450> if<00:03:23.600> you've<00:03:23.750> been<00:03:23.780> effectively

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
position or if you've been effectively

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.750 
position or if you've been effectively
pushing<00:03:24.830> out<00:03:24.950> whatever<00:03:25.400> you're<00:03:25.550> supposed<00:03:25.730> to

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
pushing out whatever you're supposed to

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.640 
pushing out whatever you're supposed to
be<00:03:25.880> pushing<00:03:26.180> out<00:03:26.300> you<00:03:27.200> should<00:03:27.440> then<00:03:27.620> be

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
be pushing out you should then be

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.470 
be pushing out you should then be
rotating<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.460> the<00:03:28.520> next<00:03:28.820> most<00:03:29.060> important

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
rotating to the next most important

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.110 
rotating to the next most important
position<00:03:29.930> if<00:03:30.920> your<00:03:31.130> teammate<00:03:31.460> dies<00:03:31.640> so

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
position if your teammate dies so

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.090 
position if your teammate dies so
basically<00:03:32.840> that<00:03:33.110> is<00:03:33.290> going<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.530> create<00:03:33.680> a

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
basically that is going to create a

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.520 
basically that is going to create a
rotation<00:03:34.850> off<00:03:35.120> spawn<00:03:35.480> so<00:03:35.930> you're<00:03:36.170> gonna<00:03:36.290> hold

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
rotation off spawn so you're gonna hold

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.430 
rotation off spawn so you're gonna hold
complete<00:03:36.890> control<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.810> hopefully<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:39.320> guys

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
complete control and hopefully you guys

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.380 
complete control and hopefully you guys
can<00:03:39.500> see<00:03:39.740> this<00:03:39.950> example<00:03:40.280> this<00:03:40.790> is<00:03:41.000> an<00:03:41.090> example

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
can see this example this is an example

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.350 
can see this example this is an example
of<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.990> good<00:03:42.320> rotation<00:03:42.970> alright<00:03:43.970> guys<00:03:44.090> so<00:03:44.330> I

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
of a good rotation alright guys so I

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.880 
of a good rotation alright guys so I
chose<00:03:44.690> this<00:03:44.900> clip<00:03:45.140> because<00:03:45.350> it<00:03:45.620> shows<00:03:45.860> how

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
chose this clip because it shows how

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.520 
chose this clip because it shows how
powerful<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:47.360> tool<00:03:47.600> of<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:47.960> me<00:03:48.110> map<00:03:48.290> can<00:03:48.500> be

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
powerful the tool of the me map can be

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.730 
powerful the tool of the me map can be
and<00:03:48.890> what<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.460> can<00:03:49.580> use<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.850> for<00:03:49.970> so<00:03:50.180> basically

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
and what you can use it for so basically

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.690 
and what you can use it for so basically
Optics<00:03:51.740> playing<00:03:51.890> hardpoint<00:03:52.220> in<00:03:52.310> solar<00:03:52.490> right

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
Optics playing hardpoint in solar right

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.130 
Optics playing hardpoint in solar right
now<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.150> they're<00:03:53.390> using<00:03:53.570> their<00:03:53.780> mini-map<00:03:54.110> to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
now and they're using their mini-map to

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.600 
now and they're using their mini-map to
rotate<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.830> effectively<00:03:55.220> fight<00:03:55.430> off

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
rotate and effectively fight off

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.700 
rotate and effectively fight off
everybody<00:03:56.090> on<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.450> map<00:03:56.660> so<00:03:56.900> as<00:03:57.080> you<00:03:57.440> can<00:03:57.560> see

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
everybody on the map so as you can see

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.220 
everybody on the map so as you can see
right<00:03:57.950> now<00:03:58.010> formal<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:59.060> or<00:03:59.300> cream<00:03:59.900> and<00:03:59.930> scum

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
right now formal is or cream and scum

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.720 
right now formal is or cream and scum

point has went to optic just because
they've<00:04:23.120> been<00:04:23.150> paying<00:04:23.510> attend

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
they've been paying attend

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.970 
they've been paying attend
-<00:04:24.000> their<00:04:24.120> mini-map<00:04:24.480> they've<00:04:24.780> been<00:04:24.990> they<00:04:25.740> know

- their mini-map they've been they know

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.380 
- their mini-map they've been they know
where<00:04:26.280> everybody's<00:04:26.550> dying<00:04:26.790> where<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.060> action

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
where everybody's dying where the action

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.910 
where everybody's dying where the action
is<00:04:27.480> on<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.630> map<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.080> they<00:04:28.260> know<00:04:28.440> what<00:04:28.710> gaps

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
is on the map and they know what gaps

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.500 
is on the map and they know what gaps
that<00:04:29.160> need<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.400> be<00:04:29.520> filled<00:04:29.760> so<00:04:29.850> this<00:04:30.210> is<00:04:30.330> kind

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
that need to be filled so this is kind

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.790 
that need to be filled so this is kind
of<00:04:30.570> a<00:04:30.630> way<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:30.810> can<00:04:31.020> utilize<00:04:31.200> your<00:04:31.470> mini-map

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
of a way you can utilize your mini-map

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.190 
of a way you can utilize your mini-map
to<00:04:32.100> get<00:04:32.370> better<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.790> a<00:04:33.600> way<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.810> can<00:04:34.080> utilize

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
to get better and a way you can utilize

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.740 
to get better and a way you can utilize
it<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.650> your<00:04:34.920> advantage

another<00:04:37.750> advanced<00:04:38.229> thing<00:04:38.319> I<00:04:38.410> wanted<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.710> talk

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
another advanced thing I wanted to talk

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.460 
another advanced thing I wanted to talk
about<00:04:38.919> was<00:04:39.400> flag<00:04:39.789> routes<00:04:40.000> so<00:04:40.270> basically<00:04:40.840> when

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
about was flag routes so basically when

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.260 
about was flag routes so basically when
your<00:04:42.009> teammate<00:04:42.340> pulls<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.669> flag<00:04:42.850> out<00:04:43.030> and

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
your teammate pulls the flag out and

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.140 
your teammate pulls the flag out and
you're<00:04:43.660> on<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.840> map<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.699> right<00:04:45.699> now<00:04:45.849> you<00:04:45.910> don't

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
you're on the map so right now you don't

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.490 
you're on the map so right now you don't
know<00:04:46.210> what<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.449> do<00:04:46.569> you<00:04:46.780> don't<00:04:46.870> see<00:04:47.050> anybody<00:04:47.380> on

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
know what to do you don't see anybody on

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.200 
know what to do you don't see anybody on
your<00:04:47.530> screen<00:04:47.889> and<00:04:48.130> your<00:04:48.759> teammate<00:04:49.030> just

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
your screen and your teammate just

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.790 
your screen and your teammate just
pulled<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.479> flag<00:04:49.690> now<00:04:49.930> let's<00:04:50.349> assume<00:04:50.590> there's

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
pulled the flag now let's assume there's

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.040 
pulled the flag now let's assume there's
no<00:04:50.860> communication<00:04:51.610> right<00:04:51.849> and<00:04:52.060> all<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.870> have

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
no communication right and all you have

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.140 
no communication right and all you have
left<00:04:53.349> is<00:04:53.680> your<00:04:53.949> mini-map<00:04:54.250> your<00:04:54.610> teammates<00:04:55.000> on

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
left is your mini-map your teammates on

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.240 
left is your mini-map your teammates on
the<00:04:55.210> map<00:04:55.419> and<00:04:55.660> you<00:04:55.720> don't<00:04:56.319> know<00:04:56.380> what<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.590> do<00:04:56.680> so

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
the map and you don't know what to do so

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.890 
the map and you don't know what to do so
what<00:04:57.819> you<00:04:57.970> should<00:04:58.030> be<00:04:58.210> doing<00:04:58.419> right<00:04:58.479> there<00:04:58.720> is

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
what you should be doing right there is

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.029 
what you should be doing right there is
you<00:04:59.050> should<00:04:59.199> be<00:04:59.229> looking<00:04:59.380> at<00:04:59.560> your<00:04:59.680> mini-map

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
you should be looking at your mini-map

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.290 
you should be looking at your mini-map
you<00:05:00.160> should<00:05:00.340> be<00:05:00.430> trusting<00:05:00.880> your<00:05:00.940> teammates

you should be trusting your teammates
because<00:05:01.449> that's<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.870> best<00:05:02.050> thing<00:05:02.169> you<00:05:02.289> can<00:05:02.440> do

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
because that's the best thing you can do

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.320 
because that's the best thing you can do
in<00:05:02.830> this<00:05:03.160> situation<00:05:03.340> you<00:05:03.789> should<00:05:03.970> be<00:05:04.060> cutting

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
in this situation you should be cutting

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.080 
in this situation you should be cutting
off<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.569> next<00:05:04.870> possible<00:05:05.520> area<00:05:06.520> where<00:05:06.819> your

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
flag carrier you can die so let's say

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.460 
flag carrier you can die so let's say
you're<00:05:08.710> playing<00:05:08.740> retreat<00:05:09.250> and<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:11.229> flag<00:05:11.440> is

watching<00:05:32.259> this<00:05:32.860> very<00:05:33.099> cut<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:34.060> make<00:05:34.210> sure<00:05:34.419> that

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
watching this very cut to make sure that

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:36.510 
watching this very cut to make sure that
the<00:05:34.810> flag<00:05:35.050> does<00:05:35.349> not<00:05:35.560> die<00:05:35.740> now<00:05:36.009> obviously

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
the flag does not die now obviously

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.700 
the flag does not die now obviously
that's<00:05:36.699> a<00:05:36.789> very<00:05:36.819> simple<00:05:37.710> oversimplified

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
that's a very simple oversimplified

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.640 
that's a very simple oversimplified
situation<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:39.550> but<00:05:40.539> that's<00:05:40.900> pretty<00:05:41.139> much<00:05:41.349> the

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
situation and but that's pretty much the

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.810 
situation and but that's pretty much the
general<00:05:41.889> gist<00:05:42.220> of<00:05:42.370> what<00:05:42.460> you're<00:05:42.580> gonna<00:05:42.639> have

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
general gist of what you're gonna have

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.770 
general gist of what you're gonna have
to<00:05:42.909> do<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:43.330> CTF<00:05:43.990> to<00:05:44.169> get<00:05:44.320> cuts<00:05:44.530> so<00:05:44.770> you<00:05:45.520> can<00:05:45.820> you

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
to do and CTF to get cuts so you can you

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.149 
to do and CTF to get cuts so you can you
can<00:05:46.810> obviously<00:05:47.199> tell<00:05:47.470> that<00:05:47.530> using<00:05:48.130> your

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:48.159 
can obviously tell that using your

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.379 
can obviously tell that using your
mini-map<00:05:48.520> is<00:05:48.639> the<00:05:48.729> only<00:05:48.880> possible<00:05:49.240> way<00:05:49.360> you

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
mini-map is the only possible way you

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.120 
mini-map is the only possible way you

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
think about that in the situation where

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.600 
think about that in the situation where
you're<00:05:53.199> gonna<00:05:53.349> be<00:05:53.500> putting<00:05:53.740> this<00:05:53.889> alot<00:05:54.280> so

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
you're gonna have to learn to look at

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.680 
you're gonna have to learn to look at
your<00:05:56.440> mini-map<00:05:56.680> off<00:05:56.919> spawn<00:05:57.219> or<00:05:57.820> and<00:05:58.240> just<00:05:58.570> in

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
your mini-map off spawn or and just in

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.870 
your mini-map off spawn or and just in
any<00:05:58.870> situation<00:05:59.409> where<00:05:59.440> it<00:06:00.009> requires<00:06:00.159> teamwork

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
any situation where it requires teamwork

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.390 
any situation where it requires teamwork
and<00:06:01.210> you<00:06:01.900> can't<00:06:02.229> get<00:06:02.440> all<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:02.770> call-outs<00:06:03.130> out

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
and you can't get all the call-outs out

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.490 
and you can't get all the call-outs out
or<00:06:03.669> you<00:06:04.060> don't<00:06:04.270> or<00:06:04.539> the<00:06:04.930> team<00:06:05.110> your<00:06:05.380> other

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
or you don't or the team your other

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.659 
or you don't or the team your other

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
teammates don't know all the information

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.490 
teammates don't know all the information
on<00:06:07.000> the<00:06:07.060> map<00:06:07.090> so<00:06:07.419> that's<00:06:07.870> how<00:06:07.990> you<00:06:08.050> use<00:06:08.229> your

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
on the map so that's how you use your

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.159 
on the map so that's how you use your
mini-map<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.889> kind<00:06:09.190> of<00:06:09.810> figure<00:06:10.810> out<00:06:10.870> what's

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
mini-map to kind of figure out what's

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:12.300 
mini-map to kind of figure out what's
going<00:06:11.349> down<00:06:11.469> on<00:06:11.620> the<00:06:11.680> map<00:06:11.800> and<00:06:11.979> what<00:06:12.070> you<00:06:12.159> need

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
going down on the map and what you need

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.100 
going down on the map and what you need
to<00:06:12.370> do<00:06:12.580> without<00:06:13.240> somebody<00:06:13.449> telling<00:06:13.780> you<00:06:13.870> what

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
to do without somebody telling you what

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.170
