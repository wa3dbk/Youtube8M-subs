00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.020
 hello everyone with you again panda today 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.390
 we will analyze such a mechanism 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.610
 like a bunker that is the bunker the very mechanism 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.879
 and the door to the bunker is already a mechanism 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.510
 let's see how it works here 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.610
 so here he can door it say here 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.830
 this is the whole mechanism but the pros are that 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.070
 you can close it from the inside let's get it 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.800
 let's build it so we need 6 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.400
 sticky pistons 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.049
 to start digging a hole here and this here 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.510
 actually here's the bunker 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.510
 begins then we set the sticky pistons 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:08.140
 here we fall back block and here time is sticky 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.760
 pistons like this and dancing on the wiring and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.590
 so put it like that cross 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.900
 that is, it is depending on where we are going 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.610
 go from the other side we start for 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.560
 hold growth that is if we go 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.570
 here it should be here 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.570
 here's the line not patron marvel over there 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.530
 and if we want the doors to open 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.240
 consistently need to pick 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.640
 the delay is correct that is here it is 0 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.370
 tightening here is not at all 3 Petra here 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.210
 delay 1 1 0 1 seconds and here to 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.400
 opened ability 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.290
 add one more glue 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:52.050
 saying almost everything works left 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:55.200
 just finish the race for 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.660
 the whole scheme and put here 1 volume 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.580
 and there, too, with the new set now 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.100
 three peter 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:06.600
 here for now just a block is also here 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:14.520
 Jupiter and here we put the block here once 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:16.980
 new torch and here and here we put 1 volume 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.750
 that is, here's the February 1 ton of it have 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.920
 us activators that is if we 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:27.870
 activate the lever here sequentially 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.330
 as we see it is also possible by action on 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.000
 redstone here replace on linden so 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:38.670
 You can choose any delay so that it has 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.080
 here we are this row and this one is smooth well I 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.480
 after all, and you are your preference when 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.220
 they open smoothly and so i 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.250
 leave here so well, this is to choose to you 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.019
 and here and so everything, and now let's 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.910
 do it so that you can open it 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.459
 this and close from the inside ie we go there 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.080
 go close and besides us there already 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:05.420
 no one else will go and so let's 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:08.070
 first all this is so close the deal 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.380
 and outside it may even look 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:20.910
 like a dance floor for battle 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:23.160
 so here and here so it seems to me this 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.870
 the design is very solitary and pretty 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.850
 compactly viewed from above that is 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.100
 we see absolutely no 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.550
 redstone well let's do it 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.490
 this topic so as not to close 7 so 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.360
 here for god's sake 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:45.650
 oh no no here so i erased in that 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:48.590
 so accidentally put here on bridges 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.190
 here on often if the food garden when 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.490
 this delay 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.740
 so here's all quit and the day we do 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.640
 announcement in one year and here affairs 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.100
 you fishing 2 of 4 put here 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.930
 Redstone to check 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.810
 as we see nothing but everything is correct 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.840
 camp have been closed now we sony 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.180
 open as we see this row closed 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.540
 that means 10 correctly put this one 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:21.920
 block a simple torch here put whether peter 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:28.280
 now without delay and here so here 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:29.650
 put the redstone also go 4 down so 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:36.290
 set redstone 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:40.820
 check closed set put here 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:43.550
 the repeater here is so deep here 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.900
 I grow well now everything can interfere here 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.680
 wanted and when you clicked on it we all 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.540
 the doors open 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.950
 and when we activate it there 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.070
 indicators and it all closes and 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.750
 from the outside all this is no longer how to open everything 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:07.160
 Now you can close this whole structure 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:17.960
 from that part, well, like this 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:18.970
 here and so thank you all for your attention 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.380

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.890
