00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
people that I played because seriously a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.880 
people that I played because seriously a
dozen<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.360> too<00:00:36.450> much<00:00:36.570> work<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:36.829> this<00:00:37.829> is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
dozen to be too much work so this is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.410 
dozen to be too much work so this is
gonna<00:00:37.980> be<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.190> similar<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
gonna be really similar to just the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.000 
gonna be really similar to just the
golden<00:00:39.690> online<00:00:39.930> matches<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> narrate<00:00:40.770> I

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
golden online matches that I narrate I

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.770 
golden online matches that I narrate I
just<00:00:41.820> played<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.210> couple<00:00:42.450> minutes<00:00:42.719> ago

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
just played this a couple minutes ago

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.360 
just played this a couple minutes ago
too<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.500> came<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.829> venit<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.190> draw

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
too so I came out the venit just draw

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.639 
too so I came out the venit just draw
him<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.539> isn't<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:45.840> hit<00:00:46.050> kills<00:00:46.289> for

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
him and this isn't one hit kills for

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.959 
him and this isn't one hit kills for
some<00:00:46.800> reason<00:00:47.070> they<00:00:47.160> took<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> feature<00:00:47.730> out

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
some reason they took that feature out

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.690 
some reason they took that feature out
so<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.899> gonna<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> lot<00:00:49.530> easier<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.399> survive

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
so it's gonna be a lot easier to survive

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.580 
so it's gonna be a lot easier to survive
it's<00:00:51.120> gonna<00:00:51.329> be<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.989> harder<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.350> kill

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
it's gonna be a little harder to kill

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.150 
it's gonna be a little harder to kill
and<00:00:53.329> there's<00:00:54.350> for<00:00:55.350> some<00:00:55.500> reason<00:00:55.739> auto<00:00:55.890> aims

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
and there's for some reason auto aims

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.340 
and there's for some reason auto aims
always<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.969> matchmaking<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.109> can't

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
always on in the matchmaking so I can't

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.029 
always on in the matchmaking so I can't
do<00:00:58.440> anything<00:00:58.469> about<00:00:58.739> that

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
do anything about that

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.500 
do anything about that
I<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.309> playing<00:00:59.579> without<00:00:59.699> auto<00:00:59.940> aim<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
I like playing without auto aim just to
