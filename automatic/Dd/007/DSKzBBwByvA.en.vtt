will will will seal in whatever glue
that<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.460> left<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> wall<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.230> once

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
that you have left on the wall and once

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.369 
that you have left on the wall and once
again<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.789> water-based<00:00:45.239> -<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> fumes

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
again it's a water-based - so the fumes

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.060 
again it's a water-based - so the fumes
aren't<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:46.800> bad<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.149> oil<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:49.050> does<00:00:49.289> kind<00:00:49.710> kind

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
aren't as bad as oil it does kind kind

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.580 
aren't as bad as oil it does kind kind
of<00:00:50.219> how<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.489> they<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.820> theme<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.960> it's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
of how if they have theme to it but it's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.529 
of how if they have theme to it but it's
basically<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.489> water-based<00:00:54.090> glue<00:00:54.360> that

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
basically like a water-based glue that

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.240 
basically like a water-based glue that
dries<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> hard<00:00:55.289> film<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.920> great<00:00:56.190> for

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
dries to a hard film so it's great for

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.279 
dries to a hard film so it's great for
conditions<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.899> what<00:00:58.050> we're<00:00:58.170> going

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.520 
brown paper and just in it dry
are<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:58.030> what<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.390> did<00:01:58.570> was<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:58.810> created<00:01:58.990> a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
are so what it did was it created a

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.310 
are so what it did was it created a
vapor<00:01:59.920> barrier<00:02:00.040> so<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:00.670> when<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.210> put<00:02:01.630> when

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
vapor barrier so that when you put when

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.100 
vapor barrier so that when you put when
you<00:02:02.380> put<00:02:02.830> joint<00:02:03.130> compound<00:02:03.700> on<00:02:04.000> top<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.990> that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
you put joint compound on top of that

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.590 
you put joint compound on top of that
which<00:02:05.410> does<00:02:05.680> have<00:02:05.980> water<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:07.360> water

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
which does have water in it the water

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.290 
which does have water in it the water
won't<00:02:08.050> be<00:02:08.200> able<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.710> penetrate<00:02:09.270> through<00:02:10.270> the

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
won't be able to penetrate through the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.500 
won't be able to penetrate through the
through<00:02:10.930> through<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.440> guards<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.220> in<00:02:12.970> and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
through through the guards and in and

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.020 
through through the guards and in and
into<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.530> paper<00:02:14.800> again<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.820> paper

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
into the paper again so that the paper

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.600 
into the paper again so that the paper
will<00:02:16.390> blister<00:02:17.140> up<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:20.410> these<00:02:20.860> gaps<00:02:21.190> here

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
will blister up so so these gaps here

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.540 
will blister up so so these gaps here
are<00:02:21.910> probably<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.960> 1/4<00:02:23.320> or<00:02:23.470> 1<00:02:24.130> inch

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
are probably like a 1/4 or 1 inch

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.370 
are probably like a 1/4 or 1 inch
so<00:02:24.670> before<00:02:25.120> we<00:02:25.300> tape<00:02:25.570> them<00:02:25.840> we're<00:02:26.200> going<00:02:26.320> to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
so before we tape them we're going to

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.370 
so before we tape them we're going to
have<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.860> pre<00:02:27.220> fill<00:02:27.490> them<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.420> if<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.230> can

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
have to pre fill them so if you can

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.250 
have to pre fill them so if you can
follow<00:02:29.590> me<00:02:29.860> into<00:02:30.460> this<00:02:30.760> room<00:02:31.090> right<00:02:31.420> here

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.070 

we're<00:02:35.260> going<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.440> make<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.740> a<00:02:35.770> point<00:02:36.130> PI<00:02:36.430> a

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
we're going to make it a point PI a

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.710 
we're going to make it a point PI a
because<00:02:38.080> because<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:39.400> when<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.300> mix<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.690> a

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
because because this when you mix the a

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.370 
because because this when you mix the a
-<00:02:41.020> 2<00:02:41.380> -<00:02:41.680> ah<00:02:41.709> -<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.190> gather<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:43.209> dries<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:43.930> up<00:02:44.080> 10

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
- 2 - ah - I gather it dries it up 10

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.170 
- 2 - ah - I gather it dries it up 10
minutes<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:44.770> what<00:02:44.890> we're<00:02:44.980> going<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.160> do<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.459> pre

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
minutes so what we're going to do is pre

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.420 
minutes so what we're going to do is pre
pre<00:02:46.570> fill<00:02:46.840> them<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.290> then<00:02:47.770> ten<00:02:48.070> minutes<00:02:48.100> later

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
pre fill them and then ten minutes later

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.160 
pre fill them and then ten minutes later
then<00:02:48.970> we're<00:02:49.120> going<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.270> tape<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.020> then

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
then we're going to tape it and then

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.550 
then we're going to tape it and then
after<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.740> we're<00:02:51.040> going<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.190> skim<00:02:51.760> coat<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.530> I

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
after that we're going to skim coat so I

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.040 
after that we're going to skim coat so I
have<00:02:53.830> my<00:02:54.160> four<00:02:54.910> inch<00:02:55.060> blade<00:02:55.300> here<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:55.959> have

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
have my four inch blade here and I have

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.350 
have my four inch blade here and I have
regular<00:02:56.290> all-purpose<00:02:56.740> joint<00:02:57.430> compound<00:02:58.000> in

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
regular all-purpose joint compound in

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:16.100 
regular all-purpose joint compound in
not<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:59.110> here

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.900 

now<00:03:17.110> I'm<00:03:17.200> going<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.410> carve<00:03:17.710> out<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.340> F<00:03:18.460> Center

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
now I'm going to carve out the F Center

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:36.450 
now I'm going to carve out the F Center
here<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.380> make<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.680> doughnut

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.740 

okay<00:03:37.460> and<00:03:37.640> then<00:03:37.790> we're<00:03:38.090> going<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.240> do<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.630> I'm

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
okay and then we're going to do is I'm

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.560 
okay and then we're going to do is I'm
going<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.900> pour<00:03:39.110> watt<00:03:39.440> water<00:03:39.890> in<00:03:40.160> here<00:03:40.570> and

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
going to pour watt water in here and

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.070 
going to pour watt water in here and
probably<00:03:41.870> pour<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:43.060> 1/4<00:03:44.060> of<00:03:44.420> an<00:03:44.540> inch<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.900> its

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
probably pour a 1/4 of an inch to its

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.500 
probably pour a 1/4 of an inch to its
way<00:03:45.350> through<00:03:45.710> half<00:03:45.800> inch<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.220> water<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:47.270> then

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
way through half inch of water and then

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.640 
way through half inch of water and then
I<00:03:47.870> have<00:03:48.260> Platt<00:03:49.190> plaster<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.140> Paris<00:03:51.140> and<00:03:51.380> on

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
I have Platt plaster of Paris and on

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.740 
I have Platt plaster of Paris and on
this<00:03:51.890> container<00:03:52.220> here<00:03:52.610> and<00:03:52.880> we're<00:03:53.600> going<00:03:53.690> to

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
this container here and we're going to

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.100 
this container here and we're going to
add<00:03:54.020> this<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.710> of<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.550> middle<00:03:55.880> of<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.990> I'm

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
add this to of the middle of it and I'm

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.740 
add this to of the middle of it and I'm
going<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.290> keep<00:03:57.470> adding<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:59.500> until<00:04:00.580> it<00:04:01.750> absorbs

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
going to keep adding it until it absorbs

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.590 
going to keep adding it until it absorbs
all<00:04:03.020> the<00:04:03.140> water<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:05.090> don't<00:04:05.240> want<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.450> get

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
all the water and you don't want to get

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.630 
all the water and you don't want to get
this<00:04:05.780> stuff<00:04:06.020> on<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.290> outside<00:04:07.010> of<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.310> banks

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
this stuff on the outside of the banks

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.449 
this stuff on the outside of the banks
because<00:04:07.940> then<00:04:08.150> you<00:04:08.360> get<00:04:08.540> chunks<00:04:09.290> in<00:04:09.620> all<00:04:10.340> your

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
because then you get chunks in all your

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.370 
because then you get chunks in all your
mud<00:04:10.670> so<00:04:11.239> I'm<00:04:11.330> going<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.480> use<00:04:11.600> my<00:04:11.810> finger<00:04:12.200> here

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
mud so I'm going to use my finger here

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.620 
mud so I'm going to use my finger here
to<00:04:12.530> spread<00:04:12.800> it<00:04:12.950> along<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.670> edges<00:04:14.120> here<00:04:14.420> and

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
to spread it along to the edges here and

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:27.580 
to spread it along to the edges here and
as<00:04:15.200> you<00:04:15.350> can<00:04:15.470> see<00:04:15.770> the<00:04:16.609> water<00:04:16.850> is<00:04:17.269> absorbing<00:04:17.900> it

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.310 

so<00:04:28.590> this<00:04:28.830> is<00:04:29.010> what<00:04:29.450> speeds<00:04:30.450> up<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:30.870> drying

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
so this is what speeds up the a drying

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.950 
so this is what speeds up the a drying
prop<00:04:31.770> prop<00:04:32.390> process<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:35.340> it's<00:04:36.300> great<00:04:36.600> for

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
prop prop process and it's great for

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
prop prop process and it's great for
projects<00:04:37.950> light<00:04:38.160> light<00:04:38.490> light<00:04:38.850> like<00:04:39.210> this

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
projects light light light like this

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.580 
projects light light light like this
because<00:04:40.980> you<00:04:41.130> can<00:04:41.160> do<00:04:41.430> several<00:04:42.030> coats<00:04:42.480> in<00:04:42.840> a

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
because you can do several coats in a

not one day so we're just going to let

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.070 
not one day so we're just going to let
this<00:04:46.440> sit<00:04:46.710> here<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:48.170> and<00:04:49.170> just<00:04:50.010> wait<00:04:50.220> for<00:04:50.250> uh

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
for this to a term gray hair and then

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.440 
for this to a term gray hair and then
once<00:04:54.810> it<00:04:54.960> does<00:04:55.140> turn<00:04:55.440> gray<00:04:56.270> we're<00:04:57.270> going<00:04:57.390> to

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
once it does turn gray we're going to

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.470 
once it does turn gray we're going to
take<00:04:57.660> a<00:04:57.690> piece<00:04:58.020> about<00:04:58.320> a<00:04:58.560> pie

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
take a piece about a pie

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.720 
take a piece about a pie
whatever<00:05:00.480> we're<00:05:00.780> going<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:00.990> mix<00:05:01.140> it<00:05:01.350> together

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
whatever we're going to mix it together

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.750 
whatever we're going to mix it together
and<00:05:03.110> then<00:05:04.110> transfer<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.850> wall<00:05:06.300> there

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
and then transfer that to the wall there

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.400 
and then transfer that to the wall there
okay<00:05:08.760> so<00:05:08.820> we've<00:05:09.090> given<00:05:09.240> this<00:05:09.510> a<00:05:09.720> few<00:05:10.110> minutes

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
okay so we've given this a few minutes

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.530 
okay so we've given this a few minutes
to<00:05:10.590> us<00:05:10.770> set<00:05:10.980> up<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:11.340> as<00:05:11.430> you<00:05:11.580> can<00:05:11.610> see<00:05:12.000> it<00:05:12.300> has

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
to us set up and as you can see it has

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.220 
to us set up and as you can see it has
turned<00:05:12.840> gray<00:05:13.110> so<00:05:14.360> that<00:05:15.360> tells<00:05:15.600> me<00:05:15.750> that<00:05:15.840> it's

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
turned gray so that tells me that it's

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.230 
turned gray so that tells me that it's
ready<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.650> uh<00:05:16.680> be<00:05:16.860> mixed<00:05:17.190> so<00:05:17.340> we're<00:05:18.090> going<00:05:18.180> to

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
take a piece a lot of pie here and mix

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:55.220 
take a piece a lot of pie here and mix
this<00:05:23.220> two<00:05:24.150> up<00:05:24.390> to<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:24.750> gather<00:05:25.110> here

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:19.909 

you

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.930 

ok<00:06:20.919> so<00:06:20.979> now<00:06:21.250> we're<00:06:21.460> going<00:06:21.490> to<00:06:21.639> do<00:06:21.729> is<00:06:21.820> we're

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
ok so now we're going to do is we're

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.180 
ok so now we're going to do is we're
going<00:06:21.970> to<00:06:22.090> transfer<00:06:22.630> this<00:06:22.810> to<00:06:23.139> the<00:06:23.620> wall<00:06:23.949> and

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
going to transfer this to the wall and

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:42.029 
going to transfer this to the wall and
pack<00:06:24.520> those<00:06:24.820> gaps<00:06:39.419> now<00:06:40.419> if<00:06:40.840> I<00:06:41.110> if<00:06:41.380> I<00:06:41.530> these<00:06:41.770> gaps

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 
pack those gaps now if I if I these gaps

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:44.820 
pack those gaps now if I if I these gaps
were<00:06:42.759> any<00:06:43.150> smaller<00:06:43.539> than<00:06:43.750> wouldn't<00:06:44.380> have<00:06:44.620> to

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
were any smaller than wouldn't have to

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.060 
were any smaller than wouldn't have to
pack<00:06:45.070> a<00:06:45.100> week<00:06:45.460> it<00:06:45.610> just<00:06:45.720> taper<00:06:46.740> but<00:06:47.740> since

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
pack a week it just taper but since

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.060 
pack a week it just taper but since
they're<00:06:48.400> so<00:06:48.820> why<00:06:49.169> you<00:06:50.169> want<00:06:50.410> you<00:06:50.620> want<00:06:50.830> to<00:06:50.889> make

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
they're so why you want you want to make

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.420 
they're so why you want you want to make
sure<00:06:51.100> both<00:06:52.090> happen<00:06:52.600> first<00:06:53.039> so<00:06:54.039> if<00:06:54.220> there's

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
sure both happen first so if there's

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:06.300 
sure both happen first so if there's
less<00:06:54.610> cracking<00:06:55.919> in<00:06:56.919> the<00:06:57.130> future<00:07:05.100> so<00:07:06.100> that<00:07:06.280> we

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
less cracking in the future so that we

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.040 
less cracking in the future so that we
all<00:07:06.490> have<00:07:06.520> to<00:07:06.880> sand<00:07:07.240> I<00:07:07.510> want<00:07:07.750> to<00:07:07.840> make<00:07:08.020> sure

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
all have to sand I want to make sure

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.150 
all have to sand I want to make sure
that<00:07:08.320> I'll<00:07:08.470> wipe<00:07:08.800> the<00:07:08.830> ends<00:07:09.760> here<00:07:11.010> so<00:07:12.010> that

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
that I'll wipe the ends here so that

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.140 
that I'll wipe the ends here so that
when<00:07:12.520> I<00:07:12.550> this<00:07:12.699> dries<00:07:13.860> double<00:07:14.860> you<00:07:14.949> know<00:07:14.979> cncn<00:07:15.940> a

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.150 
when I this dries double you know cncn a

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:26.370 
when I this dries double you know cncn a
involved<00:07:24.180> now<00:07:25.180> you<00:07:25.240> can<00:07:25.630> use<00:07:25.960> just<00:07:26.229> regular

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380 
involved now you can use just regular

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.450 
involved now you can use just regular
joint<00:07:27.130> compound<00:07:27.580> but<00:07:28.389> that<00:07:28.570> would<00:07:28.720> take<00:07:28.949> ya<00:07:29.949> a

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.460 
joint compound but that would take ya a

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.230 
joint compound but that would take ya a
long<00:07:31.150> time<00:07:31.419> to<00:07:31.599> dry<00:07:31.750> probably<00:07:32.260> oh<00:07:33.240> overnight

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 
long time to dry probably oh overnight

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.960 
long time to dry probably oh overnight
so<00:07:35.080> that's<00:07:35.500> why<00:07:35.680> were<00:07:35.979> and<00:07:36.280> use<00:07:36.430> this<00:07:36.729> right

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:36.970 
so that's why were and use this right

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.520 
so that's why were and use this right
here<00:07:37.889> and<00:07:38.889> this<00:07:39.280> stuff<00:07:39.580> dries<00:07:39.880> a<00:07:40.449> lot<00:07:41.169> stronger

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:41.530 
here and this stuff dries a lot stronger

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.410 
here and this stuff dries a lot stronger
than<00:07:41.770> I

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:43.420 
than I

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.100 
than I
normal<00:07:44.220> all-purpose<00:07:45.220> joint<00:07:45.610> out<00:07:45.930> because<00:07:46.930> it

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.110 
normal all-purpose joint out because it

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.350 
normal all-purpose joint out because it
