at<00:00:58.829> my<00:00:59.010> comics<00:00:59.609> top<00:00:59.910> 20<00:01:00.449> screener

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
at my comics top 20 screener

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.590 
at my comics top 20 screener
for<00:01:01.620> example<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.219> will<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> losers

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
for example you will see here the losers

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.210 
for example you will see here the losers
of<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.840> New<00:01:04.080> York<00:01:04.320> Stock<00:01:04.589> Exchange<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.159> of

course I have the Nasdaq users and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.800 
course I have the Nasdaq users and
gainers<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.150> often<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
gainers and so on so this is often a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.539
