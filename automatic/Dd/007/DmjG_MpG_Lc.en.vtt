00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 then people some of that there is no 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.839
 necessarily but for example they envy 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.160
 he finds in his face I say he's going to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.860
 it's going to be difficult to take half 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.030
 operating 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.030
 but no 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.120
 Well, what I see in vivian is that it brings 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.800
 about one and a half kilograms of silicone 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:27.160
 botox 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:32.019
 and the Russians that I care the most 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.269
 grouping I do not know why but I do not know 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:37.410
 if it's because he does not know how to shout that 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.410
 have a boyfriend or something 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.750
 on the sides for nothing I have to start 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.579
 We do not understand that there is as I scream 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.500
 I do not have to scream if I have one thing 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.899
 but she wants or already wants to be 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.769
 settle a relationship but as you go 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.769
 very difficult because how are you doing wrong 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.990

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.440
 other things 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.980

 I do not know why why why 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.100
 because no man has seen if so 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.530
 intense as you do not because it's the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 Communication has to be after 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.189

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.189
 1500 grams 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.920
