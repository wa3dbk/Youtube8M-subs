00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:02.179
 If an island like Haiti 

00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:05.469
 he had several hundred million dollars 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.966
 but they would continue to push more money 

00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:10.409
 than what they cover things they have, or gold. 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.049
 Then the money has no value. If a small island, let's say 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.195
 St. Croix printed a lot of money and came to America 

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:20.059
 and tried to buy things for them (they would print them day and night) 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.939
 money is not covered, so they have nothing. 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.229
 Our entire banking system is downright corrupt. 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.739
 Our money lending institutions have screwed up the system. 

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.229
 But there is no one to tell you what's wrong with him. 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.014
 So you will be fine. 

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:35.339
 State debt has grown into monstrous proportions 

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:37.242
 on debt ratios. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.090
 Failed systems 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.300
 None of the world's economic systems has eliminated our most desperate problems. 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.245
 To date, all social arrangements are still plagued by war 

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:55.067
 poverty, crime, racism, elitism and above all: 

00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:58.691
 lack 

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.338
 There is no way to make this system fair. 

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:05.041
 We must create a system that guarantees human rights. 

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.981
 Where everyone has free access to goods and services 

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.819
 you do not have to fight for women's rights or the rights of blacks; 

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:14.145
 it is automatic in a company that is set up in this way. 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.754
 Today we have highly advanced technology, but our social technology 

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:21.945
 and the economic system does not keep pace with our technological capabilities 

00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:25.516
 that could otherwise easily create a world of abundance for all people 

00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:27.666
 without serfdom and debt. 

00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:30.802
 This system will still introduce more and more automation 

00:01:30.942 --> 00:01:34.118
 to cut the purchasing power of most people. 

00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:38.046
 Our work is not taken by China or India 

00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:40.234
 machine beat man. 

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:43.659
 The time called the Gaussian curve comes 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.945
 where such employment is, production is like this 

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:50.277
 and purchasing power such. The system stops. 

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:53.249
 Company alternative 

00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:58.048
 Our problems and their solutions are technical, not political. 

00:01:58.664 --> 00:02:02.042
 Most of the problem can be solved by using science and technology 

00:02:02.182 --> 00:02:06.328
 with regard to man and the environment to serve all people 

00:02:06.468 --> 00:02:08.321
 and not just a few. 

00:02:08.777 --> 00:02:13.112
 It will be based on the form of dynamic balance. 

00:02:13.252 --> 00:02:17.722
 This means the functioning of everything at its highest potential 

00:02:18.323 --> 00:02:21.272
 without destroying the environment. 

00:02:21.864 --> 00:02:27.179
 Letting science and technology flow freely into our social system 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.961
 without restrictions by market, finances 

00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:34.822
 patents, we can achieve a very high standard of living 

00:02:34.962 --> 00:02:37.472
 in a very short time. 

00:02:38.543 --> 00:02:43.699
 We have brains, know-how, technology, ability to perform and 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.672
 to create a completely new civilization. 

00:02:46.882 --> 00:02:50.078
 Paradise or complete decay 

00:02:50.218 --> 00:02:54.615
