big germs garage here and we're working

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.030 
big germs garage here and we're working
on<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.700> Polaris<00:00:03.060> Phoenix<00:00:03.449> this<00:00:04.290> is<00:00:04.410> part<00:00:04.650> 2<00:00:04.830> so

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
on the Polaris Phoenix this is part 2 so

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.769 
on the Polaris Phoenix this is part 2 so
go<00:00:05.130> back<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.400> watch<00:00:05.490> part<00:00:05.700> 1<00:00:05.910> here<00:00:06.480> we<00:00:06.660> have

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
go back and watch part 1 here we have

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.160 
go back and watch part 1 here we have
the<00:00:06.899> shift<00:00:07.560> fork<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.099> old<00:00:08.250> shift<00:00:08.550> ratchet

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
the shift fork and the old shift ratchet

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.419 
the shift fork and the old shift ratchet
you<00:00:10.170> still<00:00:10.380> going<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.620> wear<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.950> tear<00:00:11.099> there

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
you still going to wear and tear there

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.879 
you still going to wear and tear there
we<00:00:12.120> actually<00:00:12.509> ordered<00:00:12.900> new<00:00:13.290> ones<00:00:13.530> here's<00:00:13.830> a

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
we actually ordered new ones here's a

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.120 
we actually ordered new ones here's a
new<00:00:14.099> shift<00:00:14.340> ratchet<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.969> new<00:00:15.150> shift<00:00:15.420> fork

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
new shift ratchet and new shift fork

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.420 
new shift ratchet and new shift fork
these<00:00:17.130> two<00:00:17.340> are<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> lot<00:00:17.850> snugger<00:00:18.359> fit<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:19.430> seem

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
these two are a lot snugger fit and seem

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.320 
these two are a lot snugger fit and seem
to<00:00:20.550> actually<00:00:20.670> fix<00:00:21.180> our<00:00:21.359> problem<00:00:23.000> if<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.150> watch

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
to actually fix our problem if you watch

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.929 
to actually fix our problem if you watch
part<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.830> can<00:00:26.010> see<00:00:26.220> where<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.640> weren't

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
part one you can see where we weren't

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.160 
part one you can see where we weren't
really<00:00:27.119> sure<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.420> problem<00:00:27.779> was<00:00:27.930> but

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
really sure what the problem was but

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.839 
really sure what the problem was but
when<00:00:28.470> took<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.740> apart<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.130> gears<00:00:29.369> seem<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.730> be

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
when took it apart the gears seem to be

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.040 
when took it apart the gears seem to be
fine

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
fine

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.350 
fine
the<00:00:31.349> problem<00:00:31.769> look<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.120> shift

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the problem look like that the shift

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.810 
the problem look like that the shift
fork<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:34.500> had<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> little<00:00:35.100> bit<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.280> wear<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.460> it

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
fork just had a little bit of wear to it

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.720 
fork just had a little bit of wear to it
and<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.320> shift<00:00:37.320> ratchet<00:00:37.710> also<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.340> went<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
and a shift ratchet also so we went and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.470 
and a shift ratchet also so we went and
replace<00:00:39.030> both<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:41.090> there<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.270> see<00:00:42.450> that

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
replace both of them there you see that

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.479 
replace both of them there you see that
the<00:00:42.780> bigger<00:00:43.350> gear<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:43.860> left<00:00:44.070> there<00:00:44.340> is

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the bigger gear to your left there is

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
the bigger gear to your left there is
for<00:00:44.760> reverse<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> right<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.960> forward

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
for reverse one to the right is forward

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.500 
for reverse one to the right is forward
on<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> shift<00:00:47.550> ratchet<00:00:47.940> goes<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> middle

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
on the shift ratchet goes in the middle

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.940 
on the shift ratchet goes in the middle
with<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.809> shift<00:00:49.110> fork<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.649> down<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
with the shift fork going down to the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.020 
with the shift fork going down to the
shift<00:00:50.190> shaft<00:00:50.340> which<00:00:51.059> causes<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.570> shift

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
shift shaft which causes it to shift

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.189 
shift shaft which causes it to shift
here<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.120> are<00:00:54.270> shifting<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.750> sum<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:57.020> think<00:00:58.020> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
here we are shifting the sum I think so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.770 
here we are shifting the sum I think so
you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.620> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.140 

the<00:01:04.290> problem<00:01:04.800> if<00:01:04.950> you<00:01:05.040> watch<00:01:05.190> part<00:01:05.520> one<00:01:05.700> you

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the problem if you watch part one you

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.330 
the problem if you watch part one you
would<00:01:06.300> up<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.590> full<00:01:08.010> wheel<00:01:08.160> we're

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
would up see the the full wheel we're

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.370 
would up see the the full wheel we're
going<00:01:08.550> to<00:01:08.670> reverse<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.240> work<00:01:09.360> fine<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.260> when

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
going to reverse and work fine but when

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.110 
going to reverse and work fine but when
you<00:01:10.440> put<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> forward<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.760> would<00:01:11.970> just

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
you put it in the forward it would just

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.120 
you put it in the forward it would just
sit<00:01:12.240> there<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.480> grunt<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.410> sound<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.860> gears

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
sit there and grunt the sound like gears

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.100 
sit there and grunt the sound like gears
grinding<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> wouldn't<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.480> anything<00:01:15.840> but

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
grinding and it wouldn't do anything but

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.930 
grinding and it wouldn't do anything but
um<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.830> said<00:01:17.010> once<00:01:17.160> we<00:01:17.250> took<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.580> apart<00:01:17.790> we

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
um like I said once we took it apart we

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.580 
um like I said once we took it apart we
notice<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.510> gears<00:01:18.750> were<00:01:18.960> okay<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
notice that all the gears were okay and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
notice that all the gears were okay and
uh<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.820> shift<00:01:21.090> shaft

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
uh the shift shaft

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.650 
uh the shift shaft
I<00:01:21.780> mean<00:01:22.110> shift<00:01:22.440> fork<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.580> ratchet<00:01:24.300> seem<00:01:24.510> to

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
I mean shift fork and I ratchet seem to

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.440 
I mean shift fork and I ratchet seem to
be<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> problem<00:01:26.910> was<00:01:27.060> just

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
be with the what the problem was just

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.880 
be with the what the problem was just
seemed<00:01:28.050> to<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> little<00:01:28.530> bit<00:01:28.590> wear<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
seemed to have a little bit wear and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.280 
seemed to have a little bit wear and
tear

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
tear

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.090 
tear
all<00:01:31.290> right<00:01:31.410> here<00:01:31.560> we're<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.830> get<00:01:31.980> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
all right here we're going to get the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.490 
all right here we're going to get the
transmission<00:01:32.880> back<00:01:33.060> together<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:34.200> got<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
transmission back together we got the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.740 
transmission back together we got the
new<00:01:34.650> shift<00:01:34.950> ratchet<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.550> new<00:01:35.790> shift<00:01:36.330> fork<00:01:36.600> in

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
new shift ratchet and new shift fork in

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.420 
new shift ratchet and new shift fork in
there<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:39.030> took<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.300> little<00:01:40.250> moving<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.340> around

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
there it took a little moving it around

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.510 
there it took a little moving it around
to<00:01:41.760> get<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.060> actually<00:01:42.479> fit<00:01:42.720> into<00:01:42.869> place<00:01:43.520> but

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
to get to actually fit into place but

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.450 
to get to actually fit into place but
the<00:01:45.030> gasket<00:01:45.540> was<00:01:45.720> not<00:01:46.590> damaged<00:01:47.130> when<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.340> took

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the gasket was not damaged when we took

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.210 
the gasket was not damaged when we took
it<00:01:47.610> apart<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.180> were<00:01:48.240> able<00:01:48.300> to<00:01:48.390> reuse<00:01:48.750> that

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
it apart so we were able to reuse that

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.910 
it apart so we were able to reuse that
so<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.280> got<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.550> back<00:01:50.759> together<00:01:50.940> and<00:01:51.920> we'll

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
so we got this back together and we'll

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.230 
so we got this back together and we'll
you're<00:01:53.250> ready<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.520> put<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.670> back<00:01:53.880> into<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you're ready to put it back into the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:16.670 
you're ready to put it back into the
frame<00:02:14.540> prior<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.810> putting<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.200> engine<00:02:16.530> back

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
frame prior to putting the engine back

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.250 
frame prior to putting the engine back
into<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.100> frame<00:02:17.390> we<00:02:18.390> decided<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.959> drill<00:02:19.230> a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
into the frame we decided to drill a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.759 
into the frame we decided to drill a
small<00:02:20.010> hole<00:02:20.220> into<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.120> bottom<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.810> drive

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
small hole into the bottom of the drive

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.780 
small hole into the bottom of the drive
shaft<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:25.170> seemed<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.530> collect<00:02:25.860> some<00:02:26.100> some

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
shaft it seemed to collect some some

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.970 
shaft it seemed to collect some some
water<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.239> there<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:28.110> little<00:02:28.590> tiny<00:02:28.769> hole

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
water in there so a little tiny hole

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.220 
water in there so a little tiny hole
will<00:02:29.220> allow<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.550> out<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:30.120> water<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.840> drain<00:02:31.050> out

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
will allow the out to water to drain out

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
will allow the out to water to drain out
of<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.410> half<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.800> get<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.010> there<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
of the half is to get in there in the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.560 
of the half is to get in there in the
future

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
future

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.630 
future
the<00:02:33.930> boot<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.440> goes<00:02:34.799> from<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.130> drive<00:02:35.340> shaft

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
the boot that goes from the drive shaft

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.390 
the boot that goes from the drive shaft
over<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> covers<00:02:36.720> up<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.160> guess<00:02:38.160> when<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
over the covers up the guess when the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.509 
over the covers up the guess when the
drops<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.730> up<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.000> engine<00:02:39.360> was<00:02:39.900> replaced

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
drops you up to the engine was replaced

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.710 
drops you up to the engine was replaced
so<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.700> mean<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:41.970> was<00:02:42.120> probably<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.480> cause

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
so I mean that was probably the cause

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.970 
so I mean that was probably the cause
for<00:02:42.930> water<00:02:43.110> getting<00:02:43.320> there<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.590> first

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
for water getting there in the first

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.830 
for water getting there in the first
place<00:02:44.610> but<00:02:45.330> um

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
place but um

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.690 
place but um
they<00:02:46.470> never<00:02:46.709> replace<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.250> we<00:02:47.370> decided<00:02:47.640> to

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
they never replace that we decided to

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.759 
they never replace that we decided to
put<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> small<00:02:48.150> hole<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.930> allow<00:02:49.440> water<00:02:49.680> to

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
put a small hole in to allow water to

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.750 
put a small hole in to allow water to
drain<00:02:50.070> out<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.489> future

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.099 

I'm<00:02:57.760> still<00:02:58.000> not<00:02:58.120> used<00:02:58.329> to<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.599> hemp<00:02:58.810> how<00:02:58.989> my

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
I'm still not used to the hemp how my

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.179

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
the engine put in the frame my

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.750 
the engine put in the frame my
suggestion<00:03:17.859> if<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.129> have<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.370> do<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:18.579> to

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
to be anywhere near as long as it

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.270 
to be anywhere near as long as it
actually<00:03:28.659> took<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.049> get<00:03:29.139> it<00:03:29.200> in

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
actually took to get it in

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.970 
actually took to get it in
I<00:03:30.340> actually<00:03:30.939> edited<00:03:31.569> out<00:03:31.750> about<00:03:32.230> 20<00:03:32.680> minutes

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
I actually edited out about 20 minutes

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.520 
I actually edited out about 20 minutes
or<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:33.579> a<00:03:33.609> video<00:03:33.970> where<00:03:34.959> we<00:03:35.079> were<00:03:35.200> trying<00:03:35.349> to

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
or so a video where we were trying to

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.679 
or so a video where we were trying to
get<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:35.769> this<00:03:36.189> motor<00:03:36.519> into<00:03:36.790> place<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.569> is

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
get this this motor into place it is

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.869 
get this this motor into place it is
such<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> tight<00:03:38.139> fit<00:03:38.409> by<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.310> head<00:03:39.609> on<00:03:39.790> the

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
such a tight fit by the head on the

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.809 
such a tight fit by the head on the
frame<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:41.650> we<00:03:41.739> struggled<00:03:42.340> with<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:42.639> mean

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
frame that we struggled with it I mean

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.149 
frame that we struggled with it I mean
at<00:03:43.000> one<00:03:43.150> point<00:03:43.180> we<00:03:43.510> actually<00:03:43.540> stopped<00:03:44.230> trying

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
at one point we actually stopped trying

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.909 
at one point we actually stopped trying
to<00:03:45.310> uh<00:03:45.659> we<00:03:46.659> were<00:03:46.750> we<00:03:47.079> were<00:03:47.349> sure<00:03:47.530> what<00:03:47.709> that

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
to uh we were we were sure what that

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.770 
to uh we were we were sure what that
what<00:03:48.129> what<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.489> do<00:03:48.609> or<00:03:48.790> which<00:03:49.120> direction<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.540> go

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
what what to do or which direction to go

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.589 
what what to do or which direction to go
get<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.709> fit<00:03:50.919> and<00:03:51.909> we<00:03:52.000> tried<00:03:52.239> coming<00:03:52.540> in

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
get it to fit and we tried coming in

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.979 
get it to fit and we tried coming in
from<00:03:52.719> different<00:03:53.019> sides<00:03:53.230> but<00:03:54.219> uh<00:03:54.870> finally<00:03:55.870> we

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
from different sides but uh finally we

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.839

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
alright so here we got the engine in

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.110 
alright so here we got the engine in
place<00:04:47.350> here's<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.520> show<00:04:48.580> you<00:04:48.760> how<00:04:48.910> much<00:04:49.060> room

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
hopefully we don't get water collecting

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.700 
hopefully we don't get water collecting
in<00:04:58.090> there<00:04:58.210> anymore

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
once again here's how tight it is up at

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.660 
once again here's how tight it is up at
the<00:05:01.720> top<00:05:01.960> that<00:05:02.230> was<00:05:02.710> that's<00:05:03.130> what<00:05:03.310> was<00:05:03.430> giving

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
the top that was that's what was giving

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.100 
the top that was that's what was giving
us<00:05:03.760> the<00:05:03.880> trouble<00:05:04.210> with<00:05:04.330> getting<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:04.900> engine

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
us the trouble with getting the engine

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.610 
us the trouble with getting the engine
back<00:05:05.320> into<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.800> into<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:06.850> frame<00:05:10.260> so<00:05:11.260> in<00:05:11.530> the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
back into the into the frame so in the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.900 
back into the into the frame so in the
video<00:05:11.710> I<00:05:11.860> left<00:05:12.100> out<00:05:12.250> all<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.490> part<00:05:12.730> I'm

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
video I left out all the part I'm

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.180 
video I left out all the part I'm
putting<00:05:13.180> everything<00:05:13.510> else<00:05:13.660> back<00:05:13.810> on<00:05:14.170> it<00:05:14.320> the

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
putting everything else back on it the

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.710 
putting everything else back on it the
next<00:05:15.490> couple<00:05:15.880> clips<00:05:16.150> you're<00:05:16.240> going<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.420> see<00:05:16.570> is

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
next couple clips you're going to see is

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.680 
next couple clips you're going to see is
it<00:05:16.930> actually<00:05:17.440> in<00:05:17.590> action<00:05:18.010> from<00:05:18.540> being<00:05:19.540> put

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
it actually in action from being put

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.510 
it actually in action from being put
back<00:05:19.780> together<00:05:19.960> so<00:05:20.680> as<00:05:20.770> you<00:05:20.950> can<00:05:21.010> see<00:05:21.070> here<00:05:21.400> we

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
back together so as you can see here we

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.130 
back together so as you can see here we
got<00:05:21.550> it<00:05:21.700> in<00:05:21.880> reverse<00:05:22.000> which<00:05:22.690> it<00:05:22.840> would<00:05:22.990> do

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
got it in reverse which it would do

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.770 
got it in reverse which it would do
before<00:05:23.290> part<00:05:24.040> one<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:25.390> now<00:05:25.480> he's<00:05:25.630> going<00:05:25.720> to

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
before part one and now he's going to

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.090 
before part one and now he's going to
put<00:05:25.840> it<00:05:25.990> into<00:05:26.140> forward<00:05:26.530> so<00:05:26.650> you<00:05:26.740> can<00:05:26.770> see<00:05:26.950> that

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
put it into forward so you can see that

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.429 
put it into forward so you can see that
it<00:05:27.160> did<00:05:27.400> does<00:05:27.760> shift

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:31.439 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:36.139 

so<00:05:33.589> from<00:05:34.589> what<00:05:34.709> you<00:05:34.830> can<00:05:34.979> see<00:05:35.159> they<00:05:35.399> a<00:05:35.429> little

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:36.149 
so from what you can see they a little

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:37.399 
so from what you can see they a little
bit<00:05:36.269> of<00:05:36.330> a<00:05:36.389> problem<00:05:36.659> we<00:05:36.839> had<00:05:37.019> with<00:05:37.259> the

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
bit of a problem we had with the

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:39.949 
bit of a problem we had with the
shifting<00:05:38.399> in<00:05:38.489> the<00:05:38.580> reverse<00:05:38.939> with<00:05:39.209> no<00:05:39.360> forward

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:39.959 
shifting in the reverse with no forward

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:43.489 
shifting in the reverse with no forward
shifting<00:05:40.879> was<00:05:41.879> fixed<00:05:42.419> by<00:05:42.599> replacing<00:05:43.019> the

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:43.499 
shifting was fixed by replacing the

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:45.259 
shifting was fixed by replacing the
shift<00:05:43.739> fork<00:05:44.009> in<00:05:44.189> the<00:05:44.399> shift<00:05:44.639> ratchet<00:05:45.089> I

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:45.269 
shift fork in the shift ratchet I

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:47.540 
shift fork in the shift ratchet I
believe<00:05:46.229> both<00:05:46.439> parts<00:05:46.830> together<00:05:46.949> plus<00:05:47.399> a

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
believe both parts together plus a

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.979 
believe both parts together plus a
couple<00:05:47.699> little<00:05:47.879> asanas<00:05:48.449> we<00:05:48.659> replaced<00:05:49.349> it<00:05:50.989> it

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:51.989 
couple little asanas we replaced it it

00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:54.649 
couple little asanas we replaced it it
was<00:05:52.229> less<00:05:52.409> than<00:05:52.529> 100<00:05:52.830> bucks<00:05:53.009> I<00:05:53.909> don't<00:05:54.269> know<00:05:54.479> how
