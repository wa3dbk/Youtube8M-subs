00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
is that you can engage electric mode

driving<00:03:21.239> in<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.599> city<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.109> it<00:03:22.200> uses<00:03:22.379> its<00:03:22.650> range

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
driving in the city so it uses its range

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
downtown into the city you can put on

tell you that on the way to the office

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.390 
tell you that on the way to the office
in<00:04:09.750> this<00:04:09.900> car<00:04:10.169> with<00:04:10.319> it<00:04:10.409> fully<00:04:10.680> charged<00:04:11.220> I

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
in this car with it fully charged I

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.759 
in this car with it fully charged I
managed<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.000> get<00:04:12.180> sixty<00:04:12.989> three<00:04:13.349> and<00:04:13.379> a<00:04:13.590> half

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
managed to get sixty three and a half

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.039 
managed to get sixty three and a half
miles<00:04:14.310> per<00:04:14.579> gallon<00:04:14.879> which<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.269> very

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
miles per gallon which is very

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.080 
miles per gallon which is very
impressive<00:04:16.829> now<00:04:17.400> if<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.699> have<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.849> much

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
impressive now if you have a much

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.659 
impressive now if you have a much
shorter<00:04:18.500> distance<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.590> go<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:20.220> will<00:04:20.370> actually

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
shorter distance to go you will actually

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.670 
shorter distance to go you will actually
improve<00:04:20.760> that<00:04:21.299> number<00:04:21.359> quite<00:04:22.139> a<00:04:22.169> bit<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.620> I

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
improve that number quite a bit and I

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.379 
improve that number quite a bit and I
suspect<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.280> anyone<00:04:23.699> who<00:04:23.820> has<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.030> commute

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
suspect that anyone who has a commute

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.480 
suspect that anyone who has a commute
somewhere<00:04:24.690> around<00:04:24.750> 20<00:04:25.229> miles<00:04:25.409> should<00:04:26.130> get

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
somewhere around 20 miles should get

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.730 
somewhere around 20 miles should get

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
gallon just like Toyota claims in fact I

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.899 
gallon just like Toyota claims in fact I
took<00:04:31.229> a<00:04:31.380> short<00:04:31.800> drive<00:04:32.010> today<00:04:32.310> of<00:04:32.550> maybe<00:04:32.789> just

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
took a short drive today of maybe just

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.020 
took a short drive today of maybe just
ten<00:04:33.389> miles<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:34.080> got<00:04:34.260> 96<00:04:35.130> miles<00:04:35.490> per<00:04:35.729> gallon

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
ten miles and I got 96 miles per gallon

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
in the city and here's one of the really

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.600 
in the city and here's one of the really
important<00:04:42.840> things<00:04:42.900> about<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.949> Prius<00:04:44.310> plug-in

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
important things about the Prius plug-in

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.879 
important things about the Prius plug-in
hybrid<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.330> that's<00:04:45.780> that<00:04:46.050> when<00:04:46.260> you're<00:04:46.500> not

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
hybrid and that's that when you're not

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.969 
hybrid and that's that when you're not
using<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.940> electric<00:04:48.570> mode<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:49.260> just<00:04:49.349> reverts

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
using the electric mode it just reverts

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.430 
using the electric mode it just reverts
to<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.340> conventional<00:04:51.210> Prius<00:04:51.750> which<00:04:51.960> means<00:04:52.199> that

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
to a conventional Prius which means that

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.030 
to a conventional Prius which means that

that<00:05:12.990> warm<00:05:13.350> and<00:05:13.620> I'll<00:05:13.920> tell<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:14.280> why<00:05:14.460> I<00:05:14.760> took<00:05:15.150> a

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
that warm and I'll tell you why I took a

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.350 
that warm and I'll tell you why I took a

short 3.2 mile round trip and the

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.630 
short 3.2 mile round trip and the
problem<00:05:18.840> is<00:05:19.020> it<00:05:19.230> was<00:05:19.260> relatively<00:05:19.830> cool<00:05:20.220> out<00:05:20.490> so

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
problem is it was relatively cool out so

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.580 
problem is it was relatively cool out so
what<00:05:20.760> happens<00:05:21.060> is<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.450> gas<00:05:21.720> engine<00:05:22.020> wants<00:05:22.500> to

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
what happens is the gas engine wants to

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.140 
what happens is the gas engine wants to
come<00:05:22.740> on<00:05:22.890> to<00:05:23.250> warm<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.730> car<00:05:23.970> up<00:05:24.000> to

starting<00:05:38.430> with<00:05:38.580> charge<00:05:39.150> time<00:05:39.540> the<00:05:39.960> car<00:05:40.230> takes

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
starting with charge time the car takes

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.670

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
with a fast charger but another good

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.380 
with a fast charger but another good
point<00:05:46.470> is<00:05:46.650> that<00:05:46.710> it<00:05:46.920> only<00:05:47.160> takes<00:05:47.580> a<00:05:47.760> reasonable

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
point is that it only takes a reasonable

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.600 
point is that it only takes a reasonable
three<00:05:48.720> hours<00:05:49.080> with<00:05:49.260> a<00:05:49.290> conventional<00:05:49.830> wall

California<00:06:31.700> so<00:06:32.700> is<00:06:32.820> it<00:06:32.940> worth<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.410> $5,000

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
California so is it worth the $5,000

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.250 
California so is it worth the $5,000
premium<00:06:35.010> over<00:06:35.160> a<00:06:35.430> conventional<00:06:35.790> Prius<00:06:36.660> well
