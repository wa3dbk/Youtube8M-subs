00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
I don't know if that's true because I

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.189 
I don't know if that's true because I
didn't<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.640> any<00:00:17.820> problems<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.750> I'm<00:00:19.020> pretty

going to make your way through all the
stuff<00:00:37.399> going<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.489> kind<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> come<00:00:38.879> around

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
stuff going to kind of come around

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.910 
stuff going to kind of come around
through<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:40.070> around<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.280> way<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.920> you're

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
through here around this way and you're

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010 
through here around this way and you're
going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.100> make<00:00:44.309> your<00:00:44.550> way<00:00:44.700> into<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.570> crypts

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and once you're in here you're going to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.279 
and once you're in here you're going to
make<00:00:49.620> your<00:00:49.770> way<00:00:49.890> over<00:00:49.920> through<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.789> way

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
make your way over through this way

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:58.599 
make your way over through this way
we're<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.350> Stanton

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.220 

so<00:00:59.120> you'll<00:00:59.420> make<00:00:59.570> your<00:00:59.719> way<00:00:59.809> through<00:00:59.839> there

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
so you'll make your way through there

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.819 
so you'll make your way through there
and<00:01:00.559> that's<00:01:00.769> where<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.039> actual<00:01:01.159> word<00:01:01.609> will<00:01:01.850> be

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
and that's where the actual word will be

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.049 
and that's where the actual word will be
so<00:01:03.829> then<00:01:04.009> all<00:01:04.129> you<00:01:04.220> got<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.430> do<00:01:04.489> is<00:01:04.610> connect<00:01:04.939> it

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
so then all you got to do is connect it

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:14.440 
so then all you got to do is connect it
again<00:01:05.210> it

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.520 

this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> nice<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.049> we're<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> do

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
this is the nice one we're going to do

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
this is the nice one we're going to do
to<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> autumn<00:01:17.280> Watchtower<00:01:17.789> so<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.420> pretty

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
to it autumn Watchtower so that's pretty

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.859 
to it autumn Watchtower so that's pretty
easy<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:20.280> live<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.729> plotting<00:01:21.329> the<00:01:21.479> dragon

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
easy and I live in plotting the dragon

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.460 
easy and I live in plotting the dragon
so<00:01:22.740> starting<00:01:23.460> from<00:01:23.579> up<00:01:23.759> there<00:01:24.229> it's<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.380> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
so starting from up there it's going to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.069 
so starting from up there it's going to
be<00:01:25.560> down<00:01:25.710> here<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:26.039> this<00:01:26.130> little<00:01:26.189> corner<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
be down here in this little corner and

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.210 
be down here in this little corner and
you<00:01:28.079> can<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.229> Rifton<00:01:28.740> right<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.039> it's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
you can see Rifton right there it's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.219 
you can see Rifton right there it's
going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> be<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.759> directly<00:01:30.299> west<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.990> rift

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
going to be like directly west of rift

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.149 
going to be like directly west of rift
in<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:34.049> you'll<00:01:34.289> catch<00:01:34.500> some<00:01:34.679> of<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.890> stuff

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
in so you'll catch some of this stuff

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:45.700 
in so you'll catch some of this stuff
and<00:01:35.399> that's<00:01:35.579> worth<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.960

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
so once you're here you're going to make

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.670 
so once you're here you're going to make
your<00:01:48.150> way<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.200> tower<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.920> left<00:01:51.680> is

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
your way to this tower on the left is

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.450 
your way to this tower on the left is
the<00:01:52.890> one<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:55.369> you're<00:01:56.369> just

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the one on the right and you're just

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:07.750 
the one on the right and you're just
going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.640> make<00:01:56.759> your<00:01:56.939> way<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.360> top

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.340 

and<00:02:08.300> once<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.540> get<00:02:08.630> up<00:02:08.780> here<00:02:08.990> you're<00:02:09.170> going<00:02:09.260> to

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
cross this little bridge and the word

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.020 
cross this little bridge and the word
wall<00:02:11.000> will<00:02:11.150> be<00:02:11.270> right<00:02:11.450> here<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:15.790> don't<00:02:16.790> know<00:02:16.940> if

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
wall will be right here I don't know if

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.520 
wall will be right here I don't know if
this<00:02:17.150> will<00:02:17.300> help<00:02:17.360> you're<00:02:17.660> not<00:02:17.750> that's<00:02:18.140> kind<00:02:18.410> of

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.010 
so this is going to be the last one that
we're<00:02:37.880> going<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.060> be<00:02:38.270> in<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.690> it's<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:38.930> the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
we're going to be in and it's in the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
to take a wild guess and say you

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.650 
to take a wild guess and say you
actually<00:02:42.770> have<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.070> be<00:02:43.190> part<00:02:43.460> of<00:02:43.550> them<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.570> you
