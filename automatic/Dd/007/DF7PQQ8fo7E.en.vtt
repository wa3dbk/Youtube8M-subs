there<00:00:29.880> you'll<00:00:30.240> also<00:00:30.419> notice<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.900> styling

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
there you'll also notice that styling

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.630 
there you'll also notice that styling
wise<00:00:31.589> you<00:00:32.009> get<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> lot<00:00:32.340> more<00:00:32.490> protection

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
wise you get a lot more protection

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.850 
wise you get a lot more protection
around<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.240> temporal<00:00:33.780> region<00:00:34.470> of<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> head

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
around the temporal region of the head

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.140 
around the temporal region of the head
and<00:00:35.070> then<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.490> back<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.850> occipital

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
and then in the back the occipital

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.120 
and then in the back the occipital
region<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.750> tends<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.050> sit<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> lot<00:00:37.590> lower<00:00:37.860> on

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
region so it tends to sit a lot lower on

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.460 
region so it tends to sit a lot lower on
your<00:00:38.580> head<00:00:38.730> than<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.970> lot<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.240> other<00:00:39.750> rode

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
your head than a lot of other rode

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.050 
your head than a lot of other rode
helmets<00:00:40.890> they<00:00:41.010> use<00:00:41.160> what's<00:00:41.430> called<00:00:41.490> a<00:00:41.670> unibody

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
helmets they use what's called a unibody

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.580 
helmets they use what's called a unibody
construction<00:00:42.240> so<00:00:42.900> this<00:00:43.050> outer<00:00:43.260> shell<00:00:43.560> is

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
construction so this outer shell is

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.080 
construction so this outer shell is
actually<00:00:44.010> structural<00:00:44.550> kind<00:00:44.790> of<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:44.940> an

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
actually structural kind of like an

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.300 
actually structural kind of like an
insect's<00:00:45.750> exoskeleton<00:00:45.870> what<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.950> does<00:00:47.130> is

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
insect's exoskeleton what that does is

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.550 
insect's exoskeleton what that does is
allows<00:00:47.550> them<00:00:47.790> to<00:00:47.910> use<00:00:47.940> lighter<00:00:48.750> weight<00:00:49.080> EPS

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
allows them to use lighter weight EPS

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.070 
allows them to use lighter weight EPS
foam<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.730> helmet<00:00:51.120> which<00:00:51.270> transmits<00:00:51.810> less

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
foam in the helmet which transmits less

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.470 
foam in the helmet which transmits less
crash<00:00:52.440> energy<00:00:52.950> to<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.880> rider<00:00:54.150> that's<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
crash energy to the rider that's a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.630 
crash energy to the rider that's a
really<00:00:54.720> nice<00:00:54.810> feature<00:00:55.080> 20<00:00:55.710> massive<00:00:56.280> vents<00:00:56.550> so

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
really nice feature 20 massive vents so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.800 
really nice feature 20 massive vents so
this<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.880> going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.570> lightweight

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
this is going to be a really lightweight

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.840 
this is going to be a really lightweight
helmet<00:00:58.200> we<00:00:58.650> have<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.860> nice<00:00:59.100> strap<00:00:59.640> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
helmet we have this nice strap and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.970 
helmet we have this nice strap and
buckle<00:00:59.910> assembly<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.290> their<00:01:01.470> patented

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
buckle assembly and then their patented

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.249 
buckle assembly and then their patented
micro<00:01:02.670> ratcheting<00:01:03.480> system<00:01:03.630> allows<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
micro ratcheting system allows you to

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.200 
micro ratcheting system allows you to
dial<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.859> perfect<00:01:05.250> fit<00:01:05.429> they<00:01:05.820> designed

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
dial in the perfect fit they designed

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.340 
dial in the perfect fit they designed
the<00:01:06.329> back<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> helmet<00:01:06.899> to<00:01:06.990> integrate

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the back of the helmet to integrate

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
the back of the helmet to integrate
nicely<00:01:07.530> into<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> ice<00:01:08.280> dot<00:01:08.579> system<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.179> is<00:01:09.359> a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
nicely into the ice dot system this is a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.209 
nicely into the ice dot system this is a
craft<00:01:09.659> sensor<00:01:10.079> that<00:01:10.500> determines<00:01:11.070> whether

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219 
craft sensor that determines whether

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:12.649 
craft sensor that determines whether
you've<00:01:11.429> been<00:01:11.579> in<00:01:11.670> an<00:01:11.789> accident<00:01:12.149> and<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.479> alert

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
you've been in an accident and can alert

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.349 
you've been in an accident and can alert
emergency<00:01:12.960> services<00:01:13.710> via<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.490> cell<00:01:15.090> phone

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 
emergency services via your cell phone

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.060 
emergency services via your cell phone
so<00:01:15.600> really<00:01:15.630> nice<00:01:15.960> integration<00:01:16.439> into<00:01:16.920> that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so really nice integration into that

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.130 
so really nice integration into that
safety<00:01:17.820> feature<00:01:17.850> another<00:01:18.479> cool<00:01:18.749> feature<00:01:18.899> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
safety feature another cool feature is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.899 
safety feature another cool feature is
what<00:01:19.289> they<00:01:19.409> call<00:01:19.590> their<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.799> garage<00:01:20.280> these<00:01:20.759> are

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
what they call their I garage these are

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.700 
what they call their I garage these are
these<00:01:21.030> non-slip<00:01:21.749> pads<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.289> live<00:01:22.469> right<00:01:22.679> here

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
these non-slip pads that live right here

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.319
