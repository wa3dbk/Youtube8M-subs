00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
people have come up with BS BSB and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.840 
people have come up with BS BSB and
that's<00:02:18.980> basically<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.630> between<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.850> that's

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
that's basically in between and that's

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.500 
that's basically in between and that's
here<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:25.709> it's<00:02:25.950> kind<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.519> in<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.940> area<00:02:27.209> right

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
here so it's kind of in this area right

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.110 
here so it's kind of in this area right
here<00:02:27.570> where<00:02:27.870> your<00:02:28.019> blades<00:02:28.470> where<00:02:29.010> your<00:02:29.190> right

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
here where your blades where your right

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.280 
here where your blades where your right
here<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:31.790> okay<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.630> next<00:02:33.780> length<00:02:34.140> is

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
here is okay so the next length is

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.560 
here is okay so the next length is
middle<00:02:34.590> back<00:02:34.769> length<00:02:35.100> middle<00:02:35.850> back<00:02:36.060> length<00:02:36.420> is

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
middle back length middle back length is

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.810 
middle back length middle back length is
basically<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.650> be<00:02:37.739> in<00:02:38.100> between<00:02:38.549> your

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
basically going to be in between your

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.229 
basically going to be in between your
waist<00:02:39.120> length<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.140> your<00:02:41.130> bra<00:02:41.610> strap<00:02:41.970> length

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
waist length and your bra strap length

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.080 
waist length and your bra strap length
so<00:02:42.900> for<00:02:43.860> my<00:02:44.070> height<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.950> usually<00:02:47.250> up<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.790> here

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
so for my height it's usually up in here

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.590 
so for my height it's usually up in here
somewhere<00:02:49.519> but<00:02:50.519> do<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.760> see<00:02:51.000> how<00:02:51.180> all<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
somewhere but do you see how all the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.300 
somewhere but do you see how all the
lengths<00:02:51.900> are<00:02:52.019> close<00:02:52.440> together<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.130> it's

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
lengths are close together and it's

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.550 
lengths are close together and it's
really<00:02:53.580> stupid<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:54.090> argue<00:02:54.690> because<00:02:54.870> depending

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
really stupid to argue because depending

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.010 
really stupid to argue because depending
on<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.890> length<00:02:56.099> of<00:02:56.280> your<00:02:56.400> torso

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
on the length of your torso

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.600 
on the length of your torso
and<00:02:58.110> things<00:02:58.530> like<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.770> it's<00:02:59.310> going<00:02:59.550> to

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
and things like that it's going to

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.790 
and things like that it's going to
follow<00:02:59.820> different<00:03:00.270> places<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:01.290> with<00:03:01.650> this

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
follow different places but with this

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.230 
follow different places but with this
young<00:03:02.010> ladies<00:03:02.310> video<00:03:02.490> they<00:03:02.790> were<00:03:02.850> trying<00:03:03.150> to

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
young ladies video they were trying to

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.300 
young ladies video they were trying to

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
say she wasn't way through waist length

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.250 
say she wasn't way through waist length
and<00:03:05.490> this<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.150> why<00:03:06.420> people<00:03:06.600> get<00:03:06.840> confused

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260
