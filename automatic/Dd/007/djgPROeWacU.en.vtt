00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.269
 hello and welcome I am 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.630
 sam jackson from android tv and we are 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.299
 here in london with jutta voss at the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.970
 Russian company as promised 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.600
 Today is the jutta of 2 presented 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.100
 become 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.480
 and you probably will too 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.250
 even in the technical effect too far 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.080
 Basically yes 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.060
 only the question what will that be 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.910
 There are costs and there are in germany 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.679
 to buy so if everything is planned 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.380
 have presented the draws closer 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.110
 After a short break we turn a hands on 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.850
 video of the new jutta in front and two 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.739
 So you can not switch off 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.739
 After a short break we start 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.470
 okay there we are there we have that from 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.820
 2 you get a bit rania and then 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.710
 I'll let you in on it all 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.920
 a little bit closer we have them 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.989
 as I said before on the mwc in 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.490
 barcelona looked at us now we have 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.970
 but it also in itself 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.520
 the hand 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.080
 So we have as before 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.500
 was suspended 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.810
 5 inch LED display full HD resolution 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:23.259
 We also make it at times with 1920 x 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.950
 1080 pixels and on the back yes all 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.680
 correct there is the 4 7 inch large touch 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.990
 sensitive this time so no 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.970
 touch down here but that 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.180
 Complete things in front is touch 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:41.740
 sensitive display with a resolution 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.360
 of 960 x 540 pixels 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.310
 we'll still see it 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.500
 a bit about starving by the 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.259
 it's a bit of a word of form 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.200
 i'm samsung galaxy s3 again 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.650
 So completely rounded my side 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.080
 here we have the power button and 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.479
 next to it the loud and quiet cup and 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.930
 quite funny is you might see the 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.180
 here below is still a hole or 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.590
 between that not only the people 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.299
 and quieter cup but is too 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.400
 at the same time the sim traders will become 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.090
 solved so you have nowhere else here 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.670
 Youth quite normal the 3.5 mm audio 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.980
 jack socket the left side nothing 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.610
 on the bottom we have so to 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.920
 opening for the speaker and 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.850
 micro-usb like us usually 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.170
 I know yes to the display of 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.320
 So I said we still have a 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.000
 camera on the front 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.860
 we one 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.760
 Let me take another look at 2.1 or 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.040
 2.2 2 1 megapixel camera and the 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.660
 main camera is a bit funny there 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.340
 here now and also a display is but 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.330
 So that's the bag camera as I said 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.830
 or 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.959
 the main camera I call her now yes 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.870
 it just has eight megapixels 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.730
 including the led light yes the big one 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.140
 all from which the device now even as 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.099
 seen all around what else is there 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.900
 say 2 gb ram 32 gb program memory 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.569
 unfortunately not expandable so we have 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.670
 no sim card slot here all 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.580
 interesting of the two 1500 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.200
 is mah strong battery empty 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.220
 the attentive charging station rechargeable that 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.319
 as you would then probably 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.440
 the back accordingly on the 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.510
 place or place child station and 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.599
 then the battery would be 2500 meters 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.980
 ps strong battery charge of the size 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.319
 yes I can maybe just here 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.209
 even a samsung galaxy 5 next 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.239
 Let's just keep it that way 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.760
 you have seen differences in size 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:46.120
 this, the weight of her 145 grams 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.799
 and 145 about 145 high 70 wide and 9 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.850
 So , nine has a little down 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.250
 millimeter thick or thin depending on 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:57.010
 you already know the principle 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.950
 snapdragon 800 yes, some will now 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.670
 say well his old processor 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.970
 not necessarily necessarily because what would be 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:11.890
 currently 801 would be currently adreno 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.330
 330 has the 801 but also a330 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.220
 Sorry so the 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.590
 graphics processor is still the 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.660
 same eat little tick slower with 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.220
 2.2 gigahertz clocked we still want 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.740
 Let's see what we are here for a 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.669
 have operating system that would be natural 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.520
 still quite interesting so builds vodafone 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.870
 You can tell me what the 4 4 3 me 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.580
 but I have already heard that since relatively 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.400
 come out with something new at short notice 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.639
 so update is going to be there too 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.330
 you did not know the price 699 yet 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.340
 buy euro in germany from now on 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.220
 and one other 20 countries 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.310
 and there is of course first 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.810
 Higher price but the principle of what is 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.979
 because the meaning of the whole story of 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.229
 sense of the whole story is 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.970
 in the end we are here in ide ink 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.400
 have display because it is as good as it gets 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.200
 No energy consumed and the advantage 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.200
 is that so with this new touch 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.539
 sensitive e-ink display holds every quantity 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.050
 apps can also be used on the page 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.940
 and so much 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.289
 Battery capacity saves that means here 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.639
 is no longer talked of hours 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.470
 but here is already from days 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.789
 So that means you can talk 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.860
 this jota of 2 will loose two three days 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:26.440
 act without a fixed battery so prematurely 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.270
 We were hoping to be empty 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.590
 So I hope this week in the 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.669
 Editorial came 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.229
 an employee of the German jota 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.030
 from utah devices for us to the office 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.169
 either we will get an interview 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.910
 lead or I will again one 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.250
 a little bit more detail on what 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.500
 because their so work for apps and 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.320
 what exactly with this display 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.870
 actually can do anything and what 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.510
 Finally, a price of 699 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.310
 euro should he should now 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.950
 be chosen with me france with 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.680
 Jackson by Android TV here from London 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.320
 with the jutta phones free until the 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.880
 next video 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.470
 if you liked the video if it was 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.120
 not subscribe to us and it 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.099
 maybe also via twitter google plus 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.880
 or share facebook with it all too 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.880
 have to say that 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.960
 they think 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.830
 to recover 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.830
 you are 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.469
 to the ceiling of the healthy
