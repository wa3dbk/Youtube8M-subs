00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.460
 I listen to this book just to read 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.630
 just a class is possible to live 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.020
 inside the land farm travel center 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.810
 land but you give it is fantastic 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.960
 above you don't know on the moon remembered that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.259
 can we live we are called well in the womb 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.630
 there is no air but inside the earth is here 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.779
 it is written that there is serozha 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.270
 if everything had been there already in detail 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.400
 took advantage of this and instead 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.630
 build skyscrapers after living under 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.700
 the earth but they don’t do years and yes 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.020
 all because people just haven't found 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.420
 the entrance to the earth was badly sought and I think 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.970
 that our land is already sufficiently studied and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.000
 if such a picture of him would have been long ago 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:58.560
 found and generally do not know how 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.010
 home planet is arranged and you know 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.010
 In general, for free, the school was told if 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.260
 honestly i don't remember will let's finally have 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:16.200
 computer ask instead 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:18.720
 argue that the computer is not long 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.080
 responds to returned also not to know what u 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.310
 The land inside is sure to know 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.310
 just looking for information 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.850
 u internal structure and and centers then 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.130
 should mantle occupies a large part 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.400
 ground volume and crust 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.470
 very different in composition for 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.170
 long life of our planet 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.290
 over four and a half billion years 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.200
 heavier rocks and substances 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.830
 by force those farther from lungs to 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:01.860
 its top three that I did not stop at 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:13.530
 noticed grandson peach ground in cut. 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:16.280
 core not meters in oceanic areas 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.959
 up to 70 kilometers in mountainous areas 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.500
 mainland crust 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.790
 replaced by the mantle its thickness is almost three 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.489
 thousand kilometers 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.940
 mantle receiving heat from the core 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.720
 heated from 800 degrees on top to 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.970
 2000 degrees around the core is considered that 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.440
 mantle matter is in continuous 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:43.230
 motion in the center of the earth is the core 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.530
 it consists mainly of iron and 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.430
 nickel and divided into two layers solid 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.000
 inner core and liquid outer 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.480
 core temperature 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.420
 reaches 6000 degrees due 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.190
 giant pressure in the center of the earth 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.560
 the density of matter in the earth’s core is very 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.310
 one cubic meter of it is great 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.670
 substances 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.920
 weighs about 12 and a half tons 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.489
 as much as 3 adults weigh 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.770
 an elephant 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.770
 up complicated ground 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.300
 and I also 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.010
 layer how to know about all these layers we 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.439
 can't drill through the ground 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.560
 let's listen further can steer and 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.080
 will tell now 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.110
 in the world a well was drilled in Kola 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.450
 the peninsula to a depth of 12 kilometers a 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.950
 the radius of the earth that is the distance from 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.150
 surface to its center 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.550
 over 6000 kilometers therefore the subsoil and 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.650
 our planet located on the big 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.650
 depth study on the results 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.080
 seismic exploration every hour in 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.670
 various points of the earth 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.720
 about 10 earth vibrations are recorded 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.660
 surface 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.300
 thousands of seismic stations and should 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.450
 earthquake waves 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.269
 these waves diverge in the thickness of the earth also 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.030
 like circles on water from an abandoned stone 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.540
 when the wave gets into more dense 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.120
 layer and and the speed changes dramatically 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.930
 using this data scientists and identified 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.489
 boundaries 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.489
 inner shells of the earth
