00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.780
 hello dear gamers global readers and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.220
 Welcome to our test 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.050
 video cd 5 gt5 moment times the thing that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.519
 is already a year ago 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.800
 appeared or not 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.960
 yes that's true but rockstar games has 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.330
 the game is known again now 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.070
 new for playstation 4 and xbox one 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.390
 hung up and here in this 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.790
 opening scene recognize the already synonymous 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.899
 one of the innovations namely the ego 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.340
 view mode but I'm interested 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.960
 Of course, above all, what is graphically 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.550
 did and here show you the same 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.860
 stay first a scene from the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.320
 playstation 3 the vision is foresight 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.059
 Although impressive, but around it are 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.039
 there is some text to much and so on 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.260
 some more distant detail goes 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.989
 also quite under and if only 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.070
 in the flicker as you can on some 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.049
 recognize buildings 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.450
 in the playstation 4 version sees that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.580
 already quite different from that is the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.799
 not really higher but that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.090
 flicker of the objects is gone and before 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.070
 especially you can see here that the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.110
 floor textures but clearly in quality 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.330
 to have won and also the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.790
 plants show a significantly higher 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.130
 Detailgrad here we pinch 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.350
 behind the car around you that too normal 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.600
 in the city he demonstrates 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.040
 that among other things on the asphalt the still 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.840
 times in quality has won but quite 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.299
 especially on the car it will be natural 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.220
 visible edge smoothing ensures that 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.680
 There are hardly any effects here 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.840
 or at least significantly less and for 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.640
 the paint is quite reflected 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.470
 Well, rockstar always tricks it 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.540
 again a bit that does not mean it 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.530
 all real-time reflection but that bothers 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.030
 we were open 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.580
 not at all 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.860
 with the mirroring varnish or 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.229
 just that also the poppy effect 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.090
 the objects is considerably less than 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.070
 in the old version that recognizes yes 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.869
 also here in this one 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.450
 comparison scene in which we get one 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.100
 small competition with lamar deliver 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.239
 he knows here while the father is to 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.220
 for example, the terrain on this bridge 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.920
 is much finer and not more 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.450
 vaccination is going down or just now 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.030
 podium strikes 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.680
 and after we do the slogan do not drink 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.150
 and drive have made all honor 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.430
 you also recognize this through the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.650
 Sunbeams breaking through themselves 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.040
 generally with the lighting but so 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:36.640
 has done something positive for 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:38.019
 atmosphere and we already contribute to you 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.660
 thought you get the same picture 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.150
 if we go a bit further abroad 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.440
 go out on this comparison too 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.970
 They are also good for the rest 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.850
 recognize that the object 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.130
 visibility in and of itself relatively little 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.750
 just done the textures clearly 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.690
 have become better and also the 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:01.750
 complexity of trees and the like 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.370
 but the graph has grown significantly 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.930
 So it has many aspects 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.549
 improved but have changed 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.560
 also other little things how to 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.709
 example here at this intermediate sequence 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.239
 can recognize where the animations are not 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.860
 One hundred percent run as the in 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.870
 the old versions of the case was 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.959
 there are also sequences between them 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.540
 the camera was minimally adjusted in the 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.370
 compared to the old versions but um 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.470
 the opportunity to use the content has 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.850
 otherwise nothing changes in the game 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.010
 that is still playing here 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.140
 same characters and fulfilled in the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:40.000
 run the campaign or in the side mission 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:41.950
 the same orders that 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.380
 most important new feature is of course 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.230
 quite clearly the ego view mode in which you 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.140
 yes, as you can see in the ego 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.750
 Perspective changes and gti similar to 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.100
 an ordinary first person shooter 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.880
 you can experience 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.550
 rockstar games offers you of course 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.230
 numerous options for the sake of ego 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.880
 mode to suit your needs 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.640
 if you like the automatic 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.780
 Aiming the known relatively strong 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.030
 fails in the standard 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.280
 attitude is too strong then you can 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.560
 adjust it accordingly or you can 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.420
 for example, the evasive all the 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.730
 in the game as relatively useless 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.730
 also proves easy issue 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.520
 come along with the ego-perspective 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.780
 also cockpit views for each 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.490
 vehicle in gt5 that controls itself 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.949
 a certain period of getting used to 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.440
 good though is the vehicle control 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.539
 from the outside perspective , still 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.919
 the safe variant and in some 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.690
 situations when he is with for example 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.580
 anything on a helicopter 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.979
 it has to be collected 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.490
 difficult from the ego perspective too 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.440
 regulate 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.050
 but you do not have to 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.120
 Of course, Diego is an optional one 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.520
 feature the only real weakness 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.159
 we were able to make up that is the 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.990
 the environment collision query not 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.449
 always optimal means that we stay 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.919
 sometimes objects do not depend on that 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:18.300
 absolutely to be expected 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.639
 although diego view an optional 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.370
 feature is cute rockstar games all 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.590
 trouble you to tempt 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.840
 but then switch over because many 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.969
 Missions benefit from this 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.889
 others in the middle of feeling like to 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.139
 example here this sneaking section 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.279
 where we go with franklin in michaels 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.259
 break into the house 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.969
 and that's not the only reason 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.580
 Entertaining because her brother and 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:44.539
 as usual a sister 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.539
 deliver word duel 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.220
 my way is gone 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.500
 We particularly liked the ego 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.900
 sifting mode here in this mission in 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.740
 we take a boat on the highway 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.020
 follow 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.460
 and yes the international car driver 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.460
 Of course, big is also part of it 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.370
 This is how the missions feel 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.139
 in any case completely different 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.610
 at the latest then if franklin here on 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.020
 our bonnet loves and we 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:23.500
 really do not see anymore 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:25.240
 can go where we go but it 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.280
 There are also situations where rockstar 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.330
 do not even play games at all 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.289
 allowed to switch to diego resp 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.409
 inevitably in a different perspective 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.900
 brings as for example here in this 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:39.759
 mission in which we suddenly notice 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.620
 that Michael is back with us on the 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:43.240
 back bank is and we should 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:48.940
 Of course, do not experience it when we are 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:50.650
 look straight at the street if you are 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.449
 you wonder how to make a fantastic 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.270
 then you can do even better 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.220
 you should play gdl five and in the process 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.710
 whether he is on xbox man or 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.539
 ps4 does because visually take the 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:05.020
 both games as good as ever 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:07.719
 nothing and also the framerate reached 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.740
 relatively constant in both versions 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.740
 the 30th 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:17.540
 so far you are going to santos on ps3 and xbox 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.850
 360 have not paid a visit 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.430
 then you should do that at the latest with the 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.500
 next version change but also for 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.360
 the predecessor version is worth it 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.820
 The purchase simply because that 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.920
 looks fantastic and also the 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.530
 ego view mode an entertaining 

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.780
 element added and also could 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.180
 now also online with significantly more 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.820
 players in free roam mode on the way 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.050
 his 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.880
 our test as well as all important information 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.960
 to play you will find as usual 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.960
 gamers global de
