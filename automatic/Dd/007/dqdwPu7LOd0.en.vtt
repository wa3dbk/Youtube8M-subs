00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.839
 Winter me the most beautiful and certainly 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.719
 not the safest time to drive a car 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.520
 when the mercury column is minus degrees 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.920
 Indicates are conventional 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.730
 disc cleaner often quickly at the end 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.180
 yours 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.710
 now must be a reliable one 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.800
 frost-proof disc cleaner filled 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.800
 become 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.530
 Everyone knows the situation 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.519
 Suddenly snow and ice are back 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.350
 because dirty pane bad view 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.539
 you just do not have the right one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.489
 durchblick 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:47.909
 But there is a solution 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.269
 the new sonax xtreme anti frost and 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:53.339
 clear view caused especially in winter 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.760
 a stubborn dirt film on the 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.319
 disc 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.839
 squeak the fischer himself and 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:59.999
 rattle and prevent greasy plans 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.719
 a clear view that can be dangerous 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:03.390
 become 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.400
 the application of the sonax xtreme anti 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.750
 frost is very easy, you can 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.460
 lightning fast during a boxing stop 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.440
 to do at the gas station 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.940
 on the back of the canister 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.250
 a miss table for one 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.530
 frost protection of -20 clear for example 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.900
 between them in the ratio one to one 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.640
 and then the canister itself is extreme 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.620
 practically he has an integrated 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.690
 pourer and two handles first the 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:34.950
 extremely anti frost in the write what 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:37.970
 then fill the same container 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.970
 Add water 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.640
 finished 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.330
 Incidentally, since may 2006 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.830
 disc frost protection in winter from 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.840
 legislator required 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.000
 who in the winter with frozen vischer 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.510
 liquid must be caught with a 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.510
 count fine 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.690
 in no time ensures the highly effective 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.520
 disc cleaner for a clear view 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.380
 and by the talk nano-particle 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.020
 it also reduces the wiper clocks 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.060
 clearly in a sentence the disc is 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.890
 faster free and that also brings in 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.630
 big plus in security 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.890
 if assumed face is but one 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.750
 poor cleaning performance 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.300
 impaired and they drive four 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.540
 spend several seconds during fast as 90 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.500
 you 100 yards in vivid blind flight 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.290
 nanotechnology 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.690
 the nano-particles provide during the 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.780
 process for a closed fine 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.370
 Water film on the disc surface 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.590
 this leaves the bishops optimally 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.020
 glide and the cleaning surfactants 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.020
 can work fast and over a large area 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.099
 the disc 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.250
 now free from streaking dangerous 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.799
 blend films of oil salt russ and silicone 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.510
 are removed quickly and thoroughly 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.250
 Of course this also reduces 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.659
 Consumption that means you come along 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.170
 a filling of the disc cleaner 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.540
 much further sonax xtreme anti 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.840
 frost and clear concentrate nano pro 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.540
 with 33 percent more cleaning surfactant 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.269
 is particularly material compatible and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.730
 causes no tension cracks 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.250
 to become rubber and plastics at the car 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.900
 not attacked 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.139
 the hacker this suitable product 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.269
 prevents this icing from being contained 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.579
 Glycerine makes for supple 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.780
 wiper rubbers and thus increases 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.870
 the life span 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.930
 sonax xtreme anti frost and clear yourself 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.310
 concentrate nano per quick clear 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.310
 view through nanotechnology 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:53.209
 sonax xtreme anti frost and clear view 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:57.730
 and sonax anti frost and clear view the 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.730
 Right choice for more security
