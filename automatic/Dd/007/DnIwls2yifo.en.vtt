00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the correct form and then after that

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.370 
the correct form and then after that
testing<00:00:23.460> how<00:00:23.609> much<00:00:23.730> weight<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.630> I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
little bit lighter give the body some
time<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.790> recover<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.450> work<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.229> work<00:01:34.409> on

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
time to recover and work on and work on

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.440 
time to recover and work on and work on
the<00:01:34.650> flexibility<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.340> walling<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.299> right

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the flexibility as walling I think right

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.200 
the flexibility as walling I think right
now<00:01:36.630> I'm<00:01:36.810> starting<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.470> back<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> ice

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
now I'm starting to get back on the ice

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.580 
now I'm starting to get back on the ice
once<00:01:39.210> twice<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> week<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.900> most<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.409> then<00:01:40.530> I

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
once twice a week at the most and then I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.380 
once twice a week at the most and then I
think<00:01:40.799> once<00:01:40.950> they<00:01:41.070> hit<00:01:41.189> August<00:01:41.610> second<00:01:42.299> week

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
think once they hit August second week

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.690 
think once they hit August second week
of<00:01:42.479> August<00:01:42.810> more<00:01:43.740> focus<00:01:44.100> will<00:01:44.220> be<00:01:44.250> start<00:01:44.490> going

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
of August more focus will be start going

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.190 
of August more focus will be start going
onto<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.000> ice<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.420> seeing<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.720> results<00:01:46.079> from

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
onto the ice and seeing the results from

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.440 
onto the ice and seeing the results from
in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.409> gym<00:01:46.619> being<00:01:47.220> put<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:47.430> there<00:01:47.549> I'll<00:01:48.270> say

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
in the gym being put out there I'll say

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.639 
in the gym being put out there I'll say
I<00:01:48.479> got<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> work<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.899> my<00:01:48.960> game<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> ice<00:01:49.470> as

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
I got to work on my game on the ice as

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.770 
I got to work on my game on the ice as
well
