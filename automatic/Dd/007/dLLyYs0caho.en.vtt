00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:16.130
 today here 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:20.930
 the pendrive is in principle burnt 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:28.830
 or to pre it does not have a kiss control 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:35.969
 good start between pec in an impromptu 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:41.130
 so let's try not to dismantle it 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:44.540
 I know the way it does not have a screw 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.540
 stay right here 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.150
 did not 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:11.100
 it will have to be more convincing good 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:22.640
 some result has started here 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:34.290
 So let's open it this way, here it is. 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:35.970
 Look, here we have a card. 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.170
 memory 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.509
 this is just an adapter or 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.450
 either if that card is not good I 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.350
 I have all my data without losing 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.860
 anything 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:55.320
 Good ball show I think it 's good for 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.850
 I'm going to use this usual 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.850
 it will fit directly in the case of joining 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.590
 cell phone, for example in the case of 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.160
 computer I need an adapter 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:14.060
 This guy was fit here and I'm going 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.090
 have it on the computer 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.510
 Ok, it's okay, we have it here. 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.610
 we have almost 2 gigabytes of 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:32.040
 files is is totally in tartus 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:37.850
 here is the adapter and that piece of the piece 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.850
 of the world and goes to scrap too much
