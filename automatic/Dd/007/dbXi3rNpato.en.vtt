was<00:03:31.160> really<00:03:31.340> thinking<00:03:31.430> about<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:31.820> because<00:03:31.970> you

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
was really thinking about it because you

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.220 
was really thinking about it because you
know<00:03:32.120> when<00:03:32.510> we<00:03:32.600> first<00:03:32.750> started<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:33.110> never

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
know when we first started I never

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.420 
know when we first started I never
thought<00:03:33.350> we'd<00:03:33.590> make<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.830> finals<00:03:34.130> be<00:03:34.250> honest

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
thought we'd make it to finals be honest

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.710 
thought we'd make it to finals be honest
with<00:03:34.519> you<00:03:34.610> but<00:03:34.760> as<00:03:34.880> we<00:03:35.000> progressed<00:03:35.360> I<00:03:35.540> was<00:03:35.630> like

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
with you but as we progressed I was like

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.940 
with you but as we progressed I was like
no<00:03:35.870> we<00:03:35.989> can<00:03:36.110> actually<00:03:36.230> do<00:03:36.440> this<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:36.800> guess

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
no we can actually do this and I guess

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.470 
no we can actually do this and I guess
some<00:03:37.100> got<00:03:37.670> a<00:03:37.700> really<00:03:37.880> cool<00:03:38.090> idea<00:03:38.450> for
