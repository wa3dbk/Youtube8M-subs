then you want to unscrew the screws on

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.609 
then you want to unscrew the screws on
the<00:01:40.649> motherboard<00:01:40.920> located<00:01:41.759> here<00:01:42.149> here<00:01:42.619> here

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the motherboard located here here here

here and here

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.940 
here and here
then<00:01:45.840> take<00:01:46.020> out<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> motherboard<00:01:46.679> but<00:01:46.859> be

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
then take out the motherboard but be

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.620 
then take out the motherboard but be
careful<00:01:47.340> pulling<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.149> for<00:01:48.179> there<00:01:48.509> is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
careful pulling it out here for there is

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.029 
careful pulling it out here for there is
a<00:01:48.659> thin<00:01:48.929> piece<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.170> tape<00:01:49.530> holding<00:01:49.890> that

a thin piece of tape holding that

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.560 
a thin piece of tape holding that
together

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.540 

then<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.530> are<00:01:53.680> going<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:53.980> take<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.370> plastic

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
then you are going to take the plastic

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.390 
then you are going to take the plastic
and<00:01:55.030> salt<00:01:55.300> off<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.720> top<00:01:56.080> piece<00:01:56.350> here<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:56.950> keep

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
and salt off the top piece here and keep

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.649 
and salt off the top piece here and keep
it

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.499 

then<00:02:05.619> sawed<00:02:05.920> off<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.429> bottom<00:02:06.759> left<00:02:06.969> L<00:02:07.179> piece

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
then sawed off the bottom left L piece

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.169 
then sawed off the bottom left L piece
here<00:02:08.129> saw<00:02:09.129> on<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.310> bottom<00:02:09.610> plastic<00:02:09.819> piece

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
here saw on the bottom plastic piece

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.630 
here saw on the bottom plastic piece
here<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:10.750> that<00:02:11.290> little<00:02:11.620> bit<00:02:11.860> connected<00:02:12.459> to

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
here and that little bit connected to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.800 
here and that little bit connected to
the<00:02:12.760> grip<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.269> make<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.660> completely<00:02:13.989> vertical

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.199 

then<00:02:17.590> do<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.830> same<00:02:18.010> on<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.280> back<00:02:18.400> piece<00:02:18.760> where

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
then do the same on the back piece where

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:27.450 
then do the same on the back piece where
the<00:02:19.360> 2d<00:02:19.660> s<00:02:19.780> can<00:02:20.050> sit<00:02:20.260> flat<00:02:20.500> on<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.830> circle<00:02:21.160> pad

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.670 

it<00:02:27.640> should<00:02:28.510> look<00:02:28.630> somewhat<00:02:29.020> like<00:02:29.050> this<00:02:29.410> when

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
it should look somewhat like this when

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.510 
it should look somewhat like this when
it's<00:02:29.830> done

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.770 

now<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.580> are<00:02:33.850> going<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.150> go<00:02:34.300> back<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.540> the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
now you are going to go back to the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.860 
now you are going to go back to the
motherboard

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.370 

first<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.019> are<00:02:41.049> going<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.469> cut<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.799> black<00:02:41.980> pea

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
first you are going to cut the black pea

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.440 
first you are going to cut the black pea
tape<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.830> spread<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.250> wires<00:02:43.430> out<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.000> then

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
tape to spread the wires out and then

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.480 
tape to spread the wires out and then
you<00:02:44.570> are<00:02:44.690> going<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.050> cut<00:02:45.230> all<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.620> wire<00:02:45.800> in<00:02:46.130> the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
you are going to cut all the wire in the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.470 
you are going to cut all the wire in the
middle<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:47.000> where<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.690> black<00:02:47.900> piece<00:02:48.170> was

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.660 

then<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.319> are<00:02:53.409> going<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.739> take<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.069> 24<00:02:54.430> gauge

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
then you are going to take the 24 gauge

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.180 
then you are going to take the 24 gauge
wire<00:02:54.909> and<00:02:55.239> expose<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.140> tips<00:02:56.379> shown<00:02:56.680> here<00:02:57.040> as

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
wire and expose the tips shown here as

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.100 
wire and expose the tips shown here as
well<00:02:57.730> as<00:02:57.819> the<00:02:57.940> wires<00:02:58.150> on<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.390> motherboard<00:02:58.750> and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
well as the wires on the motherboard and

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.290 
well as the wires on the motherboard and
the<00:02:59.379> sensor

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.760 

you<00:03:06.300> are<00:03:06.420> then<00:03:06.630> going<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.930> solder<00:03:07.260> the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
you are then going to solder the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.650 
you are then going to solder the
motherboards<00:03:08.340> wires<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.030> 24<00:03:09.450> gauge<00:03:09.630> wire

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
motherboards wires to the 24 gauge wire

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.870 
motherboards wires to the 24 gauge wire
which<00:03:10.200> should<00:03:10.410> be<00:03:10.560> about<00:03:10.800> one<00:03:11.070> inch<00:03:11.280> in<00:03:11.430> length

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.580 

then<00:03:16.880> solder<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.450> wire<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.900> sensor<00:03:18.380> and

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
then solder the wire to the sensor and

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.620 
then solder the wire to the sensor and
make<00:03:18.980> sure<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.790> color<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.240> the<00:03:20.360> motherboard

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
make sure the color of the motherboard

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.560 
make sure the color of the motherboard
matches<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.350> sensors<00:03:21.770> wires<00:03:22.010> after

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
matches the sensors wires after
