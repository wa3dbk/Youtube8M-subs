00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
the method you take a little bit of

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.979 
the method you take a little bit of
wd-40<00:00:30.820> get<00:00:31.820> a<00:00:31.849> little<00:00:32.029> spot<00:00:32.239> wet<00:00:32.450> there<00:00:32.689> now

wd-40 get a little spot wet there now

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.500 
wd-40 get a little spot wet there now
i'm<00:00:33.110> using<00:00:33.579> 220<00:00:34.579> grit<00:00:35.530> lapping<00:00:36.530> compound<00:00:36.559> here

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
i'm using 220 grit lapping compound here

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
i'm using 220 grit lapping compound here
i'm<00:00:38.510> just<00:00:38.630> going<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:38.840> put<00:00:39.020> a<00:00:39.050> little<00:00:39.079> bit<00:00:39.350> of<00:00:39.380> it

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
i'm just going to put a little bit of it

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:51.090 
i'm just going to put a little bit of it
right<00:00:39.680> there<00:00:40.450> let's<00:00:41.450> pray<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.780> little<00:00:41.960> bit<00:00:42.140> more

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.080 

go<00:00:52.100> right<00:00:52.400> on<00:00:52.430> top<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:52.880> the<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:55.579> lapping

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
go right on top of the the lapping

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.790 
go right on top of the the lapping
compound<00:00:57.940> this<00:00:58.940> is<00:00:59.090> a<00:00:59.120> ground<00:00:59.570> steel<00:01:00.350> bench

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
compound this is a ground steel bench

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.100 
compound this is a ground steel bench
top<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:01.400> it's<00:01:01.550> very<00:01:01.760> flat<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:04.869> we're<00:01:05.869> using

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
top so it's very flat and we're using

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.490 
top so it's very flat and we're using
the<00:01:06.560> lapping<00:01:07.189> compound<00:01:07.720> to<00:01:08.720> open<00:01:09.259> the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
the lapping compound to open the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.640 
the lapping compound to open the
porosity<00:01:10.130> of<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.670> stone<00:01:11.030> again<00:01:11.530> just<00:01:12.530> a

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
porosity of the stone again just a

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.670 
porosity of the stone again just a
figure-eight<00:01:13.130> motion<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:14.290> I<00:01:15.290> think<00:01:15.470> we<00:01:15.590> need

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
figure-eight motion and I think we need

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:25.110 
figure-eight motion and I think we need
just<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.070> little<00:01:16.100> bit<00:01:16.430> more

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.370 

flip<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:26.240> stone<00:01:26.480> over<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.080> other<00:01:27.140> side

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
flip the stone over to the other side

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.750 
flip the stone over to the other side
you<00:01:27.590> can<00:01:27.710> see<00:01:27.740> how<00:01:28.010> the<00:01:28.070> stone<00:01:28.370> has<00:01:28.520> been

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
you can see how the stone has been

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.530 
you can see how the stone has been
dulled<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.450> scuffs<00:01:33.820> just<00:01:34.820> going<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.060> simple

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
dulled and scuffs just going to simple

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.340 
dulled and scuffs just going to simple
figure-eight<00:01:36.080> motion<00:01:36.110> like<00:01:36.680> this<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:39.200> you

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
figure-eight motion like this and you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.630 
figure-eight motion like this and you
can<00:01:39.530> feel<00:01:39.830> when<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.250> grit<00:01:40.640> has<00:01:41.290> taken<00:01:42.290> those

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
can feel when that grit has taken those

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.420 
can feel when that grit has taken those
burnished<00:01:43.640> surfaces<00:01:44.330> off<00:01:44.540> of<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.840> stone

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
burnished surfaces off of the stone

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.910 
burnished surfaces off of the stone
there<00:01:46.430> we<00:01:46.640> are<00:01:47.020> now<00:01:48.020> when<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.230> rinse<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.680> stone

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
there we are now when I rinse the stone

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.590 
there we are now when I rinse the stone
off<00:01:52.300> you'll<00:01:53.300> see<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.680> stone<00:01:55.150> has<00:01:56.150> been

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
off you'll see that that stone has been

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.030 
off you'll see that that stone has been
opened<00:01:57.200> up<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.240> cleaned<00:01:59.240> again<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:00.770> stone

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
opened up and cleaned again so the stone

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.820 
opened up and cleaned again so the stone
is<00:02:01.370> now<00:02:01.610> sharp<00:02:02.150> for<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:03.050> next<00:02:03.320> sharpening

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
is now sharp for the next sharpening

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.590 
is now sharp for the next sharpening
episode<00:02:04.250> that<00:02:04.460> we're<00:02:04.580> going<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:04.880> use<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.180> for<00:02:05.390> I

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
episode that we're going to use it for I

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
sharpening stone that hasn't been

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.650 
sharpening stone that hasn't been
sharpened<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.820> while<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.740> again<00:02:13.660> just

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
sharpened in a while and again just

sharpened in a while and again just
going<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.930> figure<00:02:15.200> eight<00:02:16.330> we<00:02:17.330> can<00:02:17.480> open<00:02:17.600> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
going to figure eight we can open the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.310 
going to figure eight we can open the
ferocity<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.620> that<00:02:19.130> stone<00:02:19.810> clean<00:02:20.810> out<00:02:21.020> the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320

debris and the clogging and the grains

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.840 
debris and the clogging and the grains
of<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.260> abrasive<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:27.920> can<00:02:28.070> see<00:02:28.310> in<00:02:28.550> just

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
of the abrasive and you can see in just

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.699 
of the abrasive and you can see in just
a<00:02:28.970> matter<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:30.370> minute<00:02:31.370> or<00:02:31.489> two<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:35.709> we

a matter of a a minute or two and we

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.070 
a matter of a a minute or two and we
have<00:02:37.010> again<00:02:37.900> sharpen<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.050> stone<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.930> can

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
have again sharpen this stone you can

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.020 
have again sharpen this stone you can
see<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.410> difference<00:02:42.800> of<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:45.080> stones<00:02:46.030> texture

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
see the difference of the stones texture

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.440 
see the difference of the stones texture
from<00:02:47.780> before<00:02:48.170> sharpening<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:49.160> especially<00:02:50.150> on

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
from before sharpening and especially on

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.180 
from before sharpening and especially on
this<00:02:50.600> stone<00:02:50.840> right<00:02:51.080> here<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:51.920> one<00:02:52.160> I

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
this stone right here this is the one I

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.490 
this stone right here this is the one I
use<00:02:52.489> most<00:02:53.090> frequently<00:02:53.269> it's<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.080> very<00:02:54.260> narrow

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
use most frequently it's a very narrow

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.030 
use most frequently it's a very narrow
tapered<00:02:55.040> stone<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:56.110> works<00:02:57.110> best<00:02:57.470> of<00:02:57.769> course

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
tapered stone and works best of course

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:07.700 
tapered stone and works best of course
when<00:02:58.519> it's<00:02:58.670> sharp

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710
