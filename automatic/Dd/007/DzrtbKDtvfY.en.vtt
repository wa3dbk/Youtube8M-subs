00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.269
 4 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.969
 Hello in this way I would like to show you how to visually enhance your Windows XP 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.639
 to miss a new look 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.839
 a corresponding video for Windows Vista can already be found on the air 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.470
 DDG principle, the procedure is the same for both operating systems 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.089
 back to XP, unlike what you were used to in Windows XP 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.410
 this one in 2001 already a feast for the eyes 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.950
 but after a while, every picture threatens to enter the retina 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.610
 everything did not burn to look for alternatives 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.360
 First let's look at how we got new Visual Stylus or Skins or Lienz 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.060
 we are able to double-click the rights and the right mouse button 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.380
 find here the program item Properties in the context menu 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.730
 there you get on it 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.030
 then we have the point here 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.370
 presentation 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.660
 but we can here 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.140
 choose 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.410
 between windows classic 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.580
 Windows XP is the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.650
 strictly speaking, only one 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.710
 wants to get us into it or Daimler and this one wants us at the turn-wm 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.450
 Change color scheme still 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.409
 it's just like running 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.120
 now he is 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.870
 and now he is like you everywhere you saw an alternative and in three 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.220
 different colours 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.060
 Now the reason why Microsoft basically just wipes with a wooden parts and the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.860
 are three color variants 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.000
 Therefore, he is the Microsoft continues throwing him salts 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.720
 Wanted to sell feature 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.270
 Microsoft wants to try Microsoft in sight would also money there 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.480
 out strike 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.659
 So you came up with a star mechanism 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.299
 So only licensees who are able to buy the license from Microsoft are able to 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:56.729
 are 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.759
 final 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.690
 To create finches 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.950
 But the online community of not the online community 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.969
 if a veto is found why we said so we just have to get one 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:07.960
 Find a tool 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.980
 the federal territory of strength from our windows XP 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.129
 quasi expanded 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.579
 So first of all, you have to take care of the necessary participants 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.289
 our standard browser and consult our standard search engine 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.370
 after a program called St 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.370
 ACS pull Lueg Staiger the NBA 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.019
 Meeks 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:32.969
 Chr 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.679
 Enea 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.759
 in a good mood 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:40.759
 of course there are several hits 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.049
 mm go next to normal 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.700
 In any case, this impression is what Toni Funk de says equities 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.389
 moles title held 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:58.879
 now you are probably in the version 6 points 0 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.179
 free to get here 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.179
 click 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.609
 lie with it 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.999
 with her taxi against multiple choice 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.819
 JavaScript to look for 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.949
 and do later come to the appropriate part 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.849
 I should have downloaded that already 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.059
 a second month ago clouded again Daimler also moved 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.939
 also our default search engine 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:50.760
 and there so mild basically only after the beginning of the war and 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.970
 against Broder Expedia and Visuals part I jump fishing a direct address 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.970
 That's why I'm looking for Libya Sartre 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.709
 we with 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.029
 the way of life there comes that hit 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.019
 Ticket up 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.319
 a very good source for us is there is nowhere a menu 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.059
 and click there first 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:22.150
 the topic is decided 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.990
 Customization and next up 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.270
 Skibbe 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.319
 service 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.119
 and more so here next Windows and Teliris 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:39.979
 but probably here 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.979
 like Schulz the 1 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.360
 why now we are looking for a mill again and that is possible 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.650
 we are here now 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.100
 the most popular 0 blame for everything but always talk 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.309
 Which 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:01.569
 Duration is here to be willing than it will be that he for the first time the 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.839
 Visit website that he has been within the last 24 hours following 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.629
 why is everything 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.500
 Of course, when she uploaded there, she did not catch much 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.500
 so they click on your participation they are all 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:16.210
 furthermore, we can now here 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.650
 choose us a few 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.650
 Entrepreneurs now you just exemplify 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.919
 nine 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.569
 Inspire Art they can of course 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.800
 record any other 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.800
 and as a second mediation visit 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.960
 Final Four is a crime from throwing in the state parliament 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.410
 we'll get a first overview of course she is 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.419
 not so meaningful because I'm right 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.240
 small resolution driver with 800 times 600 but that's what a dealer looks like 

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:52.309
 and the topic 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:57.449
 Son's judge and heard 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.449
 we have an overview 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.759
 MT yes 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.599
 you also click on it 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:07.729
 on the graph then we have to wait in the download 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.729
 Click on 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:15.379
 to save 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.919
 others will too 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:21.050
 download
