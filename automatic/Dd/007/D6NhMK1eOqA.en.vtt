 cooking what I need I see at the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.559

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.980
 keeping one side a salaried activity 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.030
 employed 40 factories and in a school and 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.910
 it is true that I work so the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.950
 week and I complete the weekend by 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.320
 this authority activities from leader to 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.770
 home is actually the goal really 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:16.170
 is to do it from start to my 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:19.380
 own chef and do my cooking one in 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.310
 had spoken translated him that I think that 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.710
 it's going to be nice vegetables fruits meats 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.750
 Syrian cheeses plays the map of 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.680
 fresh and artisanal products as at home 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.700
 the sébastien ben ali cheese maker 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.129
 you go a lot of home chefs 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.819
 looting never but not at all 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:40.030
 moment it's our first is market 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.099
 I think it's super already frozen test 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.920
 here and so yeah no no I have not 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.349
 really really changing to be done 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.480
 to serve at home that's a pretty good thing 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.480
 a super nice side what frankly 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.659
 sausages a market without gates too 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.209
 it's like a match at the stage without gates 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.919
 after the mandatory break thierry 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.209
 continues its market in traders 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.209
 partners who trusted him 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.069
 the concept of a knock-on and at home has been 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.349
 well thought out at thierry la 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.970
 cooking is first and foremost a profession 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.400
 not fallen in while looking top chef 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.230
 or an almost perfect dinner some 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.090
 may think that the lady all 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.280
 recent that I know about that I 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.959
 I started while I did not even 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.420
 already had a reflection five years ago by 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.830
 relation to that to do that while in 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.819
 reaching up so we had not talked about is 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.769
 more and more services to the 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.069
 nobody either for care or 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.739
 something else and there especially to go to 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.420
 the people there make them eat 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.720
 it's a home service like a 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.060
 other visit to the fishmonger 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.819
 awakens thierry bad good 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.560
 memories of the past but after noon when 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.569
 I was young trainee to dissect 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.700
 of Florida I see crabs size 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.860
 cherry crab is nothing in it's all 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.120
 little like that there is no dear to 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.760
 take in the hard like that one 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.190
 learns the trade that is said syria did 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.930
 way from the cherry crab he has to 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.549
 still correct some mistakes for 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.010
 optimize your new business 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.360
 it's a little too rich in 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.050
 pleasing when I'm indignant 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.760
 that a customer 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.900
 I say I would like to be in his place 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.490
 what would I like to eat and 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.260
 it's true that as an epicurean dog 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.330
 I like eating good food 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.270
 I'm still 30 years old to put a little 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.910
 plus the ja 2004 a black cape the entrance 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.160
 so one of too much there I put 3 is 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.400
 so here are twelve beautiful voices well 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.400
 fresh 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.529
 and I will need them 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.169
 so close last stop at the butcher shop 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:59.789
 bettié a butcher seduced by the concept 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:05:01.510
 from the cook's home chef to suicide 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.400
 is serious, we are not sure 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.240
 if you need good products now 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.240
 I like cooking 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.100
 Why 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.350
 sing his blandine guests and 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.940
 benoît have arrived they discover the 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.820
 menu concocted by the chef at home 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.870
 preparation on almost because you have 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.790
 ruined little things of the little ones 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.100
 fignolages affair I have not raymond 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.630
 duck so he's ready to be 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.630
 pan fried of this pretty 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.660
 the guests are at the apero no question 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.400
 to give a hand in cooking in 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.810
 cooking but names just maybe 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.490
 sometimes for service because it's 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.930
 true that when they are many I 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.160
 think they stay in their place I 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.639
 stay to mine it's very important 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.310
 as well 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.560
 they learned he pays enough for that 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.930
 which is really nothing to do tonight 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:52.130
 with sir differ we agreed 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.870
 of a rather special meal with 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.330
 so Saint-Jacques mixes wrapped at 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.669
 bacon prat sauce and crispy 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.430
 with seaweed the entrance impresses and 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.190
 ask guests well 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.419
 presented a fact that changes 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.729
 I do not deserve so much I do not know 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.080
 how he does for the letter like that 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.389
 but we will ask him at the end of 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.310
 meal no but now I think in 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:17.990
 did I dry with thanks to a 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.310
 well well circle buttered the galette him 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.780
 give a shape a little bit is 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.119
 important in places and taste the 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.249
 color but also the euro 

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:28.830
 to create an auto company is fast 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:31.740
 simple but for thierry ago when 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.279
 even a major disadvantage is just the 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.909
 side we do not recover in fact the VAT 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:37.589
 on purchases 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:40.289
 it is true that it is a small side 

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:41.789
 negative it's not obvious but otherwise 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:45.479
 it's true that it's really not bad 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:45.930
 to get started there is also the facility to 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:49.369
 to launch 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.899
 a simple registration on the internet 

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:53.789
 during his home services 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:55.649
 thierry lives sometimes unpublished scenes 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.779
 as this marriage proposal 

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:59.939
 she actually wanted her 

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:01.649
 spouse a wedding of the blow he said to himself 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:03.479
 to mark blow I will appeal to 

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:05.909
 a home chef had made a 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:07.710
 great table really at a meal in 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:11.430
 in love and it was so good 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:13.110
 past that he could not say no it's the 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.360
 end of the meal it's time for them 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.389
 guests to give a note to the cracked 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.830
 in the kitchen 11 on Sahrawis 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:24.830
 and it was perfect reason hat 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.830
 universal 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:33.490
 Amen 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.110
 I 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:44.319
 he does the dishes and curiously 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:44.319
 thibault a small gift
