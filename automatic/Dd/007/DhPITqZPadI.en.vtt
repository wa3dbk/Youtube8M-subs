 such a box 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.359
 I have very few of them and it is very 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.820
 comfortable but the gold has lost its luster 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.770
 and on the chains appeared dark stains I 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 I read a lot of tips on how to 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.190

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.550
 it is important that cleaning gold at home 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.200

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.550

 gold from external pollution soap 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.800
 water for this we need 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.530
 saucepan dishwashing liquid 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.110

 I handkerchief and lay out a rag 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.700

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.920
 completely covered add our detergent 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.310
 means that we have prepared the very 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.310
 the beginning 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:28.009
 honestly i like experiments i'm still 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.009
 added quite a bit of soda and salt 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.350
 turn on the gas and heat the water somewhere before 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.670
 60 degrees give stand 10 minutes and 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.160
 wipe out with a dry cloth 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.470
 I estimate the result by very 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.550
 I decided to clean the gold 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:50.510

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.580

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.540
 I am very pleased with the result but still 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:10.340
 decided to try one mix for this 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.720
 we need 5 spruce alcohol peroxide 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.709

 We lay out our gold jewelry 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.950
 for some reason in most ways of cleaning 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.260
