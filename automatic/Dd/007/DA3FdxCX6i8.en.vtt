I really didn't want to add but I've
seen<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.680> on<00:04:07.829> a<00:04:07.859> lot<00:04:08.159> of<00:04:08.400> other<00:04:08.609> runescape

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
seen it on a lot of other runescape

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.990 
seen it on a lot of other runescape
guides<00:04:09.509> and<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:09.989> figured<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:10.859> know<00:04:10.889> I've<00:04:11.370> been

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
guides and I figured you know I've been

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.929 
guides and I figured you know I've been
coming<00:04:12.449> here<00:04:12.780> pretty<00:04:13.290> often<00:04:13.530> for<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.250> few<00:04:14.790> days

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
coming here pretty often for a few days

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.569 
coming here pretty often for a few days
now<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:15.689> I<00:04:15.989> might<00:04:16.590> as<00:04:16.650> well<00:04:16.799> throw<00:04:17.219> it<00:04:17.459> in

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
now so I might as well throw it in

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.069 
now so I might as well throw it in
because<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:18.120> other<00:04:18.239> one<00:04:18.449> I<00:04:18.479> was<00:04:18.810> going<00:04:19.019> to

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
because the other one I was going to

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.199 
because the other one I was going to
throw<00:04:19.199> in<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.620> think<00:04:20.400> that's<00:04:20.609> a<00:04:20.759> little<00:04:20.909> more

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
throw in I think that's a little more

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.180 
throw in I think that's a little more
advanced<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.680> know<00:04:23.330> not<00:04:24.860> good<00:04:25.860> for<00:04:26.159> the
