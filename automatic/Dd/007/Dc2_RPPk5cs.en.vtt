00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.090 

all<00:00:00.719> right<00:00:00.870> in<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.079> video<00:00:01.380> I'm<00:00:01.800> just<00:00:01.890> going

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
all right in this video I'm just going

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.740 
all right in this video I'm just going
to<00:00:02.129> talk<00:00:02.310> about<00:00:02.429> finding<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:02.939> maximum<00:00:03.149> or

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
to talk about finding the maximum or

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.990 
to talk about finding the maximum or
minimum<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.410> quadratic<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.700> basic

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
minimum of a quadratic and the basic

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.560 
minimum of a quadratic and the basic
idea<00:00:06.560> for<00:00:07.560> your<00:00:07.649> quadratic<00:00:08.250> ax<00:00:08.370> squared<00:00:08.849> ax

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
idea for your quadratic ax squared ax

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.660 
idea for your quadratic ax squared ax
squared<00:00:09.840> plus<00:00:10.050> BX<00:00:10.440> plus<00:00:10.679> C<00:00:10.860> if<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.309> greater

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
squared plus BX plus C if a is greater

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.759 
squared plus BX plus C if a is greater
than<00:00:11.790> zero<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.870> y<00:00:13.080> coordinate<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.740> vertex

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
than zero the y coordinate of the vertex

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.860 
than zero the y coordinate of the vertex
is<00:00:14.280> going<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.429> be<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.610> minimum<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.660> makes

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
is going to be a minimum and that makes

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.570 
is going to be a minimum and that makes
sense<00:00:16.080> because<00:00:16.230> if<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.680> greater<00:00:17.010> than<00:00:17.160> zero

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
sense because if a is greater than zero

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.370 
sense because if a is greater than zero
its<00:00:17.730> opening<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.690> vertex<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.320> going

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
its opening up so that vertex is going

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.580 
its opening up so that vertex is going
to<00:00:19.500> be<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.680> smallest<00:00:20.189> value<00:00:20.670> if<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.810> less<00:00:22.020> than

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
to be a smallest value if a is less than

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.490 
to be a smallest value if a is less than
zero<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.340> maximum<00:00:24.500> again

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
zero it's going to be maximum again

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.230 
zero it's going to be maximum again
because<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.130> know<00:00:26.250> then<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.880> opening

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
because you know then it's opening

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.279 
because you know then it's opening
downwards<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.869> you're<00:00:27.990> going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
downwards so you're going to have a

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.650 
downwards so you're going to have a
highest<00:00:28.650> point<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.609> remember<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.300> find<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
highest point and remember to find the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.080 
highest point and remember to find the
vertex<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.349> use<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.619> formula<00:00:31.949> negative<00:00:32.730> B

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
vertex we can use the formula negative B

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.420 
vertex we can use the formula negative B
over<00:00:33.120> 2a<00:00:33.540> F<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.200> negative<00:00:34.380> B<00:00:34.649> over<00:00:34.829> 2a<00:00:35.280> so

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
over 2a F of negative B over 2a so

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.190 
over 2a F of negative B over 2a so
that's<00:00:36.270> really<00:00:36.570> all<00:00:36.719> I'm<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.170> on

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
that's really all I'm going to do on

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.709 
that's really all I'm going to do on
these<00:00:37.440> examples<00:00:38.070> let's<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.489> kind<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.790> use

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
these examples let's just kind of use

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.560 
these examples let's just kind of use
those<00:00:39.930> two<00:00:40.140> observations<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.360> first

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
those two observations so in the first

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.190 
those two observations so in the first
case<00:00:42.809> we've<00:00:43.739> got<00:00:43.980> negative<00:00:44.879> 3<00:00:45.090> times<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
case we've got negative 3 times the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.670 
case we've got negative 3 times the
quantity<00:00:46.320> X<00:00:46.620> plus<00:00:46.890> 1/4<00:00:47.489> squared<00:00:47.730> plus<00:00:48.120> 5

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
quantity X plus 1/4 squared plus 5

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.439 
quantity X plus 1/4 squared plus 5
notice<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.070> our<00:00:50.160> vertex<00:00:50.610> form<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
notice this is in our vertex form a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.330 
notice this is in our vertex form a
times<00:00:52.110> X<00:00:52.559> minus<00:00:53.129> H<00:00:53.399> squared<00:00:53.430> plus<00:00:54.210> K<00:00:55.160> since<00:00:56.160> our

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
times X minus H squared plus K since our

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.250 
times X minus H squared plus K since our
a<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.820> negative<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.570> already<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.079> it's

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
a is negative I already know it's

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.959 
a is negative I already know it's
opening<00:00:58.590> downwards<00:00:59.129> which<00:00:59.340> means<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.699> have<00:00:59.850> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
opening downwards which means I have to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.560 
opening downwards which means I have to
have<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> maximum<00:01:00.510> value<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:03.390> maximum

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
have a maximum value and the maximum

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.719 
have a maximum value and the maximum
value<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.739> y-coordinate<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
value is just the y-coordinate of the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.350 
value is just the y-coordinate of the
vertex

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
vertex

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.719 
vertex
but<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> y-coordinate<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> vertex<00:01:08.130> is

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
but the y-coordinate of the vertex is

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.580 
but the y-coordinate of the vertex is
whatever<00:01:09.060> number<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.630> hanging<00:01:09.960> out<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.439> in

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
whatever number is hanging out so in

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.880 
whatever number is hanging out so in
this<00:01:10.680> case<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:10.979> by<00:01:11.460> knowing<00:01:11.520> vertex<00:01:12.299> form

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
this case just by knowing vertex form

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.429 
this case just by knowing vertex form
I'll<00:01:13.890> recognize<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.210> has<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> maximum

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
I'll recognize that this has a maximum

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.380 
I'll recognize that this has a maximum
value<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:17.250> 5<00:01:18.799> all<00:01:19.799> right<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.580> Part<00:01:21.000> B<00:01:21.060> here

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
value of 5 all right so Part B here

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.260 
value of 5 all right so Part B here
we've<00:01:21.540> got<00:01:21.720> 2<00:01:21.960> x<00:01:22.140> squared<00:01:22.439> plus<00:01:22.740> 16<00:01:23.070> X<00:01:23.340> since

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
we've got 2 x squared plus 16 X since

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.020 
we've got 2 x squared plus 16 X since
this<00:01:24.450> opens<00:01:25.009> upwards<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.250> again<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
this opens upwards because again the a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.569 
this opens upwards because again the a
value<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.960> positive<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.490> we're

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
value here is positive I know that we're

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.200 
value here is positive I know that we're
going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> minimum<00:01:30.540> value<00:01:31.939> okay<00:01:32.939> well

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
going to have a minimum value okay well

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.490 
going to have a minimum value okay well
to<00:01:33.390> find<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.840> I'm<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.320> use<00:01:34.470> my

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
to find it I'm just going to use my

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.880 
to find it I'm just going to use my
formula<00:01:35.070> negative<00:01:35.460> B<00:01:35.939> over<00:01:35.970> 2a<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:37.590> I'll<00:01:37.680> take

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
formula negative B over 2a so I'll take

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.090 
formula negative B over 2a so I'll take
negative<00:01:38.430> B<00:01:38.970> which<00:01:39.299> will<00:01:39.570> be<00:01:39.630> 16<00:01:40.200> over<00:01:40.470> 2<00:01:40.829> times

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
negative B which will be 16 over 2 times

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.450 
negative B which will be 16 over 2 times
a<00:01:41.369> which<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.030> 2<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:43.320> that's<00:01:43.409> negative<00:01:43.680> 16<00:01:44.310> over

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
a which is 2 so that's negative 16 over

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.450 
a which is 2 so that's negative 16 over
4<00:01:44.880> which<00:01:45.240> will<00:01:45.390> give<00:01:45.509> us<00:01:45.540> negative<00:01:45.840> 4<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.619> if

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
4 which will give us negative 4 and if

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.899 
4 which will give us negative 4 and if
we<00:01:47.549> plug<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.030> in

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
we plug that in

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.139 
we plug that in
to<00:01:49.180> get<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.479> Y<00:01:49.659> value<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:51.250> says<00:01:51.490> G<00:01:51.789> of<00:01:51.939> negative

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
to get the Y value it says G of negative

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.340 
to get the Y value it says G of negative
4<00:01:52.630> is<00:01:52.960> going<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.350> be<00:01:53.409> 2<00:01:53.710> times<00:01:53.979> negative<00:01:54.610> 4

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
4 is going to be 2 times negative 4

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.200 
4 is going to be 2 times negative 4
squared<00:01:56.460> plus<00:01:57.460> 16<00:01:58.180> times<00:01:58.229> negative<00:01:59.229> 4<00:02:00.210> well

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
squared plus 16 times negative 4 well

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.440 
squared plus 16 times negative 4 well
let's<00:02:01.360> see<00:02:01.539> negative<00:02:02.350> 4<00:02:02.710> squared<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.250> 16<00:02:03.460> 16

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
let's see negative 4 squared is 16 16

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.190 
let's see negative 4 squared is 16 16
times<00:02:04.689> 2<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:05.020> 32<00:02:08.280> 16<00:02:09.280> times<00:02:09.550> 4<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.929> going<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.140> be

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
times 2 is 32 16 times 4 is going to be

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.860 
times 2 is 32 16 times 4 is going to be
a<00:02:11.319> negative<00:02:12.090> 64<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:14.190> 32<00:02:15.190> minus<00:02:15.670> 64<00:02:16.269> is<00:02:16.599> going

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
a negative 64 and 32 minus 64 is going

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.670 
a negative 64 and 32 minus 64 is going
to<00:02:16.930> be<00:02:17.050> negative<00:02:18.120> 32<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.019> says<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:20.530> this

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
to be negative 32 so it says in this

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.449 
to be negative 32 so it says in this
case<00:02:20.920> our<00:02:21.190> minimum<00:02:21.640> value<00:02:22.180> will<00:02:22.690> be<00:02:22.870> negative

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
case our minimum value will be negative

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.190 
case our minimum value will be negative
32<00:02:25.049> okay<00:02:26.049> so<00:02:26.110> one<00:02:26.500> more<00:02:26.530> here<00:02:27.390> we've<00:02:28.390> got<00:02:28.569> 7x

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
32 okay so one more here we've got 7x

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.580 
32 okay so one more here we've got 7x
squared<00:02:29.349> plus<00:02:29.830> 4x<00:02:30.160> minus<00:02:30.400> 1<00:02:30.910> okay<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:31.900> for<00:02:32.440> this

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
squared plus 4x minus 1 okay so for this

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.410 
squared plus 4x minus 1 okay so for this
one<00:02:34.680> for<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.769> negative<00:02:36.160> 7x<00:02:36.610> squared<00:02:36.760> plus<00:02:37.150> 4x

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
one for the negative 7x squared plus 4x

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.059 
one for the negative 7x squared plus 4x
minus<00:02:37.630> 1<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.200> know<00:02:38.349> that<00:02:38.590> that's<00:02:38.680> going<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.950> have

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
minus 1 I know that that's going to have

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.910 
minus 1 I know that that's going to have
a<00:02:39.099> maximum<00:02:39.880> value<00:02:40.410> again<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.560> leading

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
a maximum value again the leading

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.460 
a maximum value again the leading
coefficient<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.819> is<00:02:43.480> negative<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.170> know<00:02:44.260> it's

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
coefficient a is negative so I know it's

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.740 
coefficient a is negative so I know it's
opening<00:02:44.860> downwards<00:02:45.400> which<00:02:46.269> means<00:02:46.510> it's<00:02:46.660> going

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
opening downwards which means it's going

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.720 
opening downwards which means it's going
to<00:02:46.810> have<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.989> maximum<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.950> again<00:02:48.549> I'm<00:02:48.670> just

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
to have a maximum and again I'm just

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.160 
to have a maximum and again I'm just
going<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.970> do<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.180> same<00:02:49.390> thing<00:02:49.630> I'll<00:02:49.840> take<00:02:50.019> my

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
going to do the same thing I'll take my

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.670 
going to do the same thing I'll take my
negative<00:02:50.440> B<00:02:51.130> which<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.610> positive<00:02:52.150> 4<00:02:52.510> over<00:02:52.750> 2

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
negative B which is positive 4 over 2

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.449 
negative B which is positive 4 over 2
times<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.190> which<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.209> negative<00:02:55.780> 7<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:57.190> let's

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
times a which is negative 7 and let's

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.970 
times a which is negative 7 and let's
see<00:02:57.579> that's<00:02:57.790> going<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:58.030> give<00:02:58.120> us<00:02:58.239> a<00:02:58.359> positive<00:02:58.989> 2

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
see that's going to give us a positive 2

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.590 
see that's going to give us a positive 2
over<00:03:00.010> 7<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.850> believe<00:03:01.239> after<00:03:01.420> we<00:03:01.690> simplify<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:04.180> in

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
over 7 I believe after we simplify so in

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.590 
over 7 I believe after we simplify so in
this<00:03:04.750> case<00:03:05.459> again<00:03:06.459> this<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.000> x<00:03:07.209> coordinate

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
this case again this is the x coordinate

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.509 
this case again this is the x coordinate
and<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.019> should<00:03:08.230> be<00:03:08.350> careful<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.160> not<00:03:09.310> the

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
and I should be careful this is not the

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.720 
and I should be careful this is not the
max<00:03:09.760> value<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.359> is<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.630> x<00:03:10.810> coordinate<00:03:11.079> I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
max value this is the x coordinate I

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.220 
max value this is the x coordinate I
think<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.819> said<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.359> correctly<00:03:13.480> but<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:13.989> kind<00:03:14.170> of

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
think I said it correctly but it kind of

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.379 
think I said it correctly but it kind of
ended<00:03:14.829> up<00:03:14.889> looking<00:03:15.459> like<00:03:15.489> I<00:03:15.700> was<00:03:15.850> writing<00:03:16.239> and

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
ended up looking like I was writing and

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.780 
ended up looking like I was writing and
saying<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.720> was<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.900> maximum<00:03:17.470> value<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.609> get

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
saying it was a maximum value so to get

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.539 
saying it was a maximum value so to get
the<00:03:18.970> max<00:03:19.239> value<00:03:19.569> again<00:03:20.380> that's<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:21.069> y

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
the max value again that's the y

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.140 
the max value again that's the y
coordinate<00:03:22.590> we<00:03:23.590> get<00:03:23.799> out<00:03:23.980> when<00:03:24.519> we<00:03:24.609> plug<00:03:24.910> in

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
coordinate we get out when we plug in

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.089 
coordinate we get out when we plug in
our<00:03:25.329> x<00:03:25.630> coordinate<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.380> 2

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
our x coordinate of 2

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.009 
our x coordinate of 2
so<00:03:28.099> I<00:03:28.129> have<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.400> plug<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.760> into<00:03:28.909> my<00:03:29.060> H<00:03:29.390> function

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
so I have to plug it into my H function

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.619 
so I have to plug it into my H function
here<00:03:30.260> so<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:30.680> was<00:03:30.829> negative<00:03:31.040> seven<00:03:31.670> times

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
here so that was negative seven times

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.259 
here so that was negative seven times
two<00:03:33.019> sevenths<00:03:34.090> squared<00:03:35.530> plus<00:03:36.640> four<00:03:37.640> times<00:03:37.939> two

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
two sevenths squared plus four times two

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.179 
two sevenths squared plus four times two
over<00:03:38.450> seven<00:03:40.120> minus<00:03:41.120> one<00:03:41.329> so<00:03:42.049> a<00:03:42.319> lot<00:03:42.860> of<00:03:42.890> little

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189 
over seven minus one so a lot of little

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:47.349 
over seven minus one so a lot of little
fractions<00:03:43.700> going<00:03:44.359> on<00:03:44.480> here<00:03:45.099> that's<00:03:46.099> okay<00:03:46.489> so

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
fractions going on here that's okay so

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.940 
fractions going on here that's okay so
let's<00:03:47.540> see<00:03:47.629> this<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:47.930> negative<00:03:48.349> seven<00:03:48.739> we'll

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
let's see this is negative seven we'll

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.360 
let's see this is negative seven we'll
get<00:03:49.099> four<00:03:49.430> over<00:03:49.849> 49<00:03:50.450> when<00:03:50.780> we<00:03:50.900> square<00:03:51.260> those<00:03:51.530> it

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
get four over 49 when we square those it

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.069 
get four over 49 when we square those it
looks<00:03:52.549> like<00:03:52.700> we<00:03:52.819> get<00:03:52.909> positive<00:03:53.120> eight<00:03:53.689> over

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
looks like we get positive eight over

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.009 
looks like we get positive eight over
seven<00:03:54.579> I'm<00:03:55.579> going<00:03:55.670> to<00:03:55.879> write<00:03:56.150> one<00:03:56.180> at<00:03:56.599> seven

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
seven I'm going to write one at seven

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.899 
seven I'm going to write one at seven
over<00:03:57.260> seven<00:03:57.290> just<00:03:57.920> so<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.040> can<00:03:58.159> subtract<00:03:58.700> those

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
over seven just so I can subtract those

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.349 
over seven just so I can subtract those
two<00:03:59.319> notice<00:04:00.319> seven<00:04:00.920> will<00:04:01.069> go<00:04:01.190> into<00:04:01.400> 49<00:04:01.790> seven

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
two notice seven will go into 49 seven

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.300 
two notice seven will go into 49 seven
times<00:04:02.599> so<00:04:03.049> this<00:04:03.170> is<00:04:03.319> actually<00:04:03.709> negative<00:04:03.859> four

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
times so this is actually negative four

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.410 
times so this is actually negative four
sevenths<00:04:04.790> plus<00:04:05.230> eight<00:04:06.230> seven<00:04:06.739> -<00:04:07.420> seven

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
sevenths plus eight seven - seven

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.470 
sevenths plus eight seven - seven
sevenths<00:04:09.379> well<00:04:10.340> we<00:04:10.519> do<00:04:10.639> the<00:04:10.790> arithmetic<00:04:10.909> in

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
sevenths well we do the arithmetic in

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.740 
sevenths well we do the arithmetic in
the<00:04:11.569> numerator<00:04:11.989> negative<00:04:12.620> 4<00:04:12.859> plus<00:04:13.159> 8<00:04:13.370> is<00:04:13.579> 4<00:04:13.970> 4

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
the numerator negative 4 plus 8 is 4 4

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.390 
the numerator negative 4 plus 8 is 4 4
minus<00:04:14.780> seven<00:04:15.500> is<00:04:15.620> going<00:04:15.769> to<00:04:15.889> be<00:04:15.980> negative

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
minus seven is going to be negative

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.849 
minus seven is going to be negative
three<00:04:16.639> so<00:04:17.389> I'm<00:04:17.539> getting<00:04:17.750> this<00:04:18.079> to<00:04:18.320> be<00:04:18.470> the

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
three so I'm getting this to be the

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.029 
three so I'm getting this to be the
maximum<00:04:19.579> value<00:04:20.260> says<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.410> biggest<00:04:21.769> Y<00:04:22.010> value

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
maximum value says the biggest Y value

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.890 
maximum value says the biggest Y value
that<00:04:22.610> you're<00:04:22.789> ever<00:04:23.000> going<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.270> hit<00:04:23.510> is<00:04:23.750> going

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
that you're ever going to hit is going

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.389 
that you're ever going to hit is going
to<00:04:24.080> be<00:04:24.199> the<00:04:24.349> value<00:04:24.530> negative<00:04:25.430> 3/7
