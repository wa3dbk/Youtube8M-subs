00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
 hunt lace in online stores 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:14.420
 go to all the guys i'm more pieces 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.779
 found on my channel boys today I have 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:23.689
 I upgraded my radar to do it 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.619
 see the radar and from 17 hours boys and 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.489
 here 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.789
 look, I've discovered so many cousins 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.739
 states level 50 boys and today 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.410
 we're going to pull this ugly down 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.910
 excess of hummer is missing guys then 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.899
 let's start the attack I'll show you how 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.370
 do 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.070
 even if it is not very difficult also 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.660
 because I very strong warriors then 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.120
 theoretically I shouldn't have too many 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.370
 problems then I would say we take away all 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.339
 these explosive mines if these mines 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:57.019
 however, sums perfect then I would say 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.999
 let's pull this in the corner 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.059
 ok and we have also destroyed this 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:06.440
 something says beautiful and then me 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.500
 branch off these mines guys you 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.600
 please back the one in the bottom kindly ne 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.620
 two are left will make us a bad dog 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.120
 but okay we have 50 guys energies 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.350
 I'd say let's get our warriors down 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:25.340
 let's raise first here ok 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:32.470
 obviously we pass from the ok side all 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:34.240
 there at the end via perfect back 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.850
 no i was wrong i don't tell us a 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.040
 cannon is fine we do nothing 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.100
 wrong from the canon does nothing 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.490
 there was a difference from here 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.930
 we send here perfect don't go on 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:54.700
 kindly maybe mine are perfect 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.620
 27 energy left and I would say one here is one 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.620
 which boys and then we should be a 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.600
 horse and book dates as a swing a swing 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:10.090
 anos come swing en bugey ammerman 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.880
 level 50 melts baby blue room if i 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.560
 very easy guys obviously for me in the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.480
 sense why me and heal 15 anyway 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.950
 guys even if you have warriors 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.709
 I always recommend yellow warriors in 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.810
 this case they still whistle at 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.959
 ears as they did everything like 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.010
 he did n't do orders and health from everyone 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.410
 your group and that no summit 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.870
 will survive the next meeting 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.340
 you always say the same bullshit anyway 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.750
 guys if you have warriors too 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.250
 lower level don't worry about that 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.940
 it's really very easy and a lot 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.760
 doable 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:45.160
 take away the mines I recommend if not of 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.930
 air jumps that light confetti well 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.820
