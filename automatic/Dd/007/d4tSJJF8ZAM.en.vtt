00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.269
 of all I'm not the first the second 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.269
 that the script guiding the first 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.960
 come from robin is also where attentive 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.280
 good is fine I have gone well I 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.980
 it turned out well what happens that the center does not 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.980
 has more acceleration without the hairs 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:54.339
 but first, they even give me 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.530
 tried but I fall on top of a 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.769
 car is that you can believe it 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.960
 to the mecha of the parabola over uncle 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.379
 let's go let's go 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.690
 at least here he advanced a few to 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.190
 we took the curve well we passed between 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.900
 half of these two close me that 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.510
 fuckers to see outside out outside 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.310
 for you perfect 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:21.280
 I do not do not want you to give 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:23.890
 and reduce what I 'm getting 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.130
 in the corner kid leaves final data 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:33.000
 and there is a punishment from adot I have seen my 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:35.120
 car will jump like that because it's that easy 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.540
 as if it were an invisible object or something 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.050
 A) Yes 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.050
 Y 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:57.070
 my mother how is that really fuck of 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.780
 I'm telling you, you're a reason 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:04.960
 you are a guard because he owes this 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.250
 You do not know how he messed with me but I do not know 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.410
 I have nobody behind come I have another 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.950
 World slipstream ahead to see if the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.300
 highly a few cars behind uncle 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.760
 he skips a lot 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.730
 heap for the jump but a lot 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.330
 my father sixth I think that same me 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.900
 fourth goya 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.880
 oh no no seventh and ninth for this happens 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.310
 what we feel this is ninth what 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.420
 happens what happens in garrovillas I go for the 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.420
 boot two give you heat 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:42.720
 I do not know how I'm going in front 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.670
 here is a red environment that has 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.540
 caught that is 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.540
 the rosita 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.050
 of the group nor of coÃ±a I do not allow it takes me 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.459
 following all this uncle's time good 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.069
 good good good as we advance them 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.250
 here seconds good in theory now if 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.310
 I loaded the objects was a ramp but 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.069
 what before was a terrible ramp 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.230
 confirmed we go the newspapers and look 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.970
 I hate it, the whole bitch is playing 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.790
 uncle race hey what color is your car 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.110
 I think I have black black front 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.890
 OK OK 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.170
 the guy that is serious about truth 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.930
 it was really good but the best 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.400
 because it takes me puteando the race of 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.680
 again these two quadrants in the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.330
 jump is the same as before the goat 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.180
 more own 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.740
 choose the slipstream you will apply to win 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.510
 the pink is that I have a very busted car 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:48.480
 Uncle, I do not have much bursting and we take the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.340
 perfect jump and jump things up things 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.340
 let's see it does not catch you very well 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.040
 the proof is that I do not know how to go back 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.160
 fifth fourth sixth seventh quarter 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.550
 been the time they can not win anything no no 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.070
 fucking pussy fuck and I'm skidding 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.250
 I pass skidding I did not pass rapping 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.250
 uncle 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.980
 with the handbrake 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:21.510
 I do not even know how we're doing this, I think that 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.510
 text 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:34.140
 by god of diego I am seeing if not 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.140
 I was watching 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.320
 my mother the cost of brito's life 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.320
