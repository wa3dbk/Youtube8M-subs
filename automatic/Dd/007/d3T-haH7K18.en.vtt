hi my name is dave Andrews today I'm

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.990 
hi my name is dave Andrews today I'm
going<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.890> show<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.040> how<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.220> write<00:00:08.519> computer

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
going to show you how to write computer

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.209 
going to show you how to write computer
script<00:00:09.570> we're<00:00:10.320> going<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.530> use<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> very<00:00:11.010> simple

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
script we're going to use a very simple

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.770 
script we're going to use a very simple
scripting<00:00:11.790> language<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.360> built<00:00:12.599> into

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
scripting language it's built into

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.930 
scripting language it's built into
Windows<00:00:13.230> that's<00:00:13.559> called<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.099> visual<00:00:14.370> basic

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
Windows that's called the visual basic

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.080 
Windows that's called the visual basic
scripting<00:00:15.389> or<00:00:15.570> VBS<00:00:16.820> let's<00:00:17.820> go<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.029> our

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
scripting or VBS let's go to our

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.810 
scripting or VBS let's go to our
computer<00:00:18.770> as<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.859> can<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.520> script

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
computer as you can see I have a script

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.859 
computer as you can see I have a script
file<00:00:21.119> here<00:00:21.500> that<00:00:22.500> basically<00:00:23.250> does<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:24.240> loop

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
file here that basically does a for loop

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.439 
file here that basically does a for loop
now<00:00:25.619> what<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> for<00:00:26.099> loop<00:00:26.279> does<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.939> loops<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
now what a for loop does is it loops a

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.609 
now what a for loop does is it loops a
number<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.010> case<00:00:29.070> from<00:00:29.609> 0<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.119> 7<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.349> our

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
number in this case from 0 to 7 so our

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.990 
number in this case from 0 to 7 so our
variable<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:33.020> will<00:00:34.020> go<00:00:34.200> from<00:00:34.440> 0<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.920> 7<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.880> we'll

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
variable I will go from 0 to 7 and we'll

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.240 
variable I will go from 0 to 7 and we'll
execute<00:00:36.360> all<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.170> code<00:00:37.469> every<00:00:37.890> single

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
execute all of this code every single

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.869 
execute all of this code every single
time<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.629> basically<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.200> will<00:00:40.440> loop

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
time so it basically this will loop

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.180 
time so it basically this will loop
seven<00:00:41.879> times<00:00:42.230> more<00:00:43.230> or<00:00:43.379> less<00:00:43.559> or<00:00:43.770> rather<00:00:43.920> eight

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
seven times more or less or rather eight

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.569 
seven times more or less or rather eight
times<00:00:44.489> because<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.149> go<00:00:45.270> from<00:00:45.480> zero<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.840> seven

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
times because you go from zero to seven

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.279 
times because you go from zero to seven
and<00:00:47.579> what<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.780> it's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and what this is going to do is it's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.350 
and what this is going to do is it's
going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> run<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> command<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.399> visual<00:00:51.000> basic

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
going to run a command in visual basic

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.189 
going to run a command in visual basic
scripting<00:00:51.780> called

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
scripting called

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.700 
scripting called
W<00:00:52.710> script<00:00:52.980> STD<00:00:53.850> out<00:00:54.059> dot<00:00:54.420> right<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.559> what

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
W script STD out dot right and what

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.250 
W script STD out dot right and what
that's<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> do<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.370> basically<00:00:56.520> write

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
that's going to do is basically write

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.349 
that's going to do is basically write
text<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> screen<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.910> text<00:01:00.210> it's

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
text to the screen and the text it's

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.110 
text to the screen and the text it's
going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.570> write<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.079> hello<00:01:01.469> world<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.879> follow

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
going to write is hello world we follow

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.939 
going to write is hello world we follow
that<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.539> an<00:01:03.660> echo<00:01:04.049> command<00:01:04.530> that's<00:01:04.769> going

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that with an echo command that's going

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.950 
that with an echo command that's going
to<00:01:05.010> print<00:01:05.220> out<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.400> new<00:01:05.760> line<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.330> way<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.930> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
to print out a new line that way all of

to print out a new line that way all of
our<00:01:07.260> hello<00:01:07.650> worlds<00:01:08.070> don't<00:01:08.250> show<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.150> know

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
our hello worlds don't show up you know

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.840 
our hello worlds don't show up you know
compressed<00:01:09.869> right<00:01:10.140> next<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.560> each<00:01:10.680> other<00:01:10.850> so

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
compressed right next to each other so

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.620 
compressed right next to each other so
I'm<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.240> give<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> little

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
I'm just going to give you a little

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.120 
I'm just going to give you a little
demonstration<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.320> how<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.590> works<00:01:13.890> let's

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
demonstration of how this works let's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.600 
demonstration of how this works let's
open<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.850> our<00:01:15.000> command<00:01:15.390> prompt<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.430> now<00:01:17.430> we're

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
open up our command prompt and now we're

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.190 
open up our command prompt and now we're
going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> type<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.150> CMD<00:01:20.780> let's<00:01:21.780> go<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
going to type in CMD let's go to the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.660 
going to type in CMD let's go to the
directory<00:01:22.650> where<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.040> script<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.580> stored

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
directory where that script is stored

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.710 
directory where that script is stored
we're<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> run<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> Windows<00:01:27.479> command

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
we're going to run the Windows command

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.580 
we're going to run the Windows command
that<00:01:28.170> comes<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.740> Windows<00:01:28.890> called<00:01:29.430> C<00:01:29.759> script

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
that comes with Windows called C script

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.700 
that comes with Windows called C script
which<00:01:31.590> will<00:01:31.740> actually<00:01:31.890> execute<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:33.180> command

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
which will actually execute that command

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.990 
which will actually execute that command
and<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.100> give<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.490> file<00:01:35.700> name

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and we're going to give it the file name

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.060 
and we're going to give it the file name
which<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.420> script<00:01:36.810> VBS<00:01:38.960> as<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.500> there

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
which is script VBS as you can see there

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.940 
which is script VBS as you can see there
are<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.430> our<00:01:41.729> hello<00:01:42.540> worlds<00:01:43.020> right<00:01:43.710> there

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
are all of our hello worlds right there

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.130 
are all of our hello worlds right there
displayed<00:01:44.520> immediately<00:01:45.240> after<00:01:45.869> each<00:01:45.960> other
