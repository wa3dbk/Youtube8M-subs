00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:08.750
 and let's hope I'm going to do it 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:12.259
 listen to me here this is the long part and 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:16.870
 that's the short part the rows the 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:20.300
 cuts are out 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.840
 the skinny passes over 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.700
 they are already upside down 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.939
 then press and pull the fat only 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.939
 it goes through inside 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.939
 hopefully 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:43.220
 and the first crossing is already the first 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.430
 something goes the fat one side to the 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.430
 other 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.030
 nothing else happened from one place to another and 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.750
 you have it in your hand when you have it in 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.470
 the hand passes it down 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.840
 from the knot and this is where we cover 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.850
 the world here this is going to be the knot 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.930
 because when you pull it, it's going to 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.990
 pass through the middle 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.770
 and once you pass it through the middle 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.870
 alone the knot is made and something adjusts and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.730
 so that it looks nice I chose him pulls 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.000
 these these two corners 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.860
 and the one behind is the skinny one 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.140
 you to compose and also talk to them 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.420
 also the skinny the fat one and nothing else 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.040
 fits the neck of your tie 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.040
 look how he was 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.340
 he works 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:42.850
 is the secret so you know that it is such 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:45.040
 that is fine is the tie the fat one 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.930
 the view is obviously out 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.740
 but the thin eye is towards 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.740
 in to my chest so that both 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.250
 the two with the seams 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:06.659
 seams are stuck together inside 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.659
 sewing here sewing here good bye
