first of all I actually enjoyed the game
to<00:00:37.350> begin<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.920> last<00:00:38.309> year<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.390> only<00:00:39.660> thing

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
to begin with last year the only thing

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.600 
to begin with last year the only thing
that<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.050> didn't<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.559> about<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.920> was<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that I didn't like about it was the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.389 
that I didn't like about it was the
subscription<00:00:42.300> fee<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.780> mean<00:00:43.500> yeah<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.250> good

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
subscription fee I mean yeah it's a good

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.010 
subscription fee I mean yeah it's a good
game<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.610> everything<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.840> think

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
game and everything but I just think

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.900 
game and everything but I just think
that<00:00:46.079> having<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.559> fork<00:00:46.860> out<00:00:47.070> an<00:00:47.219> extra<00:00:47.520> fifteen

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
that having a fork out an extra fifteen

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.180 
that having a fork out an extra fifteen
dollars<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.420> say<00:00:48.539> each<00:00:48.750> month<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.500> not<00:00:49.890> really

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
dollars and say each month is not really

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.069 
dollars and say each month is not really
worth<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:50.910> you're<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.329> casual<00:00:51.750> player

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
worth it if you're just a casual player

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.049 
worth it if you're just a casual player
or<00:00:52.350> perhaps<00:00:52.980> see<00:00:53.219> someone<00:00:53.579> who<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.000> know

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
or perhaps see someone who you know

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.150 
or perhaps see someone who you know
works<00:00:54.420> around<00:00:54.629> most<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> weekend<00:00:55.559> only

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.530 
people don't like the Elder Scrolls
online<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.320> certainly<00:01:41.009> agree<00:01:41.159> why<00:01:41.670> people<00:01:42.390> say

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
online I certainly agree why people say

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.230 
online I certainly agree why people say
it's<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> good<00:01:43.590> Elder<00:01:43.950> Scrolls<00:01:44.220> game<00:01:44.460> but

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
it's not a good Elder Scrolls game but

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.160 
it's not a good Elder Scrolls game but
it<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> pretty<00:01:45.899> good<00:01:46.200> MMO<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.100> my<00:01:47.250> opinion

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
it is a pretty good MMO in my opinion

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.840 
it is a pretty good MMO in my opinion
there's<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.259> lot<00:01:49.409> more<00:01:49.439> stuff<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:50.040> dies<00:01:50.399> I

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
there's a lot more stuff like dies I

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.240 
there's a lot more stuff like dies I
don't<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.960> think<00:01:52.110> they've<00:01:52.409> added<00:01:52.860> any

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
don't really think they've added any

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.990 
don't really think they've added any
classes<00:01:54.149> races<00:01:54.630> or<00:01:54.810> skills<00:01:55.520> which<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> shame

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
classes races or skills which is a shame

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.530 
classes races or skills which is a shame
I<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.799> could<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.189> more<00:01:59.670> skills<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
I think they could do more skills like a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.630 
I think they could do more skills like a
new<00:02:00.780> skill<00:02:01.140> line<00:02:01.350> or<00:02:01.500> something<00:02:01.890> perhaps<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
new skill line or something perhaps the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.010 
new skill line or something perhaps the
thieves<00:02:02.909> guild<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.509> don't<00:02:03.689> think<00:02:03.750> they've

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
thieves guild I don't think they've

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.340 
thieves guild I don't think they've
added<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.530> Thieves<00:02:05.189> Guild<00:02:05.340> Iver<00:02:06.200> but<00:02:07.200> I'm<00:02:07.320> not

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
added the Thieves Guild Iver but I'm not

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.350 
added the Thieves Guild Iver but I'm not
