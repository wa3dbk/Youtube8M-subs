00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.800 

we<00:02:24.850> shoot<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.090> video<00:02:25.240> we're<00:02:25.450> shooting<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.720> little

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
we shoot a video we're shooting a little

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.240 
we shoot a video we're shooting a little
press<00:02:26.050> video<00:02:26.350> okay<00:02:28.530> video<00:02:29.530> may<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:29.950> show<00:02:30.190> you

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250

the<00:02:30.370> other<00:02:32.610> side<00:02:33.610> or<00:02:34.380> they're<00:02:36.330> all<00:02:37.330> connected

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the other side or they're all connected

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.330 
the other side or they're all connected
so<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:39.910> an<00:02:40.000> MHL<00:02:40.600> device<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.709> sony

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
so it's an MHL device this is a sony

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.390 
so it's an MHL device this is a sony
