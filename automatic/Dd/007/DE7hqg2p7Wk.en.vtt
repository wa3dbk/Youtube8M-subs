00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:15.440 
hey there youtubers my next Amazon
package<00:00:07.260> came<00:00:07.590> in<00:00:13.669> and<00:00:14.669> I'm<00:00:14.940> actually<00:00:15.150> using

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
package came in and I'm actually using

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.330 
package came in and I'm actually using
my<00:00:17.510> my<00:00:18.510> new<00:00:18.660> cell<00:00:18.930> phone<00:00:19.170> holder<00:00:21.710> so<00:00:22.710> maybe<00:00:22.949> it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
my my new cell phone holder so maybe it

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:38.420 
my my new cell phone holder so maybe it
won't<00:00:23.519> be<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:23.789> damn<00:00:24.240> bouncy<00:00:36.890> only<00:00:37.890> two<00:00:38.100> things

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
won't be so damn bouncy only two things

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.190 
won't be so damn bouncy only two things
are<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> last<00:00:39.030> two<00:00:39.300> things<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:45.020> guess<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
are the last two things I guess the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:58.180 
are the last two things I guess the
packing<00:00:46.590> has<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> good<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.219> get<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.579> key

geek

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.290 

so<00:01:12.700> this<00:01:12.880> is<00:01:13.120> the<00:01:13.300> solar<00:01:13.600> battery<00:01:14.110> charger<00:01:15.300> you

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
so this is the solar battery charger you

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.970 
so this is the solar battery charger you
plug<00:01:16.660> that<00:01:16.690> in<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:17.560> your<00:01:18.690> car<00:01:19.690> lighter<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.410> it

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
plug that in to your car lighter and it

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.400 
plug that in to your car lighter and it
will<00:01:21.160> charge<00:01:21.430> trickle<00:01:22.240> charge<00:01:22.480> your<00:01:22.930> battery

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
will charge trickle charge your battery

the<00:03:48.600> clip<00:03:48.900> for<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.950> camera<00:03:50.280> mount<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.670> how<00:03:50.940> I

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
the clip for the camera mount and how I

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.250 
the clip for the camera mount and how I
got<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.360> set<00:03:51.600> up<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:52.020> think<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.860> uh<00:03:52.890> I<00:03:53.990> think<00:03:54.990> it

sits in there real well pretty good deal
so<00:04:08.310> actually<00:04:08.880> wash<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.330> car<00:04:09.570> today<00:04:10.190> it's<00:04:11.190> in

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
so actually wash the car today it's in

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.130 
so actually wash the car today it's in
the<00:04:11.400> 30s<00:04:11.640> my<00:04:11.940> hands<00:04:12.150> got<00:04:12.390> pretty<00:04:12.630> cool<00:04:12.870> but

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
the 30s my hands got pretty cool but

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
the 30s my hands got pretty cool but
it's<00:04:13.290> nice<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.709> clean<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:39.630> windshield<00:04:43.160> and

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
it's nice and clean the windshield and

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.440 
it's nice and clean the windshield and
as<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:44.640> can<00:04:44.820> see<00:04:45.229> the<00:04:46.229> light<00:04:46.500> is<00:04:46.530> blinking

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
as you can see the light is blinking

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.440 
as you can see the light is blinking
which<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.720> instructions<00:04:49.320> say<00:04:49.560> it's<00:04:49.740> charging

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
which the instructions say it's charging

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.350 
which the instructions say it's charging
so<00:04:52.520> hopefully<00:04:53.520> this<00:04:53.700> will<00:04:53.850> do<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.030> little<00:04:54.240> bit

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
so hopefully this will do a little bit

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.980 
so hopefully this will do a little bit
of<00:04:54.540> helpfulness<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.890> keep<00:04:56.220> in<00:04:56.570> my<00:04:57.570> battery

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
of helpfulness to keep in my battery

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.030 
of helpfulness to keep in my battery
charged<00:04:59.720> maybe<00:05:00.720> in<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.930> bit<00:05:00.990> in<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.590> while<00:05:01.800> I'll

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
charged maybe in a bit in a while I'll

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.290 
charged maybe in a bit in a while I'll
give<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.340> some<00:05:03.950> feedback<00:05:04.950> on<00:05:04.979> it<00:05:05.220> I'll<00:05:05.970> start

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
give you some feedback on it I'll start

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.909 
give you some feedback on it I'll start
it<00:05:06.419> up<00:05:06.570> maybe<00:05:06.870> tomorrow<00:05:07.229> see<00:05:07.500> how<00:05:07.530> it<00:05:07.710> does

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
it up maybe tomorrow see how it does

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.540 
it up maybe tomorrow see how it does
well<00:05:08.760> maybe<00:05:09.000> let's<00:05:09.450> see<00:05:09.690> if<00:05:09.810> it'll<00:05:09.990> start<00:05:10.260> now

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
well maybe let's see if it'll start now

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:18.770 
well maybe let's see if it'll start now
see<00:05:11.550> how<00:05:11.700> charge<00:05:12.030> my<00:05:12.240> batteries

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.080 

he<00:05:19.470> started

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.820 

but<00:05:25.090> it'll<00:05:25.420> be<00:05:25.510> tough<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:26.050> tell<00:05:26.200> exactly<00:05:26.380> how

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
but it'll be tough to tell exactly how

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.920 
but it'll be tough to tell exactly how
well<00:05:27.040> this<00:05:27.250> works<00:05:27.580> but<00:05:27.970> it<00:05:28.360> says<00:05:28.720> it's

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
well this works but it says it's

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:39.890 
well this works but it says it's
charging<00:05:29.320> it

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.600 

okay<00:05:40.139> you<00:05:40.410> can<00:05:40.590> see<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.979> battery<00:05:41.160> is<00:05:41.460> low

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
okay you can see the battery is low

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.610 
okay you can see the battery is low
that's<00:05:42.600> the<00:05:42.870> battery<00:05:43.110> indicator

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.930 

so<00:05:46.620> we'll<00:05:46.740> see<00:05:46.890> how<00:05:47.010> it<00:05:47.190> does<00:05:47.340> like<00:05:47.580> tomorrow

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
so we'll see how it does like tomorrow

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.710 
so we'll see how it does like tomorrow
like<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.690> end<00:05:48.840> of<00:05:48.960> day<00:05:49.110> how<00:05:49.350> did
