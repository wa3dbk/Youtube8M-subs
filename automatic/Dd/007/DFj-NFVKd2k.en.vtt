00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:44.299 
of the liquid from the tofu simply place

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:48.759 
of the liquid from the tofu simply place
it<00:00:44.330> on<00:00:44.600> a<00:00:44.650> paper<00:00:45.650> towel<00:00:45.979> and<00:00:46.250> gently<00:00:47.710> but<00:00:48.710> a

little bit of pressure the squeeze out
the<00:00:52.030> excess<00:00:53.030> water<00:00:53.089> the<00:00:53.720> reason<00:00:54.049> we<00:00:54.140> do<00:00:54.320> this

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
the excess water the reason we do this

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.250 
the excess water the reason we do this
is<00:00:54.830> to<00:00:55.100> allow<00:00:55.369> the<00:00:55.430> flavors<00:00:55.850> to<00:00:56.180> be<00:00:56.869> absorbed

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
is to allow the flavors to be absorbed

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.140 
is to allow the flavors to be absorbed
into<00:00:57.470> the<00:00:57.830> tofu<00:00:58.280> if<00:00:58.339> we<00:00:58.489> didn't<00:00:58.790> do<00:00:58.909> it<00:00:59.030> it

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
into the tofu if we didn't do it it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.079 
into the tofu if we didn't do it it
wouldn't<00:00:59.420> take<00:00:59.750> on<00:00:59.930> as<00:01:00.049> much<00:01:00.170> flavor<00:01:00.589> so<00:01:01.089> give

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
wouldn't take on as much flavor so give

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.990 
wouldn't take on as much flavor so give
it<00:01:02.150> a<00:01:02.210> gentle<00:01:02.900> press<00:01:03.369> we<00:01:04.369> have<00:01:04.549> been<00:01:04.729> quite

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
it a gentle press we have been quite

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.840 
it a gentle press we have been quite
gently<00:01:05.449> because<00:01:05.659> tofu<00:01:06.409> is<00:01:06.619> quite<00:01:07.010> fragile<00:01:07.340> you

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
gently because tofu is quite fragile you

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.179 
gently because tofu is quite fragile you
can<00:01:07.969> get<00:01:08.090> it<00:01:08.180> as<00:01:08.299> firm<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:08.899> silken<00:01:09.770> which<00:01:10.070> is

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
can get it as firm and silken which is

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:11.020 
can get it as firm and silken which is
very<00:01:10.340> very<00:01:10.460> soft
