do<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.340> again<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.640> separate<00:02:13.329> the<00:02:13.450> chip<00:02:13.659> and

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
do it again so separate the chip and

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.990 
do it again so separate the chip and
kind<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.319> push<00:02:14.650> down<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.219> in<00:02:15.840> from<00:02:16.840> both<00:02:17.170> sides

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
kind of push down and in from both sides

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.490 
kind of push down and in from both sides
and<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.239> chips<00:02:19.510> go<00:02:19.750> into<00:02:19.989> each<00:02:20.109> other<00:02:20.319> like

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
and the chips go into each other like

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.289 
and the chips go into each other like
that<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.370> have<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.700> shuffle<00:02:22.829> that's<00:02:23.829> it

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
that and you have the shuffle that's it

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.710 
that and you have the shuffle that's it
all<00:02:25.299> right

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
all right

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.470 
all right
now<00:02:25.870> let's<00:02:26.140> kick<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.439> up<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.650> little<00:02:26.829> bit

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
now let's kick it up a little bit

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.210 
now let's kick it up a little bit

okay<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.610> called<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.060> chip<00:02:33.360> pull<00:02:33.720> over

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
okay this is called the chip pull over

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.710 
okay this is called the chip pull over
you<00:02:35.040> see<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> lot<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.610> poker<00:02:35.790> players<00:02:36.150> doing

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
you see a lot of poker players doing

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.540 
you see a lot of poker players doing
this<00:02:36.870> move<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.890> basically<00:02:38.310> what<00:02:38.430> you're

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
this move and basically what you're

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.680 
this move and basically what you're
doing<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.790> you're<00:02:38.910> taking<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.209> last<00:02:39.420> point

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
doing is you're taking the last point

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.449 
doing is you're taking the last point
I'm<00:02:39.750> flipping<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.140> over<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:41.040> other<00:02:41.190> side<00:02:41.400> of

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
I'm flipping it over the other side of

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.160 
I'm flipping it over the other side of
the<00:02:41.640> other<00:02:41.730> coins<00:02:42.060> I'm<00:02:42.569> just<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:42.990> show

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
the other coins I'm just going to show

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.510 
the other coins I'm just going to show
you<00:02:43.200> with<00:02:43.380> four<00:02:43.620> for<00:02:43.830> example

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
you with four for example

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.770 
you with four for example
what<00:02:44.760> you're<00:02:44.880> doing<00:02:44.970> is<00:02:45.150> you're<00:02:45.270> holding<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
what you're doing is you're holding the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.230 
what you're doing is you're holding the
chips<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.200> place<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:47.010> position<00:02:47.520> with

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
chips in place in this position with

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.270 
chips in place in this position with
these<00:02:48.450> three<00:02:48.720> fingers<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.950> this

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
these three fingers this is the this

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.860 
these three fingers this is the this
will<00:02:50.430> be<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> middle<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.360> stack<00:02:51.570> and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
will be in the middle of the stack and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.990 
will be in the middle of the stack and
this<00:02:52.290> finger<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.860> finger<00:02:52.920> will<00:02:53.370> hold

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
this finger and this finger will hold

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.820 
this finger and this finger will hold
them<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.300> place<00:02:54.330> basically<00:02:55.020> your<00:02:55.380> thumb<00:02:55.650> does

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
them in place basically your thumb does

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.199 
them in place basically your thumb does
all<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.190> work<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.520> other<00:02:56.640> fingers<00:02:57.000> don't

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
all the work the other fingers don't

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.360 
all the work the other fingers don't
move<00:02:57.330> at<00:02:57.480> all<00:02:57.600> all<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.650> do<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.100> take<00:02:59.340> that

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
move at all all you do is you take that

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.510 
move at all all you do is you take that
last<00:02:59.910> chip<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.770> pull<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:01.920> over<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.370> other

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
last chip and pull it over the other

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.479 
last chip and pull it over the other
three<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.180> hits<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.620> side<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.010> chips<00:03:05.280> and

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
three it hits the side of the chips and

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.790 
three it hits the side of the chips and
it<00:03:05.610> just<00:03:05.760> kind<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:05.970> naturally<00:03:06.030> falls<00:03:06.810> over<00:03:07.230> so

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
it just kind of naturally falls over so

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.470 
it just kind of naturally falls over so
you're<00:03:07.950> not<00:03:08.070> bringing<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.850> over<00:03:08.970> you're<00:03:09.300> just

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
you're not bringing it over you're just

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.660 
you're not bringing it over you're just
shooting<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.170> over<00:03:10.440> kind<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:10.890> like<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.310> and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
shooting it over kind of like that and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.350 
shooting it over kind of like that and
that's<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.810> that's<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.350> pull<00:03:14.010> over<00:03:14.269> there<00:03:15.269> in

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
that's it that's the pull over there in

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.810 
that's it that's the pull over there in
this<00:03:15.540> position<00:03:16.019> you're<00:03:17.010> holding<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.550> chips

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
this position you're holding the chips

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.820 
this position you're holding the chips
with<00:03:18.120> these<00:03:18.360> three<00:03:18.600> fingers<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.200> all<00:03:19.680> you're

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
with these three fingers and all you're

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.590 
with these three fingers and all you're
doing<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.100> you're<00:03:20.190> taking<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.640> furthest<00:03:21.150> chip

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
doing is you're taking the furthest chip

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.840 
doing is you're taking the furthest chip
and<00:03:22.019> point<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.500> up<00:03:22.590> with<00:03:22.769> your<00:03:22.920> thumb<00:03:23.160> like

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
and point it up with your thumb like

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.880 
and point it up with your thumb like
this<00:03:23.910> once<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.810> get<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.050> this<00:03:25.140> position<00:03:25.680> it

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
this once you get to this position it

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.130 
this once you get to this position it
hits<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:27.000> side<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.390> chip<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.989> just

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
hits the side of the chip and it just

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.740 
hits the side of the chip and it just
kind<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.350> naturally<00:03:28.410> falls<00:03:29.220> over<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.850> main

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
kind of naturally falls over the main

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.800 
kind of naturally falls over the main
thing<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.050> remember<00:03:31.320> is<00:03:31.709> speed<00:03:32.580> so<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.450> faster

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
thing to remember is speed so the faster

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.410 
thing to remember is speed so the faster
you<00:03:33.930> go<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.470> cooler<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.310> looks<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.850> think<00:03:36.299> it's

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
you go the cooler it looks I think it's

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.539 
you go the cooler it looks I think it's
time<00:03:36.540> for<00:03:36.600> another<00:03:36.810> trick<00:03:37.230> maybe<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.950> little

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
time for another trick maybe a little

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.840 
time for another trick maybe a little
harder

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.880 

this<00:03:43.420> is<00:03:43.600> probably<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.110> hardest<00:03:44.350> trick<00:03:44.770> on

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
this is probably the hardest trick on

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.910 
this is probably the hardest trick on
this<00:03:45.040> DVD<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.910> spin<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:46.960> twirl<00:03:47.350> move<00:03:47.650> because

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
this DVD the spin and twirl move because

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.620 
this DVD the spin and twirl move because
that's<00:03:48.100> basically<00:03:48.460> what<00:03:48.730> you're<00:03:48.760> doing<00:03:49.180> to

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
that's basically what you're doing to

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.560 
that's basically what you're doing to
chips<00:03:49.930> go<00:03:50.830> up<00:03:51.010> one<00:03:51.250> chip<00:03:51.460> goes<00:03:51.640> down<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.180> spins

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
chips go up one chip goes down it spins

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.060 
chips go up one chip goes down it spins
and<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:52.780> goes<00:03:52.930> back<00:03:53.170> in<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.530> middle<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:53.950> the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
and it goes back in the middle of the

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.850 
and it goes back in the middle of the
coin<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:55.780> need<00:03:55.930> three<00:03:56.170> chips<00:03:56.500> for<00:03:56.740> this

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
coin so you need three chips for this

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.350

you want to do is you want to take the

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.840 
you want to do is you want to take the
deck<00:05:32.620> and<00:05:32.830> just<00:05:33.100> spread<00:05:33.340> it<00:05:33.370> out<00:05:33.580> now<00:05:33.790> the

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
deck and just spread it out now the

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.570 
deck and just spread it out now the
trick<00:05:34.120> is<00:05:34.150> to<00:05:34.270> get<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:35.260> cards<00:05:35.650> as<00:05:35.890> evenly<00:05:36.430> a

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
trick is to get the cards as evenly a

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.000 
trick is to get the cards as evenly a
split<00:05:37.030> as<00:05:37.240> possible<00:05:37.900> so<00:05:38.410> what<00:05:38.530> you<00:05:38.590> don't<00:05:38.830> want

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
split as possible so what you don't want

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.100 
split as possible so what you don't want
is<00:05:39.100> a<00:05:39.130> clump<00:05:39.490> over<00:05:39.760> here<00:05:40.030> and<00:05:40.240> you<00:05:40.810> know<00:05:40.930> this

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
is a clump over here and you know this

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.560 
is a clump over here and you know this
kind<00:05:41.320> of<00:05:41.410> a<00:05:41.470> messy<00:05:41.710> thing<00:05:42.120> smoothness<00:05:43.120> is<00:05:43.330> very

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
kind of a messy thing smoothness is very

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.210 
kind of a messy thing smoothness is very
important<00:05:44.080> so<00:05:44.500> you<00:05:44.560> take<00:05:44.770> the<00:05:44.890> deck<00:05:45.070> you

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220
