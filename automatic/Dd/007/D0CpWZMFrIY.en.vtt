00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:07.130
 falls on the part then almost touchpad 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:09.549
 that now the battery knows already inside the 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.549
 matter 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:28.970

 beast is indeed a beast 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.950
 so much so that I have already found the typical one 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:50.509
 it does nothing at all so much in the sense 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:50.509
 which also hurts 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.370

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:04.120
