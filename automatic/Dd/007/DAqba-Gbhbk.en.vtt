of<00:02:10.560> our<00:02:10.710> j2<00:02:11.040> engine<00:02:11.660> which<00:02:12.660> is

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
of our j2 engine which is

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.880 
of our j2 engine which is
the<00:02:13.420> only<00:02:13.780> upper<00:02:14.020> stage<00:02:14.230> engine<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.710> took

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
the only upper stage engine that took

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.650 
the only upper stage engine that took
the<00:02:15.520> man<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:15.910> moon<00:02:16.060> on<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.390> Apollo

practices and bonding processes so that

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.120 
practices and bonding processes so that
the<00:03:04.690> workmanship<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.680> much<00:03:05.890> higher<00:03:06.070> level

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
the workmanship is a much higher level

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.190 
the workmanship is a much higher level
than<00:03:06.550> was<00:03:06.790> ever<00:03:06.880> attainable<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.750> old<00:03:07.900> j2

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200

well<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.920> design<00:03:09.220> page<00:03:09.459> is<00:03:09.670> finished<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.240> so

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
well the design page is finished and so

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.930 
well the design page is finished and so
now<00:03:10.810> we<00:03:11.230> are<00:03:11.470> in<00:03:11.740> full-scale<00:03:12.670> manufacturing

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
engine 10001 will be ready for test

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.210 
engine 10001 will be ready for test
early<00:04:51.520> in<00:04:51.670> calendar<00:04:52.150> 2011<00:04:52.540> and<00:04:53.080> that<00:04:53.800> testing

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
early in calendar 2011 and that testing

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.590 
early in calendar 2011 and that testing
will<00:04:54.370> really<00:04:54.640> give<00:04:54.790> us<00:04:54.910> an<00:04:55.030> idea<00:04:55.120> whether

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
will really give us an idea whether

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.630 
will really give us an idea whether
we've<00:04:55.840> nailed<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.320> design<00:04:56.640> the

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
we've nailed the design the

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.520 
we've nailed the design the
manufacturing<00:04:58.360> processes<00:04:58.960> are<00:04:59.170> now<00:04:59.290> being

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
manufacturing processes are now being

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.650 
manufacturing processes are now being
developed<00:04:59.740> on<00:05:00.160> this<00:05:00.520> first<00:05:00.820> engine<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.480> we're

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
developed on this first engine and we're

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.330 
developed on this first engine and we're
proofing<00:05:02.080> these<00:05:02.260> things<00:05:02.590> out<00:05:02.770> making<00:05:03.220> sure

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
proofing these things out making sure

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.010 
proofing these things out making sure
the<00:05:03.520> tapes<00:05:03.790> are<00:05:04.000> correcting<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.510> machining

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
the tapes are correcting the machining

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.660 
the tapes are correcting the machining
making<00:05:05.350> sure<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.650> weld<00:05:05.890> parameters<00:05:06.520> are

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
making sure the weld parameters are

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.550 
making sure the weld parameters are
right<00:05:06.850> making<00:05:07.720> sure<00:05:07.750> that<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.260> assembly

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
right making sure that the assembly

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.500 
right making sure that the assembly
sequences<00:05:09.280> are<00:05:09.460> perfect<00:05:09.880> for<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.120> upcoming

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
sequences are perfect for the upcoming

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.600 
sequences are perfect for the upcoming
engines<00:05:11.050> so<00:05:11.560> it's<00:05:11.680> always<00:05:11.830> hard<00:05:12.130> to<00:05:12.220> get<00:05:12.460> that

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
engines so it's always hard to get that

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.760 
engines so it's always hard to get that
first<00:05:12.850> engine<00:05:13.390> put<00:05:13.570> together<00:05:13.720> but<00:05:14.380> once<00:05:14.590> we

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
first engine put together but once we

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.230 
first engine put together but once we
have<00:05:14.950> this<00:05:15.100> put<00:05:15.310> together<00:05:15.430> we'll<00:05:15.820> put<00:05:16.030> in<00:05:16.120> a

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
have this put together we'll put in a

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.940 
have this put together we'll put in a
bunch<00:05:16.450> of<00:05:16.570> improvements<00:05:17.380> and<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:17.590> following

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
bunch of improvements and the following

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.290 
bunch of improvements and the following
engines<00:05:18.400> will<00:05:18.580> go<00:05:18.700> together<00:05:18.850> much<00:05:19.270> more

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
engines will go together much more

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.470 
engines will go together much more
easily
