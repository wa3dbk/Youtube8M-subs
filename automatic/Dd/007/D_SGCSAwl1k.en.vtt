00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.490
 you have requested in another video these 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.470
 Simple are bobbins and brushing 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.030
 dry has many virtues and many 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.800
 properties for the skin is the leaves 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.780
 gentle prevents you from having dead cells 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.050
 exfoliates and also irrigates better the 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.210
 blood in the body and also prevents a 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.800
 little cellulite also you know 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.690
 that always within a framework of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.580
 healthy eating and exercise 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.590
 etcetera good I use these two 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.270
 Brush if I'm going to teach you how 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.489
 I use it more or less I'm like this 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.010
 half in bikini is to show you how 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.380
 He uses it 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.030
 what I do is get home and with this 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.050
 small 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.400
 I'm starting with the foot up 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.430
 forever 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.540
 in circular movements upwards 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.870
 up English glÃºteo 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.780
 abdominal 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.750
 and then the chest gently scratches a lot 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.280
 at the beginning it will cost you because you will say 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.080
 that bothers the skin but once 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.450
 do it several times then it seems 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.640
 something soft then I also start with the 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.030
 hands up always in direction 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.820
 to the heart also below the 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.030
 armpits that there are many ganglia that you're going 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.880
 to make the lymphatic system 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.420
 better again circulate chest 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.530
 halo of the chest I do not touch the other 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.880
 the same hand down circulars 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.430
 more and then 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.549
 with this good brushing brush 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.360
 big what I use for the back 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.299
 we use the expanda without touching the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.270
 column of panning up towards 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.079
 upwards for the neck 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.079
 shoulders 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.060
 this scratch even I think a little 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.969
 more than the previous one and if I want some 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.600
 times for him again review over 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.000
 all the thigh that is the area that most 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.160
 the skin is thicker and we have more 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.740
 cells 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.590
 the fat cells that we want 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.570
 mobilize a little more and good takes 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.430
 At the beginning we do not know why you are late 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.020
 minutes but then with what you do in 5 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.930
 minutes 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.400
 you go teitel leftover is very very good me 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.800
 I do about everything and nothing more reach 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.930
 house and you feel like more relaxed the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.730
 body because you take off your annoying clothes 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.400
 the bra whatever and you can 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.409
 It leaves you feeling of well - being in the 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.480
 You can also do it before the 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.860
 shower but I do not recommend that you wash 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.470
 after the shower because you have the 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.560
 more sensitive skin when freshly wet 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.140
 I can use this for wet 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.090
 but I've never wet what I've used 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.640
 always dry and good I hope that you 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.080
