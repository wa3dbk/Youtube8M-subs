00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
up using safety wire to fix it right now

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.960 
up using safety wire to fix it right now
it's<00:01:41.829> in<00:01:41.979> full<00:01:42.270> hot<00:01:44.100> I'll<00:01:45.100> go<00:01:45.280> ahead<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.549> cycle

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
it's in full hot I'll go ahead and cycle

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.490 
it's in full hot I'll go ahead and cycle
it<00:01:46.090> if<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.360> can<00:01:48.539> actually<00:01:49.539> I'll<00:01:49.899> just<00:01:49.929> let<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.380> do

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
it if I can actually I'll just let it do

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:58.780 
it if I can actually I'll just let it do
the<00:01:50.649> test

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:06.250 

so<00:01:59.790> there<00:01:59.910> goes<00:02:00.150> cycling

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.130 

the<00:02:06.800> gap<00:02:07.130> does<00:02:07.550> open<00:02:08.150> up<00:02:08.330> when<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.750> gets<00:02:08.780> too

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
the gap does open up when it gets too

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.740 
the gap does open up when it gets too

but<00:02:15.590> my<00:02:15.740> band-aid<00:02:16.190> worked<00:02:18.730> least<00:02:19.730> until<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.150> get

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
but my band-aid worked least until I get

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:40.330 
but my band-aid worked least until I get
the<00:02:20.480> part

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.440 

you<00:02:40.910> can<00:02:41.030> see<00:02:41.239> how<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.420> gap<00:02:41.900> opens<00:02:43.269> come<00:02:44.269> on

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
you can see how that gap opens come on

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.679 
you can see how that gap opens come on
