data<00:04:34.009> and<00:04:34.219> stuff<00:04:34.369> like<00:04:34.519> that<00:04:34.579> it's<00:04:34.849> going<00:04:34.999> to

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:35.059 
data and stuff like that it's going to

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:36.369 
data and stuff like that it's going to
really<00:04:35.179> help<00:04:35.360> with<00:04:35.509> battery<00:04:35.839> life<00:04:36.079> and<00:04:36.229> that

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:36.379 
really help with battery life and that

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.919 
really help with battery life and that
5s<00:04:37.159> they<00:04:37.699> have<00:04:37.879> that<00:04:38.089> chip<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:38.629> I'm<00:04:38.749> sure

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:38.929 
5s they have that chip so I'm sure
