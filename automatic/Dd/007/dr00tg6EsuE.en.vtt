00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.920
 hi in this video I will comment 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:20.260
 in a simple way a trick to be able 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.200
 cover the gray hair well 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.530
 many women have the problem of 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:31.029
 have a hard or rebellious face that is 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.850
 usually call this which means that 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:39.730
 when the color is applied on the hair 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:42.340
 dye gray hair cuticle and 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.430
 It costs up costs for opening 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.820
 that the product penetrates inside and fulfills 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.120
 with its function 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.790
 then when dyeing this type of hair 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.100
 what it does is that a color remains 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.700
 dizzy a very faded color does not remain 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.670
 it is clearer than in other areas 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.880
 of the hair cable of the hairs 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.900
 they have gray hair as we can give it a 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.170
 solution to this 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.350
 with a very simple trick we know that the 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.320
 hair grows every day and every month 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.570
 about one centimeter worth 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.290
 little bit more, depending on the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.430
 person well when we go to have the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.909
 hair in the root we apply the dye 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.579
 single 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.200
 explained we know that when we go to 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.109
 apply a dye mix the cream 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.840
 dyes and the tin can with the 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.490
 oxygenated water well before doing this 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.969
 operation we are going to apply the client 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.289
 just the coloring cream or the 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.509
 let's imagine if we are not having the 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.509
 hair with a chestnut color 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.829
 the brown color will be applied 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.380
 as if we applied a dye with the 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.350
 brush with the brush we apply it 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.210
 in the whole root and we let it act 10 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.310
 minutes more or less 15 what is going to be this 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.430
 this has a logic some dyes that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.140
 little bit of ammonia that the dye brings 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.810
 what you are going to do is to soften the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.170
 hair is going to be that force a little to the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.579
 Cuticle to be opened 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.870
 well in this way when we apply the 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:29.430
 dye already mixed with hydrogen peroxide 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.560
 is going to have the easiest way to 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.470
 penetrate inside the stem and power 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.959
 fulfill its function this is the only thing that 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.209
 does therefore this is a very trick 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.440
 simple we apply for 10-15 minutes 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:46.110
 the dye only and then there's no need 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.239
 wash the hair apply we make the mixture 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.030
 with oxygenated water and we apply the 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.030
 dye as usual as always 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:01.170
 a note if we stick with a color 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.340
 only base for example a 4 vale 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.640
 we apply the 4 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.470
 those 10 minutes is worth it but if we are not 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.360
 having hair for example with a 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.019
 6-3 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.319
 we have to apply only during 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.550
 about 10 minutes a color dye 6 without 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.660
 no reflection 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.660
 only the base tone is valid because it is 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.690
 this because in a white hair the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.000
 tones are clearer and reflections 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.390
 more intense and as we want 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.600
 cover that covers the face well then 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.570
 we apply only one base color on 6 and 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.900
 then we prepare the 63 and we already apply it 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.210
 as always with this trick you will see that the 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.310
 face if they have problems or 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.430
 rebel that is called will see that they 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.990
 it covers perfectly I hope it is 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.990
 useful and up to another video
