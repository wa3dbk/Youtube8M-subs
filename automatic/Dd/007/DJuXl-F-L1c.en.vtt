00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:09.900
 Just spray the windows to increase the efficiency of air conditioning 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:13.670
 Window energy saving spray 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.670
 It's cold and hot 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:25.820
 Winter window contains the correspondence of light 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:29.670
 It brightens and warms the air , but at the same time it dissipates the heat of the room that has warmed up 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:36.500
 It has become a cause of reducing the efficiency of heating 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:43.940
 It is the window glass of the winter season mainly for unpleasant condensation 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:51.180
 This energy saving spray is cold and hot when I want to recommend it there 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:54.950
 Our patented 2-layer insulation technology can be easily used at home 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.670
 Limiting heat in and out of the window glass 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.970
 A pair in a comfortable space 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.450
 Underground Bo aqueous safe because 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:12.440
 To attach by chemical reaction in Lars year 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:13.930
 You can easily apply the active ingredients without selling them just by spraying and extending them. 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.590
 I will 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.550
 After painting, it won't drop even if you wipe it with a cloth 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.760
 Of course cleaning is ok 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.710
 yeah 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:32.120
 It's cold and hot, as the name implies , from the three seat in winter 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.570
 Provide comfortable living with heat insulation effect 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.430
 In the case of winter 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:43.740
 The heat in the room escapes from the window glass 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.930
 Now due to the cause of the heating efficiency will be stayed at one time 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.130
 if 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:53.350
 By coating the window glass with a cold, hot moment, the imperial house of the heat from the window glass is suppressed 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.980
 I will 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:03.659
 This sound effect can increase the efficiency of air conditioning 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:08.350
 We control outflow of approximately 28% heat 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.280
 It is now possible to establish a large electricity bill 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:16.990
 Nem ãƒ¼ 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:25.330
 There are also condensation suppression effect in the cold hot at that time of the winter effect 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:28.470
 Condensation moisture in the room in that the surface temperature of the window glass on a cold day of winter falls is on the glass surface 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:34.080
 It occurs by adhering 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.370
 Or the water flow of the grown condensation causes corrosion of the flow to the wooden frame of the sash 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.610
 It will also be on the vase flights 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:45.860
 Morishi 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:47.630
 The growth of condensation is caused by the fact that the temperature near the surface of the glass does not fall due to the heat insulation effect at the time of cold and hot 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.490
 Significantly delayed 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.740
 It can be reduced to about one third 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.450
 As you can see the results 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:07.590
 The after-sales of scoo 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:10.220
 Water is flowing through the glass surface without through, but the window sprayed under the same conditions is cloudy and stops 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.220
 I am 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:23.460
 Then we introduce how to use at the time of cold and hot 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:27.660
 It is cold and hot, and two pieces of dry cloth prepare 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:31.580
 Turn the sprue nozzle to this position 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:35.560
 The triangle is a mark of sound 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:40.990
 Let's clean the hot side cleanly 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:46.290
 And 30 centimeters away from the window, and a quick cookie 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.290
 The standard is 5 sprays per ad 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:58.060
 Stretch the entire window with the prepared cloth 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:02.000
 After that, just wipe it with another 10,000 cloth ok 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:07.030
 Only one window glass 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.030
 You can easily get Tamagotsuki effect 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:20.400
 We introduce the performance of insulation technology by the I layer structure has been used when the cold hot 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:25.530
 Acquired Tokyo in 23 countries around the world 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:31.070
 The world's first thermal insulation technology is already widely used 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:38.780
 The same technology as insulation film c film for window glass 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:39.650
 Seal film has already been adopted in various buildings, its trust and track record in many offices 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:47.740
 building 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.740
 It is proven that it is used for window glass of public facilities Shinkansen 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:58.240
 The Necessity of Your Eco-Life in the Future 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.240
 It's cold and hot
