think that would complement the white

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.520 
think that would complement the white
edge<00:02:53.209> flap<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.389> there<00:02:54.599> that's<00:02:55.139> what<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.379> it

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
and this is a look a better is this this

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.569 
and this is a look a better is this this
is<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.299> as<00:03:54.510> good<00:03:55.379> as<00:03:55.590> you're<00:03:55.709> gonna<00:03:55.769> get<00:03:56.010> for
