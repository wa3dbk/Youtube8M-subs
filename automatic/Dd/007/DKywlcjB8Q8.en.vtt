seasons<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.189> forms<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.850> think<00:01:06.330> he<00:01:06.420> should<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.689> 83

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
seasons in forms I think he should be 83

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.859 
seasons in forms I think he should be 83
rated<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.740> start<00:01:07.979> off<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.549> FIFA<00:01:09.299> 15<00:01:09.420> maybe

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
rated to start off with on FIFA 15 maybe

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.010 
rated to start off with on FIFA 15 maybe
could<00:01:10.680> stretch<00:01:10.979> from<00:01:11.100> 84<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.790> think<00:01:12.000> 83<00:01:12.600> is

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
could stretch from 84 I think 83 is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350 
could stretch from 84 I think 83 is
actually<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:13.860> fair<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.220> Christmas<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:14.909> he

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
actually really fair for Christmas so he

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.140

think<00:01:35.939> he's<00:01:36.240> genuine<00:01:36.540> decent<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.900> passing

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
think he's genuine decent and passing

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
think he's genuine decent and passing
dribbling<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.400> decent<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:38.880> well<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.270> should

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
dribbling is decent as well that should

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.819 
dribbling is decent as well that should
go<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.630> little<00:01:39.689> bit<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.229> his<00:01:40.439> physical

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
go up a little bit now his physical

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.960 
go up a little bit now his physical
spouse<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.250> gonna<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.460> difficult<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.820> all

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
spouse it's gonna be difficult for all

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.490 
spouse it's gonna be difficult for all
of<00:01:42.000> them<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.540> think<00:01:42.720> he<00:01:42.869> should<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.259> my

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
of them I don't think he should have my

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.319 
of them I don't think he should have my
physical<00:01:43.979> simply<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:44.700> he's<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.149> low

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
physical simply because he's got low

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.510 
physical simply because he's got low
strength<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.930> fifa<00:01:46.229> 14<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:47.340> my

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
strength on fifa 14 so that's my

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.980 
strength on fifa 14 so that's my
prediction<00:01:47.700> anyway<00:01:48.270> let's<00:01:48.659> move<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.960> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
prediction anyway let's move on to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.249 
prediction anyway let's move on to
Jerome<00:01:49.350> Boateng<00:01:49.590> an<00:01:49.979> 83<00:01:50.579> rated<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.060> fifa<00:01:52.020> 14

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
Jerome Boateng an 83 rated on fifa 14

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.380 
Jerome Boateng an 83 rated on fifa 14
and<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.040> believe<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.520> also<00:01:53.820> an<00:01:54.090> upgrade<00:01:54.360> I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and I believe this is also an upgrade I

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.959 
and I believe this is also an upgrade I
think<00:01:54.630> his<00:01:54.780> first<00:01:54.990> one<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.320> an<00:01:55.409> 82<00:01:56.009> genuinely

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
think his first one was an 82 genuinely

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.810 
think his first one was an 82 genuinely
a<00:01:57.180> really<00:01:57.270> awesome<00:01:58.200> sent<00:01:58.950> back<00:01:59.159> definitely

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
a really awesome sent back definitely

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.780 
a really awesome sent back definitely
one<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:00.689> favorites<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.710> think<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.399> 15

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
one of my favorites and I think on be 15

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.520 
one of my favorites and I think on be 15
he's<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.479> even<00:02:03.689> better<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.439> it

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
he's going to be even better I think it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.609 
he's going to be even better I think it
deserves<00:02:04.619> an<00:02:05.000> 84<00:02:06.000> rated<00:02:06.450> card<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.810> we<00:02:06.840> had<00:02:06.990> 14

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
deserves an 84 rated card so we had 14

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.830 
deserves an 84 rated card so we had 14
clean<00:02:08.039> sheets<00:02:08.369> he<00:02:08.520> got<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> goal<00:02:09.000> he<00:02:09.420> got<00:02:09.629> an

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
clean sheets he got a goal he got an

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.130 
clean sheets he got a goal he got an

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
amount don't think that is deserved and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.949 
amount don't think that is deserved and
i<00:02:29.370> think<00:02:29.550> that's<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:29.790> EA<00:02:29.910> would<00:02:30.150> do<00:02:30.300> but<00:02:30.540> i<00:02:30.720> am

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
i think that's what EA would do but i am

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.960 
i think that's what EA would do but i am
upgrading<00:02:31.170> his<00:02:31.590> physical<00:02:32.130> staff<00:02:32.340> simply

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
upgrading his physical staff simply

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.420 
upgrading his physical staff simply
because<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.690> will<00:02:34.050> include<00:02:34.650> strains<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.250> his

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
because it will include strains and his

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.610 
because it will include strains and his
strength<00:02:35.640> moment<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.180> about<00:02:36.330> 87<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.110> to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
strength moment is about 87 so to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.020 
strength moment is about 87 so to
balance<00:02:37.800> out<00:02:38.100> with<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.280> heading<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.790> should

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
balance out with this heading it should

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.330 
balance out with this heading it should
be<00:02:39.060> right<00:02:39.239> about<00:02:39.360> 84<00:02:39.900> that's<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.380> pretty<00:02:40.980> fair

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
be right about 84 that's a pretty fair

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.490 
be right about 84 that's a pretty fair
guess<00:02:41.610> they're<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.330> very<00:02:42.630> decent<00:02:42.989> car<00:02:43.319> to

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
guess they're so a very decent car to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.680 
guess they're so a very decent car to

18<00:03:09.900> assists<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.470> i<00:03:10.500> genuinely<00:03:10.739> think<00:03:11.010> his

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
18 assists and i genuinely think his

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.220 
18 assists and i genuinely think his
weak<00:03:11.550> foot<00:03:11.820> should<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:12.390> upgraded<00:03:12.900> from<00:03:12.989> two

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
weak foot should be upgraded from two

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.199 
weak foot should be upgraded from two
starts<00:03:13.560> three<00:03:13.769> star<00:03:13.980> because<00:03:14.250> i<00:03:14.400> did<00:03:14.820> look<00:03:15.000> at

he scored six of his goals with his

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.400 
he scored six of his goals with his
right<00:03:17.700> foot<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.420> doesn't<00:03:18.930> seem<00:03:19.019> like<00:03:19.230> a

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
right foot so that doesn't seem like a

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.170 
right foot so that doesn't seem like a

section<00:03:26.310> below<00:03:26.400> i<00:03:26.489> think<00:03:26.790> his<00:03:26.910> physical

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
section below i think his physical

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.970 
section below i think his physical
static<00:03:27.959> at<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.290> go<00:03:28.320> why<00:03:28.829> have<00:03:28.950> you

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
static at that and go why have you

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.400 
static at that and go why have you
upgraded<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.549> eight<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:31.110> reason<00:03:31.380> being

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
upgraded that eight and the reason being

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.130 
upgraded that eight and the reason being
because<00:03:31.680> his<00:03:32.070> strength<00:03:32.519> is<00:03:32.730> around<00:03:33.239> 90<00:03:33.870> at<00:03:34.079> the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
because his strength is around 90 at the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.539 
because his strength is around 90 at the
moment<00:03:34.500> his<00:03:34.950> heading<00:03:35.370> stat<00:03:35.640> was<00:03:36.090> around<00:03:36.600> about

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
moment his heading stat was around about

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.340 
moment his heading stat was around about
74<00:03:38.549> i<00:03:38.579> believe<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:39.840> i<00:03:39.870> don't<00:03:40.049> see<00:03:40.170> why<00:03:40.290> it

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
74 i believe so i don't see why it

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.600 
74 i believe so i don't see why it
should<00:03:40.470> stay<00:03:40.769> around<00:03:41.070> that<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> me<00:03:41.459> because

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
should stay around that to me because

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.550 
should stay around that to me because
his<00:03:41.910> strength<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.329> me<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:42.750> high<00:03:42.959> i'm<00:03:43.380> gonna

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
his strength to me so high i'm gonna

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.170 
his strength to me so high i'm gonna
combine<00:03:43.890> up<00:03:44.070> with<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.220> heading<00:03:44.549> it<00:03:44.790> should

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
combine up with the heading it should

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.479 
combine up with the heading it should
balance<00:03:45.329> out<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:46.079> around<00:03:46.260> about<00:03:46.410> 82<00:03:46.920> so<00:03:47.100> a<00:03:47.130> very
