00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.000
 The Christmas Spruce stands, everything is glittering on it, 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 and where are you? 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.500
 I set up a nursery, I prepared everything. 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.700
 When I think of me as a loser, I was born in a stallion that night, 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.500
 when the star of the repaticae was Bethlehem. 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.400
 2014 years after how you look at this world I do not know, 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.300
 when you come back again between us on the Judgment Day, you will probably stand like a buried. 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.000
 But you will come among us in sandals, but you will still wear a long white robe, 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 but will you have a beard, a mustache, long hair, just like a miraculous power once? 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.300
 Ring-ding-ding-dindingidin! 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.000
 Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow, pa-pa-pa-pa-pow! 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.700
 How would you feel if you came into this modern world? 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.400
 Can he turn on? Could you learn who lives? 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.700
 Would you be tempted by the christmas songs that exaggerate with the scribbles, 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.480
 Would you have moved Last Christmas, though George Michael likes to have a bowl? 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.300
 Do you have everyday little things to worry about? 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.600
 You, too, are bloody under the skin, "Mary help me!" 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.800
 If I would like to call on the holy three kings or the blue cans, 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.000
 let me disappoint you - ModrÃ¡ny all terms are busy. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Jesus Christ, how we thirst, Jesus Christ, how we thirsty, 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.700
 Jesus Christ, as we are thirsty, do not give us a pit, 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.100
 they do not give us a pit! 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.000
 Would you be able to change the water into wine? 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Jesus Christ, we are thirsty, the thirst of a better world. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Jesus Christ, happy Christmas, live Slovenia! 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Jesus Christ, the superstar, give up, save us and be a king! 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Jesus Christ, the Son of God, come and do us from the waters of the wines! 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:07.800
 Jesus Christ, happy Christmas, live Slovenia! 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.200
 All the best, Jesus!
