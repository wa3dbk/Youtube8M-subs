till they leave play Doyle

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.909 
till they leave play Doyle
I<00:00:04.830> think<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:05.430> have<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.150> look<00:00:06.299> at<00:00:06.420> my<00:00:06.540> own<00:00:06.890> team<00:00:07.890> and

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
I think I have a look at my own team and

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.890 
I think I have a look at my own team and
and<00:00:08.730> for<00:00:09.030> us<00:00:09.059> we<00:00:09.269> were<00:00:09.389> known<00:00:09.570> near<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
and for us we were known near the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.290 
and for us we were known near the
standard<00:00:10.469> today<00:00:10.559> we<00:00:10.860> made<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.040> really<00:00:11.300> slow

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
standard today we made a really slow

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.060 
standard today we made a really slow
start<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.080> before<00:00:13.230> we<00:00:13.500> knew<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.830> were<00:00:13.860> to

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
start and before we knew it we were to

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.620 
start and before we knew it we were to
nail<00:00:14.250> down<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:15.830> now<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.859> think<00:00:17.510> lots<00:00:18.510> of

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
nail down so now I think lots of

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.630 
nail down so now I think lots of
elements<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.080> our<00:00:19.199> game<00:00:19.380> there's<00:00:19.980> been<00:00:20.160> very

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
elements of our game there's been very

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.890 
elements of our game there's been very
good<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.029> everyone<00:00:21.330> has<00:00:21.420> seen<00:00:21.600> over<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.869> last

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
good and everyone has seen over the last

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.509 
good and everyone has seen over the last
couple<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.439> seasons<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.100> not<00:00:23.400> quite

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
couple of seasons it's just not quite

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.790 
couple of seasons it's just not quite
happened<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.060> us<00:00:24.090> at<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.300> moment<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:25.710> have

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
happened for us at the moment so we have

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.310 
happened for us at the moment so we have
a<00:00:25.859> lot<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.039> work<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.260> said

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
a lot of work to do and like I said

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.410 
a lot of work to do and like I said
today<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.369> was<00:00:29.580> very<00:00:29.609> disappointing<00:00:30.330> in

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
today was was very disappointing in

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.189 
today was was very disappointing in
terms<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.720> performance

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
terms of performance

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.119 
terms of performance
I<00:00:35.450> just<00:00:36.450> think<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.860> number<00:00:38.070> of

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
I just think it's it's a number of

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.610 
I just think it's it's a number of
things<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.910> think<00:00:39.750> we've<00:00:39.870> sort<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.170> potential

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
things I think we've sort of potential

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
things I think we've sort of potential
and<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> Tottenham<00:00:41.610> game<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.969> season<00:00:42.210> I

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and in the Tottenham game this season I

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930 
and in the Tottenham game this season I
think<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.020> may<00:00:43.110> Harbor<00:00:43.290> players<00:00:43.700> fit<00:00:44.700> then

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
think one may Harbor players fit then

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.340 
think one may Harbor players fit then
key<00:00:45.149> players<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.600> been<00:00:45.690> mothers<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
key players have been mothers now for a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
key players have been mothers now for a
couple<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.620> seasons<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.760> think<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.270> showed<00:00:48.420> in

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
couple of seasons I think we showed in

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
couple of seasons I think we showed in
that<00:00:48.690> game<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.469> real<00:00:49.860> quality<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
that game the real quality and the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.080 
that game the real quality and the
intensity<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> team<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.670> for

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
intensity of the team and and for for

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.180 
intensity of the team and and for for
ourselves<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:55.170> those<00:00:55.350> guys<00:00:55.980> aren't

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
ourselves when those guys aren't

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.939 
ourselves when those guys aren't
available<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:57.180> hurt<00:00:57.300> us<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:57.890> as<00:00:58.890> I

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
available then it can hurt us but as I

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.529 
available then it can hurt us but as I
said<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.399> still<00:00:59.730> should<00:00:59.940> be<00:00:59.969> better<00:01:00.180> than<00:01:00.420> what

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
said we still should be better than what

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.319 
said we still should be better than what
we<00:01:00.660> were<00:01:00.809> today<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.910> there's<00:01:02.910> no<00:01:03.000> doubt<00:01:03.180> we

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
we were today so there's no doubt we

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
we were today so there's no doubt we
need<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> go<00:01:04.320> back<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.799> training<00:01:05.010> ground

and normally are passing shorter and

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.930 
and normally are passing shorter and
crisper<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.119> faster<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.380> game<00:01:56.560> and

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
crisper and faster and the game and

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.130 
today we were didn't show enough
composure<00:02:00.310> on<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.670> ball<00:02:00.880> but<00:02:01.119> first<00:02:01.930> and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
composure on the ball but first and

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.810 
composure on the ball but first and
foremost<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.590> thought<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.040> intensity<00:02:03.610> of

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
foremost I thought the the intensity of

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.820 
foremost I thought the the intensity of
her<00:02:03.910> game<00:02:04.119> was<00:02:04.780> some<00:02:04.930> quite<00:02:05.110> at<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.380> level<00:02:05.410> but

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
her game was some quite at the level but

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.669 
her game was some quite at the level but
that's<00:02:06.640> not<00:02:06.790> something<00:02:06.970> that<00:02:07.330> we<00:02:07.509> will<00:02:07.690> we

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
that's not something that we will we

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.650 
that's not something that we will we
will<00:02:08.709> look<00:02:08.950> at<00:02:09.190> I'm<00:02:09.729> very<00:02:10.030> very<00:02:10.209> fortunate

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
will look at I'm very very fortunate

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.270 
will look at I'm very very fortunate
that<00:02:11.050> I've<00:02:11.170> got<00:02:11.350> an<00:02:11.500> honest<00:02:11.800> group<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.100> players

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
that I've got an honest group of players

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.690 
that I've got an honest group of players
that<00:02:12.580> know<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:14.010> that's<00:02:15.010> what<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.280> level<00:02:15.580> isn't

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
that know that that's what a level isn't

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.390 
that know that that's what a level isn't
what<00:02:15.910> we'd<00:02:16.060> expect<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.860> we<00:02:18.010> will<00:02:18.160> over

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
what we'd expect and and we will over

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.680 
what we'd expect and and we will over
the<00:02:18.489> course<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.820> season<00:02:19.030> get<00:02:19.300> better<00:02:19.480> and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
the course of the season get better and

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.690 
the course of the season get better and
better

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.830 

yes<00:02:27.700> shortly<00:02:27.940> when<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.090> went<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.360> -<00:02:28.480> one<00:02:28.690> with

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
yes shortly when I went to - one with

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.720 
yes shortly when I went to - one with
enough<00:02:29.050> time<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.650> think<00:02:30.130> we<00:02:30.250> shot<00:02:30.400> regained

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
enough time and I think we shot regained

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.820 
enough time and I think we shot regained
a<00:02:30.790> wee<00:02:30.910> bit<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.120> her<00:02:31.180> composure<00:02:31.540> again<00:02:31.989> I<00:02:32.230> felt

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
a wee bit of her composure again I felt

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.010 
a wee bit of her composure again I felt
I<00:02:32.920> did<00:02:33.070> change<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.970> system<00:02:34.180> -<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.870> order

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
I did change the the system - in order

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.979 
I did change the the system - in order
to<00:02:35.260> give<00:02:35.709> us<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:36.220> new<00:02:37.030> dimension<00:02:37.570> in<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.780> game

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
to give us a new dimension in the game

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.620 
to give us a new dimension in the game
brahim<00:02:38.350> scored<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.709> fantastic<00:02:38.830> goal<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.790> and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
brahim scored a fantastic goal and and

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.740 
brahim scored a fantastic goal and and
then<00:02:40.780> as<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:40.989> said<00:02:41.170> up<00:02:41.290> until<00:02:41.410> probably<00:02:41.799> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
then as I said up until probably the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.150 
then as I said up until probably the
they<00:02:43.750> got<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.959> third<00:02:44.140> goal<00:02:44.380> at<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.620> n-bomb<00:02:44.980> or

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
they got the third goal at the n-bomb or

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.570 
they got the third goal at the n-bomb or
risking<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.030> game<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.480> make<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.260> mistake<00:02:47.680> we

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
risking the game and make a mistake we

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.520 
risking the game and make a mistake we
probably<00:02:48.790> went<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.120> too<00:02:49.299> much<00:02:49.450> threat<00:02:50.140> then<00:02:50.350> so

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
probably went in too much threat then so

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.009 
probably went in too much threat then so
with<00:02:50.650> enough<00:02:50.830> time<00:02:51.100> T<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:52.180> get<00:02:52.360> back<00:02:52.540> in<00:02:52.720> -<00:02:52.870> but

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
with enough time T to get back in - but

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.199 
with enough time T to get back in - but
just<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.410> little<00:02:54.370> bit<00:02:54.489> luck<00:02:54.760> we<00:02:54.910> need<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.150> in

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
just that little bit luck we need it in

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.690 
just that little bit luck we need it in
the<00:02:55.299> final<00:02:55.600> ball<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.890> final<00:02:57.190> finish<00:02:57.489> I

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
the final ball and the final finish I

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.860 
the final ball and the final finish I
just<00:02:57.850> wasn't<00:02:58.330> there<00:02:58.450> for<00:02:58.630> us

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.300 

yeah<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:05.900> think<00:03:06.110> but<00:03:06.410> that's<00:03:06.530> we<00:03:06.920> have<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.160> deal

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
yeah I think but that's we have to deal

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.640 
yeah I think but that's we have to deal
with<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.959> know<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.110> can't<00:03:09.410> run<00:03:09.530> away

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
with that you know you can't run away

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.190 
with that you know you can't run away
from<00:03:09.739> we<00:03:10.160> were<00:03:10.630> we<00:03:11.630> were<00:03:11.690> brilliant<00:03:12.050> last

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
from we were we were brilliant last

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.780 
from we were we were brilliant last
season<00:03:12.590> everything<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.010> will<00:03:13.160> say<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.489> at<00:03:13.640> this

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
season everything I will say is at this

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.949 
season everything I will say is at this
point<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:14.569> last<00:03:14.989> season<00:03:15.380> we<00:03:16.340> didn't<00:03:16.610> finish<00:03:17.090> we

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
point of last season we didn't finish we

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.540 
point of last season we didn't finish we
did<00:03:18.110> we<00:03:18.230> weren't<00:03:18.380> playing<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.280> level<00:03:19.520> that

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
did we weren't playing to the level that

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.650 
did we weren't playing to the level that
we<00:03:19.670> finished<00:03:19.970> in<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.150> last<00:03:20.270> three<00:03:20.510> four

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
we finished in the last three four

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.110 
we finished in the last three four
months<00:03:20.720> as<00:03:21.019> he's<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.530> know<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.459> remember<00:03:22.940> last

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
months as he's you know I remember last

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.400 
months as he's you know I remember last
season<00:03:23.330> everyone<00:03:23.630> asking<00:03:23.930> me<00:03:24.019> but<00:03:24.140> would<00:03:24.319> we

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
season everyone asking me but would we

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.490 
season everyone asking me but would we
get<00:03:24.590> enough<00:03:24.769> goals<00:03:25.040> will<00:03:25.940> be<00:03:25.970> score<00:03:26.300> enough<00:03:26.540> so

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
get enough goals will be score enough so

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.770 
get enough goals will be score enough so
he<00:03:27.739> finished<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.130> season<00:03:28.310> 101<00:03:28.940> goals<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:29.750> I

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
he finished the season 101 goals so I

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.570 
he finished the season 101 goals so I
look<00:03:30.019> at<00:03:30.170> his<00:03:30.260> now<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:30.620> think<00:03:30.860> we've<00:03:31.040> got<00:03:31.550> a

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
look at his now and I think we've got a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.559 
look at his now and I think we've got a
bit<00:03:31.700> of<00:03:31.790> work<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:31.940> do<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:34.269> that's<00:03:35.269> something

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
bit of work to do and that's something

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:36.820 
bit of work to do and that's something

won<00:04:23.300> again<00:04:28.150> well<00:04:29.150> I've<00:04:29.240> always<00:04:29.390> said<00:04:29.510> that<00:04:29.720> we

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
won again well I've always said that we

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.650 
won again well I've always said that we
were<00:04:30.140> the<00:04:30.740> work<00:04:30.890> in<00:04:31.100> progress<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.789> think<00:04:32.539> we

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
were the work in progress I think we

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.570 
were the work in progress I think we
everyone<00:04:33.200> would<00:04:33.680> realize<00:04:33.950> we<00:04:34.100> probably<00:04:34.370> raped

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
everyone would realize we probably raped

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.650 
everyone would realize we probably raped
early<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.060> were<00:04:35.680> we<00:04:36.680> were<00:04:36.800> last<00:04:37.039> year<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.669> I

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
early it were we were last year and I

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.180 
early it were we were last year and I
think<00:04:39.080> everyone<00:04:39.380> will<00:04:39.470> look<00:04:39.590> at<00:04:39.740> Manchester

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
think everyone will look at Manchester

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.670 
think everyone will look at Manchester
City<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.669> and<00:04:41.479> Chelsea<00:04:41.990> is<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.110> two<00:04:42.380> squads

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
City and and Chelsea is the two squads

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.260 
City and and Chelsea is the two squads
that<00:04:42.860> are<00:04:43.039> really<00:04:43.340> set<00:04:44.330> up<00:04:44.450> for<00:04:44.479> that<00:04:44.750> but<00:04:46.270> our

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
that are really set up for that but our

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.940 
that are really set up for that but our
limits<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:48.229> know<00:04:48.289> there's<00:04:48.500> no<00:04:48.560> limits<00:04:48.860> on

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
limits you know there's no limits on

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.230 
limits you know there's no limits on
what<00:04:49.100> we<00:04:49.220> want<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.460> achieve<00:04:49.520> at<00:04:49.850> love<00:04:49.970> report

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
what we want to achieve at love report

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.060 
what we want to achieve at love report
we<00:04:50.330> just<00:04:50.510> need<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:51.020> keep<00:04:51.229> moving<00:04:51.500> forward<00:04:51.830> I

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
we just need to keep moving forward I

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.740 
we just need to keep moving forward I
think<00:04:52.100> that<00:04:52.370> was<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.550> key<00:04:52.700> for<00:04:52.910> us<00:04:52.970> this

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
think that was the key for us this

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.060 
think that was the key for us this
season<00:04:54.139> to<00:04:54.260> keep<00:04:54.440> progressing<00:04:56.050> so<00:04:57.050> but<00:04:58.010> at

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
season to keep progressing so but at

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.710 
season to keep progressing so but at
this<00:04:58.160> moment<00:04:58.340> in<00:04:58.550> time<00:04:58.580> we've<00:04:59.389> lost<00:04:59.570> three

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
this moment in time we've lost three

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.620 
this moment in time we've lost three
over<00:05:00.080> five<00:05:00.229> games<00:05:00.530> so<00:05:01.400> we<00:05:01.550> need<00:05:01.700> to<00:05:01.820> be<00:05:01.970> much

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
over five games so we need to be much

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.969 
over five games so we need to be much
better<00:05:02.840> so<00:05:03.110> I<00:05:03.169> don't<00:05:03.200> think<00:05:03.410> we<00:05:03.620> can<00:05:03.740> even

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
better so I don't think we can even

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.860 
better so I don't think we can even
connect<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.520> talk<00:05:04.850> of<00:05:05.000> that<00:05:05.180> until<00:05:05.690> we<00:05:05.750> get

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
connect it and talk of that until we get

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.440 
connect it and talk of that until we get
some<00:05:06.110> consistency<00:05:06.440> so<00:05:07.090> but<00:05:08.090> I<00:05:08.150> think<00:05:08.330> as<00:05:08.419> I

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
some consistency so but I think as I

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.570 
some consistency so but I think as I
said<00:05:08.600> we<00:05:08.870> showed<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.169> potential<00:05:09.500> in<00:05:09.830> our<00:05:09.919> team

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
said we showed the potential in our team

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.920 
said we showed the potential in our team
in<00:05:10.729> the<00:05:10.820> Tottenham<00:05:11.150> game<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:11.539> we<00:05:11.600> need<00:05:11.630> to

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
in the Tottenham game and we need to

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.990 
in the Tottenham game and we need to
look<00:05:12.650> to<00:05:12.860> get<00:05:13.010> back<00:05:13.159> to<00:05:13.280> that<00:05:13.310> level<00:05:13.550> as<00:05:13.789> quick

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
look to get back to that level as quick

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.530 
look to get back to that level as quick
as<00:05:14.120> we<00:05:14.150> can

was<00:06:07.420> definitely<00:06:07.840> well<00:06:07.960> I<00:06:08.140> think<00:06:08.230> when<00:06:08.500> you<00:06:08.590> do

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
was definitely well I think when you do

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.950 
was definitely well I think when you do
over<00:06:09.430> a<00:06:09.460> number<00:06:10.270> of<00:06:10.480> games<00:06:10.630> and<00:06:10.840> it's

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
over a number of games and it's

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.120 
over a number of games and it's
certainly<00:06:11.200> something<00:06:11.350> we<00:06:11.590> need<00:06:11.740> to<00:06:11.830> look<00:06:11.950> up

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
certainly something we need to look up

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.270 
certainly something we need to look up
no<00:06:13.030> it<00:06:13.120> was<00:06:13.210> never<00:06:13.330> a<00:06:13.720> problem<00:06:14.530> for<00:06:15.070> us

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
no it was never a problem for us

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.790 
no it was never a problem for us
last<00:06:16.270> season<00:06:16.690> I<00:06:16.780> think<00:06:16.930> the<00:06:17.260> the<00:06:17.470> Aston<00:06:17.770> Villa

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
last season I think the the Aston Villa

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.500 
last season I think the the Aston Villa
game<00:06:18.130> we<00:06:18.280> probably<00:06:18.460> brought<00:06:18.850> the<00:06:19.060> issues<00:06:19.390> on

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
game we probably brought the issues on

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.720 
game we probably brought the issues on
ourselves<00:06:19.840> you<00:06:20.770> know<00:06:20.800> so<00:06:21.130> it's<00:06:21.280> important<00:06:21.640> you

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 
ourselves you know so it's important you

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.180 
ourselves you know so it's important you
stay<00:06:21.790> calm<00:06:22.180> in<00:06:22.360> those<00:06:22.480> situations<00:06:23.110> and<00:06:23.320> I'm

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
stay calm in those situations and I'm

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.500 
stay calm in those situations and I'm
not<00:06:24.370> sure<00:06:24.520> that<00:06:24.670> whether<00:06:24.820> the<00:06:24.970> second<00:06:25.330> goal

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
not sure that whether the second goal

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.620 
not sure that whether the second goal
was<00:06:25.600> across<00:06:25.960> or<00:06:26.320> or<00:06:26.830> a<00:06:26.920> shot<00:06:27.220> but<00:06:27.550> whatever<00:06:28.480> way

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
was across or or a shot but whatever way

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.510 
was across or or a shot but whatever way
it<00:06:28.750> came<00:06:28.870> from<00:06:28.930> across<00:06:29.410> and<00:06:29.680> we<00:06:30.220> needed<00:06:30.400> to

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
it came from across and we needed to

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.280 
it came from across and we needed to
defend<00:06:30.880> better<00:06:31.150> but<00:06:31.480> I<00:06:31.630> all<00:06:31.780> came<00:06:32.020> from<00:06:32.140> the

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
defend better but I all came from the

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.940 
defend better but I all came from the
intensity<00:06:32.830> of<00:06:32.920> our<00:06:33.040> start<00:06:33.600> we<00:06:34.600> I've<00:06:35.470> been<00:06:35.710> here

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
intensity of our start we I've been here

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.710 
intensity of our start we I've been here
love<00:06:36.790> to<00:06:36.880> pull<00:06:37.030> the<00:06:37.120> last<00:06:37.240> couple<00:06:37.510> of<00:06:37.540> seasons

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
love to pull the last couple of seasons

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.180 
love to pull the last couple of seasons
and<00:06:38.020> we<00:06:38.200> were<00:06:38.260> tough<00:06:38.500> games<00:06:38.770> but<00:06:39.040> we've

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
and we were tough games but we've

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.370 
and we were tough games but we've
actually<00:06:39.340> performed<00:06:40.000> well<00:06:40.240> and<00:06:40.990> played<00:06:41.200> well

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
actually performed well and played well

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.960 
actually performed well and played well
today<00:06:41.620> a<00:06:41.740> performance<00:06:42.280> level<00:06:42.400> wasn't<00:06:42.730> what

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
today a performance level wasn't what

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.390 
today a performance level wasn't what
we'd<00:06:43.120> expect<00:06:43.540> and<00:06:43.780> and<00:06:44.380> normally<00:06:45.040> for<00:06:45.190> us<00:06:45.250> the

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
we'd expect and and normally for us the

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.380 
we'd expect and and normally for us the
consequence<00:06:45.910> of<00:06:46.030> that<00:06:46.060> will<00:06:46.240> be<00:06:46.360> a

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.390 
consequence of that will be a

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.700 
consequence of that will be a
disappointing<00:06:46.990> result<00:06:47.080> and<00:06:47.410> that's<00:06:47.530> how<00:06:47.650> it

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
disappointing result and that's how it

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.010 
disappointing result and that's how it
was<00:06:47.830> today
