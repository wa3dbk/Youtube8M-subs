other freeware aircraft I also have a
camera<00:00:55.900> add-on<00:00:56.940> which<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.120> could<00:00:58.270> do<00:00:58.390> this<00:00:58.540> but

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
camera add-on which I could do this but

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
started an engineering Flight Simulator

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:17.350 
started an engineering Flight Simulator
X<00:02:03.640> for<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.180> propeller

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.530 

so<00:02:18.370> thanks<00:02:19.370> for<00:02:19.430> watching<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:20.060> hope<00:02:20.090> this

helped you and I will now come to a bit

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.050 
helped you and I will now come to a bit
of<00:02:23.360> flying<00:02:23.630> with<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.200> plane<00:02:24.790> okay<00:02:25.790> we<00:02:26.000> are

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
of flying with this plane okay we are

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.940 
of flying with this plane okay we are
now<00:02:26.210> lined<00:02:26.540> up<00:02:26.750> on<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:26.960> runway<00:02:27.260> Ellen<00:02:27.800> are

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
now lined up on the runway Ellen are

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.110 
now lined up on the runway Ellen are
ready<00:02:28.310> for<00:02:28.520> takeoff

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
ready for takeoff

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.050 
ready for takeoff
now<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.080> plane<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.530> very<00:02:30.950> high-powered<00:02:31.640> so

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
now this plane is very high-powered so

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.440 
now this plane is very high-powered so
we<00:02:32.240> don't<00:02:32.540> need<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.750> lot<00:02:32.990> of<00:02:33.050> runway<00:02:33.350> for<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:34.450> you

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
we don't need a lot of runway for it you

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.900 
we don't need a lot of runway for it you
may<00:02:35.660> need<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.960> bit<00:02:36.230> more<00:02:36.260> runway<00:02:36.710> for<00:02:37.250> several

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
may need a bit more runway for several

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.680 
may need a bit more runway for several
default<00:02:38.420> aircraft<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.400> same<00:02:40.580> size<00:02:40.910> or<00:02:41.270> any

freeware<00:02:42.230> craft<00:02:42.650> but<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.040> aircraft<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:43.730> very

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
freeware craft but this aircraft is very

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:55.040 
freeware craft but this aircraft is very
powerful

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:14.220 

as<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.770> can<00:02:55.890> see<00:02:56.100> I'm<00:02:56.250> already<00:02:56.460> able

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.680 

I'm<00:03:14.680> now<00:03:14.980> going<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.310> set<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.640> flaps<00:03:15.910> back<00:03:16.209> one

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
I'm now going to set the flaps back one

00:03:16.690 --> 00:04:04.100 
I'm now going to set the flaps back one
to<00:03:17.110> Cline

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110
