hi<00:00:09.139> this<00:00:09.200> is<00:00:09.379> Dan<00:00:09.650> Moskowitz<00:00:10.160> in<00:00:10.339> this<00:00:10.549> video

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
hi this is Dan Moskowitz in this video

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.669 
hi this is Dan Moskowitz in this video
we'll<00:00:11.059> show<00:00:11.089> off<00:00:11.360> our<00:00:11.539> new<00:00:11.719> simulation<00:00:12.320> engine

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
we'll show off our new simulation engine

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.379 
we'll show off our new simulation engine
glass<00:00:12.980> box<00:00:13.309> and<00:00:13.610> how<00:00:13.789> we're<00:00:13.969> using<00:00:14.150> it<00:00:14.359> to

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
glass box and how we're using it to

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.540 
glass box and how we're using it to
simulate<00:00:14.750> the<00:00:15.109> basic<00:00:15.469> economic<00:00:16.039> loop<00:00:16.250> between

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
simulate the basic economic loop between

simulate the basic economic loop between
residential<00:00:17.480> industrial<00:00:17.689> and<00:00:18.289> commercial

residential industrial and commercial

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.140 
residential industrial and commercial
buildings<00:00:19.070> keep<00:00:19.460> in<00:00:19.610> mind<00:00:19.820> that<00:00:20.000> this

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
buildings keep in mind that this

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.089 
buildings keep in mind that this

the first thing their rules do is tell

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.779 
the first thing their rules do is tell

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
them that they don't have any workers so

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:42.010 
them that they don't have any workers so
they<00:00:40.910> need<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.120> send<00:00:41.300> out<00:00:41.480> some<00:00:41.510> Help<00:00:41.960> Wanted

the rules that produce the goods are the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.190 
the rules that produce the goods are the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
same rules that produce air pollution

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.510 
same rules that produce air pollution
the<00:01:22.200> simulation<00:01:22.710> rules<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.159> create<00:01:23.399> the

the simulation rules that create the

here<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.360> see<00:01:27.539> buildings<00:01:28.229> writing<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> air

here we see buildings writing to the air
pollution<00:01:29.100> map<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.789> it's<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> same<00:01:30.960> rule

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
pollution map and it's the same rule

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.319 
pollution map and it's the same rule
that<00:01:31.350> triggers<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:31.860> smoke<00:01:32.069> effect<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:32.759> here

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
that triggers the smoke effect and here

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.980 
that triggers the smoke effect and here
we<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.569> a<00:01:33.600> debug<00:01:33.929> visualization<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.709> that<00:01:34.860> map
