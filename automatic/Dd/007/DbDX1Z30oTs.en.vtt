00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.640 
start in Germany we have a full-sized
sim<00:02:15.540> card<00:02:15.720> slot<00:02:15.900> right<00:02:16.050> there<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.620> a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
sim card slot right there this is a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.550 
sim card slot right there this is a
micro-sim<00:02:17.220> slot<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.600> SD<00:02:18.930> card<00:02:18.960> slot<00:02:19.380> and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
micro-sim slot and the SD card slot and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.290 
micro-sim slot and the SD card slot and
down<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.100> we<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.370> something<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.880> will

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
down here we have something that will

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.410 
down here we have something that will
probably<00:02:21.720> probably<00:02:22.710> be<00:02:23.220> criticized<00:02:24.120> right

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
probably probably be criticized right

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.110 
probably probably be criticized right
from<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> start<00:02:24.810> that's<00:02:25.650> only<00:02:25.950> an<00:02:26.220> 18<00:02:26.880> million

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
from the start that's only an 18 million

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.020 
from the start that's only an 18 million
power<00:02:27.450> battery<00:02:28.790> combined<00:02:29.790> with<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
power battery combined with the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.270 
power battery combined with the
octa-core<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.780> will<00:02:31.230> probably<00:02:31.740> not<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.010> the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
octa-core it will probably not be the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.370 
octa-core it will probably not be the
longest<00:02:32.550> running<00:02:32.790> phone<00:02:33.150> probably<00:02:33.930> might<00:02:34.260> be

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
longest running phone probably might be

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.650 
longest running phone probably might be
hard<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.680> get<00:02:34.980> through<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.250> day<00:02:35.370> down<00:02:36.270> here<00:02:36.300> is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
hard to get through the day down here is

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.420 
hard to get through the day down here is
that<00:02:37.020> mono<00:02:37.320> speaker<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.740> was<00:02:37.980> talking<00:02:38.220> about

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
that mono speaker I was talking about

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.370 
that mono speaker I was talking about
and<00:02:38.670> that's<00:02:39.150> pretty<00:02:39.300> much<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:40.200> whole

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
and that's pretty much it the whole

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.880 
and that's pretty much it the whole
thing<00:02:40.560> weighs<00:02:40.740> in<00:02:40.980> at<00:02:41.780> 121<00:02:42.780> grams<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.380> think<00:02:43.650> and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
thing weighs in at 121 grams I think and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.310 
thing weighs in at 121 grams I think and
the<00:02:44.690> device<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.990> 9.5<00:02:46.860> millimeters<00:02:47.640> thick<00:02:48.510> this

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
the device is 9.5 millimeters thick this

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.500 
the device is 9.5 millimeters thick this
is<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> prototype<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.310> there's<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.850> bunch<00:02:51.300> of

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
is a prototype so there's a bunch of

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.600 
is a prototype so there's a bunch of
stuff<00:02:52.110> or<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.470> bunch<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.860> things<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.280> are<00:02:53.370> not

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
stuff or a bunch of things that are not

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.550 
stuff or a bunch of things that are not
fully<00:02:53.940> worked<00:02:54.150> out<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.720> back<00:02:55.350> cover

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
fully worked out so the back cover

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.950 
fully worked out so the back cover
doesn't<00:02:55.770> really<00:02:56.190> fit<00:02:56.610> back<00:02:56.820> here<00:02:56.850> but<00:02:57.840> they're

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
doesn't really fit back here but they're

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.120 
doesn't really fit back here but they're
probably<00:02:58.140> going<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.410> work<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.710> out<00:02:58.860> until

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
probably going to work that out until

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.270 
probably going to work that out until
the<00:02:59.370> device<00:02:59.790> gets<00:03:00.060> released<00:03:00.360> around<00:03:01.280> Julie

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
the device gets released around Julie

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.690 
the device gets released around Julie
July<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.540> summer<00:03:03.870> time<00:03:04.290> frame<00:03:04.700> they're

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
July in the summer time frame they're

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.560 
July in the summer time frame they're
gunning<00:03:05.910> for<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.120> price<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.720> around<00:03:07.520> 269<00:03:08.570> 279

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
gunning for a price of around 269 279

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.110 
gunning for a price of around 269 279
euros<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.110> Germany<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:11.370> will<00:03:11.610> probably<00:03:11.850> be

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
euros in Germany this will probably be

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.200 
euros in Germany this will probably be
the<00:03:13.020> cheaper<00:03:13.650> when<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:13.980> actually<00:03:14.340> comes<00:03:14.700> to

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
the cheaper when it actually comes to

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.060 
the cheaper when it actually comes to
the<00:03:15.300> retailers<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.260> was<00:03:16.410> wrong<00:03:16.530> with<00:03:16.770> mobile

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
the retailers so I was wrong with mobile

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.060 
the retailers so I was wrong with mobile
