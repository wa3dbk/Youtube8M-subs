00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.000
 in this video we will show how 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.490
 make an extra hole in a belt 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.539
 when this does not fit our 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.130
 measure can be very useful this video 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.680
 now that the 'bikini operation' is coming 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.720
 we want to reduce our belly in 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.720
 Christmas when we earn those kilitos 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.980
 the first thing to do in 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.800
 any of the methods that we will see 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.140
 will be to measure the distance at which 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.630
 we want to make the hole 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.480
 We will do this by testing the 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.670
 belt 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.770
 and taking the reference with the finger 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.440
 later we will make a mark 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.230
 with a marker or pen to not 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.829
 lose this reference 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.300
 now once this step is done 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.159
 we will proceed to explain the different 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.700
 methods to carry out the 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.820
 realization of the hole 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.820
 yes 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.110
 for method 1 we will need a 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.479
 tool called punches this one 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.270
 It can be obtained easily and cheaply in 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.900
 many Chinese bazaars once we have 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.200
 the tool this has various 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.390
 thicknesses to make the hole so 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.300
 that we will select the one indicated according to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.840
 those that already exist in the belt now 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.350
 simply as we previously marked the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.909
 area where to make the hole position 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.300
 we will make the tool in place 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.830
 exact and we will push hard until 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.880
 drill the material that is 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.880
 Composed the belt 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.450
 and so in this way we will realize through 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.049
 the first method the hole 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.049
 Y 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.480
 for the second method we will need 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.540
 some pliers a nail the thickness of the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.150
 existing holes in the belt and a 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.690
 heat source either a lighter or 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.050
 preferably a kitchen fire now 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.210
 we will hold the nail with the pliers and 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.010
 we will proceed to heat the tip with the 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.780
 fire until it turns red 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.390
 once the tip is in kant 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.370
 descente we will position the nail in the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.939
 mark where we want to make the hole 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.450
 and we will click on it until we drill 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.450
 the material 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.690
 and so in this way we will get the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.220
 hole by the second method 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.260
 good people I hope you liked it 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.150
 the video in which we explain how 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.850
 perform extra holes in belts 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.070
 that we are not worthy anymore, we will appreciate it if 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.750
 I liked your likes and 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.610
 comments on other tricks that 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.610
 we could record thank you very much
