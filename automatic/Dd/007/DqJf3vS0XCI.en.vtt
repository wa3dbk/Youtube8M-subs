Strait of Georgia salt water and we're
going<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.580> ask<00:00:17.699> Stephanie<00:00:18.300> here<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.750> explain

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
going to ask Stephanie here to explain

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.470 
going to ask Stephanie here to explain
to<00:00:19.650> us<00:00:19.770> what<00:00:20.039> we're<00:00:20.310> seeing<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.000> terms<00:00:21.210> of

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
to us what we're seeing here in terms of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.429 
to us what we're seeing here in terms of
these<00:00:21.630> parent<00:00:22.109> materials<00:00:22.619> behind<00:00:22.949> us<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:25.140> what

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
these parent materials behind us so what

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.099 
these parent materials behind us so what
we<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.800> here<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.670> two<00:00:27.060> kinds<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.689> free

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
we have here it's two kinds of free

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.740 
we have here it's two kinds of free
materials<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.880> brown<00:00:30.090> stuff<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.570> top

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
materials we have the brown stuff on top

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.080 
materials we have the brown stuff on top
here<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.160> different<00:00:32.640> from<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:33.059> we

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
here and it is different from what we

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.540 
here and it is different from what we
have<00:00:33.360> at<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> bottom<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.380> more<00:00:34.649> great<00:00:34.950> so

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
have at the bottom here is more great so

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.370 
have at the bottom here is more great so
what<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.210> at<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> bottom<00:00:36.780> here<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
what we have at the bottom here the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.340 
what we have at the bottom here the
great<00:00:37.590> part<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.210> glacial<00:00:39.210> marine<00:00:39.350> prep

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
great part is glacial marine prep

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.799 
great part is glacial marine prep
material<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.190> was<00:00:41.430> deposited<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.360> ocean

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
material it was deposited in the ocean

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.950 
material it was deposited in the ocean
in<00:00:43.020> salt<00:00:43.320> water<00:00:44.149> and<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.420> reason<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.840> know

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
in salt water and the reason we know

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.110 
in salt water and the reason we know
that<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.579> fine-grained

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
that is because it's a fine-grained

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.740 
that is because it's a fine-grained
sediment

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
sediment

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.130 
sediment
it's<00:00:49.670> Lucy<00:00:50.670> Walt's<00:00:50.969> Odin<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.390> really<00:00:51.660> high<00:00:51.870> in

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
it's Lucy Walt's Odin is really high in

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.279 
it's Lucy Walt's Odin is really high in
self<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.800> play<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.820> indicative<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
self and play that's indicative of the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.319 
self and play that's indicative of the
position<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.829> water<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:56.969> we're<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
position in water we know we're in the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.779 
position in water we know we're in the
ocean<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> go<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> fine<00:00:58.410> texture<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
ocean to go to the fine texture and the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.670 
ocean to go to the fine texture and the
lack<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.180> stratification<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:01.379> we're<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.590> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
lack of stratification if we're in a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.030 
lack of stratification if we're in a
river<00:01:01.920> we'd<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.550> layers<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> no<00:01:04.769> some

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
river we'd have layers so no some

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.190 
river we'd have layers so no some
different<00:01:05.430> colors<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> mottling

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
different colors in here the mottling

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.030 
different colors in here the mottling
and<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:08.990> but<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.439> not<00:01:10.500> developed

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
and so on but it's not developed

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.060 
and so on but it's not developed
recently<00:01:11.250> or<00:01:11.790> yeah<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.229> feature<00:01:13.530> that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
recently or yeah that is a feature that

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.640 
recently or yeah that is a feature that
develop<00:01:14.670> after<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.299> sediment<00:01:15.780> deposited<00:01:16.380> in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
develop after the sediment deposited in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.679 
develop after the sediment deposited in
the<00:01:16.890> ocean<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.490> then<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:17.790> exposed<00:01:18.180> because

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the ocean and then got exposed because

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.410 
the ocean and then got exposed because
the<00:01:18.780> sea<00:01:19.020> level<00:01:19.320> receded<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.939> models

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the sea level receded and this models

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.130 
the sea level receded and this models
are<00:01:21.780> caused<00:01:22.409> by<00:01:22.770> iron<00:01:23.280> oxidation<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.990> what

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
are caused by iron oxidation so what

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.630 
are caused by iron oxidation so what
happens<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> sediment<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.430> very

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
happens here is the sediment is very

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.630 
happens here is the sediment is very
fine<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.270> oxygen<00:01:27.930> has<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> hard<00:01:28.560> time

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
fine and oxygen has a hard time

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.760 
fine and oxygen has a hard time
penetrating<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.840> batch<00:01:31.140> rates<00:01:31.439> alone

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
penetrating it in batch rates alone

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.080 
penetrating it in batch rates alone
cracks<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.640> forms<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.720> red<00:01:34.140> models<00:01:35.090> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
cracks and forms this red models and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030 
cracks and forms this red models and
where<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.720> oxygen<00:01:36.990> doesn't<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.740> iron

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
where the oxygen doesn't get the iron

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.999 
where the oxygen doesn't get the iron
stays<00:01:38.640> reduced<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.600> reduced<00:01:40.110> iron<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.770> just

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
stays reduced and reduced iron is just

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.950 
stays reduced and reduced iron is just
great<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.490> that's<00:01:41.640> what<00:01:41.820> gives<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.360> dull

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
great so that's what gives it this dull

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.679 
great so that's what gives it this dull
gray<00:01:43.259> power

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.539 

the<00:01:45.990> other<00:01:46.110> interesting<00:01:46.350> thing<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.250> can

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the other interesting thing that you can

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.039 
the other interesting thing that you can
see<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.470> surface<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.149> these<00:01:51.149> stones

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
see in this surface here is these stones

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.350 
see in this surface here is these stones
scattered<00:01:52.680> throughout<00:01:52.920> there<00:01:53.369> right<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.210> can

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
scattered throughout there right you can

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.410 
scattered throughout there right you can
see<00:01:54.630> bits<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.290> stones<00:01:55.880> we're<00:01:56.880> treating<00:01:57.210> here

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
see bits of stones we're treating here

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.020 
see bits of stones we're treating here
and<00:01:57.540> there

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
and there

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.380 
and there
and<00:01:58.650> that<00:01:59.650> is<00:01:59.920> indicative<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:00.850> glacial

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
and that is indicative of the glacial

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.940 
and that is indicative of the glacial
environment<00:02:01.510> even<00:02:02.410> though<00:02:02.530> we're<00:02:02.740> in<00:02:02.860> the

environment even though we're in the
ocean<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:04.030> glaciers<00:02:04.420> were<00:02:04.600> not<00:02:04.780> far<00:02:05.020> up<00:02:05.050> and

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
ocean the glaciers were not far up and

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.440 
ocean the glaciers were not far up and
bits<00:02:06.100> of<00:02:06.280> ice<00:02:06.460> were<00:02:06.700> breaking<00:02:07.090> out<00:02:07.180> from<00:02:07.240> the

bits of ice were breaking out from the
glaciers<00:02:07.950> floating<00:02:08.950> as<00:02:09.789> icebergs<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.750> as

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
glaciers floating as icebergs and as

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.780 
glaciers floating as icebergs and as
they're<00:02:11.230> melting<00:02:11.740> they're<00:02:12.160> dropping<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
they're melting they're dropping the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.860 
they're melting they're dropping the
soup<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.330> stones

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
soup this stones

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.080 
soup this stones
they're<00:02:14.170> called<00:02:14.410> drop<00:02:14.740> stones<00:02:15.100> they<00:02:15.790> become

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
they're called drop stones they become

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.580 
they're called drop stones they become
incorporated<00:02:16.870> in<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.320> fine-grained

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
incorporated in the fine-grained

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.190 
incorporated in the fine-grained
sediments<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:19.060> is<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.270> feature<00:02:19.990> of

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
sediments and that is a feature of

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.630 
sediments and that is a feature of
glacial<00:02:20.920> marine<00:02:21.010> current<00:02:21.520> material<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:24.310> let's

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
glacial marine current material so let's

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.370 
glacial marine current material so let's
let's<00:02:25.060> think<00:02:25.390> about<00:02:25.600> how<00:02:26.280> soils<00:02:27.280> develop<00:02:27.940> and

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
let's think about how soils develop and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.410 
let's think about how soils develop and
this<00:02:29.380> site<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.920> an<00:02:30.190> interesting<00:02:30.610> one<00:02:31.060> where<00:02:31.300> we

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
this site is an interesting one where we

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.760 
this site is an interesting one where we
have<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.600> couple<00:02:31.959> of<00:02:32.080> different<00:02:32.440> parent

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
have a couple of different parent

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.800 
have a couple of different parent
materials<00:02:33.280> one<00:02:33.610> on<00:02:33.760> top<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.300> other<00:02:34.450> and

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
materials one on top of the other and

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.050 
materials one on top of the other and
they're<00:02:35.500> if<00:02:35.650> they're<00:02:35.830> quite<00:02:36.040> contrasting<00:02:36.550> so

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
they're if they're quite contrasting so

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.270 
they're if they're quite contrasting so
could<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.470> again<00:02:38.470> describe<00:02:38.920> what<00:02:39.130> we're

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
could you again describe what we're

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.530 
could you again describe what we're
looking<00:02:39.550> at<00:02:39.670> here<00:02:39.730> they<00:02:40.120> are<00:02:40.239> they're<00:02:40.510> very

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
looking at here they are they're very

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.460 
looking at here they are they're very
different

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
different

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.510 
different
the<00:02:41.709> just<00:02:42.370> step<00:02:42.550> we<00:02:42.700> have<00:02:42.790> them<00:02:42.940> talk<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:44.520> a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
the just step we have them talk is a

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.910 
the just step we have them talk is a
very<00:02:46.060> coarse<00:02:46.390> grain<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.110> with<00:02:47.260> no<00:02:47.440> silver

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
very coarse grain so with no silver

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.060 
very coarse grain so with no silver
clear<00:02:48.190> it's<00:02:48.489> all<00:02:48.700> sand<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.270> gravel<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.860> is

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
clear it's all sand and gravel that is

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.640 
clear it's all sand and gravel that is
known<00:02:51.280> as<00:02:51.580> glacial<00:02:52.060> floovio<00:02:52.720> Frank<00:02:53.110> material

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
known as glacial floovio Frank material

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
known as glacial floovio Frank material
that<00:02:54.280> was<00:02:54.550> deposited<00:02:55.060> by<00:02:55.630> melting<00:02:56.140> glacier

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
that was deposited by melting glacier

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.580 
that was deposited by melting glacier
forming<00:02:57.670> an<00:02:57.790> out<00:02:57.940> wash<00:02:58.239> plane<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.840> front<00:02:59.530> of

forming an out wash plane in front of

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.170 
forming an out wash plane in front of
the<00:02:59.650> glacier<00:02:59.800> all<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.310> fine<00:03:00.520> material<00:03:00.670> was

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
the glacier all the fine material was

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.840 
the glacier all the fine material was
carried<00:03:01.540> away<00:03:01.600> farther<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:03.070> this<00:03:03.310> stuff<00:03:03.610> was

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
carried away farther so this stuff was

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.699 
carried away farther so this stuff was
born<00:03:04.180> on<00:03:04.330> land<00:03:04.570> whereas<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.260> stuff<00:03:05.470> at<00:03:05.620> the

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
born on land whereas the stuff at the

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.130 
born on land whereas the stuff at the
bottom<00:03:05.860> here<00:03:06.340> was<00:03:06.640> fall<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.360> ocean<00:03:07.390> quite

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
bottom here was fall in the ocean quite

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.520 
bottom here was fall in the ocean quite
water<00:03:09.390> calmed<00:03:10.390> positional<00:03:10.900> environments<00:03:11.440> so

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
water calmed positional environments so

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.410 
water calmed positional environments so
what<00:03:11.680> we<00:03:11.799> have<00:03:12.010> here<00:03:12.489> we<00:03:12.880> have<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:13.060> bit<00:03:13.299> of

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
what we have here we have a bit of

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.220 
what we have here we have a bit of
geological<00:03:13.989> history<00:03:14.290> unraveling<00:03:16.080> here<00:03:17.080> we

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
geological history unraveling here we

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.800 
geological history unraveling here we
can<00:03:17.350> see<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:17.680> about<00:03:18.610> 15,000<00:03:19.269> years<00:03:19.360> ago<00:03:19.660> we

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
can see that about 15,000 years ago we

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.370 
can see that about 15,000 years ago we
were<00:03:19.930> in<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.170> ocean<00:03:21.060> with<00:03:22.060> these<00:03:22.959> glaciers

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
were in the ocean with these glaciers

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.800 
were in the ocean with these glaciers
not<00:03:23.560> far<00:03:23.830> off<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.310> then<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.850> ocean<00:03:25.000> receded

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
not far off and then the ocean receded

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.710 
not far off and then the ocean receded
and<00:03:26.170> we<00:03:26.350> found<00:03:26.620> ourselves<00:03:26.769> on<00:03:27.340> lands<00:03:28.060> with

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
and we found ourselves on lands with

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.850 
and we found ourselves on lands with
this<00:03:29.680> outwash<00:03:30.160> plain<00:03:30.840> forming<00:03:31.840> on<00:03:32.170> in<00:03:32.650> front

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
this outwash plain forming on in front

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.140 
this outwash plain forming on in front
of<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.070> glaciers

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
of the glaciers

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.089 
of the glaciers
and<00:03:34.269> it<00:03:34.720> has<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.930> lot<00:03:35.200> of<00:03:35.230> implications<00:03:35.950> for

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
and it has a lot of implications for

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.860 
and it has a lot of implications for
sold<00:03:36.340> properties<00:03:38.310> right<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:40.300> soils<00:03:40.690> at

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
sold properties right so the soils at

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.710 
sold properties right so the soils at
Forman<00:03:41.349> that<00:03:41.560> forced<00:03:42.459> textured<00:03:42.910> surface<00:03:43.450> are

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
Forman that forced textured surface are

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.869 
Forman that forced textured surface are
subject<00:03:44.200> to<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.349> lot<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.650> weathering<00:03:45.550> and

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
subject to a lot of weathering and

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.199 
subject to a lot of weathering and
leaching<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:47.140> and<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:47.800> on<00:03:48.010> very<00:03:48.700> different

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
leaching and and so on very different

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.380 
leaching and and so on very different
from<00:03:49.300> what<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.599> have<00:03:49.810> down<00:03:50.050> here<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:52.120> is

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
from what you have down here that is

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.289 
from what you have down here that is
most<00:03:52.750> obvious<00:03:53.200> in<00:03:53.319> the<00:03:53.349> color<00:03:53.650> difference<00:03:54.299> the

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
most obvious in the color difference the

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.960 
most obvious in the color difference the
Glacial<00:03:56.049> flugel<00:03:56.410> material<00:03:57.010> tends<00:03:57.670> to<00:03:57.849> have

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
Glacial flugel material tends to have

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.720 
Glacial flugel material tends to have
very<00:03:58.209> rapid<00:03:58.780> soil<00:03:59.140> profile<00:03:59.730> development

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
very rapid soil profile development

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.000 
very rapid soil profile development
because<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.180> water<00:04:01.709> circulates<00:04:02.709> freely

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
because the water circulates freely

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.490 
because the water circulates freely
through<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.580> so<00:04:04.150> here<00:04:04.360> we<00:04:04.390> can<00:04:04.599> see<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:05.019> Solon

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
through it so here we can see the Solon

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.490 
through it so here we can see the Solon
pretty<00:04:05.799> much<00:04:06.090> extends<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.750> bottom<00:04:08.200> of

pretty much extends to the bottom of

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.949 
pretty much extends to the bottom of
this<00:04:08.680> glacial<00:04:08.980> Google<00:04:09.459> material<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:10.660> it<00:04:10.810> has

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
this glacial Google material so it has

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.660 
this glacial Google material so it has
you<00:04:11.200> can<00:04:11.349> see<00:04:11.500> roots<00:04:12.390> in<00:04:13.470> contrast<00:04:14.470> in<00:04:15.190> the

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
you can see roots in contrast in the

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.610 
you can see roots in contrast in the
