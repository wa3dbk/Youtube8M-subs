the trans little shootout I think the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.550 
the trans little shootout I think the
last<00:00:18.090> two<00:00:18.270> years<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.570> really<00:00:19.140> good<00:00:19.349> bike

last two years a really good bike

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.260 
last two years a really good bike
all-around<00:00:20.189> stock<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.790> we<00:00:20.849> want<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.060> see<00:00:21.150> what

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
all-around stock and we want to see what

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.940 
all-around stock and we want to see what
we<00:00:21.330> could<00:00:21.450> do<00:00:21.509> to<00:00:21.630> improve<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.020> thing<00:00:22.259> we're

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
we could do to improve this thing we're

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.109 
we could do to improve this thing we're
gonna<00:00:23.040> go<00:00:23.220> around<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.580> tell<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.759> what<00:00:23.880> we<00:00:23.910> did

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
gonna go around and tell you what we did

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.150 
gonna go around and tell you what we did
here<00:00:24.360> so<00:00:24.509> the<00:00:25.380> main<00:00:25.529> thing<00:00:25.739> we<00:00:25.800> wanted<00:00:26.009> to<00:00:26.070> do

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
here so the main thing we wanted to do

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.470 
here so the main thing we wanted to do
is<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.430> get<00:00:26.520> a<00:00:26.579> little<00:00:26.640> bit<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.029> power

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
is just get a little bit of power

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.600 
is just get a little bit of power
increase<00:00:27.779> while<00:00:27.960> keeping<00:00:28.259> the<00:00:28.380> motor

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
increase while keeping the motor

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.819 
increase while keeping the motor
relatively<00:00:29.610> reliable<00:00:30.270> with<00:00:31.020> good<00:00:31.230> good<00:00:31.529> parts

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
relatively reliable with good good parts

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.200 
relatively reliable with good good parts
that<00:00:32.009> wouldn't<00:00:32.309> wouldn't<00:00:32.579> cause<00:00:33.059> any

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
that wouldn't wouldn't cause any

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.229 
that wouldn't wouldn't cause any
problems<00:00:33.630> long<00:00:34.110> term<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.940> went<00:00:36.059> with<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
problems long term and so we went with a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.240 
problems long term and so we went with a
high<00:00:36.360> compression<00:00:36.690> piston<00:00:37.140> from<00:00:37.290> vertex<00:00:37.620> with

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
high compression piston from vertex with

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.130 
high compression piston from vertex with
some<00:00:38.430> hot<00:00:38.579> cam<00:00:38.790> stage<00:00:39.059> 2<00:00:39.300> cams<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.870> that's<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
some hot cam stage 2 cams so that's the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.260 
some hot cam stage 2 cams so that's the
main<00:00:40.320> motor<00:00:40.620> mod<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.070> did<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.150> that

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
main motor mod we did and so what that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.640 
main motor mod we did and so what that
does<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.540> cams<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.200> give<00:00:43.350> us<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> little<00:00:43.530> bit

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
does that cams and give us a little bit

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.980 
does that cams and give us a little bit
more<00:00:43.770> bottom<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.220> mid<00:00:44.370> power<00:00:44.580> and<00:00:44.880> the<00:00:45.630> cam<00:00:45.810> is

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
more bottom to mid power and the cam is

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.660 
more bottom to mid power and the cam is
a<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.230> bit<00:00:46.350> more<00:00:46.500> mid<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.830> top<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.280> good

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
a little bit more mid to top so good

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.980 
a little bit more mid to top so good
power<00:00:47.940> increase<00:00:48.270> throughout<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:48.870> we're

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
power increase throughout is what we're

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.420 
power increase throughout is what we're
looking<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.730> FMF<00:00:50.730> mega<00:00:51.420> bomb<00:00:51.630> header<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.290> a

good all around and kind of something we
even<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> stock<00:01:01.470> motor

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
even do with just the stock motor

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.910 
even do with just the stock motor
a<00:01:02.280> good<00:01:02.940> upgrade<00:01:03.120> okay<00:01:04.079> so<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.559> motor<00:01:04.710> the

a good upgrade okay so for the motor the
only<00:01:05.189> other<00:01:05.339> performance<00:01:05.850> thing<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:06.090> did<00:01:06.240> was

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
only other performance thing we did was

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.170 
only other performance thing we did was
added<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.810> bit<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.079> renegade<00:01:07.890> fuel<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:09.030> give

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
added a bit of a renegade fuel to give

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.080 
added a bit of a renegade fuel to give
us<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.659> extra<00:01:10.220> umph<00:01:11.220> we're<00:01:11.430> looking<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090

the<00:01:12.990> rest<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.320> motor<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.530> all<00:01:13.710> stock<00:01:14.040> we

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the rest of the motor is all stock we

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.770 
the rest of the motor is all stock we
were<00:01:14.640> able<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> use<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.000> stock<00:01:15.210> valve<00:01:15.479> springs

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
were able to use the stock valve springs

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.360 
were able to use the stock valve springs
and<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.050> hot<00:01:16.200> cams<00:01:16.440> can<00:01:16.710> use<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> stock<00:01:17.130> valve

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
and the hot cams can use the stock valve

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.430 
and the hot cams can use the stock valve
springs<00:01:17.700> good<00:01:18.510> reliability<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> valve

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
springs good reliability on the valve

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.050 
springs good reliability on the valve
train<00:01:19.620> and<00:01:20.010> that's<00:01:20.190> what<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.790> for

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
train and that's what we are going for

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.120 
train and that's what we are going for
there<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.440> Hinson<00:01:22.710> clutch<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
there so the the Hinson clutch is a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.770 
there so the the Hinson clutch is a
really<00:01:23.430> good<00:01:23.550> clutch<00:01:23.850> setup<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.630> all<00:01:24.659> these

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
really good clutch setup for all these

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.570 
really good clutch setup for all these
bikes<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:25.620> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> little<00:01:25.979> weaker<00:01:26.250> parts

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
bikes it one of the little weaker parts

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.950 
bikes it one of the little weaker parts
on<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> arms<00:01:27.060> II<00:01:27.180> would<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> clutch<00:01:27.780> in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
on the arms II would be the clutch in

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.270 
on the arms II would be the clutch in
this<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.229> want<00:01:28.440> to<00:01:28.590> upgrade<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.070> entire

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
this so you want to upgrade the entire

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.550 
this so you want to upgrade the entire
clutch<00:01:29.580> setup<00:01:29.850> when<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.690> time<00:01:30.900> comes<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
clutch setup when that time comes and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.010 
clutch setup when that time comes and
your<00:01:32.549> parts<00:01:32.760> are<00:01:32.880> worn<00:01:33.060> out<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.840> upgrade

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
your parts are worn out you can upgrade

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.350 
your parts are worn out you can upgrade
to<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> Hinson<00:01:34.650> setup<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.150> project

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
to the Hinson setup for this project

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.789 
to the Hinson setup for this project
went<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:36.930> some<00:01:37.110> really<00:01:37.290> cool<00:01:37.530> looking

hooked<00:04:51.539> up<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.050> then<00:04:52.229> you<00:04:52.500> know<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.770> forks<00:04:53.419> at

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
hooked up and then you know the forks at

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.999 
hooked up and then you know the forks at
first<00:04:54.750> they<00:04:54.930> were<00:04:55.020> a<00:04:55.050> little<00:04:55.199> bit<00:04:55.319> div'<00:04:55.830> we

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
first they were a little bit div' we

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.339 
first they were a little bit div' we
stiffened<00:04:56.669> them<00:04:56.759> up<00:04:56.879> slightly<00:04:57.210> gave<00:04:58.139> a<00:04:58.169> little

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
stiffened them up slightly gave a little

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.679 
stiffened them up slightly gave a little
bit<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.590> compression<00:04:59.150> and<00:05:00.150> then<00:05:00.509> they<00:05:00.629> were

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:00.689 
bit of compression and then they were

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:02.330 
bit of compression and then they were
just<00:05:00.780> they<00:05:01.050> worked<00:05:01.229> really<00:05:01.319> well<00:05:01.530> balance<00:05:02.159> was

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
just they worked really well balance was
