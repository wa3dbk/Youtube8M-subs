from the one side the goal here was to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.440 
from the one side the goal here was to
distract<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:32.189> lightning<00:00:32.700> tail<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> few

Sam<00:00:33.690> your<00:00:33.840> eyes<00:00:33.989> while<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.280> ram<00:00:35.489> in

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
Sam your eyes while you get the ram in

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.810 
Sam your eyes while you get the ram in
there<00:00:36.620> and<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> semi<00:00:38.040> rise<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.430> take<00:00:38.610> that

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
there and the semi rise to take that

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.420 
there and the semi rise to take that
tower<00:00:39.090> out<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:39.930> arches<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.739> between

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
tower out and then arches in between

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.910 
tower out and then arches in between
these<00:00:41.579> 2<00:00:41.790> archer<00:00:42.090> towers<00:00:42.530> should<00:00:43.530> make<00:00:43.710> them

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
these 2 archer towers should make them

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.020 
these 2 archer towers should make them
pop<00:00:44.219> right<00:00:45.180> into<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.570> middle<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.820> best

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
pop right into the middle so it's best

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.690 
pop right into the middle so it's best
to<00:00:48.180> use<00:00:48.210> more<00:00:49.010> archers<00:00:50.010> at<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> beginning

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
to use more archers at the beginning

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.350 
to use more archers at the beginning
instead<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.750> groups<00:00:53.000> we'll<00:00:54.000> get<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
instead of in groups we'll get to the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.990 
instead of in groups we'll get to the
core<00:00:54.600> quicker<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.520> underestimated<00:00:56.520> how<00:00:56.760> many

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
core quicker I underestimated how many

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.420 
core quicker I underestimated how many
it<00:00:57.149> would<00:00:57.239> take<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.140> two<00:00:58.920> groups<00:00:59.280> of

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
it would take so I have two groups of

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.900 
it would take so I have two groups of
archers<00:00:59.820> sent<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:01.160> but<00:01:02.160> as<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.730> they

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
archers sent in but as you can see they

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.260 
archers sent in but as you can see they
get<00:01:03.090> right<00:01:03.300> into<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.660> castle<00:01:03.930> very<00:01:04.320> quickly

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
get right into that castle very quickly

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.940 
get right into that castle very quickly
it's<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.479> matter<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.810> having<00:01:07.350> enough<00:01:07.740> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
it's just a matter of having enough of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.190 
it's just a matter of having enough of
them<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.430> take<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> down<00:01:08.990> asset<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.080> then

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
them to take it down asset and then

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.899 
them to take it down asset and then
these<00:01:10.409> Archer<00:01:11.010> towers<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.490> take<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> down

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.010 

very<00:01:15.539> simple

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.349 

I<00:01:21.079> think<00:01:21.829> I<00:01:21.920> used<00:01:22.130> 200<00:01:22.609> troops<00:01:22.820> on<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:23.210> as

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
I think I used 200 troops on this as

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:31.480 
I think I used 200 troops on this as
well<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:27.350> just<00:01:27.500> 110<00:01:28.219> troops<00:01:28.579> I<00:01:30.369> could<00:01:31.369> have

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
well and just 110 troops I could have

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.910 
well and just 110 troops I could have
gotten<00:01:31.909> away<00:01:32.090> with<00:01:32.360> less<00:01:32.600> if<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:32.899> sent<00:01:33.229> him<00:01:33.380> more

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
gotten away with less if I sent him more

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.690 
gotten away with less if I sent him more
archers<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.549> begin<00:01:34.850> with<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:36.369> do<00:01:37.369> have<00:01:37.640> a

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
archers to begin with I do have a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.120 
archers to begin with I do have a
hundred<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.149> fifty<00:01:38.479> space<00:01:38.899> but<00:01:39.799> I'm<00:01:39.890> trying

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
hundred and fifty space but I'm trying

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.590 
hundred and fifty space but I'm trying
to<00:01:40.250> use<00:01:40.459> as<00:01:40.969> little<00:01:41.240> as<00:01:41.479> possible<00:01:43.569> so<00:01:44.569> that

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
to use as little as possible so that

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.899 
to use as little as possible so that
next<00:01:44.990> let's<00:01:45.380> have<00:01:45.560> a<00:01:45.649> quick<00:01:45.950> look<00:01:45.979> at<00:01:46.310> boom<00:01:46.700> and
