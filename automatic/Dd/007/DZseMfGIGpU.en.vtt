00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 but 

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.020
 we 

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:11.629
 hello I am because in stasiak 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.059
 commercial director of the company this is 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.680
 the huma de france since 2008 it's him 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.949
 matt manufactures pioneer concrete blocks 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.140
 in France in our ultra modern factory 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.380
 based in valenciennes we produce 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.340
 new generation of cellular concrete 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.300
 we attach a very big 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.410
 importance to services and quality 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.119
 thanks to the quality of the concrete under 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.460
 the time is it matt our products 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:41.600
 perfectly meet the requirements of 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:43.249
 the rt 2012 and 2020 very little day I 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.079
 am the manager of the sarl not everything 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:48.399
 especially building companies 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.539
 mainly works 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.389
 we are a company of 15 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.100
 people here in saint catherine 

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:57.649
 we realized three buildings for 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.069
 the account of the 6th thanks to the blog his 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.079
 glasses 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:03.250
 we were able to realize this building on 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.510
 nine months with five people 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.000
 it's numata is very important 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.040
 to ergonomics his products and this gets 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.300
 feel right away for the company and 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.530
 for the workers on the building site and 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.070
 woerth are not used in the good 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.630
 position 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.710
 so they are easier to take 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.330
 after posed with a single manipulation 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.110
 in addition the blocks are light they are 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.270
 planned with neither ergonomic nor 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.040
 light blocks it means less of 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.920
 fatigue and increased performance 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.770
 of 11 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.290
 in August the big dimension of the blocks and 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.549
 the ease of bonding players 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.470
 adds to the speed of setting 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.610
 implemented 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.070
 the sum of working hours avoid 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.390
 calculate the cell blocks its 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.899
 glasses allow the carob 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.640
 browser five times faster with its 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.430
 mahf build becomes so more 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.180
 economical with classical materials 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.180
 without view card quality 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.789
 hello my name is hitting n 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.530
 I work for the group of his 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.479
 we are here at salomÃ© on the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.600
 residence of the call is our first 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.800
 bbc project and first project especially 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.690
 built in cellular concrete 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.610
 we have two residences here 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.810
 collective the first one that makes eleven 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.790
 dwellings and the second one that's nine 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.890
 housing plus a communal cell 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.540
 it's a program that was built 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.459
 in severe concrete but with a cage 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.290
 of stairs that is concrete and especially 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.130
 the specificity of this residence and 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.959
 that there is no age or at all 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.980
 the insulation the cellular concrete constitutes 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.530
 the carrier element and at the same time 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.300
 the insulating element 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.130
 that also assured us a very 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.450
 good airtightness since 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.030
 for collective we have to be 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.740
 less than 1 cubic meter per hour and 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.569
 per square meter and to stop 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.709
 facts here we were at about 0.4 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.370
 that is, we were even 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.110
 better than individual housing so 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.910
 the final results were of the order 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.430
 of 0.4 but we also did tests 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.440
 intermediaries at the time of the closed 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.600
 and we had results that were 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.340
 very good even at times the machine 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.170
 for airtightness does not 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.220
 worked out more we realized 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.720
 that it was simply because we 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.480
 had a very good airtightness 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.410
 better than almost at the level of 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.600
 passive ultimately and we owe this to a 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.280
 share we have concrete side 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.900
 interior superior side and 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.760
 inferior ie all that is 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.420
 slab but that all the walls that are 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.409
 whites as if their sound 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.060
 plainfaing made of materials 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.100
 full with thin joints and 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.050
 finally we have no source of 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.050
 sealing loss at the time of 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.470
 young people among the benefits of concrete 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.320
 cellular 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.390
 we have on the one hand the blow is a 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.680
 operation which is for us a 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.480
 reference at assya 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.280
 this is the operation that to date has 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.930
 cost cheapest to keep bbc 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.100
 we are less than 1000 euros per meter 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.700
 square while usually rotates 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.660
 rather 1200 1300 euros 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.340
 second advantage is that we have a 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.750
 great ease of implementation 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.770
 we can cut blogs as we 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.590
 wish it is full to 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.210
 also hardly to manipulation 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.610
 develops full but light them took them 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.320
 builder as social landlord 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.060
 also the point that is very important 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.940
 it's not just consciousness is 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.800
 also the maintenance the durability of the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.190
 building and finally with the concrete 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.110
 cellular 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.110
 we end up with a material that does not 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.130
 poses no problem for housing 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.410
 ie that tenants can 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.060
 very well drill fix things to the wall 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.890
 with the good things it seems like that 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:25.550
 poses no unforeseen problems and we file 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:27.410
 the main qualities of 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.630
 blogs those of the mat on their excellent 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.440
 thermal insulation while keeping a 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.510
 very high load-bearing strength the concrete 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.130
 cell cell morning and up to five 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.830
 times more insulating than other materials 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.750
 wear it 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.670
 it's human so lets do 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.780
 considerable savings on the 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:49.510
 energy bill and not just in 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.250
 winter but also in summer because thanks to 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.380
 the combination of phase shift and 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.430
 the thermal inertia of our blocks by 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.530
 their exceptional qualities 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.560
 insulation it also offers comfort 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.970
 optimal summer and that without raising 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.660
 the energy bill for 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.070
 the use of air conditioning to 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.990
 the excess matt dwellings remain 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.600
 so pleasantly warm in winter and 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:14.110
 deliciously fresh in summer and this 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.460
 of course it's the game does not think 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.010
 not only in comfort of the inhabitants 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.080
 but also their safety because our 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.440
 blogs are a fuel enough the mab 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.810
 is classified a1 but also to their health 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.560
 two blocks are certified to plus they 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.850
 are 100% mineral and breathable our 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.440
 blocks are composed only of 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.590
 natural raw materials that are 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.480
 not without function too 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.689
 their manufacture requires very little 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.459
 energy or 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:43.289
 construction has itself allowed a 

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:45.309
 healthy and sustainable ecological construction 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:48.449
 build years elected m so it's 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:48.449
 build for tomorrow
