disguise

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.960 

you<00:00:10.320> walk<00:00:10.530> around<00:00:10.680> the<00:00:10.920> pits<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.670> saw

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:11.970 
you walk around the pits and you saw

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.780 
you walk around the pits and you saw
what<00:00:12.240> they've<00:00:12.420> done<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> their<00:00:12.900> robot<00:00:13.790> it's

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
what they've done to their robot it's

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.039 
what they've done to their robot it's
sort<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.090> pretty<00:00:15.300> good<00:00:15.420> actually<00:00:15.600> I<00:00:15.780> think<00:00:15.840> a

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
sort of pretty good actually I think a

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.240 
sort of pretty good actually I think a
lot<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.439> machines<00:00:16.740> are<00:00:16.860> going<00:00:16.950> to<00:00:17.040> develop

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
lot of the machines are going to develop

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.450 
lot of the machines are going to develop
that<00:00:17.520> way<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.880> there<00:00:18.630> be<00:00:18.689> interchangeable

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
that way and there be interchangeable

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.890 
that way and there be interchangeable
weapons<00:00:20.460> systems<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.000> will<00:00:21.240> develop<00:00:21.570> it

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
weapons systems that will develop it

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.859 
weapons systems that will develop it
seems<00:00:22.349> to<00:00:22.470> head<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.860> way<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:23.970> yeah<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.750> quite

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
seems to head that way so yeah be quite

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.760 
seems to head that way so yeah be quite
tricky<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.200> should<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.470> good<00:00:25.619> you'll<00:00:25.740> be

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
tricky I should be good you'll be

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.280 
tricky I should be good you'll be
bolting<00:00:26.160> last-minute<00:00:26.550> things<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.090> yeah<00:00:27.480> do

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
bolting last-minute things on yeah do

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.179 
bolting last-minute things on yeah do
you<00:00:28.349> think<00:00:28.380> your<00:00:28.829> adaptation<00:00:29.930> worked<00:00:31.040> it<00:00:32.040> did

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
you think your adaptation worked it did

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.729 
you think your adaptation worked it did
at<00:00:32.310> the<00:00:32.340> end<00:00:32.840> when<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.930> picked<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.410> that's

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
at the end when you picked you up that's

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.889 
at the end when you picked you up that's
it<00:00:35.040> that's<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.120> was<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.690> little

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
it that's it but it was just a little

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.260 
it that's it but it was just a little
bit<00:00:37.290> close<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.800> time<00:00:38.010> they<00:00:38.310> were<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.700> close<00:00:38.940> in

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.560 

I<00:01:07.880> mean<00:01:08.650> like<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.770> idea<00:01:10.130> when<00:01:10.970> look<00:01:11.150> when

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
I mean like the idea when look when

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.510 
I mean like the idea when look when
you're<00:01:11.690> fighting<00:01:11.960> razor<00:01:12.290> to<00:01:12.740> make<00:01:12.890> those<00:01:13.100> and

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
you're fighting razor to make those and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.450 
you're fighting razor to make those and
changes<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.770> think<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:15.920> might<00:01:16.130> have<00:01:16.190> been<00:01:16.340> my

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
changes I think it might have been my

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.650 
changes I think it might have been my
idea<00:01:16.850> we<00:01:17.780> we<00:01:18.410> sat<00:01:18.590> down<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:18.979> thought<00:01:19.040> about

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
idea we we sat down and thought about

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.300 
idea we we sat down and thought about
after<00:01:20.660> losing<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:21.290> razor<00:01:21.440> twice<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:21.979> extreme

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
after losing to razor twice and extreme

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.400 
after losing to razor twice and extreme
vulnerability<00:01:22.760> to<00:01:23.390> different<00:01:23.659> weapons<00:01:24.020> and

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
vulnerability to different weapons and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.600 
vulnerability to different weapons and
we<00:01:24.590> thought<00:01:24.770> well<00:01:24.979> we<00:01:25.130> need<00:01:25.160> to<00:01:25.430> build

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
we thought well we need to build

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.200 
we thought well we need to build
something<00:01:25.790> yeah<00:01:26.570> it<00:01:27.020> was<00:01:27.170> a<00:01:27.200> very<00:01:27.470> clever

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
something yeah it was a very clever

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.460 
something yeah it was a very clever
interpretation<00:01:29.210> of<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.509> rules<00:01:29.750> there's<00:01:30.350> been

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
interpretation of the rules there's been

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.100 
interpretation of the rules there's been
an<00:01:30.560> arguments<00:01:31.100> raging<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.119> mean<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.630> your<00:01:32.869> robot

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
an arguments raging I mean is your robot

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.680 
an arguments raging I mean is your robot
small<00:01:33.560> enough<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.890> fit<00:01:34.070> in<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:34.400> pit<00:01:34.690> it's

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
small enough to fit in that pit it's

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.210 
small enough to fit in that pit it's
within<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.170> maximum<00:01:36.290> size<00:01:36.650> allowed<00:01:36.979> in<00:01:37.130> the

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
within the maximum size allowed in the

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.980 
within the maximum size allowed in the
rules<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:37.850> is<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.030> lot<00:01:38.360> bigger<00:01:38.600> than<00:01:38.750> what

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
rules and that is a lot bigger than what

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.260 
rules and that is a lot bigger than what
will<00:01:39.110> go<00:01:39.259> in<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.440> pit<00:01:39.759> well<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:40.910> can't<00:01:41.119> say

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
will go in the pit well you can't say

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.090 
will go in the pit well you can't say
further<00:01:41.539> than<00:01:41.690> that<00:01:41.720> really<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.410> you<00:01:42.979> were

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
further than that really and you were

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.219 
further than that really and you were
quite<00:01:43.310> ungentlemanly<00:01:44.180> when<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.720> ref<00:01:44.840> bot<00:01:45.080> was

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
quite ungentlemanly when the ref bot was

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.740 
quite ungentlemanly when the ref bot was
trying<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.590> get<00:01:45.710> them<00:01:45.890> off<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.160> arena<00:01:46.399> walls

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750
