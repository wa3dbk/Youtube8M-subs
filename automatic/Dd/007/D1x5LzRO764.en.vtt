00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.730
 hello my name is Lesha I draw banks 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.540
 about seven years old and want to share with you 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.880
 recipe for making thin tips 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.960
 Once when I first started drawing 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.860
 rummaged the internet asking friends 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.330
 which graffiti draws such ways and 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.260
 I tried them and I did it 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.930
 A strong current of the Abilov walls all 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.079
 clogged after a minute of use I 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.429
 experimented a lot and here 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.989
 I decided to show you what I achieved 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:42.089
 many experienced riders advised me 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.839
 use nozzles from cheap paint 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.460
 type d call from supposedly there it is 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:52.199
 hole 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.989
 thicker here it is and accordingly the needle there 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.100
 here and for this it was necessary still 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.049
 buy syringes with the thinnest needles 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.890
 The key to these needles is that they are very 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.640
 I quickly littered too, so I tried and 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.590
 I did not like 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.800
 so I decided to use these 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.470
 I like these nozzles with a spout 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:19.010
 nozzles so that the spout is very easy 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:23.210
 here's the needle 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.210
 But from such syringes of the thickest 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.180
 needle 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.780
 very easy to insert i turn 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.780
 cut down 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.009
 let's face it 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.280
 it turns out then I use normal 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:56.200
 lighter well in general the source of fire 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:02:02.850
 To melt the gift of plastic as 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.850
 lighters not me not smoking matches 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.420
 when melting it is important to do so 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.220
 plastic fully paid a hole 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:21.459
 because the paint will then pass 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:25.560
 here so here here and not to litter and will 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.560
 gotta need to be careful 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.939
 here we have such here 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.799
 nozzle and a bunch of plastic on the fingers and 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:41.220
 now we will go to this nozzle 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:44.430
 test we test the nozzle for 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.560
 start i take a can of paint and going down 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.069
 no control for that I turn over 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:55.680
 and thin us with a thick nozzle just 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:58.879
 so push forward waiting around 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.879
 10 15 seconds 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.560
 when the jar gets a little soft 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:17.940
 you can flip and try to take 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.940
 nozzle and draw lines 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:40.710
 And now I will try the same nozzle. 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.760
 on brand new cans not 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.760
 releasing pressure 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.590
 as we see the difference is small 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.950
 the only thing that can be squirting 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.950
 stronger 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.330
 here 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.220
 if you can draw very close at all 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.790
 make hairs 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.350
 plus these tips is that when she 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.980
 clogs and clogs most often 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.640
 exactly the needle 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:47.610
 you can just get a needle and change 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.490
 new and work on in principle 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.160
 Thanks for watching, I hope 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.570
 this video is useful to you and if you 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.800
 there are some interesting ways 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.470
 manufacturing 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.070
 tips, share comments with me 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.070
 until
