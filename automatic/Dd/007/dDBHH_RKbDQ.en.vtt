00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.059
 so hello to all of you and 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.190
 the other 63 we meet today 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.110
 for a little tutorial but win when we 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.340
 do not really know mechanics but I 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.530
 think it will serve more than one you are 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.970
 what to ask to do that so 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.550
 what a little tutorial to know how 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.800
 we do the mixing on motorcycles 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.950
 time then there are two options to two 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.250
 possibilities be in your bike while 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.920
 simply you have a tank 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.810
 of oil so a lizard of the god mixes 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.730
 just to fill his tank and he 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.460
 is a system that those who charge 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.579
 in fact to add so this mixture 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.780
 in your in your engine or 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.150
 simply otherwise we will have to do it 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.610
 so personally I prefer to do 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.320
 it's more reliable 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.079
 so that's why I use the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.320
 haye pesnel after everyone does as he 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.870
 wants 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.680
 the best is it's still 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.340
 take the ascendancy for blood 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.059
 synthetic 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.170
 so here it is the ipod know and racing 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.630
 so in 100% synthetic 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.460
 this is a 5 liter quest can 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.789
 in fact so there are 4 liters + 1 liter 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.520
 offered and a small can 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.959
 otherwise, or just a little 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.310
 dosing container there are small ones 

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.499
 doser so we'll be fine 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.119
 useful what I do so it's once 

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:24.729
 useful and forgetting which small millet no 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.909
 used I fill it with the big so 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.859
 here you have to know 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.679
 how much gas did you put in 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.240
 your in your can 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.789
 so if you put for example 10 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.130
 liters of gasoline and that for you will 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.299
 mx-5 the mix it's not going to be good if 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.369
 you want to put that for bows 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.369
 so have to look there I know that 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.310
 in that one I have 9 liters so I'm going 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.630
 take with the little the little guy from 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.849
 the graduation you may not see 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.490
 but it is well marked 2% must be 2 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:56.200
 % I even prefer to be a bit more after 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.509
 that's according to you but not in 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.249
 below 2% that's for sure after it's 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.869
 play with fire you risk yourself 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:04.169
 risk breaking 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.149
 therefore for 5 liters of gasoline 2% 

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:10.479
 it's 100 milliliters 100 milliliters 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.390
 that's 2% for 2% blends for 5 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.600
 liters of gasoline then what we do 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.480
 so sure on this one we open the small 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.180
 compartment is simply 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.709
 what are we doing we are going to support 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.590
 I advise you against a 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.240
 wall you to use the skin the weight of 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.500
 your body one pressing you on the 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.080
 can it be much faster to 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.730
 fill up so here's a first dose on 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.810
 is about 5 liters 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.410
 so we open the bottle well I'll 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.209
 do with but tomorrow thank you up well 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.680
 be careful to put the two 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.040
 so there is a first dose of 5 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.770
 liters 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:57.450
 he will then have to put a 2 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:59.280
 4 liters sees there and we go then I come 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.550
 so to do the second dose 2 4 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.090
 liters 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:07.500
 we will of course put it in the can 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.340
 we will then do the same for the 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.200
 second the first cause of this one 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.030
 so 2.5 liters that one there are about 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.860
 ten liters and a half so we will put 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.739
 for 11 liters it will do a little bit 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.570
 more than 2% but there is no problem 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.880
 it's good I put about so 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:28.310
 five more beds one bed so 6 liters 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.320
 we're going to finish pouring we're going next 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.730
 closed so the gas can 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.890
 with now the mixture we will put 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.959
 his goods hunger and the very very 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.489
 important it's done even the thing the 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.660
 more important after putting the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:51.450
 mixture should not forget it's 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:53.040
 simply to agitate the senses 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.150
 why simply because there in 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.510
 does it make it much heavier than 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.550
 the senses she does not know yet 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.069
 homogenize so in fact it's down 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.730
 we have a film of tiles and at 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.110
 the essence that in water 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.019
 so what we're going to do is we're going 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:16.229
 well shaken gold each his method not no 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:18.720
 more restless for ten minutes just that 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.489
 it mixes well and then everything 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.060
 it just remains to pour 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.060
 the senses 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.150
 normally this one should have 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.540
 a little a little belt in 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.820
 function of your mix so this one 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.479
 it's more like mixing it and 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.090
 red 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.060
 she is rather orange and the years has taken 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.919
 an orange hue so it's also for 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.389
 that we see that the essence and the 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:48.000
 mixture have been done correctly 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:50.250
 chaipas should close your tank 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.270
 I also advise you if your bike 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.440
 must remain at rest for a long time and 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.080
 not going for a long time 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.090
 after your last motorcycle ride 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.900
 close the senses and turn it 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.150
 until she stops everything 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.530
 simply to avoid deposits of 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.110
 to mix meanings that will be done in 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.740
 the carburetor all that and who goes who 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.250
 will prevent a correct start by 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.010
 the future 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.600
 so here I hope this little tutorial has you 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.830
 helped even if it's something that 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.650
 a lot of people know it does 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.150
 also sometimes good to see him again 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.070
 I hope you enjoyed it a lot and 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.080
 listen if you have some ideas of 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.120
 tutos I am a taker let some 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.669
 comments I wish you well 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.669
 roll do your regard mixture
