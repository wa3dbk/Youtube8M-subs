00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.440

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.710
 Video demonstration of the htv loader 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.000
 for playstation2 in console farc las 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.650
 chubby 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.190
 this has been doubled has the 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.860
 particularity that can not be 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.590
 erase the games so you do not have the 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.080
 right side menu 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.200
 where is the option from eleventh to 38 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.420
 of the credit so no one can enter 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.140
 the option to delete edit or change the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.840
 names this is a hard drive of 120 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.590
 days which contains all those games 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.590
 that are in the list 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.620
 here the only game that is not compatible 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.620
 with the h2s pool paradise 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:05.050
 you can play using another launcher 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.050
 that I will show later 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.360
 all games run blue 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.640
 normally without any problem to 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.640
 exception of pool paradise 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.340
 We tested the 2013 fish that some did not 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.340
 it works like this 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.220
 and normally it does not work 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.220
 no problem 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.200
 very well I give everything time to see and 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.200
 that do not stay in January be love 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.789
 usually dad 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.239
 well now we will pass 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.210
 to try the other launcher that is the open 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:18.300
 ps2 laude 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:21.230
 to check the list of games 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.230
 now because the guys 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.920
 good for this open weight side of 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.110
 we reboot the console comes out matrix and 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.120
 we need a memory card configured 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.660
 have free program installed 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.670
 music box to which this program is 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.900
 has added some more options for 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.500
 I can throw 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.940
 the next the hell 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.510
 as you can see is version 1.8 is a 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.410
 browser in the 5 figuration online lf 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.650
 the opening 9.0 and the open or 9.0 with that 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.890
 sm who is excited to give you a 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:17.319
 better an improvement to the videos 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.319
 as you see starts or in front of the oder 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.230
 and here is 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.650
 you can see on the covers the background is seen 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.840
 of the game and it is the same disk that has 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.930
 installed the hd or loader and also has 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.660
 this option to be able to use it with this 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.660
 pitcher that is open ps2 laude 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.170
 it's the same list too 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.120
 games but now it has an improvement 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.580
 graph looks nicer more 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.150
 presentable resemblance to pitchers 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.860
 who have 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.130
 the play stress 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.640
 the xbox 360 or what win they have with their 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.340
 cover not the advantage of this launcher 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.020
 is that here you can play the games 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.170
 that are not compatible with the h dollar 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.610
 to be called the dragon ball infinite 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.730
 war 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.330
 the paradise that was installed today loads 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.670
 he is also and the captain tsubasa or 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.240
 known as here they know it here as 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.940
 the super champions is in Japanese it 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.900
 can play normally the other games 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.900
 they are all compatible 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.980
 and the advantage of estÃ¡e lauder is that 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.860
 it also allows you to create memories 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.350
 virtual so you can record your 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.780
 games saved inside the hard drive 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.150
 as if from the back of a play 3 there 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.590
 that records all your saves within the 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.680
 disco this is also nice you have 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.150
 option but in some games 70% of 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.390
 the games are compatible with these 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.390
 options 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.509
 as they see most of it has its 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.710
 graphic presentations and let's try 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.710
 the board 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.050
 no problem loading 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.060
 and that has an option to put it in 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.449
 pal ntsc inside the configurations 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.370
 of the other 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.039
 for any questions any question 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.009
 I'll leave my mail and they can 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.870
 contact can ask and any 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.999
 doubt that they have to be able to 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.279
 answer easier than it is 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.849
 answering in some pages of 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:35.060
 sales 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:38.040
 they contact 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.420
 the problem is not 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.980
 it clears all the doubts of the 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.350
 people 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.340
 and they have some interest in youtube for 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.340
 get is the savings 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.110
 I had 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:09.150
 in charge normally 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.580
 and this is an advanced game 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.150
 without any problem all the series goes out 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.150
 more normally 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:30.639
 well that's all we see
