only had three points on us and the
offense<00:02:30.260> definitely<00:02:30.650> stepped<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:30.980> up<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.159> notch

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
offense definitely stepped it up a notch

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.470

from last week I mean there's still
definitely<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.959> couple<00:02:33.200> kinks<00:02:33.500> that<00:02:33.530> we<00:02:33.739> can<00:02:33.859> be

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
definitely a couple kinks that we can be

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.069 
definitely a couple kinks that we can be
worked<00:02:34.159> out<00:02:34.340> but<00:02:34.879> on<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.480> whole<00:02:35.659> the<00:02:35.750> offense

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
worked out but on the whole the offense

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.929 
worked out but on the whole the offense
did<00:02:36.379> a<00:02:36.409> lot<00:02:36.680> better<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.159> special<00:02:37.489> teams<00:02:37.670> also

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
did a lot better and special teams also

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.160 
did a lot better and special teams also
is<00:02:38.060> really<00:02:38.269> good<00:02:38.420> nice<00:02:38.599> punt<00:02:38.870> cover

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
is really good nice punt cover

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.780 
is really good nice punt cover
nice<00:02:39.560> kickoff<00:02:39.889> cover<00:02:40.159> I<00:02:40.250> mean<00:02:40.430> we<00:02:40.519> didn't<00:02:40.670> have

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
nice kickoff cover I mean we didn't have

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.220 
nice kickoff cover I mean we didn't have
too<00:02:40.909> many<00:02:41.000> big<00:02:41.120> returns<00:02:41.540> from<00:02:41.720> them<00:02:41.900> at<00:02:42.049> all<00:02:42.200> I

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
too many big returns from them at all I

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.170 
too many big returns from them at all I
don't<00:02:42.409> think<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.340> overall<00:02:43.609> is<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.819> team<00:02:44.030> we've

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
don't think so overall is the team we've

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.640 
don't think so overall is the team we've
definitely<00:02:44.389> improved<00:02:44.930> from<00:02:45.049> last<00:02:45.290> week<00:02:45.500> but

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650
