 hello youtube friends today I will teach you 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.490
 how to install 'assassin's creed' well 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.380
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.200
 download the file that is in the 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.570
 description of the video once downloaded 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.450
 they pass it to their cell phone once it's ready 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.640
 we created a folder called gameloft 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.840
 then inside this we create another 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.840
 called folder game 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.830
 and then once created we look for the 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.700
 'assassin's creed' folder and we move it 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.700
 to the ga folder 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.150

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.150
