best<00:03:54.389> way<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:54.630> knew<00:03:54.870> how<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.139> couldn't<00:03:55.590> do<00:03:55.739> it

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
best way I knew how I couldn't do it

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.089 
best way I knew how I couldn't do it
that<00:03:56.040> well<00:03:56.250> but<00:03:56.599> yeah<00:03:57.599> I<00:03:57.630> put<00:03:57.900> some<00:03:58.139> velcro

that well but yeah I put some velcro
here<00:03:59.849> so<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.500> actually<00:04:02.030> can<00:04:03.030> open<00:04:03.560> and

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
here so that it actually can open and

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.830 
awesome work and you can see up here I
put<00:04:35.409> too<00:04:35.560> much<00:04:35.590> too<00:04:36.280> much<00:04:36.460> glue<00:04:36.849> when<00:04:37.599> using

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
because what I did is I cover it the

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:43.670 
because what I did is I cover it the
inside<00:05:39.029> with<00:05:40.029> white<00:05:40.330> cardstock<00:05:40.930> paper<00:05:41.550> and<00:05:42.629> I

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
came out so well I mean it's kind of

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.800 
came out so well I mean it's kind of
nice<00:06:02.620> but<00:06:03.310> I<00:06:03.339> really<00:06:03.430> need<00:06:03.819> to<00:06:03.849> work<00:06:04.150> on<00:06:04.389> it<00:06:04.629> so

I'm gonna make another one maybe just a

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.230 
I'm gonna make another one maybe just a
little<00:06:06.849> smaller<00:06:08.219> because<00:06:09.219> I<00:06:09.250> think<00:06:09.400> that<00:06:09.699> it's

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
little smaller because I think that it's

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.510 
little smaller because I think that it's
a<00:06:10.419> little<00:06:10.599> too<00:06:10.839> big<00:06:11.139> for<00:06:11.500> the<00:06:11.650> little<00:06:11.919> kitchen

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
a little too big for the little kitchen

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.509 
a little too big for the little kitchen
area<00:06:12.699> that<00:06:13.180> I<00:06:13.210> have
