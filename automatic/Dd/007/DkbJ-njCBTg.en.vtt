00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
changes colors there it's kind of like

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.130 
changes colors there it's kind of like
what<00:01:06.920> would<00:01:07.039> happen<00:01:07.610> if<00:01:07.820> mother-of-pearl<00:01:08.479> and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
what would happen if mother-of-pearl and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.100 
what would happen if mother-of-pearl and
camouflage<00:01:10.130> got<00:01:10.520> together<00:01:10.970> that's<00:01:11.720> like<00:01:11.869> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
camouflage got together that's like the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.760 
camouflage got together that's like the
best<00:01:12.259> way<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.619> can<00:01:12.770> describe<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:14.560> one<00:01:15.560> thing

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
best way I can describe it one thing

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.020 
best way I can describe it one thing
they<00:01:15.890> did<00:01:16.070> with<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:16.369> watch<00:01:16.640> is<00:01:16.880> they

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
they did with this watch is they

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.109 
they did with this watch is they
skeletonized<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.710> hour<00:01:18.950> hand<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:20.030> the

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
skeletonized the hour hand and the

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.179 
skeletonized the hour hand and the
minute<00:01:20.450> hand<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.290> that<00:01:21.439> you<00:01:21.530> can<00:01:21.650> see<00:01:21.920> the

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
minute hand so that you can see the

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.210 
minute hand so that you can see the
chronograph<00:01:22.850> dials<00:01:23.470> better<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:24.860> don't<00:01:25.070> know

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
chronograph dials better I don't know

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.190 
chronograph dials better I don't know
that<00:01:25.400> was<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.580> best<00:01:25.850> idea<00:01:26.479> because<00:01:26.720> it<00:01:27.020> makes

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
that was the best idea because it makes

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.480 
that was the best idea because it makes
them<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.380> little<00:01:27.500> hard<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:27.979> see<00:01:28.189> they're<00:01:28.369> not

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
them a little hard to see they're not

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.580 
them a little hard to see they're not
impossible<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.180> see<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:29.600> another<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.409> right

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
impossible to see and another the right

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.100 
impossible to see and another the right
length<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:31.130> all<00:01:31.340> but<00:01:31.939> you<00:01:32.689> know<00:01:32.810> they<00:01:32.930> could

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
length and all but you know they could

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.300 
length and all but you know they could
have<00:01:33.140> been<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.350> little<00:01:33.560> bit<00:01:33.799> more<00:01:34.040> bold

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
have been a little bit more bold

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.460 
have been a little bit more bold
especially<00:01:35.119> because<00:01:35.600> I<00:01:35.780> think<00:01:35.930> most<00:01:36.259> of<00:01:36.380> the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
especially because I think most of the

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.050 
especially because I think most of the
people<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:36.979> are<00:01:37.100> gonna<00:01:37.250> be<00:01:37.460> wearing<00:01:37.970> this
