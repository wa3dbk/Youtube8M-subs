00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.800
 hello and welcome here 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.590
 back to the box at the start and stopped 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.720
 video on a channel and if you are the 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.340
 beautiful mode hardware like 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.720
 Zocken wants to make points but has 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.240
 not to be shot down anymore 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.029
 then makes it into a relaxed yet 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.950
 at a height where I just no one 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:38.320
 can interfere with it the point was 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.470
 and beautiful and keep going 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.640
 points and quite honest who damn 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.140
 again to intercept this height 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.940
 how it all works here and how 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.360
 we've managed to show that too 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.800
 right in the connection so stay tuned 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.050
 this clip also works the macd 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.270
 and aroon in beautiful mode hotwire 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.130
 where he is, if at all 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.860
 Use is in other is just pure 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:07.120
 Black thing and that of bbc 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.280
 onlive brought on cloud and he shows 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.600
 makes me exactly namely here 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.400
 in the front the car and the lettering 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.070
 and right in between the bar is that 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.390
 According to skipper just sat c4 now the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.310
 You had a bit because you have to 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.680
 that really perfectly put on each other 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.330
 you will see it all the same 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.250
 that is apart is better 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.690
 that's because the explosive fruit is easy 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.790
 is much better to control 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.550
 you see a few failed attempts is yes 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.619
 so we put down three pieces 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.509
 i am now settling here for home 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.660
 Perfect to see that Klaus Geber too 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.650
 really perfect is necessary because otherwise 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.270
 have the light left or right 3 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.040
 of course I'm talking in too, of course 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.600
 the direction that should not be so 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.250
 that looks good i am you once 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.550
 must be a good point and indeed 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.410
 help sees now they are four points 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.530
 this has something to do with this dazzling and 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.000
 At this blind is such a small 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.620
 triangle and exactly on this point 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.810
 pattern out yours around the perfect book 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.300
 to have too perfect for him towards 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.649
 push so changed levitt we have 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.810
 now cut a grenade 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.000
 when the grenade explodes 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.710
 we both ignite the c4 at the same time 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.450
 must be a perfect time 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.580
 be there and we have landed already 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.750
 on the roof, the old hammer can now 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.920
 you really rumcruisen and new here 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.390
 that just blatantly my husband can do that 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.000
 Environment its hotwire points all the way 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.709
 No one relaxes and relaxes 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.500
 that's just not funny again 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.300
 Just wanted to show it and yes stop 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.340
 really look out for it is for two 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.950
 make a total of flex c4 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.450
 She puts her perfectly on a sports park 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.670
 then back then are now again 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.280
 that three witches on the license plate 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.410
 there still be the c4 point 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.510
 and if that is achieved then 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.190
 Throws the grenade out of the window 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.140
 Colleague can even come out with a back 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.570
 A school is leaning out of the window 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.580
 grenade and if this explodes then 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.070
 you ignite the bang together 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.480
 and then you just put so high, 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.250
 lands on top of it is one 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.810
 A little trick does not work 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.450
 first time but I wish you 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.510
 damn much fun and yes what 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.860
 say another thing is just that again 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.540
 mega awesome fail 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.790
 and if you liked that here 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.380
 really really mad if 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.640
 her an abo leaves me 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.560
 noticed that last time the people 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.090
 yes the videos are much clicked but 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.500
 somehow not proceed comment 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.750
 under that can not be true though 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.549
 Let's go for the abo I want here 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.140
 really get a bit big and 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.769
 I can only do that with you I need 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.570
 me for that 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.970
 So we'll see each other in the next one 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.560
 videos and so much fun 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.560
