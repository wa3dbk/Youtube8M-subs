get the most out of it now the best way
to<00:02:10.830> get<00:02:11.130> low<00:02:11.420> is<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.569> hold<00:02:12.720> on<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.140> hoods

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
to get low is to hold on to the hoods

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.590 
to get low is to hold on to the hoods
remembering<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.030> cover<00:02:15.239> your<00:02:15.420> brakes<00:02:15.690> and

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
remembering to cover your brakes and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.870 
remembering to cover your brakes and
hold<00:02:18.600> your<00:02:18.780> arms<00:02:19.709> parallel<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.580> ground

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
hold your arms parallel to the ground

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.449 
hold your arms parallel to the ground
and<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.170> by<00:02:22.320> bending<00:02:22.590> your<00:02:22.739> elbows<00:02:23.130> about

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
and do this by bending your elbows about

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.300 
and do this by bending your elbows about
90<00:02:23.970> degrees<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:25.290> drops<00:02:25.620> at<00:02:25.830> all<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.190> your

90 degrees and this drops at all of your
body<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:27.330> gets<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.630> good<00:02:27.780> aerodynamic

position<00:02:30.739> now<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.800> problem<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.489> it's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
position now the problem of this is it's

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.160

this<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:10.780> crucial<00:03:11.020> because<00:03:11.260> this<00:03:11.500> reduces

but remember you've always got to be

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.220 
but remember you've always got to be
looking<00:03:16.900> ahead

looking ahead

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.080 
looking ahead
it's<00:03:18.130> not<00:03:18.250> about<00:03:18.340> riding<00:03:18.760> with<00:03:18.850> your<00:03:18.940> head

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
it's not about riding with your head

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.170 
it's not about riding with your head
down<00:03:19.330> you<00:03:19.780> must<00:03:19.990> be<00:03:20.170> looking<00:03:20.290> forward<00:03:21.180> when

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
down you must be looking forward when

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.090 
down you must be looking forward when
freewheelin<00:03:22.810> downhill<00:03:23.260> as<00:03:23.530> much<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:23.920> same

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
freewheelin downhill as much the same

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.000 
freewheelin downhill as much the same
except<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.210> position<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.690> your<00:03:25.720> feet<00:03:26.010> hold

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.250 

so<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:39.300> all<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.600> worth<00:03:39.810> it

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
so it's all that worth it

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.010 
so it's all that worth it
