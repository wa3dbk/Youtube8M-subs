00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.930
 and then guys that Henrique me 18 video 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.910
 of 18 in the civil seat will be all that 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.619
 precedes the fourth mission 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.450
 only that it will be less because the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.689
 People are not going to have to investigate anything. 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.789
 nor how it was in that in the video that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.500
 precedes the 3rd people here in the sewer 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.279
 investigate what was happening and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.010
 everything else 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.050
 he's already coming here in the round pib a 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.160
 girl will be presented to the person already 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.410
 You know she is but I have to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.559
 present to her and there is the following 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.150
 This video will be smaller and I'll go 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.080
 show you the figueirense that I 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.610
 I will make 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.170
 Let's see if it's going to work, I'm 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.449
 Thinking about doing something we're going to 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.269
 to see if it will work is to deliver the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.430
 gifts to save them are not the 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.799
 case of the boat for a pine tree I think it is 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.750
 that's his name to have access to 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.159
 inscription of the potions a new die 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.510
 means to attack the 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:07.500
 Horror, right? 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.810
 and this video will probably be 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.210
 sent on the same day as the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.570
 third mission and the other day at 9 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.890
 morning a full video of the fourth mission 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.399
 are introducing themselves and asking if 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.049
 she would like to see her room here is 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:26.640
 normal, now we'll see that the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:31.499
 revealed that you're going to tell us 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.770
 will there will see us then we'll see 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:36.539
 which revealed that you will want not 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.369
 talks to impress boy armed with a 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.320
 make you change the course of a city 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.359
 whole and with the twins as always 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.189
 for our own lord pedro tom 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.469
 that guy who was there will go 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.950
 take their votes in parliament to the 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.990
 sister that hit and one night you changed 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.299
 More than a man changes in one in life 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.240
 whole thing we need to talk to you and soon 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.759
 but now the pendleton oil brother 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.639
 of the guys that we dispatched that is 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.609
 talk to us is this you see the 

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:07.319
 mission lanes still only have it there 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:09.030
 we talk to pedro leÃ³n that 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.670
 maybe it's him going from the next 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.470
 mission or is the lord in that other 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.940
 winning mars is where I 'm going to speak 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.740
 with the guy over there to unlock some 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.739
 things here 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.900
 still will not rise because I honor the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.920
 things and can not do it. 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.830
 right in the first leg 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.880
 the legalist conspiracy thanks for the 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.520
 your job 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.910
 I do not know if I can but my own 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.140
 brothers and it's logical, man, I never fucking face 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.640
 I thought you had killed 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.340
 Empress and make much more sense 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.290
 that spy master that guy over there 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.769
 incriminate we were behind 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.440
 Besides marina we spent a lot of money 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.120
 we expose ourselves to a great risk 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.590
 taking you out of prison but we 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.120
 we believe you make a difference 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.380
 now or tell me at home revealed that 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.569
 is looking for me I just tried 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.519
 talk to the fucking view of bitch, huh? 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.220
 translation made by me and did not like it 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:11.110
 cent and wheel has something that does not 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.549
 Let's talk now, you should probably 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.970
 be what we're going to have to do in 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:18.340
 next mission is to determine the location 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.750
 and here I'll talk to him, let's go 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.750
 lock new items 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:31.930
 here is the number two ppgmad of the 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.310
 mask the other lot the potion and each 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.400
 Portion, right? 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.420
 and now we also have the data 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.590
 where the data here costs 50 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.959
 a thousand that other old man to the other two 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.530
 It is very expensive to give a 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:55.480
 daily sleep is costing you 100 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.160
 they are the 11 the one plus one nor yet 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.019
 I know it pays to buy it because not 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.790
 I used it, I did not use the data 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.730
 What good is it to be able to make the face of 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.609
 friends to sleep data even when 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.950
 whether you are in battle face to face 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.510
 It does not work to realize that it 's weird. 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.010
 so I think it works the other to 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.739
 then I 'll even search to see what 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.780
 this fight of piety 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.150
 I think I'm going to buy this second one. 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.800
 level of zoom for masks just to 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.200
 see what happens has nothing 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.539
 to buy even more Ãºltil the rest of 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.240
 line practically in use 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.480
 could have bought the hit rate is 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.090
 improve hit rate 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.060
 cloud but that is not a return to 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.750
 raining here it makes oauth has 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.310
 these 1 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.310
 now it's close, it 's good, right? 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:50.420
 It means to even combine this. 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.220
 from here with that magic of getting behind 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:57.220
 of the wall may be useful 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:00.320
 now let's see here have this 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.140
 and if the crutch now ran away from her 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:11.030
 I 'm already with the 6 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:12.590
 so I have to draw to choose 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.570
 another let me see what will be better 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.000
 here I am slowly passing the 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.890
 People can read right 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.390
 remembering that I did not skip any 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.730
 Do you have the same thing as me? 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.200
 I am following exactly what I am 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.750
 doing you will probably be with 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.040
 all these items leave from here to 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.960
 increase my mana bar 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.730
 will probably increase also type a 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.520
 people will have access to one more magic 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.520
 before the manna fits here that I was 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.170
 thinking of buying the team good for 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.030
 to be able to stop time 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.310
 How do I have five waves going to buy? 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.310
 how many were probably going 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.320
 There will be 3 more and it will cost 3 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.540
 also I know to tighten the second 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:55.100
 button is stopped for a short of 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:59.660
 agent for time for a while we 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.160
 risk caraca eight streets thinking that only 3 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.620
 the second level as was the majority 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.470
 whoa 8 should also make misery 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.530
 on level 2 do not let that one there 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.540
 Now let's see what we have to do in 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.610
 Next mission this is going to be a video 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.300
 intermediary, I'm going to send him to 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.070
 night 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.220
 I hope that the same people do not let 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.050
 pass right my friend martin was in 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.560
 with talking about ours to the next 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.090
 step is a note had a footnote of 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.530
 That's the name they're talking about. 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.120
 in that free 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:34.700
 talking about the physical the actual physical 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.070
 This guy from Sokolova he lives are talking. 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:41.090
 place that he lives half the time and 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:43.850
 passes there and the other half off the river 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.760
 in his apartment does samuel go 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.470
 take people to the bridge 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.270
 We'll find a dream, I'll go. 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.770
 find him is sokolova he has to 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.750
 bring it back here I do not believe that 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:57.640
 You have so far escaped from prison. 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:07:01.590
 catching is killing ending with high 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.790
 see if at the top and tested the high specter 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.400
 rescuing the emma and everything and now 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:10.230
 people until our next mission 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.880
 we have to consume what this here 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:16.360
 You have to consecrate this 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.740
 bridge and then behind the rescue is love 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.330
 I'm not mistaken, the paintings have this 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.880
 name should not be the one doing it either. 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.490
 these paintings are going to knead cool 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:29.830
 let's see what it is here that looks 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:36.220
 inexpensive level or stops completely 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:40.660
 time he gets everything slowly because 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:42.670
 This year may have been head of here. 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.770
 This magic is very goofy. 

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:47.980
 populous is that there guys already have the 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:08:00.520
 ambition 4 complete she is one of the smallest 

00:07:47.980 --> 00:08:02.170
 missions from the local game that we 

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.240
 then we go to sleep now we 

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.830
 You did not even have time to sleep, baby, that's it. 

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.180
 A hug for everyone. 

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.180
 see you next time
