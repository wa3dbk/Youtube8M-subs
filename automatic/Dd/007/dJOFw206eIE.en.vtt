things<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.399> that<00:01:06.289> then<00:01:07.289> you<00:01:07.770> got<00:01:08.009> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
things like that then you got a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.749 
things like that then you got a
softshell<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:10.050> which<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.190> know<00:01:11.310> very

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759

flexible and that's supposed to be

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.460 
flexible and that's supposed to be
moisture<00:01:14.820> wicking<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.020> supposed<00:01:16.380> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
moisture wicking so it's supposed to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.590

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
everything the shoe keeps the water out

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.699 
everything the shoe keeps the water out
for<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.700> decent<00:01:39.509> time<00:01:39.690> when<00:01:40.200> you're<00:01:40.349> out<00:01:40.440> there

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.820 
running so you know if you're running
through<00:01:42.690> smaller<00:01:42.990> puddles<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:43.470> stuff<00:01:43.679> like

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
through smaller puddles and stuff like

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.410 
through smaller puddles and stuff like
that<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.160> does<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> great<00:01:44.640> job<00:01:44.940> keeping<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420

shape isn't quite the same but you know
it's<00:02:02.130> been<00:02:02.310> used<00:02:02.459> a<00:02:02.640> little<00:02:02.729> bit<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.630> soil<00:02:03.899> is

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it's been used a little bit the soil is

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.930 
it's been used a little bit the soil is
lacking<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.590> little<00:02:04.709> bit<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.160> flexibility<00:02:05.849> here

lacking a little bit of flexibility here

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.540 
lacking a little bit of flexibility here
as<00:02:06.330> you<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.660> see<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.440> not<00:02:07.649> too<00:02:07.920> bad<00:02:08.190> but<00:02:08.489> you

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
as you can see it's not too bad but you

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.249 
as you can see it's not too bad but you
do<00:02:08.819> need<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> little<00:02:09.209> pressure<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.780> push<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
do need a little pressure to push it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.890 
do need a little pressure to push it
down<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.910> know<00:02:12.030> flexibility<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
down but you know flexibility in the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.870 
down but you know flexibility in the
soil<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.290> what<00:02:13.440> you're<00:02:13.590> sacrificing<00:02:14.520> if<00:02:14.700> you

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
soil is what you're sacrificing if you

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.850 
soil is what you're sacrificing if you
want<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.180> have<00:02:15.330> sufficient<00:02:15.930> foot<00:02:16.620> protection

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.100 
want to have sufficient foot protection
from<00:02:17.520> sharp<00:02:17.819> objects<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.510> everything<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
from sharp objects and everything and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.350 
from sharp objects and everything and
with<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.099> sole<00:02:20.340> they've<00:02:20.520> chosen<00:02:20.790> here<00:02:21.060> we

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
with the sole they've chosen here we

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.140 
with the sole they've chosen here we
think<00:02:21.629> they<00:02:21.750> did<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> fantastic<00:02:22.140> job<00:02:22.620> there<00:02:23.519> to

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
think they did a fantastic job there to

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.390 
think they did a fantastic job there to
have<00:02:24.269> a<00:02:24.299> good<00:02:24.450> combination<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.319> flexibility

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
have a good combination of flexibility

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.020 
have a good combination of flexibility
and<00:02:26.670> good<00:02:27.540> protection<00:02:28.159> the<00:02:29.159> shoe<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.849> white

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
and good protection the shoe the white

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.240 
and good protection the shoe the white
footbed<00:02:30.599> we've<00:02:31.200> mentioned<00:02:31.439> actually<00:02:31.980> really

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
footbed we've mentioned actually really

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.970 
footbed we've mentioned actually really
allows<00:02:32.579> you<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:32.849> use<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:34.019> entire<00:02:34.319> width<00:02:34.680> of

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
allows you to use the entire width of

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.399 
allows you to use the entire width of
your<00:02:35.040> foot<00:02:35.640> which<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.689> really<00:02:36.930> important

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
your foot which is really important

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.899 
your foot which is really important
especially<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.069> minimalist<00:02:38.549> running

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
especially in the minimalist running

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.030 
especially in the minimalist running
because<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.629> helps<00:02:40.079> you<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.260> absorb<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:41.010> shock

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
because it helps you to absorb the shock

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.300 
because it helps you to absorb the shock
on<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.510> entire<00:02:43.019> width<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.379> your<00:02:43.560> foot<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:43.980> it

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
on the entire width of your foot and it

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.970 
on the entire width of your foot and it
helps<00:02:44.579> you<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.760> push<00:02:44.970> off<00:02:45.180> better<00:02:45.480> so

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
helps you to push off better so

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.809 
helps you to push off better so
therefore<00:02:46.980> making<00:02:47.250> for<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.489> much<00:02:47.760> more

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
therefore making for a much more

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.899 
therefore making for a much more
efficient<00:02:48.659> stride<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.980> that's<00:02:50.400> another<00:02:50.640> plus

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
efficient stride so that's another plus

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.000 
efficient stride so that's another plus
