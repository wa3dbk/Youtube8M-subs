00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.030
 Young Ajax does the good product on even 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.519
 the best of all young teams better 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.740
 still than twente and young psv 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.150
 Amsterdammers also play excellent on the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.770
 future 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.480
 ten times a victory was achieved 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.570
 of which seven times a home match 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.090
 but this is after five minutes 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 swim that broke his first chance 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.320
 judged looks boermans 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.820
 the keeper of young ajax can be two 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.739
 authorities swim vomiting 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.269
 that ball then rises above the goalkeeper and 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.510
 the zero one 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.280
 on the scoreboard brings for mvv 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.620
 handy to be there direct 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.839
 opponent of Brugge plays 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.390
 first the inhibition of mouse and then 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.670
 later there is no stopping 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.760
 young ajax that it tries ajax that one 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.559
 Good week knows the great men of Ajax 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.199
 who have the next round of the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.739
 Europa Cup tournament reached and Frank de 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.379
 farmer 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.330
 announced today that it will also follow 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.030
 season is the head coach of the 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.010
 Amsterdammers therefore these young talents 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.359
 know where they stand in the coming season 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.079
 to be 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:15.570
 here again vomiting that yields there and 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:19.380
 then it is ultimately the ball that comes with it 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.469
 care that comes and then the belgian has none 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.600
 problems with this opportunity 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.340
 jordy croux with his second goal in 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.780
 the jupiler league 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.859
 it is the twelfth minute of the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.320
 contest 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:34.320
 the defense of ajax played apart 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.619
 and so cool with the 0 2 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.320
 for mvv and that for number 18 de om 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.649
 Ali stinks your tuber and two minutes 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.799
 later for tower with the 0 3 it must 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.539
 don't get crazier in Amsterdam 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.569
 cnops the defender with the all 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.179
 everyone has it checked and nobody 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:58.679
 stands for tower for news and therefore the 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:02.100
 0 3 buttons with the shot from distance and 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.200
 what a wanted for mvv that it 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.939
 not doing so well at all six 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.869
 won competitions in this 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.160
 League 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.080
 of which the only two away matches 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.510
 were found 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.480
 sam hendriks with an attempt but also that 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.879
 attempt goes beyond the purpose of and ww 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.980
 goalkeeper hobby 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.140
 in the second half than the possession of the ball 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.930
 ajax with many 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.480
 to the outside it is muric and then 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.799
 the cross that eventually disappears 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.870
 purchased from mvv and therefore no chance 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.469
 for the Amsterdammers 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.670
 the ball than for peeters who 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:44.549
 gives to brewers and davy brewers 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.629
 who loses the shot but mouse the goalkeeper 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.879
 from young ajax 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.590
 does not embarrass you then 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.959
 spork carriage 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.959
 sporksled to muric the ball arrives 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.930
 many many but it depends too much 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.370
 back so that the ball goes up it 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.030
 so not towards the goal of hobie 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.510
 concealed 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.019
 the young mvv goalkeeper 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.060
 ajax again that it is trying with muric 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.650
 then the ball is at the feet of not 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.049
 acolatse 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.840
 but it also becomes one there 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.359
 another ajacied shot in and also 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.739
 blocked again 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.079
 is this the great opportunity for the 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.769
 Amsterdammers with hot ones then too 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.569
 warmer then the ball does not get on goal 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.639
 a young ajax actually runs 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.620
 constantly chasing the facts 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.079
 django hot and then when the ball comes on 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.090
 This seems like a purple that nowhere 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.769
 finally comes for the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.409
 feet of acolatse 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.750
 but he is also aiming too high elton 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.180
 acolatse accounted for five goals 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.609
 now in the jupiler league 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.009
 but not tonight and we have cattle 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.729
 then again with davy brewers brewers 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:57.180
 tries it and then almost behind goalkeeper 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:59.069
 mouse the first hit wants brewers who 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.299
 is the top scorer with nine goals 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.299
 from mvv 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.659
 Amsterdam Acolatse tries it tries 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.449
 bypass his direct opponent 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.569
 mustafa then already blow them with the cross and 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:19.799
 the goal is still the 90th minute 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:22.770
 milan vision can and then make and is the 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.070
 Amsterdam honor then saved Milan 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.840
 vision of the acolatse cross but and 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.690
 vv 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.960
 just find out about the future with a counter 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.960
