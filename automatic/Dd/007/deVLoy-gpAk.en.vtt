00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.020 

now<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.270> idea<00:01:38.659> of<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:39.380> caro-kann<00:01:40.040> defence

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
now the idea of the caro-kann defence

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.030 
now the idea of the caro-kann defence
for<00:01:41.270> black<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:41.990> allow<00:01:42.229> this<00:01:42.440> bishop<00:01:42.860> to

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
for black is to allow this bishop to

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.280 
for black is to allow this bishop to
develop<00:01:43.460> on<00:01:43.750> this<00:01:44.750> diagonal<00:01:46.479> easily<00:01:47.479> in<00:01:47.690> other

Carroll Kahn is to allow black to
develop<00:02:06.440> this<00:02:06.619> bishop<00:02:08.050> before<00:02:09.050> having<00:02:09.380> to

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
develop this bishop before having to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
moving his Knight to f3 now black would

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.310 
moving his Knight to f3 now black would
be<00:02:23.540> able<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.019> move<00:02:24.530> his<00:02:24.769> Bishop<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.700> g4<00:02:27.280> as<00:02:29.320> it
