00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
but with that said let's go ahead and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.270 
but with that said let's go ahead and
jump<00:00:48.450> straight<00:00:48.780> into<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.500> class<00:00:49.710> setup<00:00:50.070> guys

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
jump straight into the class setup guys

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.220 
jump straight into the class setup guys
so<00:00:50.610> obviously<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.449> weapon<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:51.840> are<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.110> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
so obviously the weapon we are going to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.790 
so obviously the weapon we are going to
be<00:00:52.320> using<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.780> stg44<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
be using is going to be the stg44 it's a

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.410 
be using is going to be the stg44 it's a
good<00:00:56.070> weapon<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.820> also<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> those

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
good weapon but it's also one of those

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
good weapon but it's also one of those
weapons<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:57.989> make<00:00:58.350> even<00:00:58.739> better<00:00:58.949> if

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
weapons that you can make even better if

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.400 
weapons that you can make even better if
the<00:00:59.670> proper<00:01:00.149> class<00:01:00.449> setup<00:01:00.870> now<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the proper class setup now the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.900 
the proper class setup now the
attachments<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.160> recommend<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.789> this

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
attachments that I do recommend for this

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.030 
attachments that I do recommend for this
weapon<00:01:03.059> are<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> stock<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.799> red

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
weapon are going to be the stock the red

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.370 
weapon are going to be the stock the red
dot<00:01:05.250> sight<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> foregrip<00:01:06.390> obviously<00:01:07.290> we

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
dot sight and the foregrip obviously we

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.899 
dot sight and the foregrip obviously we
already<00:01:07.650> know<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> foregrip<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> stock

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
already know the foregrip and the stock

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
already know the foregrip and the stock
for<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.450> obvious<00:01:09.840> reasons<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.350> assault

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
for the obvious reasons with assault

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.230 
for the obvious reasons with assault
rifles<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.189> want<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.580> able<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> straight

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
rifles you want to be able to straight

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.420 
rifles you want to be able to straight
faster<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.930> obviously<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.740> STG<00:01:14.220> has<00:01:14.400> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
faster and obviously the STG has a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.640 
faster and obviously the STG has a
little<00:01:14.880> bit<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.090> recoil<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.840> not<00:01:16.080> terrible

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
little bit of recoil it's not terrible

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.560 
little bit of recoil it's not terrible
but<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.369> very<00:01:17.460> visible<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.420> is

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
but it's there it's very visible this is

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.789 
but it's there it's very visible this is
actually<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> first<00:01:19.380> time<00:01:19.650> that

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
actually going to be the first time that

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.039 
actually going to be the first time that
I<00:01:19.860> recommend<00:01:20.340> using<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:21.000> red<00:01:21.299> dot<00:01:21.509> sight<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
I recommend using a red dot sight and

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
I recommend using a red dot sight and
the<00:01:22.140> big<00:01:22.290> reason<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.220> small<00:01:23.759> iron

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the big reason is that the small iron

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.929 
the big reason is that the small iron
sights<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> stg44<00:01:25.500> has<00:01:25.979> are<00:01:26.189> very<00:01:26.580> hard

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
sights that the stg44 has are very hard

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.190 
sights that the stg44 has are very hard
to<00:01:27.060> deal<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.600> you're<00:01:27.780> shooting<00:01:28.110> at

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
to deal with like you're shooting at

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.780 
to deal with like you're shooting at
someone<00:01:28.439> next<00:01:29.009> thing<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.460> can't

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
someone next thing you know you can't

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.069 
someone next thing you know you can't
see<00:01:30.000> them<00:01:30.119> anymore<00:01:30.270> you're<00:01:30.540> shooting<00:01:30.869> into

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
see them anymore you're shooting into

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.530 
see them anymore you're shooting into
empty<00:01:31.380> space<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.950> want<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.820> use<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> red<00:01:33.329> dot

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
empty space you want to use the red dot

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.789 
empty space you want to use the red dot
