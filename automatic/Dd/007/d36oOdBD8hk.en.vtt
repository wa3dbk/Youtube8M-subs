flashing<00:03:21.090> protect<00:03:21.750> from<00:03:21.959> range<00:03:22.790> because<00:03:25.639> they

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
flashing protect from range because they

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.490 
flashing protect from range because they
will<00:03:26.850> hit<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.269> pretty<00:03:27.299> often<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.290> it's

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
usually around 10 10 to 14 damage so you

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.750 
usually around 10 10 to 14 damage so you
got<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.209> be<00:03:33.299> careful<00:03:33.480> if<00:03:33.810> these<00:03:33.989> guys<00:03:34.760> don't

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760
