00:00:00.102 --> 00:00:03.769
(The Boat Show theme music)

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.290
(dance music)

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.040
(In Italian language)

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.990
- [Translator] There are
only a few cities that know

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.530
how to provide the pleasures of life.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.690
This is Miami, in all its splendor,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.020
and this is the right boat to drive

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.253
in place like this: the Wider 42.

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:30.025
(dance music)

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.250
This boat has two important advantages:

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.430
70% of it is made of carbon

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.390
and 30% of traditional fiberglass,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.963
and this makes it very robust and light.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.410
The other advantage that
also helped to save on weight

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.030
is that it was built using
a vacuum lamination process.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.140
This eliminates all the problems related

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.940
to manual lamination, and
you end up with a result

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.400
that is very compact and resistant,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.142
and at the same time, very light.

00:01:08.142 --> 00:01:10.642
(dance music)

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.920
There are other elements
that are important

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.770
to the performance of this boat.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.890
For example, the stepped hull
at the aft section of the boat

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.160
that allows air to ventilate the hull,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.960
allowing the boat to slide
along a cushion of air

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.780
that reduces resistance with the water.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.780
Then there's the surface propulsion system

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.010
that also helps to reduce resistance,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.300
and the boost in
efficiency allows the boat,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.660
which is powered by two
engines of 480 horsepower,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.970
to reach a higher
performance when compared

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.329
with boats that are equipped
with a different transmission.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.570
(dance music)

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.980
The design is very original
and includes mobile sidewalls

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.700
that extend outwards on the
water, increasing the size

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.673
of the deck and the stability
of the hull when moored.

00:01:55.634 --> 00:01:58.217
(techno music)

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.450
Underneath the sunbed at the
bow is a cabin with sofas

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.133
and a table that transform
into a double bed.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.697
The bathroom and galley are
very modern and elegant.

00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:15.270
(techno music)

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.130
It's possible to choose between
two different configurations

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.710
for the bow: one to house a jet ski,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.310
the other with a sunbed and
a hanger for the tender.

00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:27.338
(funk music)

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.730
In the center of the
steering wheel is a display

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.610
that shows you the primary
functions of the boat,

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.750
especially its technical equipment.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.970
It shows you the flap
indicators, the trim indicators,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.760
the fuel gauge, and two very
important figures to follow.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.440
They're the load
percentages of both engines,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.980
and it's important that these values

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.350
are as close to each other as possible,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.480
because only this way can we achieve

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.780
that maximum efficiency.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.197
(funk music)

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.890
We're in America, but the
velocity of this Italian boat

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.710
has been set in knots.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.050
I would say that this is the
most correct method to use.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.220
I still don't understand
why the Anglo-Saxons

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.740
continue to use land measurements at sea:

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.700
miles, which they also use in races.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.310
Personally, I always prefer
using the nautical mile,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.423
which corresponds to one sixtieth
of one latitudinal degree.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.830
One of the most interesting
and important characteristics

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.510
of this boat is the
position of the engines.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.690
They are staggered, which
means they are placed

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.770
one in front of the other so
that the transmission axes

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.510
can be very close together,

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.730
and the propellers
almost touch each other,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.230
to create a single center of thrust.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.771
This enhances the performance.

00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:53.354
(techno music)

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.550
They say that boats with
surface propulsion systems

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.680
are very difficult to use, but
this is not necessarily true.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.960
I've set the flaps and the trim
tabs in a neutral position,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.880
at zero, as though they weren't there.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.870
Let's see what happens

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.833
when I suddenly increase the throttle.

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:16.587
(engine whirring)

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.370
There's no problem.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.370
The boat starts planing relatively easily.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.210
Of course, with a steering
wheel this advanced,

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.080
we can completely change
the departure settings,

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.120
and become true pilots.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.020
This is how it works:

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.540
first, bring the flaps
into a lower position.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.200
You just need to press a
button that controls them both.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.310
Then we'll do the same thing

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.563
with the surface propulsion
system, and lower the trim tabs.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.270
With these simple adjustments,

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.350
we will definitely have a
more aggressive departure.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.950
Let's try it.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.450
(dance music)

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.480
That's enough now, I'm
tired of going slowly.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.503
More throttle!

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.463
With this Formula 1 steering
wheel, it's a lot of fun.

00:05:10.463 --> 00:05:12.963
(dance music)

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.070
48.8 knots, 49 knots--

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.250
Remember: this is not miles
an hour, this is knots.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.674
This is the maximum speed of the Wider 42.

00:05:29.674 --> 00:05:32.257
(techno music)

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.130
Tilli Antonelli could not have come up

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.860
with a more original boat,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.810
Fulvio De Simoni could not have designed

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.160
a more functional boat, and Mark Wilson

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.990
could not have developed
a better set-up than this.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.930
However, is Wider capable
of producing something

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.680
even more spectacular?

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.490
An even larger boat,
maybe even 150-foot long?

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.881
We'll see.

00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:59.464
(techno music)

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.837
