00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.710
 control of drumsticks the very important thing what is to study matter the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.219
 another is independence 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.320
 it's two hours with two things that are not too far apart 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.009
 they do as separate subjects but they are always 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.529
 mixed there are many people assimilate him with him on the side of the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.560
 rudiments and what it is to make cuts or ugly things like 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.270
 apart from the tyrant 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.270
 and the other topic good independence of playing rhythms 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.380
 efe 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.900
 as this hand is independent of this one asks to go this foot is doing another 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.910
 independent thing but nevertheless 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.250
 Canada counts later if they become like ice 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.899
 quite this exercise the text eva that is here 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.519
 in the year it is precisely 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.679
 well everywhere really and good at the end of this video let's see 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.540
 also how to control the pedals but how to control all these 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:09.750
 drums and we do not know how to control only one of them the important sky 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.200
 learn first of that 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.230
 and that is done through this tool the stick 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.200
 so 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.020
 do not talk a little about it before 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.609
 i the good model and incinerate it in the vast majority are made of a wood 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.320
 that much here 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.539
 keselj and colin united states are also for the curbs 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:27.730
 the very well 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.420
 and handling 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.310
 in the other one who general is used is maple also and the other way that 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.830
 only one brand cnc materials henán oaks 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.190
 in English the ea sport and that is the mark promarca we go but it does not do these 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.980
 drumsticks 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.640
 to mariner the longer the stick is because the taller people and between 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.990
 in mass to mcqueen the good person is short if he is a child because the drumstick is 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.729
 more short 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.970
 it is not a recent rule to follow as the golden rule everything is worth not of the 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.590
 music is the really 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.300
 the golden rule everything is valid in music if there is a tall person who 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.170
 like model cuts everything well i 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.670
 there really is nothing that is correct or not correct today in correct 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.170
 to use 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.929
 to the drumstick depends on the min the use that is going to give 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.330
 then they did not show 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.129
 here for example we have timbale drumsticks 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.419
 in homs they do not change thickness anywhere and they are welcome because good 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.710
 part timbal well thin and good 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.039
 adam 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:30.250
 resonant 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.930
 it has quite the metallic sound the end 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.759
 in front of this sum that you that the orchestra of majors 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:41.149
 I have designed for him and he has a tip as in his advances in them 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:44.909
 more or less does not have as much cut here adam to the edge 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.540
 we have packages that we are looking at is how they are used to march 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.169
 kill we have also things like a few bonuses 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:01.599
 per cent they became very popular good with points of interest 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.509
 we will make one so strong 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:08.629
 and this is not good meeting bad guys that break up as easy they will go was that you 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.099
 wait and special from other materials do not fear example at that time but yes 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.579
 I have a model that has been made 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.689
 that's not bad that the selection yen 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.040
 It is a model and they love country to go 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.310
 it's so he does not live 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.770
 when we play in total it will suppose you had electronic was that has you 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.299
 here a part 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.599
 d every eight they opened 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.970
 a gap more or less here and here and filled it with rubber 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.010
 and that's for 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.750
 When we push the fork on a hard surface, they will realize that 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.979
 Let's feel like a tingling in Latin the flame of the fingers 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.300
 that tingling 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.250
 this is an aggression that is not on the sidewalk and does not really happen when 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.920
 we play 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.030
 in one part 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.520
 but when we play on a strong surface for example like state 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:54.009
 if you feel that vibration and well I was quiet for ciarán I know not 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.269
 happen 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.879
 very special to be here 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.879
 but well let's see how it gets caught 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.029
 and how to close people is very important 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.029
 let's start by vera 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.999
 the grip with these two fingers environment the main ones of the war are these 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:10.680
 two fingers 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.540
 let's see this 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.810
 they do not have three sections about 2 and 3 and usually the appointment is here between 1 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.749
 and 2 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:20.849
 or if the more or less interests of their places 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:25.309
 the drumstick work we touch it with the big toe and prose moss the fingerprint 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:28.569
 the fingerprint always touches the stick 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.189
 touching it this way if we do this sideways washington we really lose him 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.490
 the control to which talavante that this war because these two fingers 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.230
 in the other three in mind 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.750
 rest they were going to help later to promote the pietá if we see it from 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.379
 this angle 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:47.490
 really lagarde are these two fingers 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.689
 in Port 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:50.050
 others give it 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.409
 sometimes the three 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:52.740
 sometimes only two 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.740
 hodges even just one 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.740
 can give the impulse 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.740
 in a session more or less the diesel to give 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.560
 when it comes to detecting the ramrod we will see what 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.919
 there is less grip than a given moment they change 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.259
 and let's see with conce con toca a little right some people recognize this way 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.559
 to grab the racket and to play like French 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:18.620
 the people who play in this way 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.029
 as german 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.090
 internally 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.200
 Well, better than the other one, it's really good, because to master both 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.800
 for instances where 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.220
 good touch the fork with the pressure to caruso in mind is going to have 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.599
 a kind of a space here 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.289
 but the moment that we are going to do a new section know in this same year 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.240
 It's like the one in 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.390
 the anssi which they announced circus at that time we are going to do for 2012 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:45.849
 then rossi yamaha 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.889
 let's grab the racket with a little bit of d 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.500
 - space to those who rather closed 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.470
 right now he showed later how it happens to grip and good too 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.789
 we have the other one to see what this is 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.240
 the pay 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.830
 traditional the traditional network 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.419
 per hundred really happens it's by necessity the drums that is 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.940
 they are loading for marks that fall from the side 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.940
 and well you have to have this kind of tilt cough that's why it's called 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.189
 traditional to maintain that tradition 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.990
 and good 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.860
 there is not one better than the other 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.990
 none of those two holds 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.110
 percent 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.369
 as the other than the standard 

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:29.279
 the standard grip of the good stick is more logical and I say no 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:32.599
 be more used but as I tell people who play traditional they do 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.590
 very well and the drummers more 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.910
 best of the best drummers that at this moment the world 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.320
 they touch with this form 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.700
 so there's no better way or worse it's really a matter of taste and how 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.610
 it happened to each of you suddenly you entered by the side of the 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.599
 March also and then to the battery and I kept on this kind of technique 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.180
 anyone is very good
