00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
really close but I was surprised at the

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.599 
really close but I was surprised at the
the<00:01:29.109> little<00:01:29.289> amount<00:01:29.619> of<00:01:29.799> hit<00:01:29.979> markers<00:01:30.369> that<00:01:30.579> I

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609 
the little amount of hit markers that I

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:32.010 
the little amount of hit markers that I
had<00:01:30.789> been<00:01:30.969> getting<00:01:31.299> throughout<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:31.780> game

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
had been getting throughout this game

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.349 
had been getting throughout this game
usually<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.590> began<00:01:32.979> like<00:01:33.340> I<00:01:33.640> won<00:01:34.090> every<00:01:34.329> single

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
usually I began like I won every single

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.029 
usually I began like I won every single
time<00:01:34.840> but<00:01:35.079> I<00:01:35.170> was<00:01:35.289> actually<00:01:35.469> doing<00:01:35.770> pretty

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
time but I was actually doing pretty

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.529 
time but I was actually doing pretty
good<00:01:36.249> with<00:01:36.429> the<00:01:36.549> hit<00:01:36.670> markers<00:01:37.060> on<00:01:37.179> this<00:01:37.299> match

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
good with the hit markers on this match

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.039 
good with the hit markers on this match
so<00:01:37.780> I<00:01:37.869> was<00:01:38.020> pretty<00:01:38.229> pretty<00:01:39.009> satisfied<00:01:39.670> but<00:01:40.450> as

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
so I was pretty pretty satisfied but as

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.260 
so I was pretty pretty satisfied but as
you<00:01:41.259> can<00:01:41.380> see<00:01:41.439> I'm<00:01:41.710> using<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:42.130> MSR<00:01:42.670> it<00:01:42.969> was

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
you can see I'm using the MSR it was

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.989 
you can see I'm using the MSR it was
like<00:01:43.570> my<00:01:43.719> second<00:01:44.200> game<00:01:44.350> with<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.710> so<00:01:45.100> there's

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:45.999 
like my second game with it so there's

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:48.029 
like my second game with it so there's
nothing<00:01:46.179> too<00:01:46.479> fancy<00:01:46.689> on<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.170> no<00:01:47.320> extended<00:01:47.710> mags

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.630 
nothing too fancy on it no extended mags
no<00:01:48.780> no<00:01:49.780> what<00:01:50.259> is<00:01:50.289> it<00:01:50.409> variable<00:01:50.979> scope<00:01:51.280> which

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640
