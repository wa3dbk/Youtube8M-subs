this<00:02:03.369> nice<00:02:03.989> crystal<00:02:04.989> water<00:02:05.200> earlier<00:02:05.709> I<00:02:07.170> gone

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
this nice crystal water earlier I gone

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.640 
this nice crystal water earlier I gone
overboard<00:02:08.560> on<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.069> filtration<00:02:09.459> system<00:02:10.030> and

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
overboard on the filtration system and

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.509 
overboard on the filtration system and
this<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.860> due<00:02:12.129> to<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.489> water<00:02:13.420> dragons<00:02:14.040> they<00:02:15.040> a

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
this is due to the water dragons they a

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.100 
this is due to the water dragons they a
love<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.540> defecate<00:02:16.810> into<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.410> water<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:19.110> with

love to defecate into the water and with

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.830 
love to defecate into the water and with
a<00:02:20.140> less<00:02:20.769> worse<00:02:21.209> filtration<00:02:22.209> system<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.720> goes

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
a less worse filtration system it goes

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.250 
a less worse filtration system it goes
very<00:02:23.200> murky<00:02:23.620> very<00:02:23.829> day<00:02:24.010> really<00:02:24.340> quick<00:02:25.260> it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
very murky very day really quick it

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.390 
very murky very day really quick it
doesn't<00:02:26.530> look<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:26.769> good<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:30.780> back<00:02:31.780> here<00:02:32.049> I

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
doesn't look so good and back here I

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.379 
doesn't look so good and back here I
built<00:02:33.400> them<00:02:33.489> in<00:02:33.609> a<00:02:33.639> shelf<00:02:38.700> give<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> small<00:02:40.120> area

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.389 
built them in a shelf give a small area

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.509 
built them in a shelf give a small area
rounder<00:02:40.810> here<00:02:41.079> so<00:02:41.500> they<00:02:41.709> do<00:02:41.769> decide<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.430> go

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
rounder here so they do decide to go

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.580 
rounder here so they do decide to go
under<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:42.940> back<00:02:43.120> there<00:02:43.359> you<00:02:44.290> know<00:02:44.410> they're

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
under the back there you know they're

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.530 
under the back there you know they're
not<00:02:44.680> going<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:44.889> gonna<00:02:45.700> harm<00:02:45.940> themselves<00:02:46.180> but

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
not going to gonna harm themselves but

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.120 
not going to gonna harm themselves but
they<00:02:46.660> they<00:02:47.650> tend<00:02:47.859> to<00:02:48.069> just<00:02:48.519> dip<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.030> front

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
they they tend to just dip in the front

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.379 
they they tend to just dip in the front
how<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.190> small<00:02:51.519> swim<00:02:51.760> up<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:51.910> front<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.329> the

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
how the small swim up the front of the

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.420 
how the small swim up the front of the
glass<00:02:52.599> and<00:02:53.669> tend<00:02:54.669> to<00:02:54.730> climb<00:02:54.970> up<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:56.430> connect

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
glass and tend to climb up I connect

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.400 
glass and tend to climb up I connect
with<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:57.639> idea<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.299> thing<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.139> front

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
with this idea the thing that the front

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.789 
with this idea the thing that the front
goes<00:02:59.680> like<00:02:59.919> war<00:03:00.370> dragons<00:03:00.989> they<00:03:01.989> tend<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.620> get<00:03:02.769> a

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
goes like war dragons they tend to get a

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.830 
goes like war dragons they tend to get a
problem<00:03:03.609> with<00:03:03.880> rubbing<00:03:04.510> up<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:04.720> down

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
problem with rubbing up and down

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.339 
problem with rubbing up and down
advanced<00:03:05.169> I<00:03:05.470> thought<00:03:05.680> well<00:03:06.459> if<00:03:06.549> I<00:03:06.639> remove<00:03:06.940> the

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
advanced I thought well if I remove the

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.839 
advanced I thought well if I remove the
barrier<00:03:08.349> put<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.709> barrier<00:03:08.980> between<00:03:09.130> them<00:03:09.669> and

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
barrier put a barrier between them and

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.870 
barrier put a barrier between them and
the<00:03:10.000> front<00:03:10.389> glass<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.930> know<00:03:11.049> yeah<00:03:11.880> should

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
the front glass you know yeah should

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.990 
the front glass you know yeah should
reduce<00:03:13.750> that

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.850 

got<00:03:21.000> some<00:03:21.210> rice<00:03:21.390> down<00:03:21.810> lighting<00:03:23.450> LEDs<00:03:24.450> just

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
got some rice down lighting LEDs just

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.130 
got some rice down lighting LEDs just
for<00:03:25.860> show<00:03:28.640> 5.0<00:03:29.640> strip<00:03:30.060> light<00:03:30.270> for<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.840> bottom

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
for show 5.0 strip light for the bottom

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.700 
for show 5.0 strip light for the bottom
of<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.380> kanaky<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.840> found<00:03:34.080> I<00:03:34.290> had<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.530> put<00:03:34.680> a

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
of the kanaky and I found I had to put a

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.360 
of the kanaky and I found I had to put a
