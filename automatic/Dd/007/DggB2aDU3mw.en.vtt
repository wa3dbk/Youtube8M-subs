00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.090 
what I do is I'm going to create a
shorter<00:01:57.960> look<00:01:58.170> throughout<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.560> sides<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
shorter look throughout the sides and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.010 
shorter look throughout the sides and
the<00:01:59.880> top<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.329> you're<00:02:00.420> probably<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.930> end

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the top and you're probably going to end

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.060 
the top and you're probably going to end
up<00:02:01.079> looking<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.409> me<00:02:01.710> when<00:02:01.860> we're<00:02:01.979> done

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
up looking like me when we're done

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.660 
up looking like me when we're done
that's<00:02:02.729> all<00:02:02.909> good

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
that's all good

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.399 
that's all good
I'm<00:02:05.090> kidding<00:02:05.450> I'm<00:02:05.509> kidding<00:02:05.960> now<00:02:06.170> we're<00:02:06.320> gonna

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
I'm kidding I'm kidding now we're gonna

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.570 
I'm kidding I'm kidding now we're gonna
we're<00:02:06.650> gonna<00:02:06.740> have<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:06.890> lot<00:02:07.009> of<00:02:07.040> fun<00:02:07.250> take<00:02:07.460> up

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
we're gonna have a lot of fun take up

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.680 
we're gonna have a lot of fun take up
sound<00:02:07.759> short<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.209> leave<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.330> little<00:02:08.539> bit<00:02:08.630> of

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
sound short and leave a little bit of

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.150 
sound short and leave a little bit of
length<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:09.020> through<00:02:09.170> here<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:09.560> make<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:10.039> nice

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
length in through here and make it nice

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.010 
length in through here and make it nice
and<00:02:10.190> full<00:02:10.489> going<00:02:10.789> back<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.150> way<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:11.360> I'm

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
and full going back this way so I'm

00:02:12.020 --> 00:03:01.960 
and full going back this way so I'm
ready<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.349> go<00:02:12.470> ready<00:02:12.890> all<00:02:13.610> right

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:04:21.090 

you

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.870 

okay<00:04:22.100> so<00:04:22.160> we're<00:04:22.340> going<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.490> do<00:04:22.580> is<00:04:22.670> want<00:04:22.790> to

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
okay so we're going to do is want to

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.340 
okay so we're going to do is want to
break<00:04:23.000> down<00:04:23.030> what<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.480> did<00:04:23.630> on<00:04:23.660> Wanda's<00:04:24.140> hair

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
break down what it did on Wanda's hair

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.940 
break down what it did on Wanda's hair
so<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:24.980> used<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:26.020> number<00:04:27.020> three<00:04:27.320> guard<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:27.860> then

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
so I used a number three guard and then

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.590 
so I used a number three guard and then
in<00:04:28.070> three<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.460> three-quarter<00:04:28.850> guard<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.300> the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
in three and three-quarter guard and the

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.530 
in three and three-quarter guard and the
back<00:04:29.780> all<00:04:30.140> the<00:04:30.410> way<00:04:30.500> on<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.860> sides<00:04:31.480> both<00:04:32.480> sides

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
back all the way on the sides both sides

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.960 
back all the way on the sides both sides
here<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:33.260> then<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:33.770> blend<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.190> in<00:04:34.280> by<00:04:34.490> hand

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
here and then I blend it in by hand

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.180 
here and then I blend it in by hand
doing<00:04:35.330> scissor<00:04:35.690> over<00:04:35.720> comb<00:04:35.870> up<00:04:36.620> into<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:36.980> top

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
doing scissor over comb up into the top

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.220 
doing scissor over comb up into the top
so<00:04:38.030> where<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.210> top<00:04:38.390> is<00:04:38.420> probably<00:04:38.750> about<00:04:38.930> I'd

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
so where the top is probably about I'd

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.930 
so where the top is probably about I'd
say<00:04:39.260> two<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.710> half<00:04:39.830> inches<00:04:40.130> in<00:04:40.280> length<00:04:40.460> and

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
say two and a half inches in length and

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.430 
say two and a half inches in length and
then<00:04:41.030> we<00:04:41.120> work<00:04:41.330> it<00:04:41.480> gradually<00:04:41.750> longer<00:04:42.140> towards

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
then we work it gradually longer towards

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.080 
then we work it gradually longer towards
about<00:04:42.620> three<00:04:42.980> and<00:04:43.070> a<00:04:43.130> half<00:04:43.250> or<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:43.520> inches<00:04:43.880> in

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
about three and a half or so inches in

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.490 
about three and a half or so inches in
length<00:04:44.540> right<00:04:44.810> throughout<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.140> front

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
length right throughout the front

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.680 
length right throughout the front
I<00:04:45.590> did<00:04:46.070> some<00:04:46.190> texturizing<00:04:46.700> and<00:04:47.000> then<00:04:47.150> used<00:04:47.480> a

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
I did some texturizing and then used a

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.900 
I did some texturizing and then used a
sea<00:04:48.440> salt<00:04:48.650> volumizing<00:04:49.340> spray<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.610> get<00:04:49.760> some

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
sea salt volumizing spray to get some

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.420 
sea salt volumizing spray to get some
volume<00:04:50.150> in<00:04:50.300> there<00:04:50.420> and<00:04:50.630> if<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:50.840> maizing<00:04:51.170> mousse

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
volume in there and if I maizing mousse

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.300 
volume in there and if I maizing mousse
blow-dried<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:52.730> then<00:04:52.970> I<00:04:53.300> used<00:04:54.260> a<00:04:54.530> beeswax

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
blow-dried it and then I used a beeswax

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.800 
blow-dried it and then I used a beeswax
paste<00:04:55.640> take<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.090> with<00:04:56.180> some<00:04:56.300> texture<00:04:56.690> and

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
paste take you with some texture and

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.960 
paste take you with some texture and
this<00:04:57.620> is<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.920> end<00:04:58.100> results<00:04:58.520> I<00:04:58.640> think<00:04:58.670> it's

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
this is the end results I think it's

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.870 
this is the end results I think it's
really<00:04:59.150> cool<00:04:59.480> really<00:05:00.020> trendy<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:00.880> hopefully

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
really cool really trendy and hopefully

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.010 
really cool really trendy and hopefully
we're<00:05:01.970> going<00:05:02.000> to<00:05:02.150> be<00:05:02.210> seeing<00:05:02.450> more<00:05:02.570> of<00:05:02.780> these
