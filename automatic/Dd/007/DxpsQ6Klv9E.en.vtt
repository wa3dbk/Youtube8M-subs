on<00:00:54.329> quite<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> bit<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.350> kind<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.590> looks

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
on quite a bit it just kind of looks

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.200 
on quite a bit it just kind of looks
like<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.610> comes<00:00:56.789> off<00:00:56.969> pretty

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
like it is but it comes off pretty

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.950 
like it is but it comes off pretty
easily<00:00:59.149> but<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.390> an<00:01:00.449> 86<00:01:00.739> c10<00:01:02.149> it<00:01:03.149> runs

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
easily but it's an 86 c10 it runs

excellence got the original radio and
was<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.540> worth<00:01:06.659> some<00:01:06.810> big<00:01:06.960> bucks<00:01:07.020> once<00:01:07.470> I

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
was just worth some big bucks once I

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.240 
was just worth some big bucks once I
figure<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.100> how<00:01:08.369> I'm<00:01:08.460> gonna<00:01:10.040> or<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.159> I'm

but<00:01:47.549> uh<00:01:47.610> that's<00:01:48.479> one<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> first<00:01:48.990> things<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
but uh that's one of the first things to

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.530 
but uh that's one of the first things to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
thousand miles on it it's actually got

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.639 
thousand miles on it it's actually got
less<00:01:59.460> miles<00:01:59.759> than<00:02:00.090> my<00:02:00.240> my<00:02:00.899> Aston<00:02:01.259> up<00:02:01.439> there

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
less miles than my my Aston up there

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.920 
less miles than my my Aston up there
only<00:02:02.610> by<00:02:02.729> about<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.060> hundred<00:02:03.240> well<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.750> guess

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
only by about a hundred well I guess
