00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.539
 The tailoring of the Passion Theater 13 dressmakers have been working here for nine years 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.749
 Months on the costumes for the Oberammergau Passion Play 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.010
 a large part of which are made to order 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.330
 patterns 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.670
 Angelika Kirchschlager works otherwise in a fashion house 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.970
 but now she sits half-day here at the machine for a small one 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.190
 expense allowance 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.000
 Nordex I'm already a kindergarten with him as a kid, so he's right in the middle of it 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.610
 the passion and bathing 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.420
 exactly at the partner dies then always or in the meantime is then but goes 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.360
 he only one point but it's just the population long 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.030
 with beds available 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.120
 with market values 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.120
 it is somehow level with the whole place 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.600
 that's the beautiful thing about the passion 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.840
 This time, not a singer from the short trip for the first time raised her 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.840
 costume 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.320
 that's just one of more than 1000 700 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.350
 with presentation of the Custom Builder they were new for the 2010 Passion Play 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.350
 sounds 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.000
 because of the cost, Opel would hang around 600 robes for the people 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.580
 so far, everything is going according to plan 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.030
 but Angelika Tischler still remembers the last passion in 2000 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.030
 when a seamstress turned out at short notice 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.130
 Lammer Banzer has to work through 24 hours bobber 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.720
 Penzer is quite funny but as very exhausting but in the ship tells 30 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.279
 thanks to the nova is only the after 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.519
 and it was like that 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.889
 and that's why so much work 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:18.730
 many hours 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.939
 we show that banks have their own plans and available 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.009
 Leifeld and men and children 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.009
 Science is the one suffering from the power 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.999
 on stage rehearsals 50 stage helpers opening and rebuilding the individual 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:35.999
 scenery 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.939
 in the middle Carsten Lück the technical director of the passion plays 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.549
 He is responsible for the 23 different sets 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.180
 usually only a few minutes remain for the conversion between the scenes 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:56.189
 the preparations for the stage construction began almost a year ago 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.769
 an almost magical moment for carpenter Carsten Lück 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.349
 this is how everything is back from the hose to mountains of ten years 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.650
 nothing happens to me 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.600
 And then not only does the new stage design has to mean the next whole stage 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.740
 they are looking what's new technique in the background what needs to be done 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.020
 you have to make a word on big and then it is for display mushroom itself 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.770
 Of course, as I said before, they are first photos with CCS models 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.080
 It is possible to build everything in such a way that later on it will be practicable 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.729
 said Blümel threw the two try to mildly in Spyker 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.579
 Plau and Campari with supervisor Elke Karell on her performance 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:35.409
 The two camels are the only ones with players who are not from Oberammergau 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.409
 come 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:45.979
 For all people she thought she must have been born in the South Bavarian town 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.979
 or live here for at least 20 years 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.619
 Call Tel Kerner the amateur actors a few more 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:55.619
 practical tips for dealing with animals 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:58.830
 what can you do not feel like doing 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.719
 after returning to the claws of the litigation linen 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.389
 and tears once you set the pace for you also feel like shopping too 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.049
 Fun in the team gets attention first, so they are 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.049
 because the Billy goats 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.910
 Franks doing so during the rehearsal in the tailoring in one of the costumes for 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:20.150
 a good stop 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.150
 one of the dignitaries of the Jewish community of Jerusalem 

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:27.240
 whose birth can become 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.030
 has been consumed in single again together with chat again 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.760
 and then the fabric is very complicated to work on when Teske does not pull then 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.889
 always the length still further meanwhile meanwhile protection further 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.009
 times Ract has always changed it by hanging on that 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.059
 both were actually percent the price of broadcast shipment was not a meter 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:49.819
 to tailor 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.669
 He stood for this robe comes from India 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.809
 a seamstress needed for several days 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:59.529
 For Angelika Tischler, the effort is worthwhile for the moment alone 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:03.249
 The curtain is the first time at Thonet or is it already percent 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:07.759
 to keep cards costs what have Master but now exhausting the number 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.349

 I'm excited about that already very cold days 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.050
 little dreamy 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.330
 if that's all so sixth pastors 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.180
 everyone is satisfied 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.110
