00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.210
 ah 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.150
 I have drawn a smile on a paper 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.460
 maybe this time closing nicely 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.350
 I can learn to respect another opinion 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.790
 that although they are not right looking at that 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.680
 smile I happen not to offend 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.390
 opinions there are millions but they start from 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.460
 service values this person be 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.140
 cultured and even and that in insults 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.610
 deserving an apology because knowing of 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.769
 what does street mouths say and those are my 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.120
 heroes people that gives little light that 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.220
 is the influence that I want and not us 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.230
 It's important to criticize or opinion if 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.690
 matter from the point of view 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.580
 more real ideal for rap as little 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.320
 people do not understand and respect and 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.149
 we are fed up with bandits and tricks 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.800
 of the national market to extinguish everything 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.630
 what does not make big sales to 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.490
 neighborhood rhythms we get out of heaven 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.990
 we pick up prejudices and 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.180
 fears is that I love myself and I can not no 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.369
 fit vocabulary of mature hard types 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.080
 we are so safe handling the word 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.580
 how I want like you live money from 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.380
 I applaud my lyrics that I give 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.030
 I bring and only doing so astonishes the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.190
 itself first and what I want is the 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.810
 respect my mind goes ten years for 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.520
 ahead aware that the sum of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.560
 battles make you big I refuse to see 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.119
 my life so tied to my couch spines me 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.550
 they do not occur not likely if I was born to 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.200
 be great rap does not talk about love does not talk 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.550
 of alcohol does not talk about that shit in my 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.530
 people 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.240
 They are the only thing that will be worth to you if they are given 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.730
 realize that you sing until you see die 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.080
 rap is assimilated not wanting to think what 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.540
 what comes out is what comes and it does not matter 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.340
 like because revelation artists with 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.230
 a fucking version get in a couple of 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.730
 days what you in two career lives 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.860
 musical and it tastes bad 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.350
 sergio that artist that can inspire you 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.570
 well I am that bad influence that late or 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.280
 early you must censor and perez the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.690
 big creating knots in phrases will be 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.370
 bent detail in the quality my 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.320
 in the concept, he embroidered it 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.300
 I need support reported sheet music 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.490
 crushed with buds I am the god of 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.590
 rhythm and the ground trembles compared to 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.780
 Great, do not compare me in the seas 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.940
 deep I hold my breath and when I go out 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.940
 There is no one to stop me, I snuffed 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.280
 It is true 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:35.420
 serious 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:35.420
 if rap is serious 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.180
 free 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.230
 the clearance of this one 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.299
 I have tattooed every part of my body 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.739
 dead almost there is not even a piece where 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.749
 encounter returns a stubborn and stubborn 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.879
 strong when I think I 'm divine hand 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:01.859
 composing and writing the lie not 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.019
 it's a lie if there's no promise I never 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.750
 They swore to respect I'm sorry to write 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.849
 with cold tears one more chapter in my 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.379
 daily rising to the scene and contributing to 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.209
 world a small natural force 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.639
 the word justice is the call of the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.469
 not studio rap or the scavenger my 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.090
 word is a waste of sincere shit 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.280
 does not investigate is how to prove having 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.859
 talent it is imperative to be a poet and 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.019
 dodge time is born with it is 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.700
 love what is good is to be in debt until 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.439
 the neck when everything is going well 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.329
 You do not care about serious subjects casually 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.370
 or to be a story is life itself 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.290
 who backs my creations today to the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.900
 hills and their fakes fall in love 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.790
 I can without stamps with dreams with color and 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.530
 without talking about love if all 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.060
 our shit fads no fashions 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.250
 you find out even if you want, do not compare 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.250
 with taking it in the veins I snuffed 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.959
 Plague 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.659
 you know that before 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:05.430
 through 100 bases deep magnets 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.760
 efe 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.610
 rat is violent and ramps inside 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.130
 always an attempt at a perfect world 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.990
 and my lyrics weigh complain they kiss you 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.880
 they have their own life and proper land 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.680
 back scores have come out 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.690
 horrifying that I always compose the 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.520
 more beautiful sonatas your problem is 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.530
 address the rich racist child of 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.600
 mixed poor and mythical public of 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.730
 intolerance tells you to shut up is 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.740
 a sign that music complains is 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.960
 the difference of rap from the street and your 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.360
 false rap manufactured in a company 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.310
 evaluate I can you and so get my letters 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.140
 is the conclusion that every artist carries 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.880
 piggyback and count his muse without changing 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.040
 his own style and in masses are legs 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.990
 abnormal musicals fatalities realities 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.150
 resounding kneel with deadly boxes 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.100
 musicals that make up the hip hop of 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.230
 demented minds in mental diamonds 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.450
 rough with coincidences that take you 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.670
 to buy a lcd rap you realize 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.770
 of the waste of quality as of 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.100
 year zero only look for laws style 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.100
 cool 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.880
 it's the sea is deep are monkfish 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.260

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.120
 there is really good passes in seas
