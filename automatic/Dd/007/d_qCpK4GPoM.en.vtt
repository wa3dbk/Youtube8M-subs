see they're halfway all of them are

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.499 
see they're halfway all of them are
going<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.310> complete<00:01:17.670> line<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.150> they're<00:01:18.270> all

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
going to complete line so they're all

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.760 
going to complete line so they're all
equal<00:01:20.630> bring<00:01:21.630> them<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.930> way<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
equal bring them all the way up and

I don't know I just I just type the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.090 
I don't know I just I just type the
random<00:01:54.960> stuff<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.890> wanted

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
random stuff in just because I wanted

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.459

the<00:01:56.280> sound<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.700> better<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:58.049> type<00:01:58.320> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the sound to be better so just type it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.200 
the sound to be better so just type it

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
in and save it and it will save and then

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.940 
in and save it and it will save and then
so<00:02:03.210> once<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.020> saved<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.530> exit<00:02:04.829> out<00:02:04.890> of

so once it's saved you can exit out of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.230 
so once it's saved you can exit out of
that

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240
