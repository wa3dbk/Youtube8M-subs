00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.220
 let well who did not get tired of their family 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.680
 show the man who says i 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.410
 never gets tired of my family and me 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.439
 always with her well 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.050
 tired of his family, God be with you but 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.910
 never had the desire to take a break from 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.030
 family, I have a constant desire 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.489
 impracticable and relax with family to me 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.210
 how do you want to combine all no 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.650
 man can not stand 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.420
 long enough especially if you 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.900
 see him around the clock for me 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.729
 The big test has always been 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.400
 trips to this are on vacation because if 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:57.549
 do you see a person 24 hours a day well 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.589
 except while you sleep there two 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.930
 weeks in a row it goes without saying 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.449

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.610
 will leave children johny johny husbands of children 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.630
 do n't pretend like this hypocrisy 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.430
 that there is no such thing and yes of course when 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.189
 returning from vacation I am happy to run 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.740
 to work and a few days I'm great 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.420
 worker right to envy i'm an example for 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.290
 collective i 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.479
 the pride of my superiors I am very 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.659
 love my baby i can too his mother 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:32.350
 resist for example and in childhood when this 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.899
 the object is not interactive at all 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.320
 You get tired of it very quickly so boring after all 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.009
 not boring you love them father is boring 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.880
 talk about what 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.159
 take a break from family maybe it can 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.890
 afford a man who left 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.130
 much left to live yet 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.500
 a great life is a child born to me 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.610
 And this this worked at home as a programmer. 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.039
 then suddenly I realized that I really needed 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.799
 go to work I somehow became straight 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:07.270
 such a workaholic right all I disagree 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:10.000
 I sit and already at 7 pm 8 if on 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.000
 the work does not start to please and in general 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.190
 the best workers are people who like 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.830
 somehow here recently married type may 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.019
 be so now three or four months ago and 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.360
 now they suddenly realized that they were tired 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.859
 from my family in general to be honest people 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.230
 somehow scare annoying close friends 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:32.380
 but less persistent 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.400
 all the time I want to be alone show 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.920
 and air win 60 says that now 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.620
 here I will rest from them a few round up 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.420
 with her I will not stay here you catch every 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.320
 day of communication with my family 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.250
 one that's great you threw sneakers on a chair 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.450
 and went to work 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.459
 come lies sneakers on the table well this 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.680
 the best workers they are waiting for 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.900
 any new job for that 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.000
 to stay a little longer in order 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.170
 to say the phone sorry we are here 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.269
 here at work detained and today 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.079
 come later and probably lie down here I am 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.480
 there is something I do not think, and this is exactly 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.859
 what happens to all people is not 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.109
 need this feeling afraid 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.940
 food for me medication such situations 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.739
 there was always work and judging because 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.380
 these people constantly see around me 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.280
 for them, too, work serves as a cure for 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.170
 families in general this is good myself 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.019
 perfect from being able to choose 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.390
 any moment but unfortunately our women 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.599
 never let it do give them 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.599
 god of health
