touch<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.310> really<00:02:44.790> don't<00:02:45.000> get<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.630> it's

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
touch so I really don't get this it's

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.280 
touch so I really don't get this it's
really<00:02:46.380> awkward<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.360> black<00:02:48.720> ops<00:02:48.989> I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
really awkward that the black ops I

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.199 
really awkward that the black ops I
think<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.709> might<00:02:49.829> be<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.130> best<00:02:50.400> game<00:02:50.760> balance

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
think it might be the best game balance

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.750 
think it might be the best game balance
wise<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:52.230> i<00:02:52.290> think<00:02:52.590> it's<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.799> worst<00:02:53.130> game<00:02:53.640> oh

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
wise but i think it's the worst game oh

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.170 
wise but i think it's the worst game oh
wow<00:02:53.940> fail<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:55.560> think<00:02:56.069> it's<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.220> word<00:02:56.400> game<00:02:56.430> when

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
wow fail I think it's a word game when

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.330 
wow fail I think it's a word game when
it<00:02:57.269> comes<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.690> knowing<00:02:58.379> that<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.769> always<00:02:58.980> kill

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
it comes to knowing that you always kill

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.640 
it comes to knowing that you always kill
the<00:02:59.430> person<00:02:59.579> unless<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.090> got<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.299> host<00:03:00.650> bro

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650
