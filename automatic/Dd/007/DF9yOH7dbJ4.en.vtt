okay I think a lot of more church does

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.090 
okay I think a lot of more church does
is<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:02.080> artificial<00:02:03.080> construction<00:02:03.649> that<00:02:03.890> came

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
is a artificial construction that came

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.889 
is a artificial construction that came
much<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:05.270> know<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.420> doesn't<00:02:05.479> seem<00:02:05.750> them

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899

through<00:02:12.920> struggles<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:14.320> in<00:02:15.320> my<00:02:15.560> experience

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
through struggles and in my experience

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.600 
through struggles and in my experience
that<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.550> don't<00:02:17.150> think<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.510> everybody<00:02:17.930> gets

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
that I don't think that everybody gets

that<00:02:19.610> surf<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.510> don't<00:02:20.810> think<00:02:20.959> they're

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
that surf that I don't think they're

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.020

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
there for the spiritual part of it and I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.430 
there for the spiritual part of it and I
think<00:02:23.090> that's<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.450> most<00:02:23.600> important<00:02:24.080> part<00:02:24.110> is

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
think that's the most important part is

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.550 
think that's the most important part is
a<00:02:24.650> relationship<00:02:25.370> with<00:02:25.519> God
