00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
90 k xb an hour which is faster than

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.660 
90 k xb an hour which is faster than
asking<00:01:30.840> um<00:01:32.240> since<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.390> max<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.110> 75<00:01:34.680> k<00:01:35.280> xb

now<00:01:36.000> or<00:01:36.210> talking<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.350> been

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
now or talking we have been

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.870 
now or talking we have been
concentrating<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.579> lot<00:01:38.610> um<00:01:40.460> constant<00:01:41.460> flipping

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
concentrating a lot um constant flipping

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.440 
concentrating a lot um constant flipping
through<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> whole<00:01:42.479> hour

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.969 

the<00:01:47.450> thing<00:01:47.689> is<00:01:47.720> though<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.049> even<00:01:48.560> though

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
the thing is though that even though

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.280 
the thing is though that even though
this<00:01:49.130> is<00:01:49.310> more<00:01:49.490> expensive<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:50.780> need<00:01:50.990> less

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
this is more expensive you need less

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.969 
this is more expensive you need less
planks<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.820> make<00:01:53.000> because<00:01:53.900> it's<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.409> high<00:01:54.590> up<00:01:54.799> so

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
planks to make because it's a high up so

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.520 
planks to make because it's a high up so
you<00:01:55.100> get<00:01:55.220> more<00:01:55.400> speed<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.110> since<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:57.380> need

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
you get more speed and since you need

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.300 
you get more speed and since you need
less<00:01:57.830> a<00:01:58.759> plank<00:01:59.450> makes<00:01:59.690> it<00:02:00.020> almost<00:02:00.560> evens<00:02:01.130> out

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
less a plank makes it almost evens out

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.649 
less a plank makes it almost evens out
with<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:02.509> alkene<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.880> prices<00:02:05.180> are

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
with the the alkene so the prices are

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.630 
with the the alkene so the prices are
almost<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.080> same<00:02:06.110> in<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.830> end<00:02:07.009> but<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.460> just

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
almost the same in the end but it just

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.559 
almost the same in the end but it just
stops<00:02:07.970> for<00:02:08.209> doing<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.940> spank<00:02:11.330> them

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
stops for doing this so you spank them

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:19.180 
stops for doing this so you spank them
full<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:12.020> warlocks<00:02:12.560> keep<00:02:13.370> like<00:02:13.610> me<00:02:16.780> yeah<00:02:18.190> I'll

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
full of warlocks keep like me yeah I'll

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.550 
full of warlocks keep like me yeah I'll
