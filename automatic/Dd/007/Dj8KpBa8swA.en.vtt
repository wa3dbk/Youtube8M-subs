 omnisports president bongo 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.779
 the progress of the work from the outside we do not guarantee the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.899
 serenity but some are observers librevillois 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.899
 normal this is the mythical stadium of Libreville 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.690
 some probably inform you and gullible do not believe for a delivery 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.130
 before the start of the can 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.050
 works his wife emerging emerge think that the mac anguished the wine 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.090
 is flat 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.270
 what about the powerful but it's not as perfect as the reader 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.830
 do not think after calls to trouble this is the appellate court 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.190
 this will not appear 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.070
 that is the problem 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.799
 the playing card he had hit the way 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.609
 it's not bad it happened that it must be home alpha pr condÃ© 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.620
 at the national observatory 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.440
 the facilitators of these structures we can count for September 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.840
 they are under the mango tree at the neck along the barrier of the town hall of the 3rd 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.230
 borough 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.050
 after 6 the evolution of the works 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.870
 he does not hesitate to come down to the site solicited complements 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.140
 technical training 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 to justify their now serenity 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.810
 But of course it is 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.300
 it all started to finish 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.830
 but the bad was made of comment 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.910
 for his part do not put back in the bath for several months 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.870
 5 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.990
 it already gives my word 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.600
 because I'm really pissed off the colonel he was in paris for 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.550
 defend their colors 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.080
 this tax by the children my wife 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.690
 between the two there is the site manager between caux and the realities of his 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.700
 contract 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.160
 on the platform is 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.170
 the skin of the porticoes is only on the last level before the frame 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.490
 the press gallery has already welcomed them 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 one of the turns also in the armed hand 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.990
 the impact of November's decline 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.990
 benjamin does not have the floor is money 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:13.759
 for the rest 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.959
 the scaffoldings are set up the formwork with 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.239
 this operation is done by the definitive development of the last level 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.629
 on the western platform is the presidential platform that performs 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.869
 the development of the last level 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:31.229
 for bends he coast the laying of scaffolding not started deadlines 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:32.699
 will be required 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:36.469
 m yet still take to this day of back TV medium 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.189
 always always always 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.109
 always to meet deadlines 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.449
 the delegates originally announced 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:48.429
 confirm that we hope that at the end we are considering 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.919
 always to deliver the main work aude for the end of September 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.689
 it must be said that all the other bodies of state are at work on the 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:57.979
 different tribes 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.049
 if on the west stand 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.879
 the wiring is visible on his alter-ego of space 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.379
 the installation of the air conditioning sound is running 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.849
 plumbing work may also be left corner by 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.099
 damask hanging and trainees for the attacked air conditioning attacking 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.549
 to electricity years attacked the skin but we attacked 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.919
 % of the whole party according to him in the usa 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.699
 % the attacked was targeting the mining 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:27.699
 these are things that you do not necessarily see yet on the site since 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.949
 for the most part outsource to providers such as 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.009
 if I was a system of 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:38.139
 besides the fact is that to find them all the big names of the place in 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.199
 terms of subcontracting services 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.469
 the specific 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.680
 who for the most part manufactures% and its elements after she assembles in all 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.239
 case at their workshops 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.149
 so far we do not have friends of people on the building site but that's it 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:55.149
 maybe not as much but pretty much working outside for us 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.259
 to date the highest point of the stadium stage 4 goals 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:04.509
 the different tribes left to reach the 36 meters an addition that 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:08.849
 can be explained by the dimensions of the future protos supposed to support the frame 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.979
 stadium omnisports president bongo 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:14.609
 this frame he turns his frame not fall next August 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.049
 axis patients such as mounting the frame also a task 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.120
 important 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.159
 it will start next month 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.150
 we ad other countries what 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.150
 ii is the assembly of the frame which is already on site 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.110
 precisely do floor assemblies check that all firing friend in the air 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.779
 some masonry work performs in parallel 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:38.550
 it promotes the development of the boxes 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.690
 for the future offices which to house refreshment refreshments at 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.039
 half-time 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.960
 some supplies to know if and I do not have to be that are already in 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.969
 warehouses 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.710
 for the seats it is necessary to wait for the installation of the supports are its 

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.330
 memories his furniture 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.230
 we also 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.230
 these days we refuse seats 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.499
 you will not necessarily need to quickly because they are 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:03.159
 elements that will be 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.710
 practically at the end because once the finishes are finished 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.700
 Nevertheless, we have imposed the seat of the preliminary stages such as for the 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.439
 in place of fixing these seats 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.409
 what could possibly 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.499
 in gasoline and workers about 80% 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:20.440
 I will explain why 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.759
 each seat ab3 fixation 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.810
 well it takes time to put them ie three holes part a day 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.000
 it seems like nothing but forty thousand times it's still 120 of 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.550
 them 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.559
 so this task will start this month 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.270
 and in fact at the end we will see the bust with the seats 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.089
 put the bolts to hold them in the bindings 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:41.909
 and exchange rates 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.580
 as for the hour of play 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.020
 there is not much to say for now 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.249
 the lawn has been under permanent maintenance 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:51.409
 the specifications provides for your riding 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:52.580
 at the dawn of sports 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.539
 it's probably the fifth 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.219
 that the grass is doing well 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:58.419
 it may be time 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.069
 for administrations in charge of compensation and relocation 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:04.569
 to start the operation 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.030
 and the contractors awarded corresponding lots eleven facilities 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.479
 outside to start their action 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.509
 at the sports stadium president bongo 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.509
 surprises in perspective 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.919
 so 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.590
 wedding
