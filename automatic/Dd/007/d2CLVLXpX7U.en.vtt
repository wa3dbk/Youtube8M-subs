Oh<00:00:00.240> what<00:00:08.540> okay<00:00:09.540> so<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.590> rump<00:00:11.190> races

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.839 
Oh what okay so this is rump races
apparently<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.990> I'm<00:00:13.950> guessing<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.490> there's

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
apparently and I'm guessing that there's

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.380 
apparently and I'm guessing that there's
gonna<00:00:14.969> be<00:00:15.059> some<00:00:15.740> rump<00:00:16.740> races<00:00:17.390> hopefully

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
gonna be some rump races hopefully

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.910
