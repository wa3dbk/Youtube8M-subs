00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.920
 and all condemned and today I bring you back 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.480
 pack for version 1.6 point 4 of 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.280
 Minecraft 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.279
 Now let's do a little review 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.080
 of how backpacks are created in 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:19.320
 our chest backpacks 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.600
 and then I'll do the installation and remind you 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.490
 that the download links for this mode 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.060
 will be in the description along with a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.420
 law video and a forge video of 1.6 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.590
 point 4 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.800
 Then let's start first as 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.110
 create this backpack the small backpack 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.680
 OK 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.680
 what do i know 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.880
 here it's worth 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.160
 you are confusing me 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.780
 as you see when you give the little girl with the 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.610
 right button we get the map that is 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.170
 as if we had a portable trunk 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.500
 We can carry as many backpacks as 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.040
 we want 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.440
 what happens when we go to a mine and we 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.690
 we find that we are on top of 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.390
 everything but we need that material that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.850
 we have sinned and we can not get him pac 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.670
 pac our backpack and here we can 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.670
 put it 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.670
 Y 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.570
 to put the backpack 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.420
 with the bus with the one in the table, here in 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.680
 my mind I have to give to the backpack 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.460
 it simply corresponds with 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.860
 cow's 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.470
 with leather and we make the small backpack 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.680
 ok but we can build us a 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.140
 double backpack is to say as if it were a 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.970
 great new trunk for a double but as 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.770
 it was craft was this is like leather but more 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.860
 dark as it is believed 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.950
 well to pay for it we will need to do 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.360
 with two leather and the rest of rope in 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.080
 this position 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.780
 as if it were a numeric keypad on 4 and 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.810
 the 6 would be leather and the rest all of 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.679
 rope and he would give us 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.679
 this is when 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.700
 to make our own we have to 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.330
 burn it is to put this in the oven 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.209
 and most will we look like leather 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.700
 tanned and it will put us like this what we 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.319
 will allow you to have the same craft as in 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.040
 this in the new position 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.170
 let us create the big backpack 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.770
 as you see 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.860
 ok but there we can carry a backpack 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.050
 large and small backpack but with table 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.880
 of kraft is to say because you have to 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.190
 bring a kraft table 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.320
 all the time to be able to grow things 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.940
 or wood to do it because it does not take 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.940
 a backpack that allows us to create 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.290
 we project right button we have that is 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.269
 a portable type kraft table 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.670
 but we can make a cracking mass 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.860
 big 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.080
 allows us of the crafter table but 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.390
 above we add a part to be able to 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.270
 put objects here as this is created 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.480
 to monkeys with leather and a table kraft eo 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.890
 in the center that has the same craft 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.280
 I think that this is what serves him in the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.200
 center a character table and then on 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.110
 this is with the tanned leather burned in 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.090
 the oven gives us the big backpack has 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.210
 the same character only with different 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.080
 leather ok but saying oh but this is 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.900
 a little bland why not 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.270
 because we will not be able to consider backpacks 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.310
 of colors as backpack leaves us 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.650
 we have to do simply with the 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.810
 dyes for example we give here 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.110
 we put this backpack and lapis lazuli 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.450
 he creates a blue backpack for us 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.190
 illustration the squid ink a backpack 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:00.030
 black this happens with backpacks 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.030
 do not do the same 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.200
 now I'm going to use in law to 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.160
 teach all the characters but 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.170
 tell you that for example in this craft 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.240
 I believe in the basic before making us this 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.750
 backpack if we put for example in 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.020
 lapis lazuli here would make us this 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.489
 backpack was made blue directly on 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.900
 instead of having to do them first in the 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.600
 big backpack and then the blue 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.970
 are we crafter already and for example we are going to 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.790
 make me have the big backpack and 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.190
 I put football we have the backpack like that 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.139
 blue I put the black dye and I the 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.300
 turns black, so not because 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.370
 we change the column once we will stay 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.930
 of that color is worth 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:47.169
 and well now I'm going to put the mail 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.830
 and I'm going to show you all these backpacks 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.050
 as you see 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.470
 I will go as they are created 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.500
 because you can see is red with 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.610
 red rose with green is with green 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.740
 brown cactus with cocoa seeds 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.700
 does with lapis lazuli 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.860
 purple with purple tint 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.280
 and later 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.940
 the light blue is with dye they said 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.570
 gray with light tint 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.670
 with art with gray dye is changing 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.480
 pink tint 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.560
 dandelion with yellow flowers 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.630
 and else 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.740
 also orange 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.789
 from light blue 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.770
 with white bone powder and these are 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:41.400
 same 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.740
 we can also create a backpack that 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.569
 be like a trunk he said in case of 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.389
 that we die with the backpack and lose 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.110
 everything we just have to do a 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.380
 trunk of ender 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.160
 leather is worth normal leather and 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:00.470
 we would have a trunk of the laptop 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.470
 would join with all the ballet dance 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.410
 well before we finish let's move on to 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.680
 see how this mod is installed which is very 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.400
 simple 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.500
 Y 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.150
 remember that the download links 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.720
 they are in the description in case you already know 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.880
 install it 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.340
 a video by the forum for version 1.6 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.310
 point 4 and 1 panel to have the version 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.009
 1.6 point 4 also now we see ourselves with 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.930
 the installation 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.650
 well and now for the installation of 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.569
 back pack for version 1.6 point 4 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.050
 we will need this file okay but what 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:36.490
 I will leave in the description as I said 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.800
 to download it 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.860
 then we will have to go to the beginning or give 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.780
 to the windows button on our keyboard and 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.380
 here write so percent 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.720
 afp percent data therefore both 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:53.560
 hundred and said then we'll go to 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:57.280
 roaming in this folder will point 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.630
 minecraft and in domes and here copy this 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.630
 file to leave written 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.280
 then we close this as you see puts that 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.580
 is with version 1.6 in all it's 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.409
 compatible for both versions 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:15.750
 if you have it already download the version 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:19.050
 1.6 points 2 do not need iskander then 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.050
 let's go to minecraft 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:28.770
 remember that the profile has to be 

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.770
 in forge we will give to play 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.480
 it will be loaded without any problem 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.950
 and it 's loading 

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.620
 now I will show you how it was 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:45.800
 if we go to mods here we see that back pack 

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:48.770
