rig recovery skills the main tip for
this<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.929> use<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.380> wind<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.950> your<00:00:14.309> body<00:00:14.580> in

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
this is to use the wind and your body in

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640 
water my simple way to recover the rig
is<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.939> do<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.269> with<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.510> board<00:00:24.779> facing<00:00:25.320> into

like<00:01:19.799> an<00:01:19.920> aeroplane<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.180> use<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
like an aeroplane and you can use the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.240 
like an aeroplane and you can use the
wind<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.140> take<00:01:22.409> off<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.979> fly<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.490> rig<00:01:25.250> an

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
alternative way to fly the rig is to

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.340 
alternative way to fly the rig is to
swim<00:01:28.920> sideways<00:01:29.220> towards<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.179> wind<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:31.200> with

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
swim sideways towards the wind and with

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.440 
swim sideways towards the wind and with
one<00:01:31.590> hand<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.159> mast<00:01:32.399> throw<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.299> rig

one hand on the mast throw the rig

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.570 
one hand on the mast throw the rig
forward<00:01:33.990> into<00:01:34.289> your<00:01:34.439> other<00:01:34.619> hand<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:41.520> is

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
forward into your other hand this is

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.609 
forward into your other hand this is
like<00:01:41.880> throwing<00:01:42.149> a<00:01:42.299> javelin<00:01:42.539> and<00:01:42.929> uses

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
like throwing a javelin and uses

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.240 
like throwing a javelin and uses
stronger<00:01:44.039> muscle<00:01:44.369> groups<00:01:44.580> in<00:01:44.729> your<00:01:44.789> body<00:01:46.250> if

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
you keep swimming into the wind and the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.680 
you keep swimming into the wind and the

towards a tail the board you are then in

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.160 
towards a tail the board you are then in
a<00:02:08.250> position<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.729> steer<00:02:09.030> more<00:02:09.239> effectively<00:02:09.720> and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
a position to steer more effectively and

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.960 
a position to steer more effectively and

the sale can fall in many different ways

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.920 
the sale can fall in many different ways
so<00:02:19.520> it's<00:02:19.700> best<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.060> clear<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.420> rig<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:20.810> that

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
so it's best to clear the rig so that

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.860 
so it's best to clear the rig so that
you<00:02:21.140> have<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.470> swim<00:02:21.710> the<00:02:21.830> shortest<00:02:22.340> distance

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
you have to swim the shortest distance

mast above the boom your back hand goes

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.780 
mast above the boom your back hand goes

and away from the board

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.199 
and away from the board
means<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.830> can<00:03:27.980> lift<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.340> rig<00:03:28.489> across<00:03:28.760> and

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
means you can lift the rig across and

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.710 
means you can lift the rig across and
into<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.660> wind<00:03:30.370> once<00:03:31.370> again<00:03:31.550> this<00:03:32.180> draws<00:03:32.510> the

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
into the wind once again this draws the

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.570 
into the wind once again this draws the
wind<00:03:32.930> under<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.530> sail<00:03:33.800> and<00:03:33.980> keeps<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.370> water

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
wind under the sail and keeps the water

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.250 
wind under the sail and keeps the water
off<00:03:34.820> it<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.209> stops<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.900> clue<00:03:36.140> from<00:03:36.320> sinking

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.070 

so<00:03:39.920> make<00:03:40.099> sure<00:03:40.129> you're<00:03:40.610> upwind<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.510> draw<00:03:42.019> the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
so make sure you're upwind and draw the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:54.490 
so make sure you're upwind and draw the
rig<00:03:42.260> across<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:43.040> into<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.519> wind<00:03:53.349> let's<00:03:54.349> look

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
rig across and into the wind let's look

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.410 
rig across and into the wind let's look
for<00:03:54.620> some<00:03:54.769> ways<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.310> recover<00:03:55.580> the<00:03:55.819> rig<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.239> go

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
for some ways to recover the rig and go

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.020 
for some ways to recover the rig and go
in<00:03:56.569> a<00:03:56.629> direction<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:57.349> desire<00:04:00.459> remember<00:04:01.459> you

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
in a direction you desire remember you

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.759 
in a direction you desire remember you
should<00:04:02.120> always<00:04:02.330> look<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:02.840> swim<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.290> shortest

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
should always look to swim the shortest

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.460 
should always look to swim the shortest
route<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.430> clear<00:04:04.730> your<00:04:04.970> rig<00:04:05.209> let<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.900> wind<00:04:06.170> do
