00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.040 

Buffett<00:00:00.420> before<00:00:00.719> I<00:00:00.750> live<00:00:01.020> by<00:00:01.050> that<00:00:01.530> sink

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.660 

I<00:00:20.140> don't<00:00:20.769> really<00:00:20.890> mind<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.340> loading<00:00:21.640> screen

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
I don't really mind the loading screen

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:46.410 
I don't really mind the loading screen
to<00:00:22.060> balance<00:00:22.330> you<00:00:22.660> only<00:00:22.779> see<00:00:23.050> it<00:00:23.169> briefly

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.630 

quite<00:00:47.019> heal<00:00:47.230> or<00:00:47.440> I<00:00:48.010> don't<00:00:48.160> know<00:00:48.309> that<00:00:48.519> will

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
quite heal or I don't know that will

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.400 
quite heal or I don't know that will
throw<00:00:48.969> the<00:00:49.210> games<00:00:49.420> but<00:00:49.780> I<00:00:49.839> don't<00:00:50.050> think<00:00:50.230> we'll

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
throw the games but I don't think we'll

00:00:50.410 --> 00:01:10.100 
throw the games but I don't think we'll
try<00:00:51.510> too<00:00:52.510> hard

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.040 

um<00:01:10.410> I<00:01:11.220> don't<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:11.610> my<00:01:11.820> eyes<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.810> cool<00:01:12.990> i

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
um I don't know my eyes this is cool i

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.480 
um I don't know my eyes this is cool i
guess<00:01:13.230> it's<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.920> can't<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.310> any<00:01:14.430> worse

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
guess it's but it can't be any worse

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.130 
guess it's but it can't be any worse
right<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.210> register<00:01:15.570> i<00:01:15.690> was<00:01:15.810> pretty<00:01:15.960> bad

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
right because register i was pretty bad

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.920 
right because register i was pretty bad
before<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.980> like<00:01:17.190> an<00:01:17.310> arty<00:01:17.580> zone<00:01:17.930> actually

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
before it's like an arty zone actually

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.670 
before it's like an arty zone actually
thought<00:01:19.050> they<00:01:19.140> were<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> fill<00:01:19.560> this

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
thought they were going to fill this

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.080 
thought they were going to fill this
with<00:01:19.830> water<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.310> i<00:01:20.400> guess<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:20.700> decided

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
with water but i guess they decided

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.240 
with water but i guess they decided

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
guess if both tanks came here could this

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.170 
guess if both tanks came here could this
need<00:02:18.650> be<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.010> new<00:02:19.130> heavy<00:02:19.370> fighting<00:02:19.730> area<00:02:20.120> I

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.990 
clicked by RT you should be safe from
tank<00:02:30.740> stores<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.190> things<00:02:31.280> but<00:02:31.550> if<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.790> if

you're at all tank and you try to poke

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.220 
you're at all tank and you try to poke
out<00:02:33.950> of<00:02:34.100> here<00:02:34.310> it's<00:02:35.000> going<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.239> be<00:02:35.390> an<00:02:35.780> click

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
out of here it's going to be an click

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.610 
out of here it's going to be an click
right<00:02:37.300> this<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:40.090> side<00:02:41.090> scraping<00:02:41.480> what's<00:02:42.470> still

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
right this is side scraping what's still

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.610 
right this is side scraping what's still
going<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.830> get<00:02:42.950> clicks<00:02:43.959> I'll<00:02:44.959> just<00:02:45.110> check<00:02:45.260> 81

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
going to get clicks I'll just check 81

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.660 
going to get clicks I'll just check 81
after<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:45.950> just<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.250> make<00:02:46.370> sure<00:02:46.400> that's

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
after this just to make sure that's

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.199 
after this just to make sure that's
right<00:02:47.770> this<00:02:48.770> it<00:02:49.130> might<00:02:49.370> be<00:02:49.520> better<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.820> like<00:02:50.030> go

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
right this it might be better to like go

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.180 
right this it might be better to like go
here<00:02:50.390> from<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.690> side<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.900> think<00:02:51.190> because

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
here from this side I think because

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.770 
here from this side I think because
either<00:02:52.430> sides<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.150> pick<00:02:53.330> up<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:53.510> church

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
either sides you pick up this church

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.090 
either sides you pick up this church
from<00:02:53.989> this<00:02:54.170> approach<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.709> think<00:02:54.920> you're<00:02:55.010> going

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
from this approach I think you're going

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.229 
from this approach I think you're going
to<00:02:55.160> get<00:02:55.280> wrecked<00:02:55.550> by<00:02:55.730> already<00:02:55.970> because<00:02:56.120> you

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
to get wrecked by already because you

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.030 
to get wrecked by already because you
can't<00:02:56.450> really<00:02:56.600> thank<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.590> i<00:02:57.680> guess<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:57.950> can

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
can't really thank you i guess you can

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.410 
can't really thank you i guess you can
kind<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.340> use<00:02:58.400> that<00:02:58.489> but<00:02:58.820> like<00:02:58.910> already<00:02:59.209> sit

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
kind of use that but like already sit

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.990 
kind of use that but like already sit
both<00:02:59.570> their<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.110> their<00:03:00.560> source<00:03:01.010> i<00:03:04.000> guess

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
both their and their source i guess

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.520 
both their and their source i guess
maybe<00:03:05.150> they're<00:03:05.480> already<00:03:05.690> probably<00:03:05.989> more<00:03:06.350> over

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
maybe they're already probably more over

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.470 
maybe they're already probably more over
here<00:03:06.670> sometimes<00:03:07.670> already<00:03:07.910> go<00:03:08.000> do<00:03:08.180> go<00:03:08.330> over

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
here sometimes already go do go over

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.990 
here sometimes already go do go over
here<00:03:08.630> though<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:09.049> area<00:03:09.700> probably<00:03:10.700> not<00:03:10.790> not<00:03:10.940> a

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
here though this area probably not not a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.630 
here though this area probably not not a
six<00:03:11.390> but<00:03:11.600> like<00:03:11.720> over<00:03:11.930> here<00:03:12.170> just<00:03:13.130> depends<00:03:13.549> i

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
six but like over here just depends i

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.030 
six but like over here just depends i
guess<00:03:13.670> i<00:03:14.090> don't<00:03:14.870> know<00:03:15.019> it's<00:03:15.590> still<00:03:15.799> really

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
guess i don't know it's still really

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.110 
guess i don't know it's still really
vulnerable<00:03:16.340> that's<00:03:16.700> what<00:03:16.820> thing<00:03:17.000> that

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
vulnerable that's what thing that

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.860 
vulnerable that's what thing that
worries<00:03:17.360> me<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:20.030> looks<00:03:20.269> better<00:03:20.450> though<00:03:20.720> i

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
worries me it looks better though i

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.090 
worries me it looks better though i
think<00:03:20.900> i<00:03:21.320> think<00:03:21.470> it'll<00:03:21.739> be<00:03:21.769> better<00:03:21.950> than

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
think i think it'll be better than

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.740 
think i think it'll be better than
before<00:03:24.940> that's<00:03:25.940> something<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.299> got<00:03:26.420> splashed

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
before that's something you got splashed

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.539 
before that's something you got splashed
it<00:03:26.989> at<00:03:27.110> priority<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:27.680> it'll<00:03:28.040> be<00:03:28.130> easier<00:03:28.459> to

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
it at priority but it'll be easier to

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.660 
it at priority but it'll be easier to
fight<00:03:28.730> thanks<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.209> I<00:03:29.299> guess<00:03:29.330> oh<00:03:30.519> yeah<00:03:31.519> let's

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
fight thanks to it I guess oh yeah let's

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.479 
fight thanks to it I guess oh yeah let's
let's<00:03:31.940> just<00:03:32.090> look<00:03:32.180> at<00:03:32.329> a<00:03:32.360> well<00:03:32.570> make<00:03:32.720> sure<00:03:32.750> so

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
let's just look at a well make sure so

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.340 
let's just look at a well make sure so
it'd<00:03:34.489> be<00:03:34.610> easier<00:03:35.000> if<00:03:35.030> those<00:03:35.390> less<00:03:35.660> places

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
it'd be easier if those less places

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:59.430 
it'd be easier if those less places
already<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.920> sit<00:03:37.250> safely

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.560 

now<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.100> dose<00:04:00.460> will<00:04:00.670> sit<00:04:00.880> here<00:04:00.910> safely<00:04:01.390> this

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
now the dose will sit here safely this

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.410 
now the dose will sit here safely this
is<00:04:01.810> dead<00:04:02.050> if<00:04:02.800> this<00:04:03.160> was<00:04:03.340> leveled<00:04:03.790> out<00:04:03.910> that

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
is dead if this was leveled out that

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.640 
is dead if this was leveled out that
would<00:04:04.540> be<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:04.810> good<00:04:04.990> then<00:04:05.170> they<00:04:05.320> might<00:04:05.440> get<00:04:05.590> a

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
would be so good then they might get a

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.440 
would be so good then they might get a
little<00:04:05.830> but<00:04:06.070> not<00:04:06.610> I'll<00:04:06.790> just<00:04:06.820> sit<00:04:07.150> back<00:04:07.270> here

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
little but not I'll just sit back here

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:15.050 
little but not I'll just sit back here
and<00:04:07.570> cook<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.920> is<00:04:09.070> unchanged

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.930 

it<00:04:15.450> wasn't<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:15.810> damn<00:04:16.079> fine<00:04:16.410> map<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:17.070> had<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.820> many

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
it wasn't a damn fine map I had so many

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.110 
it wasn't a damn fine map I had so many
problems<00:04:19.400> mostly<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.609> when<00:04:20.760> you're<00:04:20.940> in<00:04:21.030> a

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
problems mostly that when you're in a

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.670 
problems mostly that when you're in a
heavy<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.630> have<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.930> be<00:04:22.049> so<00:04:22.260> careful

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
heavy you have to be so careful

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.470 
heavy you have to be so careful
especially<00:04:23.070> if<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.370> go<00:04:23.490> down<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.639> 90<00:04:24.180> it

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
especially if you go down to 90 it

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.030 
especially if you go down to 90 it
wasn't<00:04:24.840> like<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.110> worst<00:04:25.320> map<00:04:25.590> in<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.830> world

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
wasn't like the worst map in the world

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.620 
wasn't like the worst map in the world
and<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.430> was<00:04:26.550> better<00:04:26.730> than<00:04:26.850> old<00:04:27.180> old<00:04:27.419> bridge

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
and it was better than old old bridge

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:35.060 
and it was better than old old bridge
are<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:31.940> don't<00:04:32.940> know

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.130 

this<00:04:35.670> stuff<00:04:35.940> hasn't<00:04:36.120> really<00:04:36.450> changed<00:04:36.480> don't

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
this stuff hasn't really changed don't

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.720 
this stuff hasn't really changed don't
think<00:04:37.380> maybe<00:04:37.800> this<00:04:37.950> is<00:04:38.130> opened<00:04:38.430> up<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:38.640> don't

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
think maybe this is opened up I don't

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:50.260 
think maybe this is opened up I don't
know<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:38.910> can't<00:04:39.300> really<00:04:39.420> remember<00:04:39.510> Johnson

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.970 

the<00:04:50.810> problem<00:04:51.080> with<00:04:51.170> rush<00:04:51.320> hour<00:04:51.470> i<00:04:51.530> thought<00:04:51.830> was

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
the problem with rush hour i thought was

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.160 
the problem with rush hour i thought was
this<00:04:52.130> area<00:04:52.490> i<00:04:52.550> thought<00:04:52.820> this<00:04:52.940> was<00:04:53.150> need<00:04:53.900> to<00:04:54.020> be

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
this area i thought this was need to be

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:00.650 
this area i thought this was need to be
improved<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.620> most

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.630 

oh<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:01.440> was<00:05:01.620> paying<00:05:01.860> attention<00:05:01.950> i<00:05:02.340> was<00:05:02.430> looking

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
oh I was paying attention i was looking

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.439 
oh I was paying attention i was looking
back<00:05:02.760> there

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.269 

I<00:05:08.599> shouldn't<00:05:09.199> delete<00:05:09.439> minds<00:05:09.710> I<00:05:09.889> think<00:05:10.099> mine

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:10.279 
I shouldn't delete minds I think mine

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:12.749 
I shouldn't delete minds I think mine
should<00:05:10.490> just<00:05:10.639> be<00:05:10.729> a<00:05:10.759> lower-tier<00:05:11.090> map<00:05:11.449> though

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
should just be a lower-tier map though

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.429 
should just be a lower-tier map though
it's<00:05:13.759> too<00:05:13.939> small<00:05:14.240> i<00:05:14.300> think<00:05:14.629> by<00:05:14.779> Reuters<00:05:15.110> Oh

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:15.439 
it's too small i think by Reuters Oh

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:23.070 
it's too small i think by Reuters Oh
feels<00:05:16.069> so<00:05:16.159> weird<00:05:16.550> now

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.839 

this<00:05:23.710> will<00:05:23.889> probably<00:05:24.039> make<00:05:24.310> fighting<00:05:24.759> a

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
this will probably make fighting a

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.309 
this will probably make fighting a
little<00:05:25.120> bit<00:05:25.240> easier<00:05:25.360> I<00:05:25.629> think<00:05:25.659> on<00:05:25.990> this<00:05:26.110> area

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
little bit easier I think on this area

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:34.350 
little bit easier I think on this area
it's<00:05:26.560> just<00:05:26.830> really<00:05:27.039> hard<00:05:27.280> Yvonne<00:05:27.550> room

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.810 

can<00:05:35.360> you<00:05:35.480> spot<00:05:35.780> this

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.600 

maybe<00:05:40.360> you<00:05:40.540> get<00:05:40.660> wet

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.320 

it's<00:05:47.150> really<00:05:47.599> awkward

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.750 

maybe<00:05:52.990> you<00:05:53.110> just<00:05:53.229> sit<00:05:53.500> right<00:05:53.530> here

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.710 

I<00:05:57.760> don't<00:05:58.760> even<00:05:58.820> know<00:05:59.000> if<00:05:59.030> you<00:05:59.210> could<00:05:59.360> smell

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
I don't even know if you could smell

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:18.450 
I don't even know if you could smell
maybe<00:05:59.960> you<00:06:00.080> can't<00:06:00.290> see<00:06:00.380> that<00:06:00.620> I<00:06:00.800> guess<00:06:00.980> I

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.590 

mmm<00:06:19.300> rank<00:06:19.600> it's<00:06:19.780> better<00:06:19.960> but<00:06:20.199> I<00:06:20.259> don't<00:06:20.500> know
