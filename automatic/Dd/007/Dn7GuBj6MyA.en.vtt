00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
it's rolling over this is what it does

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.759 
it's rolling over this is what it does
on<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.699> mannequin<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.900> can<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.289> right<00:00:28.320> there

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
on the mannequin you can see right there

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.710 
on the mannequin you can see right there
that<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.070> bottom<00:00:29.310> rung<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:30.240> world

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
that that bottom rung is just world

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.269 
that that bottom rung is just world
really<00:00:31.109> tight<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.380> that's<00:00:31.740> what<00:00:31.920> happens

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
really tight and that's what happens

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.120 
really tight and that's what happens
when<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.520> knit<00:00:32.730> every<00:00:32.969> row<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.860> now<00:00:35.010> we're

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
when you knit every row so now we're

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.560 
when you knit every row so now we're
going<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> use<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.640> second<00:00:36.030> stitch<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.420> we

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
going to use the second stitch that we

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.619 
going to use the second stitch that we
learned<00:00:36.920> in<00:00:37.920> our<00:00:38.340> beginner<00:00:38.700> projects<00:00:39.390> which

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
learned in our beginner projects which

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.049 
learned in our beginner projects which
is<00:00:39.809> purling<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:41.550> we're<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.850> start

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
is purling so we're going to start

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.720 
is purling so we're going to start
purling<00:00:42.480> now<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.040> this<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.250> where<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.550> have

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
purling now and this is where you have

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.880 
purling now and this is where you have
to<00:00:44.879> really<00:00:45.059> think<00:00:45.600> about<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.930> if<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.590> look<00:00:46.770> at

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to really think about it if you look at

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.340 
to really think about it if you look at
that<00:00:47.070> mannequin<00:00:47.550> you'll<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.390> purl

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that mannequin you'll see that the purl

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.860 
that mannequin you'll see that the purl
rows<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.250> ones<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.550> stick<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.090> from

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
rows are the ones that stick out from

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.080 
rows are the ones that stick out from
the<00:00:52.020> hat<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> knitted<00:00:53.340> rows<00:00:53.520> are<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the hat and the knitted rows are the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.319 
the hat and the knitted rows are the
ones<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.390> clean<00:00:55.230> back<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> now<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.210> to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
ones that clean back so now you have to

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.250 
ones that clean back so now you have to
decide<00:00:57.449> how<00:00:58.109> wide<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.949> want<00:00:58.980> those<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.640> be<00:01:00.260> so

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
decide how wide you want those to be so

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.619 
decide how wide you want those to be so
as<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.500> pearl<00:01:01.739> around<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.129> row<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.510> do

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
as I pearl around this row you can do

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.969 
as I pearl around this row you can do
four<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.379> six<00:01:05.309> or<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.119> make<00:01:06.299> them<00:01:06.590> two<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
four or six or you can make them two and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.340 
four or six or you can make them two and
two<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:09.210> think<00:01:09.450> about<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:10.110> kind<00:01:10.320> of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
two so think about that it's kind of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.130 
two so think about that it's kind of
like<00:01:10.530> looking<00:01:10.710> at<00:01:10.920> stripes<00:01:11.600> how<00:01:12.600> why<00:01:12.840> do<00:01:12.900> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
like looking at stripes how why do you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.840 
like looking at stripes how why do you
want<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.010> that's<00:01:14.040> how<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
want them to be and that's how you

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.749 
want them to be and that's how you
design<00:01:15.320> this<00:01:16.320> pattern<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.070> hat<00:01:17.250> now

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
design this pattern for your hat now

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.600 
design this pattern for your hat now
I've<00:01:18.060> done<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.720> couple<00:01:18.810> times<00:01:19.110> now<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.860> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
I've done this a couple times now and I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.580 
I've done this a couple times now and I
like<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> rim<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.479> about<00:01:21.720> six<00:01:22.140> rows<00:01:22.409> of

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
like the rim to be about six rows of

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.270 
like the rim to be about six rows of
knitting<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.270> then<00:01:24.270> after<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.280> alternate

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
knitting and then after that I alternate

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.830 
knitting and then after that I alternate
the<00:01:26.430> rows<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.930> purling<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:29.720> for<00:01:30.720> of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the rows in for of purling and for of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.620 
the rows in for of purling and for of
knitting<00:01:31.939> all<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:33.030> we're<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> finish

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
knitting all right we're going to finish

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.490 
knitting all right we're going to finish
off<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.860> next<00:01:35.130> section<00:01:35.579> with<00:01:35.729> pearls<00:01:36.500> so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
off with the next section with pearls so
we're<00:01:37.650> purling<00:01:38.009> arounds<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:41.030> we've<00:01:42.030> decided

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
we're purling arounds and we've decided

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.420 
we're purling arounds and we've decided
that<00:01:42.540> we're<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.170> four<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.189> five

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.969 
that we're going to do four or five
inches<00:01:44.729> up<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> crown<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.049> what<00:01:46.860> we're

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
inches up to the crown so what we're

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.660 
inches up to the crown so what we're
going<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:48.350> purl<00:01:49.350> rows<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.979> then<00:01:50.579> we're

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
going to do for purl rows and then we're

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.929 
going to do for purl rows and then we're
going<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.979> knitted<00:01:52.979> rose<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.670> put<00:01:53.850> that
