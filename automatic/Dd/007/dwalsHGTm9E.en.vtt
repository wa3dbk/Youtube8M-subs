00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.050
 morale there on the map of a 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.890
 now as in the last step person that I 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.699
 I passed 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.660
 the type of marking is not on the map for you 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.309
 Left again only here I spent one 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.379
 time to mark the type of character to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.150
 You hold now I'm going for the kind of 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.740
 marking as you should mark the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.920
 meshing you must have here in 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.750
 balcony which is quite important 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.600
 There's no pattern here for you either. 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.210
 want to hold holding because it is a one 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.369
 where staff invest a lot 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.369
 terror last terrorist terrorist 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.500
 invest a lot to make that hake 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.570
 for suddenly you're eliminating a face 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.460
 so pay attention to this type of 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.540
 that you can sometimes be 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.329
 doing wrong china is doing 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.520

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.079
 balcony too but you can suddenly 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.670
 talk to your uncle and such a team has 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.950
 the same language as the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.570
 competitive're just that everything here 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.610
 porch will bring down this whole thing year 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.590

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.310
 the part of the pole and here from the house 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.700
 Woods 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.140
 So pay attention, it's no kind of 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.740
 you should have here on the balcony 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.210
 is for example a player has to stay 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.430

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.290

 left he has the option to schedule both 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.090
 here in the trash, but the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.209
 serve suddenly caught on the line here or 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.340

 this guy kill the house he has to be 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.900
 quite clever at that point because 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.310
 when that face falls 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.530
