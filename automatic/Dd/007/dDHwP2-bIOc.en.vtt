00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.720
 much hand 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.560
 I thought those to make bananas to 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.930
 let's see what it takes to make the oven 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.640
 our bananas in the hole do not need a few 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.010
 ingredients that I'm sure of one of 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.690
 you know neither refrigerator nor at home 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.690
 the dose for two people is two bananas 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.280
 a juicy beautiful orange 3 tablespoons of 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.490
 sugar that may vary depending on 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.380
 of personal taste and about 15 grams 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.290
 of butter 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.049
 let's move on to the preparation today on 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.240
 oven at maximum temperature in the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.909
 Meanwhile I took the bananas or 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.460
 peeled and cut in the direction of 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.829
 length to position them in a 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.219
 container that also goes into the oven with 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.590
 the part cut downwards 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:25.079
 I squeezed the orange and some juice 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.499
 came to now lobos park above the 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.499
 trivial 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.569
 this is the sage that will also go into 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.569
 form 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:41.610
 but only now the sugar we offer 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.610
 bananas with sugar 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.159
 it may suffice and now he cheats on them 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.859
 Bananas and everything on the plate let's see says 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.289
 which ends the butter we had before 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.289
 weighed and prepared 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.290
 now after this operation it will be enough 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.290
 put everything in the oven for 5 minutes 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.290
 five minutes have passed I have removed the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.980
 banal from the oven and now it only remains 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.040
 implantable is important 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.319
 eat both very hot and warm but 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.810
 before you serve better because otherwise 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.180
 will tend to argue with some cream 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.100
 the dish will be even more beautiful is also 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.100
 for this evening we ended up in 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.270
