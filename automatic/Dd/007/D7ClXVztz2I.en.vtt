of<00:00:16.500> habit<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.460> tend<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> get<00:00:17.970> caught<00:00:18.210> up

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
of habit and I tend to get caught up

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.120 
of habit and I tend to get caught up
doing<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> same<00:00:19.020> thing<00:00:19.320> over<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.680> over<00:00:19.830> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
doing the same thing over and over and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.920 
doing the same thing over and over and
that<00:00:20.460> includes<00:00:20.850> when<00:00:21.240> I'm<00:00:21.359> printing<00:00:21.660> my

that includes when I'm printing my
photographic<00:00:22.590> images<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> tendency<00:00:23.609> to

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
photographic images I have a tendency to

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.320 
photographic images I have a tendency to
stick<00:00:24.689> with<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.109> same<00:00:25.439> paper<00:00:26.039> over<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.060> over

stick with the same paper over and over

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.179 
stick with the same paper over and over
again<00:00:27.449> sort<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.869> for<00:00:28.170> every<00:00:28.500> print<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:28.980> maybe

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
again sort of for every print or maybe

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.679 
again sort of for every print or maybe
with<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> few<00:00:29.580> exceptions<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.359> tend<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
with a few exceptions but I tend to

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.810 
with a few exceptions but I tend to
print<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.590> same<00:00:31.800> paper<00:00:32.070> once<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.460> find<00:00:32.700> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
print on the same paper once I find a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.060 
print on the same paper once I find a
paper<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.770> so

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
paper that I like but it can be so

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.729 
paper that I like but it can be so
helpful<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.880> explore<00:00:36.360> different<00:00:36.750> options<00:00:37.260> and

I've<00:00:54.809> already<00:00:55.110> printed<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.620> bunch<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:56.010> samples

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
I've already printed a bunch of samples

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.639 
I've already printed a bunch of samples
and<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.329> gives<00:00:57.539> me<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> few<00:00:57.930> benefits<00:00:58.079> for<00:00:58.500> one

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and that gives me a few benefits for one

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.490 
and that gives me a few benefits for one
thing<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.190> gives<00:00:59.730> me<00:00:59.940> exposure<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.960> papers

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
thing it gives me exposure to papers

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.650 
thing it gives me exposure to papers
that<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.770> might<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.280> otherwise<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:03.149> ignored

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that I might have otherwise just ignored

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.399 
that I might have otherwise just ignored

for example I'm looking here at a print

metallic I would normally never choose a

metallic<00:01:15.090> paper<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
metallic paper it's going to have a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.080 
metallic paper it's going to have a
little<00:01:16.170> bit<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.500> silvery<00:01:17.009> appearance<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.939> it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
little bit of a silvery appearance to it

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.760 
little bit of a silvery appearance to it
and<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.750> don't<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.380> makes

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and I just don't think that that makes

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.460 
and I just don't think that that makes
sense<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.400> my<00:01:20.549> photographic<00:01:21.270> images<00:01:21.750> at

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
sense for my photographic images at

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.530 
sense for my photographic images at
least<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.860> didn't<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.759> made<00:01:23.909> sense<00:01:24.180> until

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
least I didn't think it made sense until

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.940 
least I didn't think it made sense until
I<00:01:24.600> printed<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.140> photo<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> metallic

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
I printed this photo on the metallic

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850 
I printed this photo on the metallic
paper<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.640> looks<00:01:26.820> great<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.930> white<00:01:28.439> areas

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
paper and it looks great the white areas

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.289 
paper and it looks great the white areas
are<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.070> relatively<00:01:29.549> white<00:01:29.729> areas<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
are the relatively white areas of the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.660 
are the relatively white areas of the
photo<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.320> sort<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.710> silvery

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
photo now have this sort of silvery

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.880 
photo now have this sort of silvery
shine<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.360> them<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.650> looks

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
shine to them it really just looks

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
shine to them it really just looks
wonderful<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.579> works<00:01:35.850> great<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.930> image

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
wonderful it works great for this image

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.810 
wonderful it works great for this image
I'm<00:01:37.350> sure<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.650> will<00:01:37.710> work<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.130> other<00:01:38.310> images

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
I'm sure it will work for other images

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.460 
I'm sure it will work for other images
as<00:01:38.970> well<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.840> would<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.110> probably<00:01:40.320> never

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
as well and I would have probably never

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.410 
as well and I would have probably never
even<00:01:40.740> tried<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.369> paper<00:01:41.610> if<00:01:41.880> not<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.360> that

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
even tried this paper if not for that

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.170 
even tried this paper if not for that
sampler<00:01:42.869> pack<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.380> also<00:01:44.159> using<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.850> sampler

out<00:01:48.180> different<00:01:48.240> papers<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:49.979> a

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
