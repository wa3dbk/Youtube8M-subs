00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.689

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.849

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.039
 I see this game profile was so 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.050

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.090
 If I have at home going into 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.820

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.820

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.540

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.440
 taste that goes into the oven 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.950
 deep down I'm going to cook pasta 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.630
 I choose full time, this is it. 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.229
 but you can also choose that 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.950
 is spindle or an integral spaghetti that 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.950
 you want there 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.899
 good on the prostate bottle to mess with 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.350
 in this table and if I put this one 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.650
 I quoted the house olive oil thread 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.810

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.240

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.980
 gluten without sugar and has very few 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.230
 calories per serving 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.440

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.530
 But it yields a lot and to our 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.920
