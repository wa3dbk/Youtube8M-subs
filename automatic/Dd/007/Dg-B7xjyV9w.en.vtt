I think it looks really fantastic and
here<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.759> guys<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.299> buildable<00:01:48.659> element<00:01:49.170> of

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
here it is guys the buildable element of

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.859 
here it is guys the buildable element of
the<00:01:49.649> set<00:01:49.920> itself<00:01:50.220> without<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.420> minifigures

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the set itself without the minifigures

the set itself without the minifigures
attach<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.439> might<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> blandest

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
attach this might be the blandest

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.010 
attach this might be the blandest
vehicle<00:01:53.759> I've<00:01:53.850> ever<00:01:53.880> seen<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.509> my<00:01:54.540> entire<00:01:54.659> life

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
vehicle I've ever seen in my entire life

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.959 
vehicle I've ever seen in my entire life
it<00:01:55.140> doesn't<00:01:55.170> particularly<00:01:55.530> look<00:01:55.799> bad<00:01:56.189> it's

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
it doesn't particularly look bad it's

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.350 
it doesn't particularly look bad it's
just<00:01:57.210> extremely<00:01:58.250> extremely<00:01:59.250> born<00:01:59.880> well<00:02:00.210> it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
just extremely extremely born well it

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.399 
just extremely extremely born well it
makes<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.689> interesting<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.170> pretty<00:02:01.290> much

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
makes it interesting and pretty much

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.440 
makes it interesting and pretty much
sets<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.860> apart<00:02:01.950> from<00:02:02.189> any<00:02:02.610> other<00:02:02.729> Lego<00:02:03.210> set

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
sets it apart from any other Lego set

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.840 
sets it apart from any other Lego set
that's<00:02:03.600> kind<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.930> ever<00:02:04.170> come<00:02:04.680> out<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.670> way

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
that's kind of ever come out is the way

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.999 
that's kind of ever come out is the way
that<00:02:06.060> many<00:02:06.240> figures<00:02:06.450> go<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.530> thing<00:02:07.799> so

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
that many figures go on this thing so

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.979 
that many figures go on this thing so
the<00:02:08.250> first<00:02:08.489> step<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.789> attaching<00:02:09.060> these<00:02:09.599> soul

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
the first step is attaching these soul

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.180 
the first step is attaching these soul
tree<00:02:10.229> minifigures<00:02:10.709> right<00:02:10.890> here<00:02:11.069> you

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
tree minifigures right here you

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.410 
tree minifigures right here you
basically<00:02:11.550> rip<00:02:11.910> them<00:02:12.150> in

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
basically rip them in

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.000 
basically rip them in
half<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:12.930> take<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> body<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.860> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
half and then take the body of the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.710 
half and then take the body of the
soldier<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.580> clip<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> side

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
soldier and you clip it on to the side

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.080 
soldier and you clip it on to the side
of<00:02:16.020> this<00:02:16.590> part<00:02:16.920> right<00:02:16.980> here<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.730> then<00:02:18.030> you

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
of this part right here and then you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.570 
of this part right here and then you
take<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.390> legs<00:02:18.630> here<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.230> fold<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:20.010> legs<00:02:20.280> in

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
take the legs here you fold the legs in

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.300 
take the legs here you fold the legs in
and<00:02:20.970> they<00:02:21.420> clip<00:02:21.720> onto<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.140> back<00:02:22.380> right<00:02:23.250> here

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
and they clip onto the back right here

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.010 
and they clip onto the back right here
which<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.470> extremely<00:02:25.470> weird<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.370> very<00:02:27.020> odd

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
which is extremely weird and very odd

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.350 
which is extremely weird and very odd
and<00:02:28.410> then<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:29.040> do<00:02:29.250> for<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.550> officer<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.239> many

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
and then we do for the officer in many

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.300 
and then we do for the officer in many
figures<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.840> rip<00:02:31.050> him<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.410> half<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.830> take<00:02:32.069> his

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
figures you rip him in half you take his

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.460 
figures you rip him in half you take his
legs<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.910> put<00:02:33.150> them<00:02:33.330> on<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.660> bottom<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.290> the

legs you put them on the bottom of the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.190 
legs you put them on the bottom of the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
place and voila there you go there is

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.960 
place and voila there you go there is
pretty<00:02:55.500> much<00:02:55.590> your<00:02:55.739> completed<00:02:56.340> Ultron

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
pretty much your completed Ultron

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.390 
pretty much your completed Ultron
vehicle<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.930> does<00:02:58.200> look<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.470> whole<00:02:58.860> lot<00:02:58.920> better

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
vehicle it does look a whole lot better

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.220 
vehicle it does look a whole lot better
with<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.850> minifigures<00:03:00.360> attached<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
their pieces all over the vehicle is so

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.050 
their pieces all over the vehicle is so
weird<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.160> never<00:03:08.370> seen<00:03:08.519> anything<00:03:08.819> like<00:03:08.940> that

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
weird and never seen anything like that

this<00:03:12.239> part<00:03:12.600> here<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.959> kind<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.140> sticks<00:03:13.410> on

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
this part here that kind of sticks on

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.199 
this part here that kind of sticks on
the<00:03:13.739> back<00:03:13.920> actually<00:03:14.160> acts<00:03:14.610> as<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.790> pretty<00:03:15.060> good

the back actually acts as a pretty good

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.759 
the back actually acts as a pretty good
handle<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:15.660> it's<00:03:15.780> very<00:03:15.900> easy<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.290> switch<00:03:16.560> this

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769

into this thing I kind of expected this

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.930 
into this thing I kind of expected this
set<00:04:10.049> to<00:04:10.170> be<00:04:10.319> awful<00:04:10.859> honestly<00:04:11.370> it's<00:04:11.609> not

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
set to be awful honestly it's not

actually that bad the vehicle is strange

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.129 
actually that bad the vehicle is strange
little<00:04:15.000> bit<00:04:15.180> dinky<00:04:15.600> it's<00:04:15.750> not<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.019> greatest

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
little bit dinky it's not the greatest

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.900 
little bit dinky it's not the greatest
thing<00:04:16.530> in<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.680> world<00:04:16.769> but<00:04:17.100> it's<00:04:17.340> unique<00:04:17.729> at

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
thing in the world but it's unique at

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.490 
thing in the world but it's unique at
least<00:04:18.180> it's<00:04:18.419> got<00:04:18.870> some<00:04:19.019> pretty<00:04:19.229> some

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
least it's got some pretty some

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.320 
least it's got some pretty some
playability<00:04:19.859> features<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.669> think<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.060> price

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
playability features I think the price

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.850 
playability features I think the price
is<00:04:21.359> very<00:04:21.810> good<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.229> of<00:04:22.349> course<00:04:22.620> the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
is very good and of course the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.470 
is very good and of course the
minifigures<00:04:23.640> are<00:04:23.880> so<00:04:24.349> fantastically

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
minifigures are so fantastically

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.700 
minifigures are so fantastically
it<00:04:25.690> definitely<00:04:25.870> makes<00:04:26.050> up<00:04:26.200> for<00:04:26.350> any<00:04:26.470> other

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
it definitely makes up for any other

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.250 
it definitely makes up for any other
problems<00:04:27.010> with<00:04:27.280> this<00:04:28.090> set<00:04:28.360> so<00:04:28.600> I<00:04:28.810> file<00:04:29.140> already
