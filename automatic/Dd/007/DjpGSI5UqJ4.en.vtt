00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.819
 how to make a station that ANV and 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.000
 recharge alone I do not know if they know it's a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.309
 skillful but this one went out as well as does 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.099
 little happens in the productive so they are 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.870
 that's how I started I do not know 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.930
 say it in Spanish I think I looked 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.490
 in translator today says juncker what 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.590
 let's tell you have seen that so be it 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.470
 handling and basically one thing that you 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.890
 let this fix things this 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.579
 change the name and combine this 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.050
 enchantment with the cost of experience 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.820
 Well this machine is what it does here 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.360
 is that it is not a machine as you know this 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.540
 the anwil is like one that is as grave or 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.440
 sand that fall with the gravity have 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.690
 seen Nazism can you kill someone 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.430
 As you can see, you can fall alone and 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.430
 be me and this we are going to use for this 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.370
 how can you see the bad in these areas 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.080
 is that as you go using it 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.210
 break 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.510
 with the praiseworthy and fast scope that 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.510
 break 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.840
 As you can see it sounds a lot because there 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.730
 up work a lot and that's 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.850
 basically like we're going to do it 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.229
 now let's do it with wood 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.939
 you can do it the way you 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.640
 want I chose this form because it 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.770
 See what it looks like a machine that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.500
 ann bill ago if you want to cover it 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.070
 here that I know and here I did as some 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.700
 stairs to fill them later and 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.850
 state 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.190
 how to do it together you have to do is 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.420
 like an opening in the wall 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.810
 and treat it here if you want 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.760
 here you have to basically for a 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:55.520
 lots of areas and bad and this 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:58.280
 it uses it breaks with a pretty tutorial 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.440
 short but I thought it was useful for 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.510
 some of you to see some that 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.830
 are adapting to this and bills are 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.420
 pimp bases I like the only thing 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.060
 that there are things that are not so 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.369
 balanced 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.709
 there are things that do not cost you very little in 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.239
 the experience to fix the thing that 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.130
 it costs you too much and it's not worth it 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.480
 but over time this is going 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.480
 fixing and it's getting more 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.349
 this also twitter 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.360
 and before they say one more thing before 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.680
 that rob me say that we are going the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.050
 video of the credit to the person who 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.220
 did this the video link is the 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.069
 description if you want to see it in English 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.930
 and that 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.489
 only to accredit the person 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.500
 because I do not like stealing things to the 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.190
 people is not blog goodbye 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.190
 Kisses
