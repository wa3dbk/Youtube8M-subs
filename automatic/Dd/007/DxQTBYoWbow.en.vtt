00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.550
 Hello and welcome to what medium of me today is up there 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.580
 create depth 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.169
 in Cinema 4d 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.539
 I made a small composition ten times 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.399
 It's all about revenue 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.890
 then it looks like this 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.240
 the whole picture here 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.130
 is sharp that means there is neither one creates 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.720
 and in front and behind 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.120
 everything is done but actually we want the whole thing a bit 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.520
 looks more realistic 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.890
 that the front and rear dividers 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.610
 Blurs 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.870
 and lo and behold for this actually pretty easy to do 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.520
 First we create a camera 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.160
 that we listen to objects 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.790
 10 their values 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.790
 Ambani one pulls at the house 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.260
 from her a camera 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
 you can see them up there too 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.880
 and we have a comrade goal 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.300
 that's the point boys 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.530
 Regime it to the point where we want to have that from Ashraf 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.210
 that means one follows in the middle of this it applies here 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.570
 I'm going back 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.990
 in the view of the chamber one sees this up here 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.440
 cameras 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.290
 the dance scene cameras 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.000
 and if you like this camera 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.390
 and to move this chamber push yourself old and pretty busy 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
 otherwise you can choose two different as well as the normal one 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.840
 Options so with percentages old and Zellingen from that the arbitration 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.380
 Main light 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.820
 we need a chain with a Ausraster 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.690
 work 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.690
 Susan is the whole country if it has concert now 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.190
 one looked at the whole again 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.630
 but no difference 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.630
 the ambition Canaria the camera from Velen 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.699
 Hamdy burned to the top of the game 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.149
 because the mix is ​​out 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:15.189
 un-chef Ban sharpness in front and blur behind 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:17.669
 Rainer the whole again 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.609
 that's still nothing 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.609
 that means you have to adjust some settings 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.769
 as they go the renter of positions 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.519
 And there we are. We have nothing to do with the depth of field 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.649
 the club is on the right 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:34.999
 and see here 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.949
 Oh, there we are somewhere 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.209
 the depth of field 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.249
 sitting there has begun 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:45.969
 and the rest of the coming so we could still 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:50.029
 the youngest create us the most recent form even setting everything possible 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.179
 we close the whole thing again 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.179
 ours to that again 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.859
 so and now it happens even more up front actually 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.639
 that this part of her 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.639
 and this was prevented from becoming a sheep too 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.689
 but it is very close ran 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.689
 back there may be better to recognize 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.969
 so 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.969
 Rennert the whole thing again 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.919
 without you pull down here as much as the whole down 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:27.209
 was drawn 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.209
 Super catapults gone brought him to Rome 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.069
 that's a pretty easy trick 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.019
 you just have to adjust them in the settings and Anika Baumann 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.319
 missing 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.319
 the one with set at the camera 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.730
 Depth is used so the distance actual target object that is me very much 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.199
 practically because the chamber has stopped directly 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.079
 at the target object 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.790
 which parts Schaaf Verdener now has a lot of smash move backwards 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.469
 the warriors that drive Zotac then we are 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.039
 these objects will become Schaaf 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.399
 that the other two and Schaeffler have 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:14.589
 i find this attacca very handy i hope so now 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.180
 Please visit my time for a forum 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.109
 to look at the influence and the last act
