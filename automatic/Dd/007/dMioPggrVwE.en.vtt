we're so diverse and also because it's a

they<00:02:05.970> have<00:02:06.210> more<00:02:06.720> opportunities<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.069> job

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
they have more opportunities in the job

have ones that are already counting by

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.090

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
tens you know working in third grade I

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.560 
tens you know working in third grade I
didn't<00:02:24.550> even<00:02:24.670> see<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:24.910> until<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.330> end<00:02:25.480> of

didn't even see that until the end of
third<00:02:25.750> grade<00:02:25.990> so<00:02:26.140> it's<00:02:26.260> really<00:02:26.440> exciting<00:02:26.650> and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
skills and strategies to be able to

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.360 
skills and strategies to be able to
tackle<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.170> work<00:03:08.350> that<00:03:08.560> we<00:03:08.680> give<00:03:08.920> them<00:03:09.100> and

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
tackle the work that we give them and

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.980 
tackle the work that we give them and
it's<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:09.880> same<00:03:09.940> for<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.360> English<00:03:10.690> speakers

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
it's the same for the English speakers

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.110 
it's the same for the English speakers
too<00:03:11.350> because<00:03:11.800> their<00:03:12.070> parents<00:03:12.460> usually<00:03:12.880> can't

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
too because their parents usually can't

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.310 
too because their parents usually can't
help<00:03:13.300> them<00:03:13.480> with<00:03:13.600> their<00:03:13.750> homework<00:03:13.900> either

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
help them with their homework either

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.410 
help them with their homework either
because<00:03:14.680> they<00:03:14.800> don't<00:03:15.010> speak<00:03:15.220> Spanish<00:03:15.420> so

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
because they don't speak Spanish so

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.910 
because they don't speak Spanish so
they're<00:03:16.570> all<00:03:16.690> in<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.959> same<00:03:16.990> boat<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.740> they're

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
they're all in the same boat and they're

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.070 
they're all in the same boat and they're
just<00:03:18.040> learning<00:03:18.430> side-by-side<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.720> different

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
just learning side-by-side to different

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.080 
just learning side-by-side to different
populations<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:20.680> might<00:03:20.980> not<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:22.060> know

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
populations that might not you know

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.290 
populations that might not you know
really<00:03:22.570> be<00:03:22.800> working<00:03:23.800> together<00:03:23.950> otherwise<00:03:24.700> so

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
really be working together otherwise so

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.050 
really be working together otherwise so
we<00:03:25.450> find<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.930> component<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.650> our<00:03:26.800> program

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
we find that component of our program

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.780 
we find that component of our program
probably<00:03:28.060> one<00:03:28.540> of<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.750> most<00:03:28.900> important<00:03:29.530> and

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
probably one of the most important and

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.830 
probably one of the most important and
actually<00:03:30.790> defining<00:03:31.270> pieces<00:03:31.810> of<00:03:31.959> our<00:03:32.080> program

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
actually defining pieces of our program

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.300 
actually defining pieces of our program
bridging<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.930> cultural<00:03:35.110> gap<00:03:35.410> while

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
bridging the cultural gap while

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.970 
bridging the cultural gap while
cultivating<00:03:36.970> today's<00:03:37.360> young<00:03:38.080> minds<00:03:40.680> now<00:03:41.680> when

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
cultivating today's young minds now when

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.070 
cultivating today's young minds now when
the<00:03:42.070> school<00:03:42.310> began<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:42.970> only<00:03:43.180> offered<00:03:43.600> pre-k

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
the school began it only offered pre-k

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.470 
the school began it only offered pre-k
and<00:03:44.290> kindergarten<00:03:44.920> but<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:45.610> plans<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:46.030> add<00:03:46.150> one

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
and kindergarten but it plans to add one

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.750 
and kindergarten but it plans to add one
grade<00:03:46.720> each<00:03:46.930> year<00:03:47.290> through<00:03:47.680> fifth<00:03:48.130> grade<00:03:48.400> so

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
grade each year through fifth grade so

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.610 
grade each year through fifth grade so
just<00:03:49.090> how<00:03:49.209> unique<00:03:49.510> is<00:03:49.930> this<00:03:50.110> type<00:03:50.320> of<00:03:50.470> school

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620
