00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.170
 hey people are especially happy for us 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.240
 you and that this is not 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.730
 platter on existing football but 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.529
 a huge coup is that they have 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.250
 now just friends degree when hiking 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.009
 found 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.050
 fink has a katjuscha and yes we 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.430
 have the same evening already the 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.719
 half of it prepared as 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.550
 four times as big in the original one 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.430
 have landfilled and fried though 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.450
 tasty and that's why I wanted today 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.219
 though again 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.800
 According to mushroom flight is the giant choir is 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.090
 mostly on orchards and also praised 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.550
 green area to find 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.040
 and usually enough of nitrogen 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.510
 make copies there are up to 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.400
 15 kilos become heavy 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.350
 we have really moved but 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.590
 I believe in 15 kilo can why 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.420
 not recognized and yes to keep 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.379
 It is best to give it a panel and 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.420
 fry you could also steam 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.030
 theoretically is possible there to the 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.950
 But I have spots now too 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.390
 I did not try it, I think 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.149
 at least a pretty strong one 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.950
 own taste and japan I have had 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.549
 not too much salt now 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.929
 stated 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.609
 and I think that is in the case also 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.249
 not at all possible because he is so on his own 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.929
 off really good if you have time 

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:27.429
 should find a huge chorus 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.009
 In any case, you can eat it like that 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:33.579
 long hole as long as he knows in still nice 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:37.530
 That's how fast it goes 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.530
 Just write a thumbshot 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.399
 I would be a bit 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.399
 cutting foam 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.970
 so the liquid panade I have now 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.580
 already prepared was still too yesterday 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.700
 had done a lot that is about now 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.090
 two buttons soy milk and about six 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.410
 to eight tablespoons chickpeas mail 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.310
 I go then so go in with it 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.450
 almost the flakes go out 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.910
 you can, however, for that matter 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.440
 I also take more or less 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.560
 had a liquid at the beginning 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.950
 first panade and yes that has anyway 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.880
 kept and was just a bit thinner 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.160
 and here it is a bit thicker 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.890
 data later even higher security 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.630
 more made so you can 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.860
 according to your suggestion that too 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.750
 to prepare as you like 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.370
 it is still a teaspoon of salt in it 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.800
 that's all that I end up with 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.300
 So did to the fungus on when 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.459
 you want your thick panade then makes you 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.280
 not pretty viscous mass if you 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.220
 a thinner panade will bring something 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.790
 thin then I have him on the e 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.650
 mail 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.200
 And that's basically everything 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.400
 what you need besides thank you already 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.350
 Put a pan on next 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.500
 olive oil and travel formally 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.350
 and the mushrooms just break now 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.870
 a little bit smaller because he is 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:02.570
 then just simply used afterwards 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.980
 so first into the liquid mass then 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.330
 drain out a little bit 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.680
 and into the sawdust and then either 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:16.690
 turn back and forth for so long 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:22.030
 Shake is the whole disc covered 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.030
 and then just lie in the hot fat 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.829
 which is now best in half 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:35.230
 he reduced so as not to fast 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:36.519
 it gets dark after a few minutes 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.170
 they should also be enough 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.599
 Of course, it could last longer 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:49.359
 if you like 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:51.700
 We can take that out first and 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.340
 So has a huge bobbies cut 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.159
 are here to yesterday 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.620
 eaten green beans and salad and me 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.810
 catch sauce must actually do it 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.790
 not be because the protectors have so 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.680
 a lot of juice that you actually do 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.819
 you do not need us we can anyway 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.099
 to make a soester for example 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.280
 I could very well have a paprika 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:15.310
 to imagine cream sauce or to 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.169
 example also a merciless so mushroom 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.220
 with pils well there you can yours 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.220
 let imagination run wild 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.030
 so that sometimes looks up close 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.639
 So that's the mushroom that has, so to speak 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.180
 this thin strip only left 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.020
 calmly 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:44.020
 and that is really extremely juicy and 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.220
 really tasty and the parades around it 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.139
 that really makes the whole thing one 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.139
 possible on it 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.419
 first I wanted to show her yes there wish 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.440
 I wish you a lot of luck mushrooming 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.440
 and have fun 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.840
 apa 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.039
 apa 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.170
 was 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.380
 there 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.380
 at
