00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.960
 when we lose we are never happy 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.400
 so yeah finally we 're not going 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.570
 to dramatize is a little disappointment 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.800
 because we had done a very good 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.730
 first half that hinted 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.230
 still a lot of things afterwards 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.570
 the exit of mario limina obviously has 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.860
 weighed heavy too so we saw in the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.950
 second half even though we had 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.090
 a lot of the will but shows two 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.440
 other waste also help 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.879
 situations where or betting without forcing was 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.390
 imposed on some on counters so 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.710
 it was there was there was very 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.079
 clearly a difference in value one 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.219
 put that knew before the before the beginning 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.510
 but I think it has material to 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.859
 to do better as if we had 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.670
 could chain a two half-time of the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.670
 even the same quality 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.470
 yes and then finally it's obviously there 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.580
 had talent in the face but we 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.280
 is not irreproachable in addition these are 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.480
 the on the goals we take that would 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 without much as on losses of 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.500
 ball very high and penalize us 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.210
 mons ac it's always a scenario 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.100
 we have often experienced that rises Ã‰mond 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.130
 limits it's after we got the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.690
 generosity is there was we continued 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.760
 still to play then after there are some 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.400
 nice winks what the penalty 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.380
 of arnaud even though I also find that the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.550
 the referee body shows talent 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.630
 lack of discernment with expulsion 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:52.190
 of two of the chrome water that did not deserve 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.190
 this is finally this is 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.460
 I think also realistic faith 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.690
 we are too diminished to be able to 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.220
 compete for example germain so is 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.020
 maybe not too demanding either 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.440
 with the team as it is 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.440
 present there 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.200
 thank you 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.010
 Yes 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.230
 yes the match was good it's we have 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.049
 not prepare as well in the players 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.470
 were serious and a nice matches 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:50.920
 without victory this is the second he is 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.659
 finished very well with 2 after the title 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.540
 two wins before well played then 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:00.220
 it was the fantastic kind I preach 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.269
 that you play it and the end very good 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:10.090
 work deserves the very good holiday 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:13.450
 and I want to thank ja already done but 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:18.849
 i think the season for paris saint 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.760
 germain and be good to infinity with 83 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.010
 points and a very good result we have 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.909
 scored more than 5 of all 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.640
 competitions together to say that they 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:33.690
 we were in this kind we can 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.690
 have a very good memory 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.540
 I appreciate that the skin can do it 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.209
 very beautiful is jean mas le ps that all 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.750
 the x is not easy to arrive in a 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:58.920
 new championship be immediately 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.900
 trait to make beautiful performances 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.130
 he did very good performances the 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:11.770
 scoring goals he gave a lot of 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:13.840
 passes for the teammate and he is and 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.000
 I think the key to winning the 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.579
 championship because the character the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.050
 professionality of ibra is a 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:26.760
 fantastic was a very good example 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.760
 for everyone 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:39.520
 I am very satisfied that he has arrived 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:50.979
 Here he gave every bit of the 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:54.940
 possibility that he got was a small 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:58.060
 little disappointed because the skull did not have 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.600
 the opportunity to play my I wanted 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.440
 give him the opportunity to be a 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.270
 protagonist of this season she was 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.010
 does not have a good chance 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.280
 I think it's the referee does not have a 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:16.919
 good thing because the referee is there 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:20.740
 to protect it 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:23.680
 so it's hard to help it 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.360
 just not just a finally was not 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.970
 not just because the rule and as soon as 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.200
 the red cards unfortunately 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.200
 the arbitrator must make the decision 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.970
 I do not know babe I know I 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.710
 do not want to talk today because 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.580
 I already spoke yesterday and everyone 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:54.419
 knows the situation 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:56.699
 no christmas no new good 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:08.599
 new seen his brushes it's not about 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:08.599
 new good news no 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.089
 no I did not talk with the players 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.300
 of these things since we have already said 

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:21.409
 things train - and clubs 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.159
 I had not seen each other another 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:30.369
 person leaving in these things because 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:30.369
 that things 1 between me and the club 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.559
 is not true because he was coming 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:46.789
 to pin the content of being here has 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:56.449
 not asked the clubs to go out is 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:57.680
 not true the relationship with brad is good 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.330
 like other players 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:05.419
 I have a very good relationship with 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:07.719
 players jean no problems in the 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:07.719
 season 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:12.250
 the team was united for all 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:13.930
 year 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.729
 today some problems at the 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:22.539
 starts with one after the vault and 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:25.680
 well I'm happy because I want 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:28.419
 to say that they appreciate my work 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:34.600
 but I also appreciated the work of 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:46.419
 the players they did not I do not 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:55.150
 do not know I do not know we have to talk 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:59.020
 for the 3-1 solution all the choices are 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:09.539
 difficult in the end you have to take some 

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:13.710
 regions not managed by the ademe 

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:13.710
 it does not matter to achieve
