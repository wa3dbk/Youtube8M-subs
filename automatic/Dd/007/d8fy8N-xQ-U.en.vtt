00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 how briefly but clearly to talk about 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.720
 new sport 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.220
 correctly invite a couple of famous 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.070
 athletes and give them the opportunity 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.070
 try a new discipline to taste 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.900
 cross on my rival rival this 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.490
 somebody beat 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.009
 So we are pleased to introduce our 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.259
 heroes are not afraid to check yourself 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.079
 this one completely devoid of compassion for 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.570
 human body sport 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.140
 crossfit hello my name is vitalina 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.430
 forging 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.379
 I am bodybuilding champion of Russia hi 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.269
 friends my name is Mikhail Malyutin I 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.579
 professional fighter m m and 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:46.370
 I wonder who will be the first in this 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.110
 scrum mmm or bodybuilding one vital 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.910
 competitive guy who 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.100
 motivates me just to scared 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.520
 sometimes you don't want to be alone when 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.550
 see next to the force of some kind of man too 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.280
 there, too, makes it so little there 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.979
 principle winners so interesting 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.050
 or crossfit will be merciless to all 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.229
 such pain and masochism probably in this 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.020
 there is if you say smart words then 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.670
 crossfit is a training program 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.100
 consisting of constantly not 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.200
 functional exercises high 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.450
 intensity 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 ultimate goal is to prepare answers any 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.430
 life situations 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.549
 requiring active physical action 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.330
 sometimes causing shock in the competition 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.000
 participants at 800 meters in the open sea 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.430
 swimming then cycling and then running 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.780
 cross country girls steal 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.600
 this person must be ready for anything 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.880
 but bring high goals to life 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.270
 much harder than talking about it like 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.270
 we see guys have a hard time 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.070
 on no why it will dive different 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:10.090
 exercises you get used to as an exercise already 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:16.410
 do here new weight plus 30 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.410
 knitting kilogram slept heavily 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.340
 coped worked but if mikhail how 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.340
 fighter for such training is still ready 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.599
 then for vitali crossfit the real one looks like 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.569
 torture 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.610
 now just a few exercises can 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.970
 cross out everything done 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.970
 in his entire career. 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.099
 fuck get up get up go 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:56.110
 we take a video fan and you die a little 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.550
 fell over half the distance vitali 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.150
 decided to take a break 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:05.470
 apparently remembering the magic words pamping 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:10.770
 and cardio workout you are subsidized there 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:15.100
 step on you and go 26 east 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:19.870
 make such a bundle lost five minutes I 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.030
 personally still shake hands and Michael 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.060
 familiarity with crossfit decided not 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.130
 stop really blowing finished and 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.520
 bodybuilding lost to mixed 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.520
 martial arts 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.849
 as if not so champions because champions 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.290
 that no difficulties can bring them down 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:47.120
 the champions do not give up 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.140
 generally after completing the assignment in 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.540
 the process you feel not learning the dead 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.150
 look around aunt struggle as it would be 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.370
 a person tried it once 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.420
 experiencing such sensations that you could 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.520
 I don't know, maybe I can do this later 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.770
 think everything i die there we have 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.450
 training with a live example metal sysch 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.060
 training he will come and tell me me 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.530
 again though this cross species duel 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.850
 bodybuilding mixed martial arts 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:20.060
 still lost but maybe it's just 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.190
 bye and next meeting and friend 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.169
 a set of exercises details will be able to take 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:34.040
 revenge of Michael is my brushes 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:37.010
 technique mixing of course yes when you 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.070
 built while a lie on crossfit for a fighter 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.800
 it's like water for a swimmer 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.919
 he sort of melts did not train if not 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.660
 there will be water he will not be able to walk 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.790
 prepare and we too for both 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.639
 bicyclist bike itself have something 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.760
 twist it should be back saying if u 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:59.450
 Fighter's priority is hardy but he is more 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.210
 weak power vitali builder with him 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.889
 more power priority is weaker to us 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.660
 hardy principle is they will 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.289
 engage they each come to their 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.940
 to some ideal variant because 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.700
 still playing height weight 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.289
 and we can only hope that our heroes 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.570
 will find strength and time 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:21.020
 of can introduce us to others 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:24.440
 interesting sports you first 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:28.400
 do you understand how dead you are not 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.500
 functionally shade after minute 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.610
 load when exceeded 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:38.240
 then already goes on morally-willed were 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.770
 how cool cat doing at all well 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.420
 all clean 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.390
 that is, take it all 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:57.620
 but 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:06:01.660
 man stomach is black work and train 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.660
