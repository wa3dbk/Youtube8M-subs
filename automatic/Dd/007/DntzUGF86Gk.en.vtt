00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.460
 after the failure of the last chapter of the ubisoft prince saga 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.480
 has decided to retrace his steps putting aside hope 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.670
 momentarily the events that had made us meet the beautiful 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.420
 propeller 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.380
 for bike carriers so in the world of the sands of time 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.680
 the availability of the provisional version of the cer code of 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.400
 test prince of persia the forgotten sands and check in that way 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.850
 direction the ubisoft montreale team is working 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.210
 this new prince of persia will arrive on the shelves in conjunction with 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.080
 the release of the cinematographic transposition will tell says different 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.780
 from the chronological point of view it will be positioned between the first and the second 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.980
 episode of the trilogy started with essence of time and will put you like in 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.050
 you think of the prince this time trying to help the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.030
 brother malick 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.250
 and his kingdom to survive the attack of the tremendous vocation forces 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.000
 from the sands of time 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.840
 the few Italians our Lucian disposition allowed to deepen 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.180
 particularly the plot work posed the proposals appear good mixture between 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.780
 as seen in the old episodes 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.020
 the narrative style of the last chapter 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.630
 becassine here that place is told there seemed to be a good level 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.370
 although not particularly brilliant as the acting defense of the 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.220
 exciting pen characters than we were shown by the new prince and the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.220
 his partner indicates 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.800
 started the game the forgotten sands is immediately put in front of more 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.220
 big change compared to what I saw the last episode or the new one 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.870
 combat system 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.250
 the clashes have in fact abandoned the structure one on one to return 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.370
 to the extermination of enemies who will attack in large groups 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.660
 in order to have the best sinister opponents and therefore it is necessary to strive in the 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.219
 concatenation of attacks 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.389
 c'est rando you find targets to the other and counting on the great agility of the 

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:03.370
 prince 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.560
 however, to better control the attacks it will not be useful to press 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.970
 frantically the attack button is as good as maintaining a good rhythm and one 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.989
 rather cured succession of slashing stunts 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.180
 our hero will also have the powerful magic available to him 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.010
 will allow you to inflict more damage 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.400
 to be used wisely based on the type of threat that will be found to 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.509
 face up to 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.219
 linked to the elements in these allow the prince to emanate 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.359
 powerful icy bursts corresponding to each sword thrust 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.509
 increase your armor strength with stone protection and unleash 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:34.969
 a devastating leg 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.589
 will also be implemented acreid system but was not yet present 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:40.329
 in the tested marble 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.930
 the Templars and once again divided pyoman equally between fights 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.729
 long inter platform sessions 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:49.419
 also in these situations the return to the origins is felt and how much it seems 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.779
 have long been abandoned the long guided sessions seen in 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:56.419
 previous chapter info hours of complex levels full of obstacles from 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.269
 overcome purite climb and enormous devices to make work work thanks to 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.369
 your ingenuity 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:05.089
 the magical powers of the prince give him particular skill also useful in 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.819
 these breakthrough codesite time control that allows rewinding of 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.700
 some according to the timeline 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.780
 so much so to the player a second chance in case he failed 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.719
 the last step 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.979
 this power is however limited by a bar at the top left of the 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.459
 screen so that after a certain number of attempts you will be forced to repeat 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.389
 from the last checkpoint avoiding the hated immortality effect of the 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:27.849
 last episode 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.159
 during the exploration we came across a portal passed the 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.299
 which we found ourselves in a sort of alternative reality where we have 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.349
 met mystic figure who seems to be willing to help the protagonist 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.429
 providing him with valuable advice but above all interesting magical powers 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:45.599
 specifically we were given the ability to freeze water for 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.769
 some second faculties to use to overcome some particular passages 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.819
 transforming of gettin zontal pillars which hang themselves procasca fears on 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.229
 which to walk 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.829
 the designer's decidedly indulged in exploiting this 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.000
 particular fizio 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.459
 without upsetting game play but proposing rather cool situations 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:07.519
 how much proven there is so much implemented that it bodes well for this 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.519
 which will await us in the finished product 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:18.269
 places suppressed the forgotten sands ubisoft decided to abandon 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.749
 beautiful six shedines of the last chapter to propose more settings 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:24.469
 close to the style of the sands of time trilogy 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:28.199
 aesthetically the product remains however quite valid elan villa il 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.349
 graphic engine that also drives you assassin's creed there Saturday well 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.129
 implemented with regard to the design of the environments a little 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.520
 disappointing, however, at least in this version still not definitive 

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:42.299
 modeling and above all the animation of the characters but as always 

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:46.099
 we will give a definitive judgment are the bol review sites we have though 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.180
 information instead deserved duration of the main adventure 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.259
 this first in the prince of persia area the forgotten sands left us 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.150
 rather mixed feelings 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.639
 no doubt of how ubisoft has listened to the criticisms addressed to the 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.800
 previous iteration of the piston series raising of the level of 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.120
 difficulty especially with regard to the platform sections 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.430
 let me go back to the origins, it seemed to me pretty mint that i 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.360
 fights are quick hydraulic fun to play 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.599
 because you risk being repetitive only that distance 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.720
 triple from instead decidedly convinced as well as the implementation of magic 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.949
 really that exploits you that we can't wait to test the sections anymore 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.449
 advanced game 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.789
 from the aesthetic point of view the title has little to enjoy an amazing one 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.800
 sophisticated but our way of seeing a little lower than the show that 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.889
 had given us a previous episode 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.820
 exit of the game set for May 21st hours close now stay with us 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.339
 for all the updates and the inevitable review
