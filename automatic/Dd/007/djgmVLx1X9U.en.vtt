those<00:00:54.710> outside<00:00:55.579> buildings<00:00:55.940> while<00:00:56.149> the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
those outside buildings while the

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.139 
those outside buildings while the
defense's<00:00:57.620> like<00:00:57.829> that<00:00:58.010> Tesla<00:00:58.430> is<00:00:58.550> distracting

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.719 
defense's like that Tesla is distracting
with<00:00:59.360> my<00:00:59.780> gold<00:01:01.989> and<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:04.070> wizard<00:01:04.339> tower<00:01:04.550> is

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
so once you get walls broken

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.960 
so once you get walls broken
you<00:01:15.740> can<00:01:15.890> just<00:01:16.100> plow<00:01:16.490> straight<00:01:16.550> through

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970
