00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.480
 for my friends that has been me 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.070
 asking how are we going to do the 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.050
 good chocotejas is so simple and 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.940
 simple first let's start with 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.430
 the ingredients and then I'm going to tell you 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.810
 step by step how they perform good 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.760
 we need for the chocotejas 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.600
 chocolate bitter 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.530
 grated coconut 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.530
 A spatula 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.250
 manjar blanco 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.930
 and the mold for the chocotejas 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:47.750
 well let's come with the first step 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.809
 hello then the first step to do 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.269
 chocotejas first we do we put 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.250
 a pot with water that boils with this 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.220
 boiled we put the other where they are 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.020
 the chocolates 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.090
 and they are melting we do in 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.600
 bain- marie and we started to melt the 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.430
 chocolates 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.740
 whole spoon or with the spatula that 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.750
 I showed him in the beginning and we're going 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.690
 moving 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.690
 until it's finished melting 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.740
 well after so long leave the 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.010
 chocolate if it is already melting like 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.010
 they will see 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.950
 still in need has to be left 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.950
 delgadito the chocolate 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.020
 let's leave a little more after 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.610
 this 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.920
 the chocolate is going to be put in the molds 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.130
 and from there we are going to proceed with the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.130
 chocotejas 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.519
 once the chocolate is already 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.420
 melted the next step is 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.420
 incorporate it into the mold 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.400
 we incorporate it around the mold 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.010
 A) Yes 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.160
 around the mold 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.370
 [Music] 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.670
 once we put for example well 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:06.510
 apart case in the middle has to be 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.969
 Pretty chocolate is the most important thing 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.579
 and the surroundings also occupy everything 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.049
 around with chocolate does not matter the 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.880
 time that is delayed but they do not have to 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.710
 do and it will stay like this 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.700
 there has to be no gap like this 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.290
 you have to give there has to be 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.100
 holes in nothing everything has to be and 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.100
 colate 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:40.090
 already here we had to fill in the 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.520
 chocolate in the mold well we have it 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.710
 that to leave cooling a while is already in 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.080
 cold the chocolate then let's 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.260
 proceed to make the filling for the 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.150
 filling we need this the coconut that 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.769
 we had mentioned and the delicacy 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:01.220
 what we are going to do is put the delicacy 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:04.269
 in the coconut well in circles until 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.519
 fill in the dot very well there and then 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:10.390
 with a spoon we help each other and we go to 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.390
 put the little 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:20.989
 that's how we grab it and put it in the 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:23.419
 mold and so we're doing up 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.320
 fill all the holes well 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:31.360
 we have finished filling in let's go with the 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.360
 next step let's go right 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:39.879
 and we are going to fill with the chocolate 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.879
 over with the rest 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.440
 I 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.249
 the last step of our chocotejas 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.829
 it exists to remove them from the mold while 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:16.809
 the last time we did it we put him 

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:18.999
 rolling over and letting it 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:21.429
 it will cool also you can put it if 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:23.559
 they want it to cool faster in their 

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:26.999
 refrigerator I put it in the fridge and 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:26.999
 I will proceed to dismantle 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.920
 [Applause] 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.600
 delicious 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.600
 we are not going to prove how are the 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.600
 chocotejas 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:02.509
 good but it's not so rich this is all and 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.509
 I hope you liked it
