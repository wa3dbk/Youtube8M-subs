00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 a boys surfing the internet I have 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.130
 found a great thing like it 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.800
 it says more in Tuscany in practice it is 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.429
 of the DIY version of the glove 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.820
 sigma is very expensive but very cute 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.279
 which serves precisely to wash the brushes 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.949
 I will show you how to make one 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.080
 economic version simply with the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.640
 hot glue so I'll show you 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.070
 how to proceed 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.800
 you need a plastic plate or a plate 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.520
 any flat surface always in 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.730
 plastic, however, is then hot glue 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.860
 start by drawing diagonal lines 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.260
 It creates at least three files for 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.260
 enough surface to work with 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.580
 under the temples I create some kind of waves 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.360
 those of the sea will be used for the phase 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.360
 rinse 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.970
 at this point to even step dots 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.970
 them at least three end 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.000
 finally trace the straight lines 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.000
 parallel to each other 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.460
 I make sure to remove all the residues 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.140
 of remaining glue the hot glue will be 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.780
 dry in a flash and now 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.789
 I can move on to the demonstration 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.670
 just put some detergent on the 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.459
 saucer and then rowe create ours 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.530
 surface brushes on the surface 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.789
 those earpieces and special for i 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.789
 eye brushes 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.720
 at this point I step to rinse 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.950
 rinsing heroes or brushes on the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.950
 surface on order 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.370
 et voila bellelli and cleaned in a moment 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.870
 the shot surface is perfect for i 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.550
 face brushes 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.240
 let's see how it works with the brush 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.240
 for the blush 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.880
 well I would say that the images speak for 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.650
 Sun 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.370
 I really hope this video is there 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.370
 useful state
