00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
years in one game of Haven and I think

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.260 
years in one game of Haven and I think
he<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.770> only<00:01:13.979> person<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.640> actually<00:01:15.090> do

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
he is the only person to actually do

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.080 
he is the only person to actually do
this<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.810> low<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.259> SWAT<00:01:16.790> special<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.909> Haven

this in a low for SWAT special on Haven

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.700 
this in a low for SWAT special on Haven
there<00:01:18.390> could<00:01:18.539> be<00:01:18.570> other<00:01:18.810> people<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.560> honestly
