00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.080
 but also for our first round by the social 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.279
 because to bring back the mark is me 6 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.759
 so as he is criticized for not having presented art 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.589
 yes this card 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.519
 and I decided to introduce this one 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.409
 mexico did something 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.400
 so we can say that the harm is done 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.720
 my accent still does not last 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.749
 Sadly 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.660
 by the way not by the unpacking wanted to thank you 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.479
 you have made very many 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.079
 to ask us questions for now the ps had gone well and 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.940
 in Marseille 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.970
 very pleasure 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.870
 and they ran for me the recession 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.470
 I have my place 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.270
 I serve for what happened exams 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.910
 competent authorities and that you are satisfied with these results 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.810
 and invoke the earth 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.490
 before presenting why 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.280
 the 24 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.290
 it is to say 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.320
 if the subscribers who complete the whole 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
 and it's the drama that I like it's not which one to choose 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.990
 I will show you the places and could even say in the 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.910
 comments whatever you prefer like that 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.300
 whoever will have the most marked 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.190
 it's him if I have to leave 2010 I know very well that I'll find him 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.580
 the news archos so if you tell yourself that usually I will present 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.390
 until shortly 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.600
 with suspended sentence 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 I have here 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.180
 so first of all the challenge 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.440
 with icsi 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.840
 traditionally ballistic below the title something 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.020
 and that allows us to have a nice taste that will start the cards 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.280
 inside with bright colors first 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.840
 red and yellow 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.080
 those having followed the end of a master of syrte two victories so that we 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.480
 allows to have really rare 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.650
 a good idea of ​​how will the cards be inside the package 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:15.099
 we can see about kacem transfers that nest file about the risks on 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.449
 a cushion of air but guillaume coelho that's really typical but 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.449
 to explain 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.139
 given the challenges we have 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.459
 the order form will be the gap by the psg coach 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.579
 and here it reinforces the idea of ​​the century and 2 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.429
 see paris the marquee 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:36.219
 and for example house 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.359
 the key characters of power 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.129
 I really did not know 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.129
 the cold now promo 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.879
 what we can notice that at first 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.609
 see it and red 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.519
 his choice 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.659
 these brave after piece 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:05.729
 so I took 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.249
 two card games 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.249
 in a traditional paper of the istiqlal 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.800
 we have to notice that we have 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.940
 away the other 22 color is not the same 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.759
 so that's the game 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.549
 it is the card of the traditional game alas 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:23.879
 the map 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.250
 that we present and we can not miss the colors are completely 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.249
 - 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.709
 after two weeks m 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.149
 and the same then we can see that this certainly a little on the ground I 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:40.789
 could not really be very frank 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:44.739
 this is the right time for a crime just pass 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.779
 a pro-gbagbo 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.429
 we will find so nice 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.569
 little shade of color it changes 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.609
 and say that it's fine with the detected theme 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.349
 turcotte 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.279
 so then pour the rest 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.449
 so declared 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.449
 and money defense 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:08.989
 now every challenge that m 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.129
 there that clicks and different and there we can see that his eyes 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.539
 a head of a character the debates where the ch is not hurt 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.590
 as in a certain that others 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.590
 only one of the time for her what kind of person he was 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:27.949
 so rising prices and after the other three kids from his hammer 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.990
 and then we come 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.439
 other crowned heads 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.599
 you will see it's really very different and it's really nice I 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.840
 find 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.840
 so first we have the jack of spades 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.259
 the queen of spades 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.960
 the plr of fact 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.029
 I made a little think of her thomas garcia 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:01.580
 which comes at the same price 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.580
 the milking parlor 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:08.189
 and that the king would equip himself 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.900
 the valais 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.510
 the queen of hearts at the time of the weeklong strikes week to her net 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.620
 and to see more clearly 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.860
 and finally 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.860
 caen's weed 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.349
 the lady of heart 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.349
 eyi the king the earth 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.979
 so we can really good and did not pay his differences 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.490
 such a phenomenon of colors dilated as we had seen 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.930
 on pipes mostly in strange red no and I really love what 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.150
 I do 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.740
 ending m with the two brothers 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.839
 so it's still pretty mystical 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:58.469
 I close five devices so employment a little head of his group with a 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.869
 little hat 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:03.869
 the price of some frames 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.520
 so the card game is really complete and it is very interesting to 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.360
 little visual details 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.460
 and people 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.690
 between recent advances and that's why I love this game and I wanted 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.690
 to present it 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.550
 montpellier is appreciated a group of men south 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.849
 net 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:26.699
 it's just a match 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:27.729
 informed source 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.650
 it will stand out 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.379
 if the wake of the US indices 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.999
 and I was positioned defensive line and the isf he promised 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.710
 what happened 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:47.299
 secondly, this year, it does not bother me 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.379
 worldwide 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:54.330
 in the absence of treatment find well eyi
