the beautiful thing about milk paint is
it<00:01:59.409> just<00:01:59.650> it<00:01:59.770> wears<00:02:00.070> away<00:02:00.430> gently<00:02:00.820> over<00:02:01.180> time

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
it just it wears away gently over time

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.140 
it just it wears away gently over time
instead<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.650> having<00:02:02.740> blistering<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.729> peeling

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
instead of having blistering and peeling

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.850 
instead of having blistering and peeling
like<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.420> have<00:02:04.600> with<00:02:04.750> water<00:02:04.990> modern<00:02:05.440> paints

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
like you have with water modern paints

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.729 
like you have with water modern paints
which<00:02:06.580> tend<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.330> blister<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.290> peel<00:02:08.410> from<00:02:08.619> the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
which tend to blister and peel from the

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.949 
which tend to blister and peel from the
back<00:02:08.920> because<00:02:09.220> moisture<00:02:09.670> comes<00:02:10.540> through<00:02:10.840> the

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
back because moisture comes through the

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.320 
back because moisture comes through the
paint<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.410> then<00:02:11.830> pushes<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.430> plastic<00:02:12.970> skin

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
paint and then pushes the plastic skin

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.479 
paint and then pushes the plastic skin
which<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:13.959> what<00:02:14.080> most<00:02:14.650> modern<00:02:14.980> paints<00:02:15.340> are

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
which is what most modern paints are

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.550 
which is what most modern paints are
there<00:02:15.670> are<00:02:15.760> plastic<00:02:16.239> skin<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:17.019> pushes<00:02:17.410> them

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
there are plastic skin it pushes them

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.740 
there are plastic skin it pushes them
off<00:02:17.680> from<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.010> outside<00:02:18.269> just<00:02:19.269> like<00:02:19.390> when<00:02:19.660> you

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
off from the outside just like when you

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.420 
off from the outside just like when you
put<00:02:19.930> plastic<00:02:20.110> on<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.709> grass<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.250> come

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
put plastic on the grass and you come

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.380

little<00:04:11.769> streakiness<00:04:12.130> through<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.549> wood<00:04:12.730> here

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
little streakiness through the wood here

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.050 
little streakiness through the wood here
and<00:04:13.060> there<00:04:13.829> that<00:04:14.829> was<00:04:15.160> not<00:04:15.370> gonna<00:04:15.549> flow<00:04:15.880> out

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
and there that was not gonna flow out

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.339 
and there that was not gonna flow out
the<00:04:16.239> only<00:04:16.389> way<00:04:16.599> you're<00:04:16.720> going<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.930> cover<00:04:17.109> that

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
the only way you're going to cover that

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.150 
the only way you're going to cover that
is<00:04:17.889> by<00:04:18.220> doing<00:04:19.120> a<00:04:19.329> second<00:04:19.690> coat<00:04:19.870> so<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.919> first

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
is by doing a second coat so the first

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.620 
is by doing a second coat so the first
coat<00:04:21.370> might<00:04:21.609> have<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.789> little<00:04:22.060> transparency

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
coat might have a little transparency

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.629 
coat might have a little transparency
but<00:04:22.900> your<00:04:23.080> second<00:04:23.410> coats<00:04:23.590> going<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.889> be<00:04:24.010> going

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
but your second coats going to be going

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.150 
but your second coats going to be going
to<00:04:24.729> get<00:04:24.940> fully<00:04:25.270> opaque<00:04:25.780> coverage<00:04:28.289> and<00:04:29.289> no<00:04:30.130> I

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
to get fully opaque coverage and no I

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.200 
to get fully opaque coverage and no I
think<00:04:30.340> it's<00:04:30.639> going<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:30.820> be<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:30.940> beautiful

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.770 
of started getting a little amber tint
to<00:06:17.960> it<00:06:17.990> and<00:06:18.560> we<00:06:18.740> wanted<00:06:19.039> a<00:06:19.129> stark<00:06:19.460> white<00:06:19.780> paint

to<00:06:20.870> show<00:06:21.169> up<00:06:21.379> so<00:06:22.389> so<00:06:23.389> we<00:06:23.479> just<00:06:23.629> did<00:06:23.780> that<00:06:23.900> final

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.259 
to show up so so we just did that final

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.050 
to show up so so we just did that final
coat<00:06:24.409> without<00:06:24.949> any<00:06:25.099> time<00:06:25.340> well<00:06:25.550> at<00:06:25.669> all<00:06:25.789> and

coat without any time well at all and
we'll<00:06:26.870> still<00:06:27.080> get<00:06:27.169> maximum<00:06:27.680> protection

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
we'll still get maximum protection

matter<00:06:29.030> of<00:06:29.150> fact<00:06:29.360> I<00:06:29.900> think<00:06:30.229> it's<00:06:30.530> going<00:06:30.710> to

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
matter of fact I think it's going to

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.290

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:05.029 
take a look here Steve a little bit of

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:06.760 
take a look here Steve a little bit of
chalking<00:07:05.419> this<00:07:05.569> you<00:07:05.990> know<00:07:06.080> that's<00:07:06.259> typical<00:07:06.740> of

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770 
chalking this you know that's typical of

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.740 
chalking this you know that's typical of
nothing<00:07:07.190> when<00:07:07.370> it<00:07:07.460> weathers<00:07:07.729> outside<00:07:08.150> but

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.750 
nothing when it weathers outside but

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.860 
nothing when it weathers outside but
look<00:07:08.960> no<00:07:09.440> no<00:07:10.339> pigments<00:07:10.940> there's<00:07:11.449> absolutely

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
look no no pigments there's absolutely

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.899 
look no no pigments there's absolutely
nothing<00:07:12.110> coming<00:07:12.560> off<00:07:12.680> to<00:07:12.830> here<00:07:13.039> so<00:07:13.639> you<00:07:13.759> can

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:13.909 
nothing coming off to here so you can

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:15.969 
nothing coming off to here so you can
see<00:07:14.120> how<00:07:14.270> well<00:07:14.539> that<00:07:14.569> holds<00:07:15.169> even<00:07:15.650> though<00:07:15.860> it

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:15.979 
see how well that holds even though it

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:18.550 
see how well that holds even though it
wears<00:07:16.159> away<00:07:16.719> so<00:07:17.719> it<00:07:17.810> makes<00:07:17.990> a<00:07:18.139> great

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
wears away so it makes a great

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.740 
wears away so it makes a great
sacrificial<00:07:19.460> coating<00:07:19.639> that's<00:07:20.180> easy<00:07:20.389> to<00:07:20.569> touch

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
sacrificial coating that's easy to touch

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.140 
sacrificial coating that's easy to touch
up<00:07:21.020> so<00:07:21.770> this<00:07:22.159> could<00:07:22.310> actually<00:07:22.430> just<00:07:22.759> be<00:07:22.849> we

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.150
