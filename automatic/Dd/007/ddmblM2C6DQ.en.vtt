00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.550
 the 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:10.550
 Carl Zeiss measuring systems 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.590
 achieve new dimensions of flexibility in setup and measuring time 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:21.229
 With Calypso they can take any part of their test plan to any 

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:22.659
 Run time 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:27.069
 Kalypso will automatically perform the necessary actions 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:31.659
 Queen Mines Corp. Comcast changes or navigation area yet 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.920
 Kalypso offers many different ways to execute a plan 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.960
 because only certain features are to be measured "but not the entire 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.280
 Lastly, you can then mark the relevant features or function 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.490
 Only the features that you have selected are taken into account 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.430
 AZ 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.610
 The security camera function of Calyxo avoids parts collisions and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 Ensures optimal scanning performance 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.950
 Kalypso is based on the concept of the Security Council so can the software 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.580
 determine exactly 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.550
 Huber on the ios device is the second rate is Ork 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.920
 At the same time, the cast element becomes additional space as a grant 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.940
 calmly 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.000
 This navigation app provides the machine because that part of the federal tax 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.400
 to redo select selected sections of their one 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.560
 To facilitate plans they can clear selected elements as Mimi 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.560
 Storage 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.410
 Another option Pelli offers is the creation of a now end of March 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.379
 planned so that they can explain certain characteristics with their examiners 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.450
 that are related to a particular program or for the measurement 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.449
 certain parts are of importance 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.319
 they do not have to do anything 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.299
 as the required features to highlight and also Mr. 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.519
 now plans 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.479
 and do not define myself 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:35.529
 as soon as you have made a plan, it will appear in minus b 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.930
 Thanks to its intelligent functions, Carl Zeiss achieves new things with Calypso 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.519
 Dimensions of measurement flexibility
