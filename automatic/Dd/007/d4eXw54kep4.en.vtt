00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.920
 we will prepare a first raw food dish i 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.460
 ravioli with zucchini and walnuts 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.339
 cherry tomatoes the tools we will use are 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.440
 a mandolin and a food processor as far as 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:40.769
 concerns the ingredients this time 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.710
 we will not give you an express quantity 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.050
 in g we will check you in 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:54.329
 based on the number of diners 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:57.960
 so we have 2 round zucchini for the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.109
 stuffing we will use walnuts of the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.870
 piccadilly or cherry tomatoes go 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.939
 very good also cherry oil 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:13.560
 extra virgin olive pitted olives 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:17.070
 black of the capers integral sea salt o 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.909
 pink salt as you prefer and a pinch of 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.590
 you need chilli for each courgette 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.909
 the juice of a lemon 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.520
 we have two so we have 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.439
 extracted lemon juice 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.979
 first thing we will cut in half 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.560
 zucchini we will make washers 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.570
 using the mandolin the washers e 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.530
 we will only get them from the side 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.100
 central the largest part with the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.479
 which we will do the ravioli the part 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.750
 instead the end and we will use them for the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.030
 stuffing we're going to chop them together with 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.030
 rest of the seasoning we will use 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.160
 now let's marinate the washers of 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.959
 zucchini that we got 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.390
 maybe select the most beautiful ones 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:19.840
 that we don't like will keep them aside 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:22.850
 and we will still use the courgette 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:31.580
 when we crush the other ingredients 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:40.730
 for the filling we pour the lemon a 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:43.130
 pinch salt marignano in lemons 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.790
 only zucchini slices to make them 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.120
 the more you love the more flexible 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.920
 then when we make the raviolo we don't 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.510
 they will break we leave the washers a 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.190
 marinate for at least two hours we start a 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.130
 prepare the filling of our ravioli 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:09.590
 we blend in a food processor 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:15.040
 half of the chopped tomatoes a 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.040
 touch the walnuts 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.940
 the parts of the zucchini we have 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:36.310
 always discarded by removing the others 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:42.190
 oil a little chilli pepper 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:48.130
 pitted extra virgin olive oil 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:52.920
 just say look at you and salt 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.920
 integral marine just barely a physique 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:08.290
 very good we got a cream 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.950
 rather compact than just there 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.140
 it will serve to make the filling is rather 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.810
 sticky sect which will allow us to 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.729
 better close our made ravioli 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.620
 with the slices of zucchini we start a 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.039
 prepare the sauce 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.900
 all we have to do is break up the 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.720
 we have not already made small tomatoes e 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:34.930
 pour them into the container for 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:37.410
 to go and chop them right rule 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.320
 a few seconds for it must not be 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:47.680
 very homogeneous but rather crude 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:50.540
 this good sauce this is the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.500
 result to be that container 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.900
 a plate and keep aside let's do the 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:04.880
 our parmesan fruitarians chop 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:07.520
 the voices our washers of all of them 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.590
 they have finished marinating so we can 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.150
 proceed and make the moon ravioli 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:18.590
 as you can see they have become acute 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:22.550
 elastic easily malleable for each 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.760
 single robella we will put inside a 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.300
 teaspoon of filling to fall back mo 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.820
 of raviolo we drain before preparing i 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.340
 our ravioli the liquid of 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.230
 marinating that absolutely 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:40.060
 edible and very tasty then it 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.060
 you can take it as a drink 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:25.779
 we begin to present the dish 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:29.680
 arranging the ravioli in a vortex, leaving 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:41.560
 an empty central space where we will put 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:07:01.509
 the sauce I love the sauce we add 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:07:05.940
 some Parmesan capers ours 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:05.940
 Parmesan cheese obviously made like walnuts 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.279
 to finish a round of oil 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:18.339
