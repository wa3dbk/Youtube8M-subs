00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello everyone I'm parents of adn.es and 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.370
 let's make a new video of puzzles 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.930
 of guild wars 2 in this case play this 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.940
 kayak and claw extension slope 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.610
 folklore and it's fine you have to leave 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.290
 from this waypoint which is the cloud 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.210
 in extension of claw folklore in the 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.730
 Level area 115 Plains of As Forum 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.890
 where the chats and you have facing towards 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.050
 the lake and once you get here the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.300
 lake is very easy the way or 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.070
 submerge and nothing more submerged than the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.380
 right behind these plants that what 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.060
 they are covering and you will find here a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.560
 underground gallery with a few 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.870
 barracudas but good for six of them 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.210
 that do not give us a problem and when you leave 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.250
 here to the surface, you will find 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.930
 a cavern and well then here where 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.710
 you're ladders there's a wooden base 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.649
 Once here, good, we are climbing and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.980
 we are following the only way that 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.470
 there are scaffolds we jump here 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.970
 now we give another easy jump the 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.890
 next jump this here is a little 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.570
 complicated because it seems that it is short 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.050
 but it's really a long jump and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.059
 now we jump on this wooden beam 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.950
 now when we get here we have a 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.690
 I jump a bit complicated because this 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.970
 jump you have to hurry a lot 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.030
 very much very much the end of the beam 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.380
 I recommend that you use an enhancer 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.750
 speed because if you can not stay 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.970
 short and you are silent now we are going 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.030
 climbing up here we keep climbing the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.850
 scaffolding that is not unique road here 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.890
 let's go another jump this good is easy and 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.479
 here the traps start the truth is 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.960
 that here the traps put a lot 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.720
 in fact I said good good that's going to hurt 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.490
 that I have not done well since it has 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.690
 recovered now we have to continue by 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.700
 here jumps that the left does not 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.270
 go straight because you can lose 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.490
 and again for the beams here if 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.770
 we follow the only path that there are good 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.990
 and vice to go for them leave the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.149
 cave so we keep on here and 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.210
 we have to go to that floor there 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.950
 down to the top floor and here we 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.070
 we found the typical fire traps 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.690
 what was in guild wars 1 good I told myself 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.100
 let's go back to the past what this said I do not 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.970
 I'm burning I'm here chatting 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.899
 alive 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.799
 we better stay here we recover 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.019
 and now we keep going up and I find myself 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.500
 again here some platforms on the 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.420
 what to jump 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.770
 and the truth is that this part is read 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.620
 a little how the roof moves 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.960
 you say my mother and here suddenly I 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.280
 some rocks fall on me and they crush me 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.560
 good nothing that can not be solved 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.180
 some form of steam and here a site 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.990
 sure where to recover once 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.580
 recovered 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.200
 Well, those are the scales with the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.740
 that has gone up we have to continue for 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.930
 this area here and where are the 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.950
 these birds, we have to jump to 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.110
 this platform 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.819
 is a little hidden by the waterfall and 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.819
 Here we find a treasure chest 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.200
 says that is the chest of the end of 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.569
 puzzle nou because you open it and here you 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.959
 a bug of these champions appears 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.750
 well we kill him so quickly that falls 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.430
 pretty easy and then good then 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.400
 we have to look for the exit here not 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.530
 it is but we find here some 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.250
 steps with which we are going 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.900
 climbing we keep climbing here here 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.150
 the camera gets pretty close what 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.129
 which bothers pretty 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.830
 we have to keep going up a bit more 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.980
 still here there is a rung 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.220
 here another 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.830
 and here we already realize that we have 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.959
 to press that button for what then 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.340
 we go for this beam this is enough 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.989
 easy we go up here up 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.860
 and when we are arriving here 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:44.140
 we put on top of the button then it 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:47.170
 opens a door to the bottom and go around 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.240
 the fall does not have more complication 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.330
 and good when we arrived here 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.330
 jump the achievement of the chest and we can 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.010
 open it good I hope you have served 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.150
 of help and see you in the next video 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.150
 of guild wars puzzles 2
