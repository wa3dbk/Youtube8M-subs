 Why did you decide to do it?

 exercise from physical inactivity and now 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.070
 There's a lot of doubt then.

 Guess I'll answer your questions. 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.060

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.480
 Jessica Alba

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.920
 Many thanks and recently diet 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.700
 accompanied by a nutritionist and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.399
 Academy 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.190
 I'm following exactly, but I'm 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.129
 40 pounds overweight 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.570
 I wonder if I can run without 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.649
 complicate the knee which fails above 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.510
 of weight 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.660
 the first thing is to strengthen the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.699
 muscles of the legs of the thenar days with 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.170
 impact activities with 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.540
 impact activities 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.610
 so if you like running do the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.610
 one or two times at most 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.490
 during the week you start walking and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.640
 last minute of your walk you 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.799
 Run on the other days, you do. 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.330
 aerobic activities without impact and 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.880
 strengthens your muscles 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.009
 You will end up losing weight by increasing 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.900
 muscle mass and over time you will 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.579
 increasing the time of the race that 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.180
 reducing the time of the walk 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.549

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.270
 Barbecue problem no take up your 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.229

 look at protein and excess 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:24.840
 protein excess actually wants to 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.099
 end up helping in the formation of 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.950
 kidney stones 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.630

 but since you have this program 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.720
 kidney stones always count for those 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.390
