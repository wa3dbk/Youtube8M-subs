welcome to seven trumpets prepper and in
this<00:00:03.000> video<00:00:03.179> guys<00:00:03.570> I'm<00:00:04.020> going<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.440> fire<00:00:04.680> up<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
this video guys I'm going to fire up the

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.460 
this video guys I'm going to fire up the
wood<00:00:05.130> gasifier<00:00:05.730> for<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.359> first<00:00:06.600> time<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:06.960> think

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
wood gasifier for the first time I think

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.440 
wood gasifier for the first time I think
in<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.130> year<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> half<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.730> right<00:00:09.179> John

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
in a year and a half that right John

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.350 
in a year and a half that right John
yeah<00:00:10.410> about<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> year<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.340> half<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.700> think<00:00:11.730> me

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
yeah about a year and a half I think me

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.730 
yeah about a year and a half I think me
and<00:00:12.480> little<00:00:12.570> man's<00:00:12.870> working<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.620> today

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
and little man's working on it today

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.220 
and little man's working on it today
just<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.190> kind<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.429> figure<00:00:14.610> out<00:00:14.820> if<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.870> system

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
just to kind of figure out if the system

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.769 
just to kind of figure out if the system
is<00:00:16.289> still<00:00:16.500> intact<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.300> you<00:00:18.300> know<00:00:18.390> all<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.660> got

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
is still intact and you know all you got

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.570 
is still intact and you know all you got
to<00:00:18.869> do<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.260> start<00:00:19.619> your<00:00:19.770> fire<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> bottom

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
to do is start your fire in the bottom

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.580 
to do is start your fire in the bottom
on<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> first<00:00:21.210> barrel<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.779> then<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.560> just

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
on the first barrel and then we just

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.529 
on the first barrel and then we just
kind<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.160> let<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.369> wood<00:00:23.850> sticks<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.420> old

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
kind of let the wood sticks and old

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.300 
kind of let the wood sticks and old
pallet<00:00:24.900> wood<00:00:25.050> kind<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.560> feed<00:00:25.740> down<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> so

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
pallet wood kind of feed down and so

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.160 
pallet wood kind of feed down and so
what<00:00:26.430> happens<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.880> burns<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.599> gets<00:00:27.750> hot<00:00:27.930> at

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
what happens is it burns it gets hot at

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.919 
what happens is it burns it gets hot at
the<00:00:28.230> box<00:00:28.590> at<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.099> top<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.580> then<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.330> shards

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the box at the top and then the shards

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.540 
the box at the top and then the shards
drop<00:00:31.170> down<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.619> burn<00:00:31.740> at<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> bottom<00:00:32.250> too<00:00:32.399> so

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
drop down and burn at the bottom too so

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.160 
drop down and burn at the bottom too so
you<00:00:32.640> getting<00:00:32.850> heat<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.149> top<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.630> bottom<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
you getting heat at top and bottom and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.979 
you getting heat at top and bottom and
the<00:00:34.710> air<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:34.920> still<00:00:35.219> funneling<00:00:35.700> through<00:00:35.989> now

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the air is still funneling through now

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.130 
the air is still funneling through now
the<00:00:37.680> cook<00:00:38.160> box<00:00:38.430> which<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.570> actually<00:00:39.750> where<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the cook box which is actually where the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.410 
the cook box which is actually where the
gasification<00:00:40.530> takes<00:00:41.100> place<00:00:41.430> I've<00:00:42.030> noticed

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
gasification takes place I've noticed

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.479 
gasification takes place I've noticed
that<00:00:42.719> after<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.350> year<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> half<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:44.040> neglect

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that after a year and a half a neglect

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.540 
that after a year and a half a neglect
laying<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.300> apparently<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.649> cut<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
laying out here apparently we have cut a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.479 
laying out here apparently we have cut a
hole<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> pipe<00:00:48.870> maybe<00:00:49.770> from<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.250> weed

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
hole in the pipe maybe from my weed

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.860 
hole in the pipe maybe from my weed
eating<00:00:50.820> around<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.300> or<00:00:51.390> something<00:00:51.420> but

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
eating around here or something but

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.319 
eating around here or something but
anyway<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:53.370> pops<00:00:53.610> held<00:00:53.879> up<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.059> long

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
anyway that that pops held up a long

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.970 
anyway that that pops held up a long
time<00:00:54.660> that's<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> only<00:00:55.170> gaps<00:00:55.379> I'm<00:00:55.620> thinking<00:00:55.920> I

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
time that's the only gaps I'm thinking I

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.880 
time that's the only gaps I'm thinking I
just<00:00:56.219> cut<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.840> Moen<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.469> I'll<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
just cut that Moen but I'll have to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.500 
just cut that Moen but I'll have to
shorten<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> pipe<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.000> little<00:01:00.149> bit<00:01:00.270> reek

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
shorten the pipe just a little bit reek

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.439 
shorten the pipe just a little bit reek
lamp<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> box

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
lamp that and then right here on the box

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.920 
lamp that and then right here on the box
we<00:01:03.899> noticed<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.830> filter<00:01:05.070> box<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:06.720> there

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
we noticed on the filter box that there

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.510 
we noticed on the filter box that there
is<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> gap<00:01:07.320> right<00:01:07.590> there<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.010> we'll<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.340> take

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
is a gap right there so we'll just take

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.600 
is a gap right there so we'll just take
and<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:09.210> some<00:01:09.420> metalwork<00:01:09.750> metal<00:01:10.229> fittings

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
and do some metalwork metal fittings

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.950 
and do some metalwork metal fittings
refabricate<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.689> we're<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
refabricate that and then we're going to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.140 
refabricate that and then we're going to
put<00:01:13.110> kitty<00:01:13.320> litter<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.369> so

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
put kitty litter in this and so

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.300 
put kitty litter in this and so
hopefully<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.930> will<00:01:16.170> make<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> difference<00:01:16.799> as

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
hopefully that will make a difference as

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.999 
hopefully that will make a difference as
well<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.110> other<00:01:19.110> than<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.680> looks<00:01:19.710> like

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
well and other than that it looks like

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.219 
well and other than that it looks like
the<00:01:20.159> system<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.580> ok<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.299> letting<00:01:21.540> so

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the system is ok but it's letting so

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.990 
the system is ok but it's letting so
much<00:01:22.380> pressure<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.430> there<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
much pressure out here and there that it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.850 
much pressure out here and there that it
can't<00:01:24.210> force<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.720> through<00:01:24.780> because<00:01:25.500> that's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
can't force it through because that's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.890 
can't force it through because that's
the<00:01:25.979> thing<00:01:26.159> about<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.270> wood<00:01:27.570> chores

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the thing about it as the wood chores

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.920 
the thing about it as the wood chores
the<00:01:28.590> pressure<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> box<00:01:29.750> forces<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the pressure in the box forces it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.990 
the pressure in the box forces it
forward<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.700> I'll<00:01:32.790> tell<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
forward and then out and I'll tell you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.249 
forward and then out and I'll tell you
something<00:01:33.090> I'm<00:01:33.420> standing<00:01:33.869> next<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> this

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
something I'm standing next to this

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.810 
something I'm standing next to this
right<00:01:34.500> now<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.799> know<00:01:34.860> people's<00:01:35.280> commented

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
right now and I know people's commented
