00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.800
 never sit shaking like a ship 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.800
 of paper 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.700
 true 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.120
 listen without judging 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:55.309
 and so much to help you breathe 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.579
 I know what it costs to suffer for that my 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.579
 love 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.230
 I can not stand 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.350

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.030

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.720
 good 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.440
 look at the contribution men of the team 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.110
 calling 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.530
 kalimba this singer has very well 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.330
 breathe miguel breathe the level of 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.620
 breathing to sing this theme 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.400
 very lucky today we hear 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.489
 Evasion teacher's comments 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.290
 miguel that is in energy what way to 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.049
 singing you went through a difficult time 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.360
 that you overcome it is immediately 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:28.420
 you breathe and your wonderful voice came out 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.560
 I congratulate you 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.489
 jerry what is your comment thank you 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.500
 va miguel has a torrent of voice 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.170
 impressive but I feel that you 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.270
 like to express yourself more in the high register 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.090
 and in I feel that you have a bit of 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.120
 insecurity of low notes 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.910
 I think you should try that which is not 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.810
 is what you may have in your mind 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.730
 totally and that let the voice 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.319
 totally explode that you do not feel 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.000
 tied to the song you are 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.250
 limiting because it's a registration issue 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.959
 stronger seeks that and nothing I wish you 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.940
 the best move forward thank you 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.370
 by the advice of jerry teacher smokes his 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.430
 commentary 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.370
 no doubt that you have a torrent 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.260
 of euros and I think they know how to handle it 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.599
 they handle the half voices well the parties 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.489
 serious of course they are difficult 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.220
 when the tessitura is so big so 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.290
 long and you are a tenor you have 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.960
 demonstrated now I would tell you to stay 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:28.430
 quiet from 1 to 10 for me you have 12 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.930
 exceeded football expectations but 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.880
 let's listen to your coach thank you was 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.979
 a kalimba forward 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.260
 I think they have all been excellent 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.900
 the truth is that you have a 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.310
 torrent of voice you sing fascinating is 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.130
 true that you also went through a 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.070
 difficult time but you get over it is 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.870
 incredible and it is also true that it is in 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.630
 the high voice where you look so much more 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.310
 voice so we'll take care of that I eat 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.530
 coach I promise to take care of that 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.380
 part and I really believe that your voice 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.580
 It is also very striking and you have a 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.530
 Spanish naturalness in the voice that 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.960
 we should exploit to exploit to explode and 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.550
 exploit the ma let's exploit the but you 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.139
 I congratulate and you know that I am in love with 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.240
 your voice congratulations 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.800

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.330
 will take care not to leave because 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.499
 I have to ask for a vote but you do 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.479
 he wants Miguel's voice to stay 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:20.659

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:24.139
