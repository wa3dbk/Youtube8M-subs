00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
and the next major content patch what do

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.689 
and the next major content patch what do
we<00:00:21.480> do<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:22.109> can<00:00:22.289> add<00:00:22.470> new<00:00:22.680> cities<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.369> random

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
we do we can add new cities and random

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.460 
we do we can add new cities and random
locations<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.720> doesn't<00:00:25.050> have<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.289> be<00:00:25.439> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
locations but it doesn't have to be a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.980 
locations but it doesn't have to be a
real<00:00:25.769> city<00:00:26.130> just<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.820> mini<00:00:27.060> city<00:00:27.420> made<00:00:27.750> with

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
real city just a mini city made with

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.320 
real city just a mini city made with
already<00:00:28.410> in-game<00:00:28.710> objects<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.550> boxes<00:00:30.119> or

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
already in-game objects like boxes or

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.749 
already in-game objects like boxes or
trees<00:00:30.660> are<00:00:30.960> already<00:00:31.109> existing<00:00:31.740> buildings<00:00:32.520> so

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
trees are already existing buildings so

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
trees are already existing buildings so
it's<00:00:32.940> less<00:00:33.180> work<00:00:33.420> for<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.930> deaths<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
it's less work for the deaths in the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.340 
it's less work for the deaths in the
city<00:00:35.130> could<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.460> reused<00:00:36.059> NPCs<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.260> they

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
city could have reused NPCs so they

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.049 
city could have reused NPCs so they
don't<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.860> design<00:00:38.250> new<00:00:38.489> ones<00:00:38.760> like

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
don't have to design new ones like

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.750 
don't have to design new ones like
Arthas<00:00:39.600> or<00:00:39.840> Hager<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.770> random<00:00:41.190> people<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
Arthas or Hager just random people and

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.090 
Arthas or Hager just random people and
they<00:00:42.149> give<00:00:42.329> fun<00:00:42.629> quests<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:43.170> treasure<00:00:43.620> hunts
