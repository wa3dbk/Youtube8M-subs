okay<00:00:01.700> I've<00:00:01.820> done<00:00:02.030> some<00:00:02.239> research<00:00:02.389> and<00:00:02.899> the

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.290 
okay I've done some research and the

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.150 
okay I've done some research and the
most<00:00:03.469> amazing<00:00:03.800> thing<00:00:04.279> is<00:00:04.520> is<00:00:04.730> this<00:00:05.390> is<00:00:06.160> my

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
most amazing thing is is this is my

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.330 
most amazing thing is is this is my
homemade<00:00:07.669> battery<00:00:08.389> it<00:00:08.750> will<00:00:08.780> produce<00:00:09.050> half<00:00:09.980> a

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
homemade battery it will produce half a

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.789 
homemade battery it will produce half a
volt<00:00:10.750> can<00:00:11.750> you<00:00:11.809> hold<00:00:11.960> this<00:00:12.049> woman<00:00:12.380> moans<00:00:12.559> I'll

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
volt can you hold this woman moans I'll

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.950 
volt can you hold this woman moans I'll
get<00:00:12.920> the<00:00:13.009> multimeter<00:00:13.719> okay

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
get the multimeter okay

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.900 
get the multimeter okay
keep<00:00:15.740> it<00:00:15.860> on<00:00:15.980> there<00:00:16.189> get<00:00:16.369> down<00:00:16.550> there<00:00:16.760> really

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
keep it on there get down there really

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:26.019 
keep it on there get down there really
get<00:00:17.119> certified<00:00:17.480> see<00:00:17.779> your<00:00:18.710> multimeter<00:00:25.000> so<00:00:26.000> I

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
get certified see your multimeter so I

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.970 
get certified see your multimeter so I
need<00:00:26.359> to<00:00:26.480> produce<00:00:26.630> a<00:00:26.869> half<00:00:27.109> of<00:00:27.289> all<00:00:27.470> just<00:00:27.800> using

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
need to produce a half of all just using

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.429 
need to produce a half of all just using
saltwater<00:00:28.580> but<00:00:29.480> I<00:00:29.570> want<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:29.810> find<00:00:29.990> a<00:00:30.080> family<00:00:30.230> I

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
saltwater but I want to find a family I

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.970 
saltwater but I want to find a family I
guess<00:00:30.619> lack<00:00:30.859> of<00:00:31.009> better<00:00:31.160> word<00:00:31.369> catalyst<00:00:32.980> so

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
guess lack of better word catalyst so

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.560 
guess lack of better word catalyst so
I'm<00:00:34.190> thinking<00:00:34.610> about<00:00:34.700> trying<00:00:34.970> you're<00:00:35.450> in

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
I'm thinking about trying you're in

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.630 
I'm thinking about trying you're in
human<00:00:36.110> urine<00:00:36.260> because<00:00:36.950> if<00:00:37.160> you<00:00:37.250> ever<00:00:37.370> got<00:00:37.520> to

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
human urine because if you ever got to

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.530 
human urine because if you ever got to
get<00:00:37.760> off<00:00:37.880> the<00:00:38.030> grid

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
get off the grid

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.390 
get off the grid
how<00:00:38.930> you<00:00:38.990> gonna<00:00:39.170> produce<00:00:39.350> a<00:00:39.770> way<00:00:40.010> to<00:00:40.070> store

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
how you gonna produce a way to store

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.050 
how you gonna produce a way to store
your<00:00:40.430> energy<00:00:41.710> okay<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:42.770> if<00:00:43.370> I<00:00:43.490> put<00:00:43.700> on<00:00:43.850> here

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
your energy okay so if I put on here

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.480 
your energy okay so if I put on here
from<00:00:44.900> the<00:00:45.020> most<00:00:45.200> meteor<00:00:45.470> on<00:00:45.500> see<00:00:46.160> it<00:00:46.280> reads

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.490 
from the most meteor on see it reads

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.010 
from the most meteor on see it reads
zero<00:00:46.850> nothing<00:00:47.210> say<00:00:47.810> nothing<00:00:48.850> okay<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.570> we're

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
zero nothing say nothing okay so we're

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.810 
zero nothing say nothing okay so we're
gonna<00:00:51.110> set<00:00:51.380> this<00:00:51.500> meter<00:00:51.770> right<00:00:52.580> here<00:00:53.530> okay<00:00:54.820> so

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
gonna set this meter right here okay so

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.640 
gonna set this meter right here okay so
everybody<00:00:56.120> can<00:00:56.180> see<00:00:56.390> it<00:00:56.420> now<00:00:57.050> we're<00:00:57.470> going<00:00:57.590> to

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
everybody can see it now we're going to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.050 
everybody can see it now we're going to
produce<00:00:57.800> a<00:00:58.070> half<00:00:58.310> a<00:00:58.430> volt<00:00:58.670> out<00:00:58.850> of<00:00:58.970> this

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
produce a half a volt out of this

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.490 
produce a half a volt out of this
battery<00:00:59.530> okay<00:01:05.050> seeing<00:01:06.050> on<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.290> meter

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
battery okay seeing on the meter

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.620 
battery okay seeing on the meter
producing<00:01:07.280> half<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.490> volt<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.060> I<00:01:08.180> built<00:01:08.450> this

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
producing half a volt and I built this

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.680 
producing half a volt and I built this
less<00:01:08.930> than<00:01:09.170> three<00:01:09.410> minutes<00:01:09.560> ago
