00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.349
 there is no protection to go fuck no 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:13.790
 can happen because there is no door I want 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.790
 take the chest is mine not 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.639
 Clear 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.510
 and that I also had with me mn in front of 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.279
 Jakarta in another video because here they 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.099
 I bring a new minecraft tutorial 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.779
 xbox 360 or precision 3 proceed as 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.910
 they noticed and the introduction a 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.020
 invisible door this is how 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.699
 they heard how they used accounts 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.680
 basically the outline a door that 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.360
 it looks very innocent but something that to the 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.550
 time we try to pass as you know 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.410
 account there is something that inhabits me is more 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.059
 should say to my good friend invited and 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.550
 Subscriber that will be accompanied here 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.019
 in this video rigby troll pro that can 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.760
 Greetings numbers as I told you before is 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.350
 a great friend and subscriber and well 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.729
 let's tell him what happens he runs up 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.070
 the chest to see that I'm not 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.839
 bullfighting now they have the particles that 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.720
 they are running but then you can not 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.119
 get to the chest and well that's not going to 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.130
 the invisible door now we give the 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.409
 button share in account that you hear 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.390
 the pistons down the bottom we enter and 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.340
 how will they realize the magic happens like this 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.590
 it's gentlemen I just walk the button 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.970
 door is already accessible and it may be that 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.220
 not be very useful to deceive others 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.869
 friends or something like that we go back to 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.430
 press the button and press find the 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.619
 Revilla can not leave and he does not 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.090
 come in then as I told you it's a good 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.440
 way to thunder your friends so that 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.440
 do not enter your base is a good way 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.390
 of him 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.360
 I do not know how to simply protect your things from 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.910
 modes or something like that and well 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.970
 we go that the tutorial the materials that 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.330
 they will need are redstone two 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.300
 network torches are two repeaters two 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.870
 normal non-adhesive pistons a fence 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.030
 a button then it is mandatory the 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.530
 carpet since if you see is in a 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.780
 carpet of the color that you want 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.160
 but if they need a carpet and the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.380
 block with which they will build the 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.150
 material of your choice so we're not going 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.340
 to start the first thing they are going to do is 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.830
 want to put a redstone there where 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.440
 you want from your map then to the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.780
 right and left of this redstone 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.510
 let's put two repeaters one for 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.700
 here and another one here once they have 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.250
 this we are going to put blocks to the part of 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.190
 the repeaters like this we're going to put two 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.440
 glued torches attached to the blocks 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.080
 one of your torches we are going to put 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.800
 another block on top of the torches and 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.020
 something like that will fall 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.250
 and then let's put the good piston a 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.730
 piston a fence a block and then a 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.170
 last piston and they will have something like that 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.300
 Well basically here is your mechanism 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.890
 what you have to do is climb 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.750
 this redstone wherever you want if it is that 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.940
 they want it on the outside of their 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.320
 world or if they want it from their world their 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.700
 door or if you want it looking towards 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.260
 no that's already inside of you decision 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.790
 in my case, I will be doing it 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.710
 out this is for example that 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.360
 you did not them out then what 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.080
 What I'm going to do here is put a 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.700
 quickie button then you can 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.130
 can come to generate this redstone that 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.290
 you have here and can put a 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.180
 button a lever or something that activates the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.880
 rest not then how do you realize 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.070
 you press the button and change the fence 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.990
 to the block we press the button again and 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.550
 change from the block to the fence and then in 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.110
 that's what basically consists of your 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.910
 door what you are going to do is that they are going to 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.380
 make an outline around your fence 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.230
 or the block they have there if it is 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.210
 block go and as you will know the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.370
 most of you will know one can not 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.650
 walk through something if there is a 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.810
 go there then for example or here not 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.650
 I can put a block quoted so let's go 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.280
 to grab something 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.250
 daddy 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.140
 to see if I find it here we are this 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.970
 then as many of you will know 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.800
 if we put a fence and then we put 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.050
 some little boats like that we will not be able to 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.209
 go through more than run or not 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.740
 Now if we press the button as 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.720
 will account will come out what was the 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.209
 block with this block we are going to be able to 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.739
 pass normally and all that now for 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.319
 disguise this what we are going to do is 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.840
 put a rug in back as you give 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.860
 account there is the block we change the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.660
 I 'm a mess because I can not take them and you 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.370
 realize that the pistons sound and 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.930
 change the fence then we can not 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.750
 pass as it will be done against my friend 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.340
 richard troyer could not pass and so 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.870
 good is basically that in what 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.180
 consists of the door once they have already 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.769
 created because they can simply close their 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.900
 door can decorate it like you 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.720
 want in can put their base in 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.190
 your house auction team ops you know that 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.800
 you can get creative with what 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.440
 that you want 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.879
 and this is good they can even trolle 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.820
 his friends as I said at the beginning of 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:33.530
 video for 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.150
 to say as well as nothing that does not 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.410
 you can go to my house or something like that 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.630
 well nothing to give as well as good and 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.280
 because I can not pass now what I 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.050
 I recommend a lot is to hide the vote 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.940
 put a lever out there hidden from 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.320
 done I have a very good video of a 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.300
 hidden lever I recommend you also 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.550
 put that if they want to be 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.320
 discreet and that's how you realize 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.120
 he pressed the button past the fence to 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.370
 block and we can pass and it's basically 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.660
 that in what consists the door as it 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.820
 will take into account does not use almost anything 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.110
 materials is very simple to make and 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.060
 it works very well in whatever it was 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.730
 survival as well as books that's 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.670

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.950
