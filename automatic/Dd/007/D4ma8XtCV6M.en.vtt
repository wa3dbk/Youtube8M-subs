00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
butter into a bowl and then if you can

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.810 
butter into a bowl and then if you can
just<00:00:39.360> beat<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.809> together<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.770> little<00:00:41.610> bit

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.850 
just beat that together with little bit
of<00:00:41.969> vanilla<00:00:42.450> extract<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.170> two<00:00:43.500> types<00:00:43.770> of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
of vanilla extract and two types of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.590 
of vanilla extract and two types of
sugar<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.129> got<00:00:44.250> brown<00:00:44.460> sugar<00:00:44.489> noise<00:00:45.180> show<00:00:45.420> beat

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
sugar we got brown sugar noise show beat

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.080 
sugar we got brown sugar noise show beat
that<00:00:45.719> together<00:00:45.930> too<00:00:46.289> smooth<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.920> white<00:00:47.850> sugar

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
again just soften at room temperature

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.210 
again just soften at room temperature
for<00:03:23.019> a<00:03:23.200> few<00:03:23.410> minutes<00:03:23.650> just<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.099> can

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
for a few minutes just so you can

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.770 
for a few minutes just so you can
actually<00:03:24.340> work<00:03:24.669> with<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:25.060> but<00:03:25.269> as<00:03:25.389> much<00:03:25.510> in<00:03:25.720> the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
actually work with it but as much in the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.420 
actually work with it but as much in the
middle<00:03:25.959> as<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.139> like<00:03:26.319> but<00:03:26.799> about<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.220> much

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
middle as you like but about that much

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.970 
middle as you like but about that much
is<00:03:27.700> kind<00:03:28.329> of<00:03:28.419> right<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:29.169> ratio<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.590> chocolates

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
is kind of right to ratio the chocolates

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.370 
is kind of right to ratio the chocolates
lemon<00:03:30.340> put<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:30.940> other<00:03:31.060> one<00:03:31.180> on<00:03:31.239> top<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.750> then

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
lemon put the other one on top and then

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.960 
lemon put the other one on top and then
you<00:03:32.590> need<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.739> try<00:03:32.950> neat<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.400> up<00:03:33.549> a<00:03:33.639> little<00:03:33.730> bit

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
you need to try neat it up a little bit

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.030 
you need to try neat it up a little bit
by<00:03:34.630> just<00:03:34.660> kind<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:34.959> scraping<00:03:35.410> around<00:03:35.470> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
by just kind of scraping around the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.530 
by just kind of scraping around the
outside<00:03:36.400> now<00:03:36.669> when<00:03:36.790> it's<00:03:36.910> this<00:03:37.030> soft<00:03:37.329> it<00:03:37.480> will

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
outside now when it's this soft it will

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.330 
outside now when it's this soft it will
try<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.870> squeeze<00:03:38.109> out<00:03:38.260> everywhere<00:03:38.650> but

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
try and squeeze out everywhere but

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.680 
try and squeeze out everywhere but
that's<00:03:39.430> fine<00:03:39.790> because<00:03:40.239> then<00:03:40.419> they<00:03:40.510> can<00:03:40.629> go

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
that's fine because then they can go

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.509 
that's fine because then they can go
onto<00:03:41.079> a<00:03:41.139> plate<00:03:41.379> at<00:03:41.799> this<00:03:42.010> point<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.459> goes

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
onto a plate at this point that goes

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.400 
onto a plate at this point that goes
back<00:03:42.819> into<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.419> freezer<00:03:43.660> again<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.139> set<00:03:44.290> them

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
back into the freezer again to set them

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.750 
back into the freezer again to set them
up<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:44.530> they're<00:03:44.680> easier<00:03:45.099> to<00:03:45.129> eat<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.400> they<00:03:45.609> can

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
up so they're easier to eat and they can

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.430 
up so they're easier to eat and they can
stay<00:03:45.940> in<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.090> freezer<00:03:46.329> for<00:03:46.690> up<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.900> months<00:03:47.260> and

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
stay in the freezer for up to months and

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.020
