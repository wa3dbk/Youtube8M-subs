00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.299
 good friends of killer hackers 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.119
 today I made this video drink it 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:21.160
 explain how to create a partition in 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.380
 to install a good operating system 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.190
 I state that it will be a very easy thing 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.190
 to do 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:32.430
 hello very easy because they will be few 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.230
 passages in fact I did it on purpose 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.079
 don't give up very difficult things 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.800
 Well let's start then first 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:46.230
 we have on start and we write about about 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.230
 I create information 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.420
 there 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.370
 disk partitions ve with the already 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.399
 exit above so we click that 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.930
 form coalitions of writings 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:09.400
 we wait for the classroom to open one 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.030
 new window named after 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.280
 disk management here we can modify 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.830
 create women can extend some 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.560
 partitions decided to install the 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.869
 operational or just to put us 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.330
 documents that c the partition number 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.440
 with the letter there will be what 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.110
 we must take 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.600
 in consideration we had to use this 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.100
 then create a partition we do 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.850
 right on this rectangle we do 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.800
 reduces even without ever installing the 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.970
 very heavy operating system type 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.150
 windows 7 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.630
 16 so below it will be better to give 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:58.260
 a space of about 50 gb so I had more 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.110
 space to install programs 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.750
 now we wait to have the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.470
 determination in space 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.470
 it will take some time 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.680
 I don't know when it will still take then 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.680
 we'll pause to see we'll do it 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:29.070
 well did he finish here in the third 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.440
 section will ask us to insert the 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.750
 lap number we want to expand into 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.590
 In this case we put 50 nominations 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.380
 here they are worth 50 gb ie 1000 m b fu 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.520
 then 50 lilies would be 50 thousand 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.040
 mt 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.040
 let's make them look forward 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.900
 pauses 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.480
 well here it was formed now 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.870
 let's click on those new auditions 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.820
 in black 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.290
 let's make a new one right 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.130
 that simple before 50,000 health care 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.130
 let f 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.560
 well here we have to leave everything like this 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.240
 system files we put ntfs because ex 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.970
 fat would be another kind of 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.770
 formatting for data entry 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.180
 small sizes we leave default 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.770
 volume label we write for example 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.180
 I want to install windows 7 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.590
 perform quick formatting that 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.970
 will employ less than the government instead 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.150
 making the video 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.450
 let's move forward from today we wait a while 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.020
 the partition here is here now 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:50.000
 forming here windows 7 was created 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.610
 in ntfs and livid this partition will come 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.110
 open here as 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:00.370
 and here we can insert the given id and then 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:04.190
 he is marching well friends of Lazio and Rome 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.319
 this is better to get hold of 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.280
 I like to subscribe to the channel yes there is 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.280
 enjoyed dancing
