00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
generalization which means the dog will

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.169 
generalization which means the dog will
generalize<00:00:09.559> the<00:00:10.580> different<00:00:11.580> items<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.000> we

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
generalize the different items that we

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.570 
generalize the different items that we
might<00:00:12.389> be<00:00:12.540> using<00:00:12.960> as<00:00:13.620> long<00:00:13.889> as<00:00:14.040> he<00:00:14.130> has<00:00:14.280> some

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
might be using as long as he has some

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.340 
might be using as long as he has some
sense<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.059> familiarity<00:00:15.660> within<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
sense of familiarity within the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.680 
sense of familiarity within the
environment<00:00:16.650> or<00:00:17.400> within<00:00:17.760> your<00:00:18.090> interaction

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
environment or within your interaction

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.500
