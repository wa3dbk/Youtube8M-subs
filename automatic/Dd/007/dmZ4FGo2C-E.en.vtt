advantages of cell phones is that you

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.350 
advantages of cell phones is that you
can<00:00:55.379> take<00:00:55.559> them<00:00:55.710> almost<00:00:55.890> anywhere<00:00:56.360> but

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
can take them almost anywhere but

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.599

was<00:01:51.329> wondering<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.899> thought<00:01:52.259> about<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.500> bit<00:01:52.619> a

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
was wondering I thought about a bit a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.679 
was wondering I thought about a bit a
bit<00:01:52.710> smaller<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.270> does<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.540> fit

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
bit smaller but it's it's it does it fit

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.020 
bit smaller but it's it's it does it fit
into<00:01:54.840> pocket<00:01:55.200> oh<00:01:55.590> yes<00:01:55.920> indeed<00:01:56.189> are<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.579> try

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
into pocket oh yes indeed are you try

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:06.570 
into pocket oh yes indeed are you try
and<00:01:57.149> carry<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.390> there<00:01:57.479> over<00:01:57.630> time

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.830 

yeah<00:02:07.580> we<00:02:07.730> will<00:02:07.910> tailored<00:02:08.210> suit<00:02:08.390> accommodates

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
yeah we will tailored suit accommodates

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.530 
yeah we will tailored suit accommodates
it<00:02:08.930> quite<00:02:09.110> nice<00:02:09.260> it<00:02:09.410> does<00:02:09.590> suit<00:02:10.399> especially

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
it quite nice it does suit especially

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.220 
it quite nice it does suit especially
