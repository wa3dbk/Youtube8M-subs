is<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> i<00:01:35.490> think<00:01:35.729> everybody<00:01:36.240> that's<00:01:36.479> what<00:01:36.689> buy

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
is the i think everybody that's what buy

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.840 
is the i think everybody that's what buy
this<00:01:37.020> thing<00:01:37.259> has<00:01:37.619> been<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.950> where<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:38.700> i<00:01:38.790> get

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
this thing has been like where do i get

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.060 
this thing has been like where do i get
that<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.420> yeah<00:01:39.750> where<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.320> i<00:01:40.409> buy<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.619> TV<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that like yeah where do i buy the TV and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.530 
that like yeah where do i buy the TV and
I<00:01:41.159> think<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:41.490> because<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.909> clarity<00:01:42.360> does

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
I think it's because the clarity does

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.450 
I think it's because the clarity does
when<00:01:42.750> you're<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.439> about<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:43.799> maybe<00:01:43.979> 16

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
when you're this is about what maybe 16

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.300 
when you're this is about what maybe 16
this<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.850> 65<00:01:45.360> inches<00:01:45.689> right<00:01:45.990> baby<00:01:46.290> yeah<00:01:46.439> and

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
this is 65 inches right baby yeah and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.800 
this is 65 inches right baby yeah and
it's<00:01:47.430> curved<00:01:47.670> yeah<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> things<00:01:48.659> I

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
it's curved yeah one of the things I

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.690 
it's curved yeah one of the things I
wasn't<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.170> believer<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.710> curved<00:01:49.979> right<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
wasn't a believer in curved right and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.310 
wasn't a believer in curved right and
but<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:50.880> I've<00:01:51.299> become<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.049> believer

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
but now I've become more of a believer

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.990 
but now I've become more of a believer
but<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.619> want<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> talk<00:01:53.070> about<00:01:53.100> two<00:01:53.399> things<00:01:53.610> one

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
but I want to talk about two things one

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.380 
but I want to talk about two things one
the<00:01:54.509> real<00:01:54.689> benefit<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.259> curb<00:01:55.560> yep<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.130> 24<00:01:57.119> k

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the real benefit to curb yep and 24 k

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.070 
the real benefit to curb yep and 24 k
because<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.290> content

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
because the content

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.840 
because the content
porque<00:01:59.620> but<00:01:59.860> let's<00:02:00.100> about<00:02:00.280> curve<00:02:00.580> let's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
porque but let's about curve let's

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.430 
porque but let's about curve let's
talk<00:02:00.970> about<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.270> curve<00:02:01.450> first<00:02:01.690> us<00:02:01.960> so<00:02:02.140> we<00:02:02.260> did

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
talk about the curve first us so we did

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.410 
talk about the curve first us so we did
we<00:02:02.560> made<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.890> curve<00:02:03.130> TV<00:02:03.550> to<00:02:03.970> make<00:02:04.120> it<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.270> more

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
we made the curve TV to make it a more

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.970 
we made the curve TV to make it a more
immersive<00:02:04.630> experience<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.650> what<00:02:05.830> we're<00:02:05.950> doing

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
immersive experience so what we're doing

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.530 
immersive experience so what we're doing
is<00:02:06.280> we're<00:02:06.430> bringing<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.760> edge<00:02:06.880> of<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.150> TV<00:02:07.510> and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
is we're bringing the edge of the TV and

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.840 
is we're bringing the edge of the TV and
closer<00:02:07.870> to<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.590> really<00:02:08.890> get<00:02:09.040> extra<00:02:09.550> depth

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
closer to you to really get extra depth

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.430 
closer to you to really get extra depth
so<00:02:10.149> right<00:02:10.420> really<00:02:10.750> it's<00:02:10.899> like<00:02:10.960> in<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.200> movie

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
so right really it's like in the movie

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.470 
so right really it's like in the movie
theater<00:02:11.770> exactly<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.490> see<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:12.820> you<00:02:13.060> see<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.300> in

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
theater exactly you see it you see it in

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.970 
theater exactly you see it you see it in
the<00:02:13.540> movie<00:02:13.810> theaters<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.200> lot<00:02:14.500> with<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.770> curve

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
the movie theaters a lot with the curve

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.010 
the movie theaters a lot with the curve
sprint<00:02:15.280> right<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:16.210> really<00:02:16.660> giving<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:16.990> extra

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
sprint right so really giving that extra

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.690 
sprint right so really giving that extra
depth<00:02:17.470> but<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.770> other<00:02:17.950> thing<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.340> does<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.520> it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
depth but the other thing it does is it

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.060 
depth but the other thing it does is it
opens<00:02:19.120> up<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.840> seating<00:02:20.230> area<00:02:20.380> so<00:02:20.740> someone

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
opens up the the seating area so someone

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.250 
opens up the the seating area so someone
sitting<00:02:21.280> sort<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:22.030> walking<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.540> left<00:02:22.810> is

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
sitting sort of walking to the left is

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.720 
sitting sort of walking to the left is
going<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.590> get<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.740> direct<00:02:24.010> view<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:24.550> right

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
going to get a direct view on that right

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.400 
going to get a direct view on that right
side<00:02:25.000> of<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.180> TV<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:25.690> there's<00:02:25.840> no<00:02:25.990> extreme

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
side of the TV so there's no extreme

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.930 
side of the TV so there's no extreme
angle<00:02:26.770> so<00:02:26.920> no<00:02:27.040> one<00:02:27.160> wants<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.430> be<00:02:27.520> too<00:02:27.670> far<00:02:27.880> off

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
angle so no one wants to be too far off

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.670 
angle so no one wants to be too far off
angle<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:28.570> right<00:02:28.750> curved<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.320> going<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.500> make

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
angle so right curved is going to make

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.500 
angle so right curved is going to make
the<00:02:29.890> person<00:02:30.220> sitting<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.730> sweet<00:02:30.970> spot<00:02:31.210> happy
