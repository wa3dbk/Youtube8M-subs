about<00:00:02.370> doing<00:00:03.060> 2d<00:00:03.480> in<00:00:04.190> lightwave<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.400> how<00:00:05.940> much

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
about doing 2d in lightwave and how much

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.760 
about doing 2d in lightwave and how much
actually<00:00:06.359> would<00:00:06.509> be<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.200> scared<00:00:07.649> to

death of doing ik so i think ik boost

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.660 
death of doing ik so i think ik boost
will<00:00:11.639> be<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.120> cool<00:00:12.300> thing<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.570> do<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.990> and

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
will be the cool thing to do that and

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.990 
will be the cool thing to do that and
all<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.730> need<00:00:15.089> do<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.809> set<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.529> up<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:17.000> i'll

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
all you need do to set this up is i'll

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.790 
all you need do to set this up is i'll
go<00:00:18.240> for<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.570> or<00:00:18.690> keep<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.050> video<00:00:19.380> short<00:00:19.740> as

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
go for it or keep the video short as

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.490 
go for it or keep the video short as
possible<00:00:19.859> but<00:00:20.369> basically<00:00:21.230> right<00:00:22.230> I'm<00:00:22.320> this

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
possible but basically right I'm this

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.400 
possible but basically right I'm this
particular<00:00:23.119> model<00:00:24.119> thing<00:00:24.449> I'll<00:00:24.660> sort<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.260> like

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
particular model thing I'll sort of like

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.460 
particular model thing I'll sort of like
chuck<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.990> it's<00:00:27.990> nothing<00:00:28.230> special

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
chuck this in and it's nothing special

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.169 
chuck this in and it's nothing special
but<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:29.010> gets<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> point<00:00:29.730> across<00:00:29.820> pretty

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
but it just gets the point across pretty

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.720 
but it just gets the point across pretty
quickly<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.890> if<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.399> go<00:00:32.520> over<00:00:32.550> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
quickly and this is if I go over to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.970 
quickly and this is if I go over to
modeler<00:00:33.210> these<00:00:34.050> are<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.410> separate<00:00:34.770> layers

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
modeler these are on all separate layers

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.010 
modeler these are on all separate layers
so<00:00:35.280> each<00:00:35.430> part<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.120> object<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
so each part of the object is on a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.150 
so each part of the object is on a
separate<00:00:37.350> layer<00:00:37.500> they've<00:00:37.710> all<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:37.950> their<00:00:37.980> own

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
separate layer they've all got their own

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.220 
separate layer they've all got their own
little<00:00:38.190> pivot<00:00:38.670> points<00:00:38.969> set<00:00:39.149> up<00:00:39.270> very<00:00:39.899> quickly

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
little pivot points set up very quickly

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.780 
little pivot points set up very quickly
and<00:00:40.469> really<00:00:40.680> badly<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> show<00:00:41.760> you

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
and really badly but just to show you

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.650 
and really badly but just to show you
what<00:00:41.989> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:45.170> one<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.200> que<00:00:46.670> se<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:47.969> UV

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
what you can do and one I que se one UV

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.450 
what you can do and one I que se one UV
map<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.110> whole<00:00:49.260> thing<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.559> grabbed<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
map for the whole thing just grabbed and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.459 
map for the whole thing just grabbed and
there<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.420> go<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.379> back<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.829> lay<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:53.850> again

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
there you go so back to lay out again

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.680 
there you go so back to lay out again
what<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:56.969> your<00:00:57.360> base

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
what you do is you get your your base

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.439 
what you do is you get your your base
object<00:00:58.140> you're<00:00:58.949> sort<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.370> your<00:00:59.879> route<00:01:00.210> object

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
object you're sort of your route object

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.660 
object you're sort of your route object
so<00:01:01.170> basically<00:01:01.440> everything<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.980> parented

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
so basically everything is parented

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.219 
so basically everything is parented
there's<00:01:03.059> no<00:01:03.149> bones<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.719> by<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.930> way<00:01:03.989> it's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
there's no bones in this by the way it's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.500 
there's no bones in this by the way it's
just<00:01:04.379> linking<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.489> everything<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.090> parented

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
just linking so everything is parented

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.160 
just linking so everything is parented
right<00:01:06.750> back<00:01:06.990> down<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.890> body<00:01:08.310> itself<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.479> to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
right back down to the body itself so to

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
right back down to the body itself so to
set<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.770> booth<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.220> select<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> root

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
set up like a booth you select the root

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
set up like a booth you select the root
which<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.270> body<00:01:12.570> cuz<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> thing<00:01:13.560> that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
which is body cuz that's the thing that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.050 
which is body cuz that's the thing that
everything's<00:01:13.950> linked<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.369> basically<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
everything's linked to basically and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.810 
everything's linked to basically and
then<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.110> go<00:01:16.290> press<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.650> ok<00:01:17.040> boo<00:01:17.220> stool<00:01:17.549> here

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
then you go press the ok boo stool here

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
then you go press the ok boo stool here
then<00:01:18.360> you're<00:01:18.509> right<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.810> click<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.200> go<00:01:19.259> up

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
then you're right and click and go up

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.760 
then you're right and click and go up
like<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.950> boost<00:01:20.369> after<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.659> you'll<00:01:22.170> sort<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
like a boost after that you'll sort of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950 
like a boost after that you'll sort of
set<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.490> go<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.150> there's<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.450> few<00:01:24.630> things<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
set up to go but there's a few things I

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.039 
set up to go but there's a few things I
would<00:01:25.380> go<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> start<00:01:26.580> would<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:27.049> at

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
would go and do for a start would be at

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.899 
would go and do for a start would be at

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
lock now it means I can rotate it that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.950

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
down and up or can just go and rotate

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.000 
down and up or can just go and rotate
the<00:03:07.709> head<00:03:07.920> back<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.709> sort<00:03:10.950> of

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
the head back of it and that is sort of

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.260 
the head back of it and that is sort of
that<00:03:11.220> really<00:03:11.640> it's<00:03:11.820> not<00:03:11.940> not<00:03:12.239> really

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
that really it's not not really

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.060 
that really it's not not really
difficult<00:03:12.989> with<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.230> um<00:03:14.510> yes<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.870> setting<00:03:16.770> up<00:03:16.890> ik

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
difficult with it um yes I setting up ik

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.190 
difficult with it um yes I setting up ik
using<00:03:18.030> ik<00:03:18.330> booster<00:03:18.810> for<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.050> particular

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
using ik booster for this particular

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.600 
using ik booster for this particular
thing<00:03:19.790> pretty<00:03:20.790> simple<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.360> think<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:22.530> lot<00:03:23.190> less

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
thing pretty simple I think a lot less

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.259 
thing pretty simple I think a lot less
painful<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.560> using<00:03:25.560> standard<00:03:26.130> ik<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.850> having

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
painful and using standard ik and having

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.900 
painful and using standard ik and having
all<00:03:27.420> flipping<00:03:27.989> out<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.380> doing<00:03:29.100> staff<00:03:29.550> things

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
all flipping out and doing staff things

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.660 
all flipping out and doing staff things
so<00:03:30.660> for<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.019> particular<00:03:31.140> idea<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:31.920> think<00:03:32.400> it's

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
so for this particular idea I think it's
