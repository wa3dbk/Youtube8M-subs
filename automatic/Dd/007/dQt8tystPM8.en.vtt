to<00:03:35.260> keep<00:03:35.380> it<00:03:35.530> as<00:03:35.680> authentic<00:03:35.890> as<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.459> could<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:36.820> I

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
to keep it as authentic as I could so I

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.280 
to keep it as authentic as I could so I
kept<00:03:37.150> stuff<00:03:37.329> like<00:03:37.510> saggy<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.049> stuff<00:03:38.230> because

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
kept stuff like saggy and stuff because

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.020 
kept stuff like saggy and stuff because
even<00:03:38.590> on<00:03:38.709> his<00:03:38.860> real<00:03:39.070> Matt<00:03:39.310> they<00:03:39.489> they<00:03:39.730> added

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
even on his real Matt they they added

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.250 
even on his real Matt they they added
him<00:03:40.120> right<00:03:40.299> there<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:40.630> there's<00:03:40.900> no<00:03:41.079> way<00:03:41.200> you

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
him right there so there's no way you

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.229 
him right there so there's no way you
can<00:03:41.500> add<00:03:41.739> him<00:03:41.860> in<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.040> deck<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:43.000> really

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
can add him in the deck and I really

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.850 
can add him in the deck and I really
like<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.510> thought<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.200> deck<00:03:44.440> still<00:03:44.650> has

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
like to thought that this deck still has

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.500 
like to thought that this deck still has
his<00:03:44.980> weak<00:03:45.190> monsters<00:03:45.640> like<00:03:45.790> that<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.180> mean<00:03:46.360> it's

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
his weak monsters like that I mean it's

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.479 
his weak monsters like that I mean it's
so<00:03:46.690> weird<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.049> think<00:03:47.079> that<00:03:47.320> he<00:03:47.620> used<00:03:47.890> a<00:03:48.130> soggy

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
so weird to think that he used a soggy

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.550 
so weird to think that he used a soggy
even<00:03:49.060> though<00:03:49.180> it's<00:03:49.329> not<00:03:49.480> like<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.690> 1900<00:03:50.440> which

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
even though it's not like a 1900 which

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.650 
even though it's not like a 1900 which
is<00:03:50.709> always<00:03:50.950> about<00:03:51.190> power<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:51.760> everything<00:03:51.970> so

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
is always about power and everything so

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.210 
is always about power and everything so
I<00:03:52.690> really<00:03:52.959> like<00:03:53.079> is<00:03:53.230> like<00:03:53.410> it's<00:03:53.620> really<00:03:53.859> like<00:03:54.190> a

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
I really like is like it's really like a

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.099 
I really like is like it's really like a
