00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.759
 what's up addicted to youtube today we're 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.949
 in a hole also field that you edition 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.260
 of how to get all the reds for 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.020
 the sheep 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.370
 Well the first thing we have to have 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.800
 it will be a few blocks of lapis lazuli 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.550
 and each block of about seven a 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:45.180
 how many yellow plants 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.150
 about ten radishes says radishes 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.070
 There are a few chapters 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.020
 the lapis lazuli blocks and I think if 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.500
 seven each 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.350
 if they are seven and then we go to the table 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.100
 from kraft eo we were going to need a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.170
 fairy dust 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.370
 and we will have the first dye that is 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.030
 like a blue 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.330
 a blue that was short a blue under the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.180
 sky 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.830
 and then this is the first and the second 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.390
 dye is achieved with plants 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.040
 yellow aquitania all plants 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.330
 around about 10 plants but I 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.610
 just hold and we will have the dye 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.180
 yellow 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.020
 hello I'm not going to speak English and here 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.179
 we have the second dye 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.729
 and here is the heavy but it is also a 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:45.640
 dye is a navy blue dye we're going 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.460
 for the are radishes and this is the color 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.200
 Red 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.600
 and if it is the color red rose rose online 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.909
 with the red color we could get the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.250
 most of the dyes and the others that 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.740
 have shown 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:06.320
 and then a few and for the fourth the 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.320
 order to see where we have around 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.890
 5k cactus or 6 depends on how many that 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.670
 they will make and burn them in the same 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.310
 the table today in the oven 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.730
 it says fast going down to our block that 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.850
 we put down and 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.990
 here we are are burning 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.990
 and so they give us 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.359
 from here, nothing more 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.180
 and can remove all this not 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.630
 we can get it because we still do not know 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.610
 how to get the ink wad 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.380
 get changing the gray wool 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.830
 how do you get left in the 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.830
 comments 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.100
 and here we already have the majority of all 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.030
 the reds with bags I do not know what 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.560
 color be the prediction this is the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.710
 first that the first color that you 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.500
 I taught this is a short green is the 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.850
 magenta that remove the characters the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.510
 pink orange red 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.750
 and then spain most 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.010
 and his sheep will be very colorful 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.890
 now it 's mine to have proof 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.680
 he is telling me that he was not painting 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.670
 he liked his white color 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.670
 everyone sees them 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.470
 I do not know how to get it because I'm missing 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.470
 the ink stride that gives the squid 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.459
 we already have a few 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.920
 and here are the cocoa 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.940

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.230

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.459
 and let me punish another red for 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.459
 and get the other color 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.070
