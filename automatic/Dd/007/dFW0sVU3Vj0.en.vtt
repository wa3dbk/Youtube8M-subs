package<00:00:36.620> easiest<00:00:37.620> place<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.860> practice<00:00:38.520> how<00:00:39.180> to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
package easiest place to practice how to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.930 
package easiest place to practice how to
do<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:40.170> rust<00:00:40.710> where<00:00:41.190> we're<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.850> right

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
do it is in rust where we're going right

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.170 
do it is in rust where we're going right
now<00:00:42.379> you<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.590> hold<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.430> care<00:00:44.610> package<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
now you just hold the care package and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.790 
now you just hold the care package and
you<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.360> over<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:46.140> push<00:00:46.379> right<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.620> your

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you go over and then push right on your

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.619 
you go over and then push right on your
d-pad<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.610> take<00:00:47.969> out<00:00:48.090> your<00:00:48.239> care<00:00:48.450> package

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
d-pad to take out your care package

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.369 
d-pad to take out your care package
again<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.289> use<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.480> then<00:00:51.480> once<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.870> throw<00:00:52.230> it

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
again and use it then once you throw it

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.920 
again and use it then once you throw it
you<00:00:53.059> won't<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.180> anything<00:00:54.390> there<00:00:54.719> anymore

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you won't have anything there anymore

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.439 
you won't have anything there anymore
but<00:00:55.289> once<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.980> pick<00:00:56.129> up<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.820> care<00:00:57.120> package

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
but once you pick up the care package

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.900 
but once you pick up the care package
and<00:00:57.600> use<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.500> will<00:00:58.530> again<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> care

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
and use it you will again have a care

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.420 
and use it you will again have a care
package<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.109> used<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
package this can be used with the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.939 
package this can be used with the
killstreak<00:01:03.149> care<00:01:03.390> package<00:01:03.899> sent<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.589> gun<00:01:04.769> or

emergency airdrop cause you get like for

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.480 
emergency airdrop cause you get like for
care<00:01:10.140> packages<00:01:10.170> out<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.250> need<00:01:11.430> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
care packages out of it and just need to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
care packages out of it and just need to
pick<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:11.790> one<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.240> use<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.350> will<00:01:13.530> do

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.080 
pick up one and use one and you will do
it<00:01:13.830> again<00:01:13.890> hi<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.119> go<00:01:15.240> see<00:01:15.810> easy<00:01:17.090> as

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the easiest way to do it is to find an

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.660 
the easiest way to do it is to find an
obstacle<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.070> walk<00:01:23.280> over

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
obstacle like that so you can walk over

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.399 
obstacle like that so you can walk over
it<00:01:25.939> but<00:01:26.939> uh<00:01:26.970> okay<00:01:27.450> here<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.320> to

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
it but uh okay here we go I'm going to

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.010 
it but uh okay here we go I'm going to
pick<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.920> care<00:01:29.490> package<00:01:29.840> counter<00:01:30.840> UAV

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
pick up this care package counter UAV

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.780 
pick up this care package counter UAV
use<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.619> DC<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.070> at<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> bottom<00:01:32.610> right<00:01:32.640> I

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
use in DC right at the bottom right I

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.520 
use in DC right at the bottom right I
got<00:01:33.090> another<00:01:33.270> care<00:01:33.509> package<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.110> I'm<00:01:34.200> able<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
got another care package and I'm able to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.600 
got another care package and I'm able to
throw<00:01:35.130> another<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:36.860> what's<00:01:37.860> also<00:01:38.070> neat<00:01:38.490> about

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
