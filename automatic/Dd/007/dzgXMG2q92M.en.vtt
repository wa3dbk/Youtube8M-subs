 Joachim Peter's son found that patients had sleep disorders

 and that's okay 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.300
 a three-minute phone call with the phone is enough that Google and radical

 If they are suddenly aligned magnetically then stick the

 Langenhagener means this charge is lost or is affected

 through the electromagnetic field 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.350
 that means when such a conglomerate flows through small vessels

 Finally, we look at the changes in the brain that we do

 Ratcliffe praises but if we look at a rat as the radiation
