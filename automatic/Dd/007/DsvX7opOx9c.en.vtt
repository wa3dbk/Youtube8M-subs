the<00:00:11.900> first<00:00:12.139> thing<00:00:12.290> we<00:00:12.380> need<00:00:12.500> to<00:00:12.559> do<00:00:12.799> is<00:00:13.129> to<00:00:13.309> get

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
the first thing we need to do is to get

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.730 
the first thing we need to do is to get
the<00:00:13.549> car<00:00:13.730> to<00:00:13.760> a<00:00:13.910> safe<00:00:14.179> place<00:00:14.440> there's<00:00:15.440> a<00:00:15.530> risk

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
the car to a safe place there's a risk

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.500 
the car to a safe place there's a risk
that<00:00:15.889> damage<00:00:16.430> to<00:00:16.580> the<00:00:16.700> tire<00:00:16.910> certainly<00:00:17.360> if<00:00:17.420> you

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
that damage to the tire certainly if you

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.970 
that damage to the tire certainly if you
drive<00:00:17.720> a<00:00:17.750> car<00:00:18.050> when<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:18.349> tire<00:00:18.529> is<00:00:18.710> flat<00:00:18.860> but

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
drive a car when the tire is flat but

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.740 
drive a car when the tire is flat but
the<00:00:19.189> most<00:00:19.369> important<00:00:19.910> thing<00:00:20.029> is<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:20.450> location

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
the most important thing is the location

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.120 
the most important thing is the location
right<00:00:21.080> where<00:00:21.290> you're<00:00:21.410> going<00:00:21.560> to<00:00:21.680> change<00:00:21.919> the

right where you're going to change the
tire<00:00:22.340> is<00:00:22.550> somewhere<00:00:22.880> that's<00:00:23.060> safe<00:00:23.270> ideally<00:00:24.230> it

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
tire is somewhere that's safe ideally it

should<00:00:24.349> be<00:00:24.680> flat<00:00:24.950> or<00:00:24.980> as<00:00:25.369> flat<00:00:25.610> as<00:00:25.640> possible

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
should be flat or as flat as possible

we've<00:02:58.129> still<00:02:58.370> got<00:02:58.549> on<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:58.849> car<00:02:59.120> an

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
we've still got on this car an

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.539 
we've still got on this car an
indication<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.500> where<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.680> put<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.069> jack<00:03:01.310> and

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
indication of where to put the jack and

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.759 
indication of where to put the jack and
we've<00:03:02.359> still<00:03:02.569> got<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.750> lie<00:03:02.930> wheels<00:03:03.200> but<00:03:03.530> in<00:03:03.620> this

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
we've still got a lie wheels but in this

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.500 
we've still got a lie wheels but in this
case<00:03:03.980> there<00:03:04.220> are<00:03:04.370> plastic<00:03:04.579> caps<00:03:05.090> over<00:03:05.419> the

case there are plastic caps over the

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.330 
case there are plastic caps over the
walnuts<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.349> when<00:03:06.500> we<00:03:06.590> go<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.739> put<00:03:06.889> our<00:03:07.189> wheel

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
walnuts so when we go to put our wheel

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.429 
walnuts so when we go to put our wheel
brace<00:03:07.549> off<00:03:07.760> we<00:03:08.480> might<00:03:08.659> be<00:03:08.689> surprised<00:03:09.169> to<00:03:09.260> find

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439
