00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.380 
also I want to dial back my ytp lengths
I<00:01:03.020> feel<00:01:03.830> that<00:01:04.040> my<00:01:04.280> white<00:01:04.489> EPS<00:01:04.910> for<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.180> past

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
I feel that my white EPS for the past

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.900 
I feel that my white EPS for the past
few<00:01:05.870> years<00:01:05.930> have<00:01:06.530> been<00:01:06.560> becoming<00:01:07.160> longer<00:01:07.760> and

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
few years have been becoming longer and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.760 
few years have been becoming longer and
longer<00:01:08.030> in<00:01:08.330> length<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:08.810> I'm<00:01:09.170> beginning<00:01:09.470> to

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
longer in length and I'm beginning to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.219 
longer in length and I'm beginning to
feel<00:01:10.010> restricted<00:01:10.700> by<00:01:11.000> this<00:01:11.060> length<00:01:11.570> president

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
feel restricted by this length president

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.590 
feel restricted by this length president
since<00:01:12.770> restriction<00:01:13.340> is<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.670> last<00:01:14.000> thing<00:01:14.360> you

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
since restriction is the last thing you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.930 
since restriction is the last thing you
want<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:14.840> feel<00:01:15.080> as<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.350> YouTube<00:01:15.770> pooper<00:01:16.190> I<00:01:16.400> have

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
want to feel as a YouTube pooper I have

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.910 
want to feel as a YouTube pooper I have
decided<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.420> revert<00:01:17.810> back<00:01:17.840> to<00:01:18.350> shorter<00:01:18.740> white

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
decided to revert back to shorter white

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.580 
decided to revert back to shorter white

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
EPS about three to four minutes this

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.590 
EPS about three to four minutes this
should<00:01:21.890> also<00:01:22.070> increase<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.729> frequency<00:01:22.970> at

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
should also increase the frequency at

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.990 
should also increase the frequency at

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
which I upload and also give me greater

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.469 
which I upload and also give me greater
variability<00:01:26.510> of<00:01:27.020> sources<00:01:27.740> but<00:01:28.610> before<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.180> I

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
variability of sources but before that I

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.590 
variability of sources but before that I
do<00:01:29.690> have<00:01:30.229> one<00:01:30.560> final<00:01:31.010> massive<00:01:31.759> project<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.450> do

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
do have one final massive project to do

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.710 
do have one final massive project to do

subscribers so what is the source well

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.660 
subscribers so what is the source well
it's<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:41.780> secret<00:01:41.930> for<00:01:42.290> now<00:01:42.320> but<00:01:42.710> it<00:01:43.100> will<00:01:43.430> be

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
it's a secret for now but it will be

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.310 
it's a secret for now but it will be
revealed<00:01:43.970> when<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.420> project<00:01:44.869> is<00:01:44.990> nearing

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
revealed when the project is nearing

revealed when the project is nearing
completion<00:01:45.500> I<00:01:46.220> don't<00:01:46.850> really<00:01:46.970> have<00:01:47.270> an

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
completion I don't really have an

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.780 
completion I don't really have an
estimated<00:01:48.380> upload<00:01:48.920> date<00:01:49.160> at<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:49.460> point

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
estimated upload date at this point

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.210 
estimated upload date at this point
because<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.899> project<00:01:51.320> is<00:01:51.500> really<00:01:51.830> abstract

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
because the project is really abstract

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.779 
because the project is really abstract
for<00:01:53.000> now<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:54.350> plan<00:01:54.680> to<00:01:54.710> continuously<00:01:55.550> work

on it throughout the summer

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.740 
on it throughout the summer
unfortunately<00:01:58.430> this<00:01:58.610> means<00:01:58.820> no<00:01:59.149> new<00:01:59.390> poops

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
