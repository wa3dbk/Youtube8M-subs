 hello everyone here speller hd and today you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.529
 I'm going to teach how to pass an image to 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.389
 pixelar how is this for minecraft worth 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.870
 and for that, we're just going to need this 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.180
 program that 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.830
 you will have the description and the 7 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.200
 it will have but also what 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.869
 first let's open the kabul spider 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.380
 point jr is worth that will leave you in the 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.860
 folder that you will get when extracting the 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.020
 file and here we give proust and 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.700
 we look for the image that we want to pass to 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.960
 visit in this case I'm going to put the 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.790
 peak 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.160
 and there you have it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.580
 and to pass it to microsoft we give here 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.960
 a craig craft minecraft blueprint and how 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.940
 You see here we have the picacho 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.789
 these are the minecraft blocks worth 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.590
 but I 'm going to do it like that because if I do not 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.140
 It would take a lot to load but if you want it 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.010
 do in a more detailed way still you 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.769
 you give here not 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.309
 no width or height limits and 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.309
 create it 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.800
 As you can see it is almost identical with the 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.190
 image but they are also blocks of 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:17.970
 minecraft then I 'm worth it so that 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.970
 I'm going to do it at 50/50 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.400
 that looks a little weird like that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.300
 I'm going to let him put 80 as dependents 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.880
 80 80 for 80 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.550
 and so you can already appreciate something of 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.740
 picacho we will not save it 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.740
 and we are going to put for example the chub 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.810
 chris the art 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.970
 we close here and now we open the emshi 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.970
 edit 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.690
 we give it here and we are going to load a world 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:04.220
 here is what I had done before 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.910
 and it's worth here is the world or if they go to the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.910
 area of the earth 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.800
 we wait for him to charge a little 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.800
 to the diet 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.349
 let's move the player this does not 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.549
 you have to respect but I'm going to put 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.549
 here for what 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.810
 so that it looks good and we give here to 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.560
 import we go where we keep our 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.620
 project and we open it here is 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.250
 and here as you see we have our pikachu 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.540
 that we are going to put for example here 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.540
 we give here to import 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:50.400
 ok and now here we give save 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.189
 as you see here is loading 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.200
 and it would already be saved our pixel 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.230
 we're going here here to close the program 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.420
 and now we just open our 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.360
 Minecraft 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.410
 and good once inside minecraft like 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.510
 you can see now there is chopped 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.970
 this is our import that we made 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.970
 from the edit emshi and the farther 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.920
 be better we will see it in a 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.520
 obviously limit 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.520
 and good 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.270
 there is our picacho wait we are going to 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.420
 turn off the clouds 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.150
 close vale so it looks better 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.300
 and nothing this is going to come very well for the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.860
 servers or to just hang out 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.470
