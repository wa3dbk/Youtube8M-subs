the wide receiver of your scoring nine
more<00:03:03.940> points<00:03:04.299> than<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.540> wide<00:03:04.780> receiver<00:03:05.260> of

more points than the wide receiver of
your<00:03:05.440> opponent<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.510> hope<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:08.079> illustrates

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
your opponent so I hope that illustrates

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.550 
your opponent so I hope that illustrates
that<00:03:08.859> the<00:03:09.519> most<00:03:09.700> valuable<00:03:10.030> player<00:03:10.269> is<00:03:10.659> the<00:03:11.409> one

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
that the most valuable player is the one

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.349 
that the most valuable player is the one
who<00:03:11.739> out<00:03:12.010> scores<00:03:12.400> their<00:03:12.640> positions<00:03:13.209> other

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
who out scores their positions other

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.819 
who out scores their positions other
starting<00:03:14.049> players<00:03:14.230> about<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.590> greatest

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
starting players about the greatest

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.659 
starting players about the greatest
number<00:03:15.159> of<00:03:15.190> points<00:03:16.919> but<00:03:17.919> that<00:03:17.980> example<00:03:18.400> was

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:18.669 
number of points but that example was

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.610 
number of points but that example was
just<00:03:18.940> for<00:03:19.150> one<00:03:19.180> week<00:03:19.329> we're<00:03:20.169> talking<00:03:20.530> about

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
just for one week we're talking about

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.629 
just for one week we're talking about
value<00:03:21.130> for<00:03:21.340> an<00:03:21.400> entire<00:03:21.669> fantasy<00:03:22.239> season<00:03:22.480> and

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
value for an entire fantasy season and

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.370 
value for an entire fantasy season and
calculating<00:03:24.639> value<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.269> is<00:03:25.690> actually<00:03:26.169> pretty

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
calculating value it is actually pretty

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.030 
calculating value it is actually pretty
easy<00:03:26.470> it's<00:03:27.099> not<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.340> highly<00:03:28.030> complicated

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
easy it's not a highly complicated

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.550 
easy it's not a highly complicated
formula<00:03:30.040> or<00:03:30.099> equation<00:03:30.989> but<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.109> need<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.290> lot

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
formula or equation but you need a lot

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.039 
formula or equation but you need a lot
of<00:03:32.709> information<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.400> calculate<00:03:33.639> value<00:03:34.329> you

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
of information to calculate value you

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.930 
of information to calculate value you
need<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.319> create<00:03:35.709> or<00:03:36.010> get<00:03:36.190> projected<00:03:36.400> stats

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
need to create or get projected stats

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.180

for every player who might get drafted

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.909 
for every player who might get drafted
need<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.120> factor<00:03:40.450> in<00:03:40.569> your<00:03:40.720> league<00:03:40.900> size<00:03:41.319> both

need to factor in your league size both

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.099 
need to factor in your league size both
number<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.370> teams<00:03:42.609> and<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.629> starting

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.960 
positions played and the scoring system
into<00:03:46.930> those<00:03:47.049> projections<00:03:47.669> you<00:03:48.669> need<00:03:48.849> to

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
into those projections you need to

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.550 
into those projections you need to
determine<00:03:49.419> a<00:03:49.480> baseline<00:03:49.930> for<00:03:50.139> each<00:03:50.290> player

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
determine a baseline for each player

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.400 
determine a baseline for each player
from<00:03:50.889> which<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:52.480> can<00:03:52.629> use<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.959> baseline<00:03:53.379> to

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
from which you can use the baseline to

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.860 
from which you can use the baseline to
calculate<00:03:53.949> every<00:03:54.220> player's<00:03:54.459> value<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.150> then

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
calculate every player's value and then

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.300 
calculate every player's value and then
you<00:03:55.959> need<00:03:56.079> to<00:03:56.199> rank<00:03:56.349> all<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.650> players<00:03:56.859> both

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
you need to rank all the players both

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.879 
you need to rank all the players both
overall<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:58.299> by<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.169> respective<00:03:59.799> positions
