00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
and then she's gonna tap monitor right

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.539 
and then she's gonna tap monitor right
there<00:01:37.600> there's<00:01:38.350> also<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.709> noise<00:01:38.979> gate<00:01:39.280> if<00:01:39.429> I

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
there there's also a noise gate if I

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.070 
there there's also a noise gate if I
wanted<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:39.819> turn<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.179> on<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.509> eliminate<00:01:40.899> some

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
wanted to turn that on to eliminate some

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.080 
wanted to turn that on to eliminate some
background<00:01:41.530> noise<00:01:41.679> so<00:01:42.429> now<00:01:42.580> that<00:01:42.640> she's<00:01:42.909> there

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
background noise so now that she's there

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.850 
background noise so now that she's there
she<00:01:43.270> can<00:01:43.420> do<00:01:43.509> a<00:01:43.539> little<00:01:43.840> one<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.200> one<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.560> test

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
she can do a little one to one to test

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.430 
she can do a little one to one to test
for<00:01:45.069> us<00:01:45.100> check<00:01:45.850> one<00:01:46.090> two<00:01:46.240> testing<00:01:46.869> one<00:01:47.049> two<00:01:47.080> and

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
for us check one two testing one two and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.350 
for us check one two testing one two and
I<00:01:47.590> can<00:01:47.740> see<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.069> audio<00:01:48.340> levels<00:01:48.700> there<00:01:48.909> they

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
I can see the audio levels there they

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.270 
I can see the audio levels there they
weren't<00:01:49.630> too<00:01:49.869> hot<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.380> she's<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:50.950> little<00:01:51.130> bit

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
weren't too hot and she's a little bit

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.100 
weren't too hot and she's a little bit
far<00:01:51.580> away<00:01:51.759> from<00:01:51.819> it<00:01:52.090> but<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.450> want<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:52.929> simulate

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
far away from it but I want to simulate

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.590 
far away from it but I want to simulate
the<00:01:53.560> effect<00:01:54.159> of<00:01:54.310> using<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:54.759> in<00:01:54.939> a<00:01:55.030> hotel<00:01:55.390> room

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
the effect of using this in a hotel room

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.969 
the effect of using this in a hotel room
or<00:01:55.899> in<00:01:56.020> some<00:01:56.200> place<00:01:56.380> where<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.649> don't<00:01:56.799> have

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
or in some place where you don't have

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.770 
or in some place where you don't have
access<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.430> your<00:01:57.640> mic<00:01:57.820> stands<00:01:58.359> and<00:01:58.509> all<00:01:58.570> that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
access to your mic stands and all that

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.840 
access to your mic stands and all that
your<00:01:58.899> great<00:01:59.079> stuff<00:01:59.380> just<00:02:00.100> want<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.820> know

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
your great stuff just want to you know

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.760 
your great stuff just want to you know
simulate<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.600> carrying<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.140> Apogee<00:02:02.560> mic

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
simulate you carrying the Apogee mic

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.950 
simulate you carrying the Apogee mic
with<00:02:03.070> you<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.399> Apogee<00:02:03.789> one<00:02:04.000> throwing<00:02:04.840> those

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
with you the Apogee one throwing those

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.719 
with you the Apogee one throwing those
things<00:02:05.259> into<00:02:05.500> your<00:02:05.619> laptop<00:02:05.829> bag<00:02:06.280> bringing

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
things into your laptop bag bringing

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.490 
things into your laptop bag bringing
your<00:02:06.909> iPad<00:02:07.390> with<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:07.719> and<00:02:07.899> going<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.289> you

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
your iPad with you and going and you

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.870 
your iPad with you and going and you
know<00:02:08.679> you've<00:02:08.920> got<00:02:09.039> an<00:02:09.160> idea<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.579> you<00:02:09.640> want<00:02:09.670> to

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
know you've got an idea and you want to

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.819 
know you've got an idea and you want to
lay<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.090> down<00:02:10.149> so<00:02:10.869> let's<00:02:11.079> turn<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.380> gain<00:02:11.530> up<00:02:11.680> on

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
lay it down so let's turn the gain up on

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.110 
lay it down so let's turn the gain up on
the<00:02:11.920> microphone<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.370> little<00:02:12.430> bit<00:02:12.640> on<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.910> side

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the microphone a little bit on the side

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.270 
the microphone a little bit on the side
there<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:13.720> got<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.870> little<00:02:14.049> gain<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.620> she<00:02:15.130> can

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
there just got a little gain and she can

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.849 
there just got a little gain and she can
check<00:02:15.459> her<00:02:15.579> levels<00:02:15.850> again<00:02:16.109> check<00:02:17.109> one<00:02:17.380> testing

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
check her levels again check one testing

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.170 
check her levels again check one testing
one<00:02:18.070> two<00:02:18.100> there<00:02:18.760> we<00:02:18.850> go

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
one two there we go

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.030 
one two there we go
that's<00:02:19.359> a<00:02:19.480> little<00:02:19.630> better<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.560> now<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:20.769> she's

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
that's a little better so now that she's

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.340 
that's a little better so now that she's
all<00:02:21.220> set<00:02:21.489> up<00:02:21.670> I'm<00:02:22.150> gonna<00:02:22.329> have<00:02:22.570> her<00:02:22.720> record<00:02:23.140> a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
all set up I'm gonna have her record a

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.319 
all set up I'm gonna have her record a
simple<00:02:23.530> vocal<00:02:24.010> track<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.609> we<00:02:24.700> can<00:02:24.880> try<00:02:25.269> it

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
simple vocal track so that we can try it

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.300 
simple vocal track so that we can try it
out<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.690> then<00:02:25.780> we'll<00:02:26.350> see<00:02:26.500> how<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.769> goes<00:02:26.950> from

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
out and then we'll see how it goes from

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:50.350 
out and then we'll see how it goes from
there

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.210 

so<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:51.990> that<00:02:52.110> easy<00:02:52.260> we've<00:02:52.860> recorded

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
so it's just that easy we've recorded

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.460 
so it's just that easy we've recorded
it's<00:02:53.730> all<00:02:53.940> set<00:02:54.240> we're<00:02:54.660> ready<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.050> edit<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.440> and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
it's all set we're ready to edit it and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.940 
it's all set we're ready to edit it and
maybe<00:02:56.130> add<00:02:56.340> some<00:02:56.580> effects
