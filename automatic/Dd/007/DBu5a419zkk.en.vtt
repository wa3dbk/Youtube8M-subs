00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.430
 halli hello hello yes a little info 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.469
 video via via to the gamescom 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.690
 is right in front of the door we have 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.699
 Today Sunday means one more week 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.780
 and then two more days and then 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:20.250
 Wednesdays and Thursdays it starts but 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.490
 wednesday german are available 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.020
 we already cologne so you have yes 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.480
 now quite a long time on the video 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.310
 We have been waiting a long time 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.570
 said that a video is planned it has 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.279
 everything took a while 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.379
 yes, everything was my fault more or 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.329
 we say less so I always am 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.229
 not yet we have here it feels better 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.609
 but it still stands 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:46.409
 yes tell me one man you can foresee it 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:50.670
 gets better and then I would say 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:53.969
 gamescom will survive technically for 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.559
 be possible in things he for the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.120
 he does not know that he has one 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.129
 quite a problem with the muscles 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.989
 that runs from the last down 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.449
 and he could do the last days now 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.250
 partly as good deal and it was 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.450
 I would say that cruelly 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.430
 that's why it's a miracle that I'm here 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.240
 usually still stand at all 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.310
 on the way like quasimodo but so far 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.780
 is it actually me? 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.100
 now here in the forest could climb that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.109
 video here yes because the good decided 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.149
 Now then for a week first 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.460
 go so that he is really recovered 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:31.399
 he just that i recovered in the gamescom 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.500
 comes totally relaxed and leaves 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.700
 Just child Gustav is this year 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.950
 probably not there 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.329
 the house arrest was the but it was the 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.859
 come with and the whole constant 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.640
 which also includes we have 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.640
 probably everyone 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.750
 we have made t shirts again 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.979
 as you see , dressed up 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.890
 I convinced him that one on 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.619
 gordon freeman in civilian power because i 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.900
 I also did a little something 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:16.150
 shepherd and porsche point 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.830
 except on saturday i will be there with the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.480
 be on the road because other than t shirt 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.670
 with the addition of playtech software 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.530
 and other t-shirt and should of course 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.480
 different 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.660
 if we say now we want to 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.680
 times are possible in principle 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.870
 thursday is still a bit 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.670
 first of all yes, first, what is planned 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.130
 secondly we want to own the first 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.200
 Turn gamescom upside down and first 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.470
 Let's see what's all this new hull 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.349
 It's a bit up to everything 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.910
 of course not friday is pure 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.860
 theoretically totally open 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.450
 exactly on saturday you have to stop 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.360
 look Saturday you can do it once 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.250
 like to look on my facebook page 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.290
 there's big on the gangster stage 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.570
 play teams then meet from 15 o'clock 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.630
 I'll probably meet pretty much 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.340
 be present because then we both 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.090
 pretty present near the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.670
 stage to the 1 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.230
 of course, at least I do not believe in 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.230
 the values lady of course 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.690
 Maybe I can talk about your people 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.000
 him that you have always read carefully 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.130
 best you write us when we get started 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.530
 write over because of the meeting 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.630
 youtube on if it does not work now 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.819
 facebook or something on youtube is for us 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.950
 actually the easiest way around 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.600
 mobile on the mobile nerd 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.310
 just answer there is little 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.829
 somewhere that you also know that 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.180
 it's really about us getting involved 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:52.079
 meet just write a pn with the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:54.790
 title gamescom 2013 meet or something 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.620
 The main thing is you can be clear 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.030
 realize that is quite specific 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:04.680
 and um and meet because yes then you can 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.030
 we add a bit of control 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.830
 answer comments and falls instantly 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.629
 a bit flat on the gamescom there 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.120
 Of course we do not know how to do it either 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.760
 are peppered with the internet 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.109
 where gamescom has one last year 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.180
 Now you have a few problems 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.459
 that was not quite the case with the internet 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.789
 Clarke actually did that 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.220
 mainly those with this weird one 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:29.320
 coolgardie voda went online 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.570
 We agree with the tablet below 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.390
 we had actually rather less 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.520
 also with the case with the qr codes 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.830
 But that's all right that was in the middle of 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.720
 the hall so basically there we yes 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.599
 sinful smokers are and again and again 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.800
 be outside with you 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.240
 safety again and again the mobile phone 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.650
 You can always check the question 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.300
 if you write if we will be the same 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.470
 five minutes later answer it 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.260
 or maybe it's only in the evening 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.710
 hotel is so it must have at least one 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.530
 half an hour lead time if you plan 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.050
 says the hour 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.880
 Of course, hour if you meet one 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.860
 but mainly want to organize 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:11.260
 Then we sammer then we are to the 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:14.300
 time here and there and then in itself 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:18.310
 his on 24 is likely to be curious 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.310
 to give a special sequence on a canal 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.970
 new good next week from 12 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.430
 A little bit away that will be me 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.419
 Comments are not as swift as normal 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.310
 can answer 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.629
 just as I supplement colleague 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.940
 comes on tour like me 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.930
 that's why that's not the case 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:47.300
 permanent damage 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:49.580
 but somehow gamer also prevent 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.590
 can go out yes we have extra 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.930

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.159

 from the laptop war i'm sorry you 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.770
 then pulled on the hair in the car 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.520
 Inside the trunk, they are so short 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.919

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.960
