20 volume which is a six percent now you
can't<00:01:59.770> just<00:01:59.920> do<00:02:00.009> it<00:02:00.100> with<00:02:00.189> a<00:02:00.250> generic<00:02:00.640> this<00:02:01.479> is

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
can't just do it with a generic this is

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.420 
can't just do it with a generic this is
what<00:02:01.719> I've<00:02:01.810> got<00:02:01.869> here<00:02:02.200> this<00:02:02.380> is<00:02:02.530> from<00:02:02.680> salon

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
what I've got here this is from salon

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.090 
what I've got here this is from salon
Express<00:02:03.789> and<00:02:04.060> it's<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:04.990> six<00:02:05.170> percent<00:02:05.409> 20<00:02:05.740> volume

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
Express and it's a six percent 20 volume

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.370 
Express and it's a six percent 20 volume
but<00:02:06.789> it's<00:02:06.939> only<00:02:07.090> actually<00:02:07.390> depositing<00:02:08.170> color

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
but it's only actually depositing color

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.719 
but it's only actually depositing color
it's<00:02:08.590> not<00:02:08.649> doing<00:02:08.920> any<00:02:09.039> lifting<00:02:09.460> or<00:02:09.580> anything

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
it's not doing any lifting or anything

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.820 
it's not doing any lifting or anything
cows<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.330> literally<00:02:10.600> depositing<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.440> I

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
cows it's literally depositing and I

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.980 
cows it's literally depositing and I
have<00:02:12.010> her<00:02:12.220> seen<00:02:12.610> people<00:02:13.060> drop<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.390> 10<00:02:13.570> volume

three

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.660 
three
so<00:02:15.170> that's<00:02:15.380> your<00:02:15.560> choice<00:02:15.890> if<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.070> want<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.490> but

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
so that's your choice if you want to but

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.030 
so that's your choice if you want to but
I<00:02:16.820> did<00:02:17.030> use<00:02:17.270> 6%<00:02:18.020> when<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.170> did<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.440> with<00:02:18.530> mine<00:02:18.740> and

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
I did use 6% when I did it with mine and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.100 
I did use 6% when I did it with mine and
you<00:02:19.520> make<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.850> up<00:02:19.940> on<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.150> two<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.510> one<00:02:20.540> ratio<00:02:20.810> so

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
you make it up on a two to one ratio so

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.040 
you make it up on a two to one ratio so
that's<00:02:21.350> one<00:02:21.710> part<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:23.090> two<00:02:23.270> parts<00:02:23.510> this

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
that's one part this to two parts this

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.140 
that's one part this to two parts this
now<00:02:24.500> some<00:02:24.830> people<00:02:24.980> mix<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.430> up<00:02:25.520> with<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.760> temple

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
now some people mix it up with a temple

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.430 
now some people mix it up with a temple
and<00:02:26.300> brush<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:26.780> perfectly<00:02:27.230> alright

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
and brush and that's perfectly alright

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.990 
and brush and that's perfectly alright
for<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.860> but<00:02:28.070> this<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.340> kind<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.700> toner

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
for you but this is the kind of toner

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.550 
for you but this is the kind of toner
that<00:02:29.390> although<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.840> states<00:02:30.110> on<00:02:30.350> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
that although it states on the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.340 
that although it states on the
instructions<00:02:31.180> develop<00:02:32.180> up<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.450> 30<00:02:32.660> minutes<00:02:33.080> if

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
instructions develop up to 30 minutes if

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.470 
instructions develop up to 30 minutes if
you<00:02:33.800> are<00:02:33.950> platinum<00:02:34.190> you'll<00:02:34.760> probably<00:02:34.970> wind<00:02:35.300> up

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
you are platinum you'll probably wind up

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.060 
you are platinum you'll probably wind up
and<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.690> want<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.900> develop<00:02:36.200> up<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.470> 30<00:02:36.710> minutes

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
and I want to develop up to 30 minutes

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.230 
and I want to develop up to 30 minutes
because<00:02:37.190> you're<00:02:37.430> going<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.640> end<00:02:37.730> up<00:02:37.820> with<00:02:37.970> Lila

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
care and it's a bit of a bugger to get

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.610 
care and it's a bit of a bugger to get
out<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:43.460> would<00:02:44.030> recommend<00:02:44.440> personally<00:02:45.440> how

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
out so I would recommend personally how

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.500 
out so I would recommend personally how
I<00:02:45.650> do<00:02:45.830> mine<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.430> have<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.610> tint<00:02:46.880> bottle<00:02:47.240> which<00:02:47.480> is

I do mine I have a tint bottle which is

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.490 
I do mine I have a tint bottle which is
something<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.140> have<00:02:48.290> from<00:02:48.380> my

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
something that I have from my

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.280 
something that I have from my
wholesalers<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.390> then<00:02:50.390> relatively<00:02:50.900> cheap

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
wholesalers and then relatively cheap

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.260 
wholesalers and then relatively cheap
and<00:02:51.470> it's<00:02:52.040> just<00:02:52.250> like<00:02:52.430> almost<00:02:52.670> like<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:52.940> bottle

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
and it's just like almost like a bottle

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
you get with a box diet but obviously

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.800 
you get with a box diet but obviously
it's<00:02:54.830> not<00:02:54.980> because<00:02:55.370> it's<00:02:55.610> reusable<00:02:56.360> wash

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
it's not because it's reusable wash

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.940 
it's not because it's reusable wash
water<00:02:57.020> everything<00:02:57.290> cows<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.710> it<00:02:57.800> has<00:02:57.920> a

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
little lid in the little cap so that's

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.870 
little lid in the little cap so that's

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:28.249 
that if you're in the UK there are other

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:29.740 
that if you're in the UK there are other
things<00:05:28.460> that<00:05:28.610> you<00:05:28.699> can<00:05:28.939> use<00:05:29.180> which<00:05:29.449> aren't

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
things that you can use which aren't

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.209 
things that you can use which aren't
just<00:05:30.020> as<00:05:30.169> good<00:05:30.319> and<00:05:30.620> probably<00:05:30.830> more

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:31.219 
just as good and probably more

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:32.769 
just as good and probably more
reasonably<00:05:31.699> priced<00:05:32.000> especially<00:05:32.599> if<00:05:32.689> you're

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:32.779 
reasonably priced especially if you're

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.269 
reasonably priced especially if you're
buying<00:05:32.930> from<00:05:33.050> Amazon<00:05:33.439> like<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:33.680> did<00:05:33.889> miss<00:05:34.069> cost

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:34.279 
buying from Amazon like I did miss cost

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.480 
buying from Amazon like I did miss cost
11<00:05:34.669> pounds<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:35.300> if<00:05:36.199> for<00:05:36.439> example<00:05:36.490> and

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
11 pounds and if for example and

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.769 
11 pounds and if for example and
obviously<00:05:37.759> you'd<00:05:37.909> need<00:05:38.060> to<00:05:38.180> vote<00:05:38.300> for<00:05:38.479> as<00:05:38.569> well

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:38.779 
obviously you'd need to vote for as well

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:40.450 
obviously you'd need to vote for as well
so<00:05:39.349> you<00:05:39.469> wouldn't<00:05:39.830> just<00:05:39.979> be<00:05:40.129> able<00:05:40.189> to<00:05:40.339> have

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
so you wouldn't just be able to have

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.950 
so you wouldn't just be able to have
this<00:05:40.669> I<00:05:40.849> mean<00:05:40.969> quality<00:05:41.389> this<00:05:41.509> is<00:05:41.629> only<00:05:41.719> about

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
this I mean quality this is only about

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.019 
this I mean quality this is only about
three<00:05:42.199> powerful<00:05:42.409> wholesalers<00:05:43.069> but<00:05:43.250> it's

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
three powerful wholesalers but it's

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:48.339 
three powerful wholesalers but it's
still<00:05:44.210> an<00:05:44.389> additional<00:05:44.839> price<00:05:45.020> so<00:05:47.050> would<00:05:48.050> I<00:05:48.080> buy

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
still an additional price so would I buy

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.260 
still an additional price so would I buy
it<00:05:48.409> again<00:05:48.560> probably<00:05:48.919> not<00:05:49.250> I<00:05:49.550> will<00:05:49.669> use<00:05:49.909> again

color
po1<00:06:29.000> and<00:06:29.240> that's<00:06:30.050> probably<00:06:30.379> going<00:06:30.529> to<00:06:30.620> be<00:06:30.710> my

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860
