have much success in TNA neither so I'm

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.160 
have much success in TNA neither so I'm
guessing<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.000> my<00:02:41.120> opinion<00:02:41.540> after<00:02:41.870> SummerSlam

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
guessing in my opinion after SummerSlam

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.820 
guessing in my opinion after SummerSlam
2001<00:02:43.100> Booker<00:02:43.940> T<00:02:44.090> was<00:02:44.270> basically<00:02:44.630> buried<00:02:45.170> up

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
2001 Booker T was basically buried up

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.450 
2001 Booker T was basically buried up
until<00:02:46.540> 2007<00:02:47.540> although<00:02:48.110> he<00:02:48.440> was<00:02:48.800> a<00:02:48.830> title<00:02:49.280> reign

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
until 2007 although he was a title reign

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.000 
until 2007 although he was a title reign
that<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.060> don't<00:02:50.600> really<00:02:50.750> remember<00:02:50.990> too<00:02:51.500> much<00:02:51.740> in

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
that I don't really remember too much in

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.580 
that I don't really remember too much in
my<00:02:52.040> opinion<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.990> don't<00:02:53.990> I<00:02:54.080> don't<00:02:54.140> remember<00:02:54.290> his

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
my opinion I don't I don't remember his

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
beating him at Survivor Series but

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.070 
beating him at Survivor Series but
that's<00:02:57.920> all<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.070> can<00:02:58.340> remember<00:02:58.810> Booker<00:02:59.810> T<00:02:59.960> was

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
that's all I can remember Booker T was

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.640 
that's all I can remember Booker T was
in<00:03:00.260> an<00:03:00.380> announcer<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.190> Smackdown<00:03:02.590> Pharaoh<00:03:03.590> I

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
in an announcer on Smackdown Pharaoh I

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.470 
in an announcer on Smackdown Pharaoh I
don't<00:03:03.860> think<00:03:03.980> it's<00:03:04.100> funny<00:03:04.340> how<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:05.000> know<00:03:05.120> he

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
don't think it's funny how you know he

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.390 
don't think it's funny how you know he
because<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.990> could<00:03:06.110> be<00:03:06.170> such<00:03:06.350> a<00:03:06.380> big<00:03:06.680> star<00:03:07.040> and

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
because you could be such a big star and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.270 
because you could be such a big star and
then<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:08.630> know<00:03:08.780> just<00:03:09.080> dropped<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:09.950> low<00:03:09.980> to

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
then you know just dropped so low to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.760 
then you know just dropped so low to
becoming<00:03:10.700> an<00:03:10.880> announcer<00:03:11.450> he<00:03:12.080> sees<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.410> journal

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
becoming an announcer he sees a journal

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.590 
becoming an announcer he sees a journal
manager<00:03:13.070> of<00:03:13.190> SmackDown<00:03:13.730> now<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.060> guess<00:03:14.390> that's

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
manager of SmackDown now I guess that's

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.990 
manager of SmackDown now I guess that's
something<00:03:14.980> as<00:03:15.980> far<00:03:16.220> as<00:03:16.310> his<00:03:16.430> wrestling<00:03:16.850> career

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
something as far as his wrestling career

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.590 
something as far as his wrestling career
goes<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:17.630> feel<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.050> WWE<00:03:19.090> basically<00:03:20.090> buried
