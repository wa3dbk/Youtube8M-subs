 war for you to verify 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.429

 successful people who always like to be at 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.210
 hundred who are always looking for the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.240
 fashion trends is that kind of 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.740
 women is the warlike woman attitude 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.750
 so modernist let's say it like that of the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.380
 attitude that the woman is now a 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.080
 woman totally free and free 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.450
 fully enthusiastic worker like 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.490
 you enterprising 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.920
 exactly and always 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.200
 in search of the best 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.900
 how old is war movie 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.900
 we are barely two years old this is our 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.870
 fourth season 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.490
 we launched to the market and well the truth is 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.190
 that we have done well enough 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.020
 clients have not said it for them 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.159
 same with their final customers with the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.920
 final consumer 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.499
 then war came and is here to 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.990
 stay one of our goals there are 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:00.670
 most important that we have as war 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.140
 is that we want to venture into the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.490
 foreign market that in fact already what 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.009
 we are doing right now we have 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.340
 customers in the united states and in canada and 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:13.720
 well we have badly so if we have 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.010
 as very very bad presence in the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.410
 foreign market foreign 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.830
 they think that the Mexican shoe is 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.690
 poor quality that there is no good service 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.060
 then we are what we want 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.099
 offer what to break with that that 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.950
 they think and offer a product of 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.599
 quality and super trend not even 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.079
 I believe that if a foreigner acquires 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.720
 some piece of you obviously that 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.700
 I would say to remove the bad reputation 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.739
 It would be a very important point because it 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.739
 it is good that they come to know war 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.230
 where we can locate the warlike look 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.510
 now we are in more than 20 states 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.819
 of the republic we have in the monterrey 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.710
 we have in culiacÃ¡n we have in veracruz 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.040
 we have in 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.440
 in Michoacan because in many 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.880
 states already more than 20 are in total and 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.630
