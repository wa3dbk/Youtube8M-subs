00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.410 

yeah<00:07:02.910> so<00:07:03.270> changing<00:07:04.080> values<00:07:04.260> into<00:07:04.800> the<00:07:05.420> upper

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
yeah so changing values into the upper

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:12.620

maximum<00:07:06.870> is<00:07:09.200> pretty<00:07:10.200> pretty<00:07:10.860> bad<00:07:11.130> so<00:07:11.580> that<00:07:12.060> was

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
maximum is pretty pretty bad so that was
