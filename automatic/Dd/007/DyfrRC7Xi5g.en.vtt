way too long to actually get game set up

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.699 
way too long to actually get game set up
because<00:02:55.760> somebody<00:02:56.000> has<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.420> host<00:02:57.170> one<00:02:57.470> from

from<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.110> IP<00:03:00.290> address<00:03:00.920> it's<00:03:01.220> just<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.670> pain<00:03:01.940> and

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
from the IP address it's just a pain and

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.970 
from the IP address it's just a pain and
they<00:03:02.870> really<00:03:03.200> could<00:03:03.320> have<00:03:03.410> just<00:03:03.530> made<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:03.769> much

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
they really could have just made it much

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.740 
they really could have just made it much
more<00:03:04.130> simpler<00:03:04.580> but<00:03:04.850> they<00:03:05.180> really<00:03:05.450> went<00:03:05.630> for

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
more simpler but they really went for

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.800 
more simpler but they really went for
the<00:03:06.010> annoying<00:03:07.010> bridge<00:03:07.610> all<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.450> gripes

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
hurting yourself so I would give this

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.119 
hurting yourself so I would give this

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
game a 9 out of 10 just because of the

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.619 
game a 9 out of 10 just because of the
replay<00:03:24.519> value<00:03:24.549> of<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:26.340> amazing<00:03:27.629> amazing

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
replay value of the amazing amazing

storylines<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.319> can<00:03:29.440> create<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:31.330> only

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
storylines you can create and the only

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.420 
storylines you can create and the only
reason<00:03:31.659> why<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.750> give<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.230> 9<00:03:32.470> set<00:03:32.769> of<00:03:32.860> 10<00:03:33.190> is

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
reason why I give it a 9 set of 10 is

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.850 
reason why I give it a 9 set of 10 is
because<00:03:33.700> of<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.879> annoying<00:03:34.239> deal<00:03:34.599> seeds<00:03:35.049> if

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
because of the annoying deal seeds if

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.650 
because of the annoying deal seeds if
they<00:03:36.190> would<00:03:36.400> somehow<00:03:36.670> bumble<00:03:37.360> that<00:03:37.480> all

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
they would somehow bumble that all

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.110 
they would somehow bumble that all
together<00:03:37.810> into<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.560> cheaper<00:03:38.980> price<00:03:39.250> then<00:03:39.640> maybe

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
together into a cheaper price then maybe

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.539 
together into a cheaper price then maybe
I'd<00:03:40.330> give<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:40.569> game<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.810> 10<00:03:41.110> but<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.769> just<00:03:42.340> can't

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
I'd give this game a 10 but I just can't

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:59.680 
I'd give this game a 10 but I just can't
