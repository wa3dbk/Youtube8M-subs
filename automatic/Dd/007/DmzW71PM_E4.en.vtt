00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the bottom one again I'm not sure you

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.959 
the bottom one again I'm not sure you
can<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:01.079> those<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.489> wanted<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> point

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
can see those but I just wanted to point

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.179 
can see those but I just wanted to point
them<00:01:03.149> out<00:01:03.260> because<00:01:04.260> they<00:01:04.559> are<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
them out because they are there but the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.890 
them out because they are there but the
front<00:01:05.460> side<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.810> perfect<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.860> fact<00:01:08.900> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
front side is is perfect and in fact it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.520 
front side is is perfect and in fact it
looks<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.470> somebody<00:01:10.920> took<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:12.320> paint<00:01:13.320> brush

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
looks like somebody took a paint brush

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.340 
looks like somebody took a paint brush
and<00:01:15.409> just<00:01:17.150> streaked<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:18.479> white<00:01:18.720> paint<00:01:18.990> I

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and just streaked it with white paint I

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.530 
and just streaked it with white paint I
mean<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.100> really<00:01:20.310> looks<00:01:20.610> pretty<00:01:20.880> really<00:01:21.299> kind

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
mean it really looks pretty really kind

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.830 
mean it really looks pretty really kind
of<00:01:21.600> an<00:01:21.720> interesting<00:01:21.979> sort<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.070> front<00:01:23.310> scale

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
of an interesting sort of front scale

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.719 
of an interesting sort of front scale
probably<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> some<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.860> nicer<00:01:26.159> scale<00:01:26.460> of

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
probably a some of the nicer scale of

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.880 
probably a some of the nicer scale of
horn<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.840> I've<00:01:27.990> seen<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.320> these<00:01:28.439> large<00:01:28.680> ones

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
horn that I've seen on these large ones

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.429 
horn that I've seen on these large ones
in<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.299> but<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.390> looks<00:01:30.540> good<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.229> does

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
in it but it looks good it really does

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.999
