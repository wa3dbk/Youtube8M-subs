00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and how we're going to interpret what

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
wonderful adventure in the work that we

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.460 
wonderful adventure in the work that we
do<00:01:39.000> together<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.560> finding<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.490> way<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
do together is is finding a way to

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:51.040 
do together is is finding a way to
illuminate<00:01:43.850> every<00:01:44.850> word

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050
