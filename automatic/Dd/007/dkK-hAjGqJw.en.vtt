00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
way but no the-the decent reload speed

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.260 
way but no the-the decent reload speed
on<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:50.210> gun<00:02:50.510> quicken<00:02:51.410> takes<00:02:51.710> him<00:02:51.860> out<00:02:52.270> the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
on this gun quicken takes him out the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.830 
on this gun quicken takes him out the
average<00:02:53.390> damage<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.620> shells<00:02:54.830> are<00:02:55.240> 110<00:02:56.950> and

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
average damage of the shells are 110 and

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.010 
average damage of the shells are 110 and
it<00:02:59.840> has<00:02:59.960> a<00:02:59.990> rate<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.260> fire<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.560> 14<00:03:01.750> for<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.780> minute

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
it has a rate of fire of 14 for a minute

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.380 
it has a rate of fire of 14 for a minute
so<00:03:03.050> it's<00:03:03.740> decent<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:05.000> aiming<00:03:05.300> speed<00:03:05.390> is<00:03:07.390> 2.2

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
so it's decent the aiming speed is 2.2

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.350 
so it's decent the aiming speed is 2.2
and<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:09.650> accuracy<00:03:09.890> is<00:03:10.100> zero<00:03:10.520> point<00:03:11.500> 46<00:03:12.500> so

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
and the accuracy is zero point 46 so

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.680 
and the accuracy is zero point 46 so
pretty<00:03:14.360> bad<00:03:17.290> especially<00:03:18.290> for<00:03:18.380> accuracy<00:03:18.860> but

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
pretty bad especially for accuracy but

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.750 
pretty bad especially for accuracy but
when<00:03:20.690> you<00:03:20.780> can<00:03:20.870> fire<00:03:21.140> this<00:03:21.440> wiki<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.310> doesn't

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
when you can fire this wiki it doesn't

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.960 
when you can fire this wiki it doesn't
really<00:03:22.850> matter<00:03:23.060> if<00:03:23.330> there's<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.660> shot<00:03:23.990> or<00:03:24.140> two

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
really matter if there's a shot or two

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.350 
really matter if there's a shot or two
small<00:03:25.970> tanks<00:03:26.770> doing<00:03:27.770> a<00:03:27.830> little<00:03:27.980> bit<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.360> being

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
small tanks doing a little bit of being

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.880 
small tanks doing a little bit of being
annoying<00:03:29.600> here<00:03:30.050> thinking<00:03:30.470> they<00:03:30.620> can<00:03:30.680> do<00:03:31.010> stuff

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.830 

but<00:03:35.610> they<00:03:36.000> can't<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.920> though<00:03:38.280> take<00:03:39.180> out<00:03:39.510> there

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
but they can't and though take out there

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.770 
but they can't and though take out there
were<00:03:40.080> three<00:03:40.620> kills<00:03:40.920> already<00:03:41.340> lots<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.270> bounces

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
were three kills already lots of bounces

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.460 
were three kills already lots of bounces

the<00:04:28.500> only<00:04:28.919> place<00:04:29.310> where<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.700> really

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
the only place where you really

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.510 
the only place where you really
penetrated<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.140> front<00:04:31.440> or<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.710> sides<00:04:32.310> of

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
penetrated is the front or the sides of

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.540 
penetrated is the front or the sides of
the<00:04:32.610> third<00:04:32.820> so<00:04:33.360> he<00:04:33.510> has<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.960> just<00:04:34.290> kind<00:04:35.280> of<00:04:35.340> wait

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
the third so he has to just kind of wait

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.170 
the third so he has to just kind of wait
it<00:04:35.669> out<00:04:35.790> or<00:04:36.060> just<00:04:36.090> be<00:04:36.510> lucky<00:04:36.720> with<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.080> shots

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
it out or just be lucky with the shots

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.750 
it out or just be lucky with the shots
so<00:04:39.180> far<00:04:39.210> he's<00:04:39.810> not<00:04:40.020> being<00:04:40.260> lucky<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:41.040> neither

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
so far he's not being lucky and neither

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.690 
so far he's not being lucky and neither
is<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.270> other<00:04:42.419> case<00:04:42.690> you<00:04:42.870> want

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
is the other case you want

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.160 
is the other case you want
even<00:04:44.210> firing<00:04:44.570> uh<00:04:44.890> gold<00:04:45.890> chills<00:04:46.660> but<00:04:47.660> someone

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
even firing uh gold chills but someone

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.380 
even firing uh gold chills but someone
distracts<00:04:48.860> him<00:04:49.010> and<00:04:49.220> he's<00:04:49.520> silly<00:04:49.940> enough<00:04:50.330> to

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
distracts him and he's silly enough to

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.590 
distracts him and he's silly enough to
turn<00:04:51.140> his<00:04:51.230> turn<00:04:51.440> boo<00:04:52.990> at<00:04:53.990> six<00:04:54.530> kills<00:04:55.010> and<00:04:56.000> the

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
turn his turn boo at six kills and the

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.290 
turn his turn boo at six kills and the
kv-2<00:04:58.120> speed<00:04:59.120> limit<00:04:59.420> of<00:04:59.630> this<00:05:00.230> one<00:05:00.530> is<00:05:01.420> 35<00:05:02.470> or

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
kv-2 speed limit of this one is 35 or

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.160 
kv-2 speed limit of this one is 35 or
3333<00:05:05.300> yeah<00:05:05.630> degrees<00:05:06.620> traverse<00:05:07.070> speed<00:05:07.310> is<00:05:08.170> 20

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
3333 yeah degrees traverse speed is 20

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.770 
3333 yeah degrees traverse speed is 20
so<00:05:09.680> what<00:05:10.250> what<00:05:10.730> you<00:05:10.850> expect<00:05:11.180> from<00:05:11.450> a<00:05:11.750> heavy<00:05:11.930> the

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
so what what you expect from a heavy the

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.480 
so what what you expect from a heavy the
the<00:05:14.780> HP<00:05:15.170> is<00:05:15.350> as<00:05:15.890> we<00:05:16.130> can<00:05:16.280> see<00:05:16.960> 690<00:05:18.490> something

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
the HP is as we can see 690 something

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.930 
the HP is as we can see 690 something
the<00:05:20.030> Big<00:05:20.210> E<00:05:20.330> also<00:05:20.540> has<00:05:21.110> wrong<00:05:21.410> it<00:05:22.280> is<00:05:22.430> missing

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
the Big E also has wrong it is missing

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.200 
the Big E also has wrong it is missing
40hp<00:05:23.980> found<00:05:24.980> a<00:05:25.070> wreck<00:05:25.250> there<00:05:25.660> and<00:05:27.790> yeah<00:05:28.790> he's

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
40hp found a wreck there and yeah he's

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.150 
40hp found a wreck there and yeah he's
basically<00:05:29.660> just<00:05:29.990> going<00:05:30.290> to<00:05:30.470> he's<00:05:30.890> not<00:05:30.950> gonna

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
basically just going to he's not gonna

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.890 
basically just going to he's not gonna
get<00:05:31.340> this<00:05:31.520> already<00:05:31.850> and<00:05:32.090> he's<00:05:32.510> gonna<00:05:32.690> get

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
get this already and he's gonna get

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.190 
get this already and he's gonna get
another<00:05:33.230> RT<00:05:33.680> let's<00:05:33.890> just<00:05:34.070> beat<00:05:34.220> us<00:05:34.370> up<00:05:35.200> you

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
another RT let's just beat us up you

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.900 
another RT let's just beat us up you
have<00:05:36.380> seen<00:05:36.650> what<00:05:36.980> this<00:05:37.490> do<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.300> do<00:05:39.700> who's<00:05:40.700> that
