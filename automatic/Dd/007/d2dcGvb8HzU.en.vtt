00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
orders what their average sale was and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.620 
orders what their average sale was and
that<00:00:33.350> way<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:33.560> can<00:00:33.829> put<00:00:34.040> that<00:00:34.190> on<00:00:34.460> their<00:00:35.090> daily

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630

that way you can put that on their daily
sales<00:00:35.870> summary<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:36.650> that<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:36.890> can<00:00:37.070> pull<00:00:37.250> a

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
report in QuickBooks and then you would

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.940 
report in QuickBooks and then you would

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
with the daily sales receipt you would

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.080 
with the daily sales receipt you would
customize<00:00:43.220> it<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:44.120> add<00:00:44.270> in<00:00:44.540> those<00:00:44.720> fields<00:00:46.090> all

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
customize it to add in those fields all

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.420 
customize it to add in those fields all
right<00:00:47.330> so<00:00:47.660> any<00:00:48.170> questions<00:00:48.530> on<00:00:48.710> that<00:00:48.890> before<00:00:48.950> we

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
right so any questions on that before we

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.670 
right so any questions on that before we
get<00:00:49.550> into<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.120> daily<00:00:50.420> sales<00:00:50.600> summary<00:00:50.930> on<00:00:51.260> how

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
get into the daily sales summary on how

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.650 
get into the daily sales summary on how
the<00:00:51.740> item<00:00:52.160> list<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:52.700> chart<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:53.060> accounts<00:00:53.510> are

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
the item list and chart of accounts are

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.460 
the item list and chart of accounts are
created<00:00:55.150> okay<00:00:56.800> all<00:00:57.800> right<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:58.670> again<00:00:59.480> you<00:01:00.290> need

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
created okay all right so again you need

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.260 
created okay all right so again you need
to<00:01:00.590> decide<00:01:00.920> how<00:01:01.160> detailed<00:01:01.460> you're<00:01:01.910> going<00:01:02.150> to

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
to decide how detailed you're going to

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.770 
to decide how detailed you're going to
get<00:01:02.480> on<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.960> daily<00:01:03.350> sales<00:01:03.590> summary<00:01:03.980> so<00:01:04.850> the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
get on the daily sales summary so the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.190 
get on the daily sales summary so the
way<00:01:05.960> we're<00:01:06.229> doing<00:01:06.530> this<00:01:06.680> is<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:07.310> exclude

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
way we're doing this is to exclude

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.510 
way we're doing this is to exclude
detail<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.530> we<00:01:09.650> want<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.040> keep<00:01:10.280> this

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
detail that we want to keep this

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.149 
detail that we want to keep this
summarized<00:01:11.120> but<00:01:12.050> you<00:01:12.230> can<00:01:12.560> create<00:01:12.950> as<00:01:13.130> many

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
summarized but you can create as many

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.060 
summarized but you can create as many
items<00:01:13.580> as<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:13.940> want<00:01:14.090> but<00:01:14.540> you<00:01:14.659> want<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:15.070> keep

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
items as you want but you want to keep

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.010 
items as you want but you want to keep
it<00:01:16.250> easy<00:01:16.550> for<00:01:16.850> your<00:01:17.000> client<00:01:17.390> because<00:01:17.510> this<00:01:17.810> is

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
it easy for your client because this is

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.620 
it easy for your client because this is
a<00:01:18.050> manual<00:01:18.650> entry<00:01:19.060> what<00:01:20.060> you're<00:01:20.270> going<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.479> be

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
a manual entry what you're going to be

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.270 
a manual entry what you're going to be
doing<00:01:20.870> with<00:01:21.110> this<00:01:21.229> daily<00:01:21.560> sales<00:01:21.920> summary

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
doing with this daily sales summary

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.760 
doing with this daily sales summary
though<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:23.270> only<00:01:23.510> complicated<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.500> first

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
though it's only complicated the first

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.490 
though it's only complicated the first
time<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.460> explain<00:01:25.850> it<00:01:25.909> but<00:01:26.720> after<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:27.260> you're

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
time to explain it but after that you're

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.649 
time to explain it but after that you're
memorizing<00:01:28.220> this<00:01:28.340> transaction<00:01:28.940> for<00:01:29.420> them<00:01:29.510> to

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
memorizing this transaction for them to

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.110 
memorizing this transaction for them to
use<00:01:29.840> over<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.500> over<00:01:30.830> again<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.760> it<00:01:31.909> just

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
use over and over again so it just

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.730 
use over and over again so it just
becomes<00:01:32.479> part<00:01:32.840> of<00:01:32.900> their<00:01:33.049> day<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.350> shouldn't

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
becomes part of their day it shouldn't

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.070 
becomes part of their day it shouldn't
take<00:01:33.770> them<00:01:34.190> more<00:01:34.729> than<00:01:34.880> 10<00:01:35.120> or<00:01:35.270> 15<00:01:35.630> minutes<00:01:35.990> to

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
take them more than 10 or 15 minutes to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.469 
take them more than 10 or 15 minutes to
do<00:01:36.320> this<00:01:36.500> task<00:01:36.770> if<00:01:37.250> it's<00:01:37.490> not<00:01:37.670> importing<00:01:38.270> over

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.670 

so<00:01:41.620> now<00:01:42.620> this<00:01:42.830> is<00:01:42.979> just<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.280> suggestion<00:01:43.760> if<00:01:44.680> how

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
so now this is just a suggestion if how

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.280 
so now this is just a suggestion if how
you<00:01:45.740> want<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.780> chronologically<00:01:47.780> sort<00:01:48.080> this

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
you want to chronologically sort this

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.250 
you want to chronologically sort this
now<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:49.040> is<00:01:49.100> saying<00:01:49.549> year<00:01:50.030> month<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:50.570> date<00:01:50.990> a

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
now this is saying year month and date a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.880 
now this is saying year month and date a
day<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.930> one<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.290> I'm<00:01:54.409> doing<00:01:54.560> right<00:01:54.830> now

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
day and the one that I'm doing right now

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.910 
day and the one that I'm doing right now
we're<00:01:55.549> actually<00:01:55.850> using<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.080> number<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.740> match

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
we're actually using the number to match

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.539 
we're actually using the number to match
to<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.340> batch<00:01:58.670> in<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.180> POS<00:01:59.630> side<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:01.280> that

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
to the batch in the POS side and so that

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.539 
to the batch in the POS side and so that
way<00:02:01.820> if<00:02:02.240> there's<00:02:02.750> any<00:02:02.990> issue<00:02:03.409> between<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.340> two

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
way if there's any issue between the two

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.179 
way if there's any issue between the two
systems<00:02:04.820> matching<00:02:05.720> we<00:02:06.380> can<00:02:06.590> make<00:02:06.740> sure<00:02:06.920> each

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
systems matching we can make sure each

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.870 
systems matching we can make sure each
batch<00:02:07.549> matches<00:02:08.269> and<00:02:08.479> it's

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
batch matches and it's

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.090
