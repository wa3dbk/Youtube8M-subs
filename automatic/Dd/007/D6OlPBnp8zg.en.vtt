00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.140 
g'day guys I've been having trouble with
this<00:00:04.910> belt<00:00:06.020> tension<00:00:07.020> for<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.230> alternator<00:00:07.620> and

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
this belt tension for the alternator and

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.070 
this belt tension for the alternator and
meter<00:00:10.160> an<00:00:11.160> idle<00:00:11.639> pulley<00:00:12.240> there<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.719> tighten

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
meter an idle pulley there to tighten

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.829 
meter an idle pulley there to tighten
things<00:00:13.259> up<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.620> bit<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.240> I've<00:00:15.240> got<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> good<00:00:15.690> bit

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
things up a bit and I've got a good bit

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.720 
things up a bit and I've got a good bit
of<00:00:15.870> tension<00:00:16.170> there<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.859> we've<00:00:17.070> get<00:00:17.310> get<00:00:17.550> rid<00:00:17.699> of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
of tension there so we've get get rid of

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.179 
of tension there so we've get get rid of
the<00:00:17.910> squeaks<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.660> slippage<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.740> was<00:00:19.890> going

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the squeaks and slippage that was going

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.890 
the squeaks and slippage that was going
on<00:00:20.310> there<00:00:20.840> trouble<00:00:21.840> was<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:23.730> belt<00:00:24.029> I've<00:00:24.600> got

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
on there trouble was the belt I've got

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.460 
on there trouble was the belt I've got
11<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:26.510> 1450<00:00:28.010> is<00:00:29.010> slightly<00:00:29.730> too<00:00:30.150> long<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.810> so

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
11 a 1450 is slightly too long and so

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
11 a 1450 is slightly too long and so
we're<00:00:31.679> running<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.099> adjustment<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.880> needs

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
we're running out of adjustment it needs

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.420 
we're running out of adjustment it needs
about<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> probably<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.440> 14<00:00:35.329> 20<00:00:36.329> or<00:00:36.480> something<00:00:37.430> so

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
about a probably a 14 20 or something so

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.389 
about a probably a 14 20 or something so
until<00:00:39.210> then<00:00:39.450> we've<00:00:39.860> it's<00:00:40.860> quicker<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.250> easier

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
until then we've it's quicker and easier

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.290 
until then we've it's quicker and easier
to<00:00:41.670> make<00:00:41.910> up<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.350> idler<00:00:43.670> roller<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
to make up this idler roller there and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.510 
to make up this idler roller there and
lets<00:00:46.110> sorted<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.649> out<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> we're<00:00:53.010> going<00:00:53.430> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
lets sorted that out so we're going to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.250 
lets sorted that out so we're going to
have<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> bubbler<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.510> here

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
have a bubbler in here

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.799 
have a bubbler in here
see<00:00:55.920> y'all<00:00:56.100> bubbler<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.000> pop-up<00:00:57.239> so

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
see y'all bubbler with the pop-up so

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.000 
see y'all bubbler with the pop-up so
it's<00:00:58.020> not<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> high-pressure

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
it's not going to be a high-pressure

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340 
it's not going to be a high-pressure
system<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.850> just<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.329> flow<00:01:00.690> mainly

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
system it's just going to be flow mainly

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.000 
system it's just going to be flow mainly
and<00:01:02.719> we're<00:01:03.719> also<00:01:03.870> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.320> using<00:01:04.500> wine

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and we're also going to be using wine

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.960 
and we're also going to be using wine

there<00:01:58.300> are<00:01:58.420> some<00:01:58.980> questions<00:01:59.980> going<00:02:00.280> on<00:02:00.550> -

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
there are some questions going on -

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.420 
there are some questions going on -
about<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.480> accuracy<00:02:01.960> of<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:03.190> meter

the way they're 25-point I wouldn't
doubt<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.890> accuracy<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.519> this<00:03:45.670> Tektronix<00:03:46.360> are

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
doubt the accuracy of this Tektronix are

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.020 
doubt the accuracy of this Tektronix are

still a scope at all

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.259 
still a scope at all
this<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.239> showing<00:03:51.090> 25.7<00:03:52.709> outputs<00:03:53.709> bearing

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
this is showing 25.7 outputs bearing

cause

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.380 

yeah<00:04:09.300> so<00:04:10.040> from<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.160> doubters<00:04:11.610> with<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.000> meter

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
yeah so from the doubters with the meter

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.910 
yeah so from the doubters with the meter
accuracy<00:04:12.780> son<00:04:13.440> I<00:04:14.300> think<00:04:15.300> this<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:16.739> point

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
accuracy son I think this is the point

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.300 
accuracy son I think this is the point
where<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.459> meters<00:04:17.790> are<00:04:17.970> quite<00:04:18.239> accurate<00:04:18.450> and

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
where the meters are quite accurate and

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.530 
where the meters are quite accurate and
