00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.160 

I'm<00:00:13.650> not<00:00:13.860> sure<00:00:14.160> either<00:00:14.280> one<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.540> know<00:00:15.690> Joe<00:00:16.139> was

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
I'm not sure either one I I know Joe was

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.410 
I'm not sure either one I I know Joe was

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
happier than Jack 4/100 if it'd have

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.870 
happier than Jack 4/100 if it'd have
been<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.779> Jack's<00:00:25.109> pool<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.949> no<00:00:26.160> electronic

American<00:00:33.000> record<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.920> 44<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.719> the<00:00:36.719> guy<00:00:36.899> Austin

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
American record of 44 one the guy Austin

stopped<00:00:38.309> kicked<00:00:38.700> out<00:00:38.879> 15<00:00:39.480> yards<00:00:39.989> 15<00:00:40.500> meters

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
stopped kicked out 15 yards 15 meters

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.330 
stopped kicked out 15 yards 15 meters
off<00:00:41.129> every<00:00:42.030> wall<00:00:42.260> did<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.469> breathe<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.890> last

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
off every wall did not breathe the last

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.369 
off every wall did not breathe the last
25<00:00:46.039> so<00:00:47.270> we're<00:00:48.270> all<00:00:48.390> faster<00:00:48.899> when<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.110> put<00:00:49.320> her

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
25 so we're all faster when we put her

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.549 
25 so we're all faster when we put her
head<00:00:49.590> down<00:00:49.730> those<00:00:50.730> two<00:00:50.940> guys<00:00:51.090> swim<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> 50<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.440> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
head down those two guys swim a 50 on a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.610 
head down those two guys swim a 50 on a
medley<00:00:52.980> relay<00:00:53.780> they<00:00:54.780> breathe<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.379> turn

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
medley relay they breathe it the turn

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.099 
medley relay they breathe it the turn
why<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.289> it's<00:00:58.289> faster<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> cut

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
why do you do that it's faster so cut

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.740 
why do you do that it's faster so cut
out<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.469> number<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.890> breath<00:01:02.329> Michael<00:01:03.329> Phelps

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
out the number of breath Michael Phelps

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
out the number of breath Michael Phelps
can<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.170> his<00:01:04.409> thing<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:06.030> away<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:07.640> it

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
can do his thing and get away with it it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.200 
can do his thing and get away with it it
doesn't<00:01:09.000> mean<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.390> other<00:01:10.729> 99<00:01:11.729> out<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
doesn't mean the other 99 out of a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.260 
doesn't mean the other 99 out of a
hundred<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.670> we're<00:01:14.670> working<00:01:14.850> real

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
hundred can do that we're working real

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.240 
hundred can do that we're working real
hard<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.840> cutting<00:01:16.290> down<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.799> number<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
hard on cutting down on the number of

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.240 
hard on cutting down on the number of
breaths<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.670> take<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.380> it's<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.650> anything

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
breaths we take but it's like anything

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.190 
breaths we take but it's like anything
that<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.420> important<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.110> learn<00:01:22.400> takes<00:01:23.400> time

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
that it's important to learn takes time

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.070 
that it's important to learn takes time
when<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> gun<00:01:25.560> goes<00:01:25.799> off<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.460> mind<00:01:27.080> focuses

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
when the gun goes off the mind focuses

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.859 
when the gun goes off the mind focuses
on<00:01:28.290> different<00:01:28.890> things<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.299> have<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.600> think

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
on different things if you have to think

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
on different things if you have to think
about<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.439> stuff<00:01:31.650> while<00:01:32.070> you're<00:01:32.250> doing<00:01:32.549> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
about that stuff while you're doing it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.020 
about that stuff while you're doing it
you<00:01:33.570> go<00:01:33.750> slower<00:01:34.079> anyway<00:01:34.619> got<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.729> do<00:01:35.880> it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
you go slower anyway got to do it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.450 
you go slower anyway got to do it
naturally<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.840> that's<00:01:37.560> where<00:01:37.920> we're<00:01:38.100> going

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
naturally and that's where we're going

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.810 
naturally and that's where we're going
with<00:01:38.610> it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
with it

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.030 
with it
we<00:01:39.450> know<00:01:39.630> we're<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> lot<00:01:40.079> better<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.799> third

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
we know we're a lot better on the third

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010 
we know we're a lot better on the third
day<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.670> were<00:01:41.850> last<00:01:42.150> year<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.689> knew<00:01:42.720> we

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
day that we were last year we knew we

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.499 
day that we were last year we knew we
were<00:01:43.200> thin<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:44.430> had<00:01:44.549> people<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.970> had<00:01:45.299> done

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
were thin we had people that had done

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.450 
were thin we had people that had done
some<00:01:45.840> good<00:01:46.049> times<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:49.460> conference

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
some good times but it was at conference

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.560 
some good times but it was at conference
and<00:01:52.220> we<00:01:53.220> weren't<00:01:53.399> sure<00:01:53.670> they<00:01:53.700> could<00:01:53.909> come<00:01:54.299> back

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and we weren't sure they could come back

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.039 
and we weren't sure they could come back
and<00:01:54.869> for<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.710> most<00:01:55.920> part<00:01:56.040> they<00:01:56.430> didn't<00:01:57.049> so

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and for the most part they didn't so

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.520 
and for the most part they didn't so
this<00:01:58.380> time<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:59.009> we've<00:01:59.520> got<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> better<00:02:00.000> group

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
this time we we've got a better group

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.770 
this time we we've got a better group
I'm<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:02.340> too<00:02:02.549> excited<00:02:03.210> we

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.359 

didn't<00:02:08.780> do<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.929> real<00:02:09.170> good<00:02:09.200> job<00:02:09.379> on<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.860> 800
