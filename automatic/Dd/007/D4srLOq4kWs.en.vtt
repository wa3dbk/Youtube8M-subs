one<00:01:07.140> thing<00:01:07.320> you'll<00:01:07.470> notice<00:01:07.650> when<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:07.979> when

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
one thing you'll notice when I'm when

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.179 
one thing you'll notice when I'm when
I'm<00:01:08.760> closing<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> blade<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.560> has<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> auto

I'm closing the blade this has the auto

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.149 
I'm closing the blade this has the auto
lock<00:01:11.549> system<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:13.020> liner<00:01:13.290> can't<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.950> just

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
lock system so the liner can't be just

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.120 
lock system so the liner can't be just
pushed<00:01:14.580> down<00:01:15.350> whenever<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.500> want<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.040> if

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
pushed down whenever you want so if

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.859 
pushed down whenever you want so if
you're<00:01:17.250> holding<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.610> block<00:01:17.850> blade<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.720> you're

you're holding the block blade if you're

cutting if you're using it you can't

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.789 
cutting if you're using it you can't
you're<00:01:21.000> not<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> squeeze<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.990> the

you're not going to squeeze the the
liner<00:01:23.040> over<00:01:23.189> because<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.850> has<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.119> auto<00:01:24.270> lock

red tab in the back do you think it'd be

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.780 
red tab in the back do you think it'd be

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
pretty complicated but it's fairly easy

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.149 
with your index finger on the back there
you<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.240> move<00:01:36.390> out<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> way

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
you can see that move out of the way

you can see that move out of the way
auto<00:01:38.159> locks<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.759> then<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> liner<00:01:39.180> closes<00:01:39.750> so

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
auto locks and then the liner closes so

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.370 
auto locks and then the liner closes so
pop<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.829> open<00:01:40.979> pull<00:01:41.909> down<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> tab<00:01:42.390> close<00:01:43.200> the
