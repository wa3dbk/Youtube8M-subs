00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
far while moving the camera I must admit

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.680 
far while moving the camera I must admit
that<00:00:49.260> I'll<00:00:49.590> run<00:00:50.160> into<00:00:50.579> some<00:00:50.820> limitations<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
that I'll run into some limitations I

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.330 
that I'll run into some limitations I
might<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.170> able<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.500> work<00:00:52.680> around<00:00:52.800> these<00:00:53.039> later

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
might be able to work around these later

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.549 
might be able to work around these later
but<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.030> far<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.390> only<00:00:54.600> tell<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.110> as

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
but so far I can only tell you this as

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.319 
but so far I can only tell you this as
your<00:00:55.800> mouse<00:00:56.039> mostly<00:00:56.520> controls<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> cameras

view<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.930> can't<00:00:58.170> control<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> direction

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
view you can't control the direction

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.400 
view you can't control the direction
your<00:00:59.340> character<00:00:59.879> spacing<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.750> means<00:01:01.050> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
your character spacing this means you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.100 
your character spacing this means you
cannot<00:01:01.800> walk<00:01:02.100> these<00:01:02.129> circles<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:03.600> even<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
cannot walk these circles or even a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.410 
cannot walk these circles or even a
slight<00:01:04.409> turn<00:01:04.680> that's<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.430> stretching<00:01:06.210> and

walking backwards so far secondly

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.859 
walking backwards so far secondly
sprinting<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:08.970> shouting<00:01:09.390> will<00:01:09.600> trigger

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
sprinting and shouting will trigger

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.380 
sprinting and shouting will trigger
