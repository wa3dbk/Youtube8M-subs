this Apple iPhone iPod data cable you

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.790 
this Apple iPhone iPod data cable you
may<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.509> noticed<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.139> year<00:00:16.350> cable<00:00:16.710> is

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
may have noticed that this year cable is

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.400 
may have noticed that this year cable is
quite<00:00:16.949> different<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.640> unique<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:19.260> are

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
quite different and unique and you are

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.650 
quite different and unique and you are
absolutely<00:00:19.619> tripped<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.939> obviously<00:00:21.420> not

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
absolutely tripped this is obviously not

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.480 
absolutely tripped this is obviously not
your<00:00:21.810> run-of-the-mill<00:00:22.020> iPhone<00:00:22.830> data<00:00:23.130> cable

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
your run-of-the-mill iPhone data cable

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.939 
your run-of-the-mill iPhone data cable
so<00:00:23.640> let's<00:00:23.850> take<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> closer<00:00:24.449> look<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.990> first

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
so let's take a closer look the first

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.470 
so let's take a closer look the first
thing<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.340> noticed<00:00:26.670> about<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:27.029> iPod

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
thing that I noticed about this iPod

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.390 
thing that I noticed about this iPod
iPhone<00:00:27.689> data<00:00:28.170> cable<00:00:28.560> was<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.099> was<00:00:29.220> wound

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
iPhone data cable was that it was wound

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.460 
iPhone data cable was that it was wound
up<00:00:29.609> now<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.539> possible<00:00:30.990> because<00:00:31.109> these

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
up now this is possible because these

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.630 
up now this is possible because these
mini<00:00:31.710> cables<00:00:32.099> are<00:00:32.189> flat<00:00:32.399> yep<00:00:33.239> what<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.640> was

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
mini cables are flat yep what I was

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.340 
mini cables are flat yep what I was
extremely<00:00:36.360> curious<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.930> how<00:00:37.170> they

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
extremely curious as to how they

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.959 
extremely curious as to how they
constructed<00:00:37.920> these<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> did<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> little

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
constructed these so I did a little

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.090 
constructed these so I did a little
snipping<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> traditional

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
snipping here you see the traditional

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.069 
snipping here you see the traditional
round<00:00:41.250> data<00:00:41.610> cable<00:00:41.969> there<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.450> actually<00:00:42.840> four

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
round data cable there are actually four

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.110 
round data cable there are actually four
separate<00:00:43.410> wires<00:00:43.649> living<00:00:44.129> within<00:00:44.399> one<00:00:44.579> cable

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
separate wires living within one cable

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.729 
separate wires living within one cable
they<00:00:45.390> are<00:00:45.450> bundled<00:00:45.870> together<00:00:46.020> which<00:00:46.500> makes

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
they are bundled together which makes

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.549 
they are bundled together which makes
the<00:00:46.890> round<00:00:47.070> shape<00:00:47.340> achievable<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:49.260> flat

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the round shape achievable now the flat

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.350 
the round shape achievable now the flat
one<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.890> quite<00:00:50.129> innovative<00:00:50.430> instead<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.239> just

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
one is quite innovative instead of just

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.180 
one is quite innovative instead of just
bundling<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> wires<00:00:52.079> together<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:53.100> have

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
bundling the wires together they have

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.860 
bundling the wires together they have
separated<00:00:53.730> them<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:53.969> line<00:00:54.239> them<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.600> they

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
separated them and line them up so they

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.069 
separated them and line them up so they
lay<00:00:54.989> flat<00:00:55.020> stuff<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.730> flat<00:00:56.940> iPod<00:00:57.360> iPhone<00:00:57.600> data

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
lay flat stuff the flat iPod iPhone data

get<00:01:09.210> tangled<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:10.260> I'm<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.500> bit<00:01:10.680> OCD<00:01:10.890> when

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
get tangled because I'm a bit OCD when

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.310

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
connectors is about doubled this is

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.740 
connectors is about doubled this is
because<00:01:44.310> they<00:01:44.460> needed<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.909> lay<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.240> wires<00:01:45.450> out

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
because they needed to lay the wires out

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.719 
because they needed to lay the wires out
flat<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.799> them<00:01:46.979> attached<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.549> there's

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
flat and have them attached so there's

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.109 
flat and have them attached so there's
more<00:01:47.939> space<00:01:48.180> needed<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:49.799> flat<00:01:50.009> iPhone<00:01:50.430> iPod

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
more space needed the flat iPhone iPod
