you kind of judging him on if you need
more<00:00:35.309> oil<00:00:35.370> if<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.880> need<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> little<00:00:36.300> more<00:00:36.570> if

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
more oil if you need a little more if

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.650 
more oil if you need a little more if
you<00:00:37.200> prefer<00:00:37.649> more<00:00:37.710> hot<00:00:38.160> red<00:00:38.700> pepper<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.360> for
