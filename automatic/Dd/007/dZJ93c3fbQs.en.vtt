00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
hi my name is Zachary Davis and today

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.340 
hi my name is Zachary Davis and today
I'm<00:00:05.670> going<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:06.089> be<00:00:06.180> showing<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.690> how<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.049> build

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
I'm going to be showing you how to build

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.700 
I'm going to be showing you how to build
a<00:00:07.410> computer<00:00:07.970> start<00:00:08.970> first<00:00:09.269> off<00:00:09.480> by<00:00:09.929> placing<00:00:10.440> a

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
a computer start first off by placing a

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.379 
a computer start first off by placing a
motherboard<00:00:11.130> into<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.400> computer<00:00:11.880> I'm<00:00:12.120> also

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
motherboard into the computer I'm also

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.940 
motherboard into the computer I'm also
going<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> move<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.110> camera<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.830> can

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
going to move the camera so that you can

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.310 
going to move the camera so that you can
actually<00:00:14.099> see<00:00:14.280> what<00:00:14.730> I'm<00:00:14.820> doing<00:00:18.080> so<00:00:19.080> this

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
actually see what I'm doing so this

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.859 
actually see what I'm doing so this
steel<00:00:19.590> box<00:00:19.890> here<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.880> computer<00:00:21.300> case<00:00:21.570> this

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
steel box here is the computer case this

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.429 
steel box here is the computer case this
actually<00:00:22.560> happens<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.039> be<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> actual<00:00:24.150> dell

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
actually happens to be a actual dell

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.250 
actually happens to be a actual dell
desktop<00:00:26.029> for<00:00:27.029> today's<00:00:27.330> purposes<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:28.019> chose

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
desktop for today's purposes I chose

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.080 
desktop for today's purposes I chose
this<00:00:28.529> because<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.189> little<00:00:29.519> bit<00:00:29.609> easier<00:00:29.789> to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
this because it's a little bit easier to

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.359 
this because it's a little bit easier to
assemble<00:00:30.359> than<00:00:30.900> your<00:00:31.439> normal<00:00:31.590> one<00:00:31.980> because

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
assemble than your normal one because

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.580 
assemble than your normal one because
there's<00:00:32.610> not<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:32.880> many<00:00:33.000> screws<00:00:33.420> involved<00:00:33.930> so

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
there's not as many screws involved so

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.900 
there's not as many screws involved so
we'll<00:00:34.770> start<00:00:35.010> again<00:00:35.130> by<00:00:35.430> placing<00:00:35.700> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
we'll start again by placing a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.299 
we'll start again by placing a
motherboard<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> computer<00:00:36.989> which<00:00:37.980> in

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
motherboard in the computer which in

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.590 
motherboard in the computer which in
this<00:00:38.430> case<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.450> this

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
this case you can see on this

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.979 
this case you can see on this
motherboard<00:00:40.309> there<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.120> slots<00:00:42.570> here

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
motherboard there are the slots here

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.130 
motherboard there are the slots here
these<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:44.370> what<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.940> compete<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.570> this

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
these are what to compete this this

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.670 
these are what to compete this this
particular<00:00:46.320> plate<00:00:46.890> uses<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.910> lock<00:00:48.090> into<00:00:48.680> this

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
particular plate uses to lock into this

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.770 
particular plate uses to lock into this
area<00:00:50.129> here

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
area here

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.119 
area here
so<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> slide<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:54.710> ensuring<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.739> this

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
so you slide it in ensuring that this

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.299 
so you slide it in ensuring that this
back<00:00:56.399> area<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:57.769> move<00:00:58.769> it<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> little<00:00:58.949> closer

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
back area here move it a little closer

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.270 
back area here move it a little closer
this<00:01:00.269> back<00:01:00.570> area<00:01:00.839> here<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.589> is<00:01:01.739> where<00:01:01.920> all

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
this back area here this is where all

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.799 
this back area here this is where all
your<00:01:02.579> connections<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> back<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
your connections are on the back of the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.740 
your connections are on the back of the
computer<00:01:04.009> this<00:01:05.009> must<00:01:05.640> make<00:01:05.820> sure<00:01:06.030> locks<00:01:06.450> into

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
computer this must make sure locks into

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.530 
computer this must make sure locks into
place<00:01:09.590> there<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.680> go<00:01:10.830> very<00:01:11.220> walk<00:01:11.540> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
place there you go very walk the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.210 
place there you go very walk the
motherboard<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> now<00:01:13.290> installed<00:01:13.590> into<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
motherboard is now installed into the

motherboard is now installed into the
computer<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:16.290> next<00:01:16.920> step<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:18.000> little<00:01:18.330> white

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
computer the next step this little white

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.020 
computer the next step this little white
square<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.130> where<00:01:20.310> your<00:01:20.520> processor

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
square here this is where your processor

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.700 
square here this is where your processor
goes<00:01:21.240> now<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.930> don't<00:01:22.080> know<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.500> guys<00:01:22.649> can

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
goes now I don't know if you guys can

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.190 
goes now I don't know if you guys can
really<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:24.000> there's<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.390> little<00:01:24.570> lever<00:01:24.899> on

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
really see but there's a little lever on

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.700 
really see but there's a little lever on
the<00:01:25.229> side<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:26.300> you<00:01:27.300> must<00:01:27.539> lift<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:28.020> actually

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the side here you must lift up actually

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.440 
the side here you must lift up actually
you<00:01:28.830> can<00:01:28.950> kind<00:01:29.160> of<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:29.789> see<00:01:30.330> this

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
you can kind of see it now see this

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.760 
you can kind of see it now see this
little<00:01:30.509> thing<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:30.899> here<00:01:31.460> that's<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.670> lever

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.679 

processor<00:01:37.909> normally<00:01:38.909> when<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.179> go<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.359> put<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
processor normally when you go to put it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.260 
processor normally when you go to put it
in<00:01:40.159> you're<00:01:41.159> going<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.909> put<00:01:42.090> this

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
in you're going to have to put this

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.399 
in you're going to have to put this
stuff<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.409> called<00:01:43.770> thermal<00:01:44.460> paste<00:01:45.409> this

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
stuff on it called thermal paste this

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.529 
stuff on it called thermal paste this
stuff<00:01:47.069> I<00:01:47.369> guess<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.939> shouldn't<00:01:48.149> really<00:01:48.299> say

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
stuff I guess I shouldn't really say

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.260 
stuff I guess I shouldn't really say
stuff<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.109> this<00:01:49.200> stuff<00:01:49.469> here<00:01:50.270> actually

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
stuff but this stuff here actually

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.709 
stuff but this stuff here actually
happens<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.990> help<00:01:52.679> in<00:01:52.950> cooling<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.060> processor

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
happens to help in cooling the processor

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.690 
happens to help in cooling the processor
and<00:01:54.929> ensuring<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.130> does<00:01:56.250> not<00:01:56.369> overheat

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
and ensuring that it does not overheat

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.760 
and ensuring that it does not overheat
therefore<00:01:57.630> your<00:01:57.959> computer<00:01:58.319> down<00:01:59.149> and<00:02:01.310> this

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.910 

this<00:02:06.399> is<00:02:06.969> the<00:02:07.149> process<00:02:07.600> it's<00:02:08.379> just<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.679> little

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
this is the process it's just a little

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.710 
this is the process it's just a little
basically<00:02:09.910> looks<00:02:10.090> like<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.239> piece<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.450> metal

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
basically looks like a piece of metal

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.509 
basically looks like a piece of metal
with<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.319> bunch<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.620> pins<00:02:11.830> coming<00:02:12.160> out<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.310> it

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
with a bunch of pins coming out of it

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.880 
with a bunch of pins coming out of it
that's<00:02:13.180> what<00:02:13.450> fits<00:02:13.690> into<00:02:13.959> this<00:02:14.260> white<00:02:14.500> slot

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
that's what fits into this white slot

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.830 
that's what fits into this white slot
now<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.280> do<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:16.180> must<00:02:16.390> be<00:02:16.569> very<00:02:16.720> careful

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
now to do this you must be very careful

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.220 
now to do this you must be very careful
first<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.560> all<00:02:17.650> all<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.849> have<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.209> do<00:02:19.390> is

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
first of all all you have to do is

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.640 
first of all all you have to do is
simply<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:20.830> drop<00:02:21.129> this<00:02:21.370> in<00:02:21.670> now<00:02:22.290> there's<00:02:23.290> one

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
simply just drop this in now there's one

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.780 
simply just drop this in now there's one
thing<00:02:23.920> here<00:02:25.290> yes<00:02:26.290> sorry<00:02:26.799> this<00:02:27.310> little<00:02:27.549> area

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
thing here yes sorry this little area

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.059 
thing here yes sorry this little area
here<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.569> pins<00:02:28.810> are<00:02:28.959> missing<00:02:29.349> there's

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
here that the pins are missing there's

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.680 
here that the pins are missing there's
an<00:02:30.340> identical<00:02:30.819> area<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.450> motherboard

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
an identical area on the motherboard

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.800 
an identical area on the motherboard
that<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.349> must<00:02:32.530> make<00:02:32.739> sure<00:02:32.769> that<00:02:33.760> area<00:02:34.299> is

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
that you must make sure that area is

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.259 
that you must make sure that area is
facing<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.290> same<00:02:35.560> one<00:02:35.799> on<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.950> motherboard<00:02:36.269> so

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
facing the same one on a motherboard so

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.120 
facing the same one on a motherboard so
you<00:02:37.330> set<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.380> should<00:02:38.530> literally<00:02:38.860> just

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
you set it in it should literally just

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.680 
you set it in it should literally just
fall<00:02:39.489> into<00:02:39.640> place<00:02:39.819> you<00:02:40.150> shouldn't<00:02:40.450> have<00:02:40.569> to

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
fall into place you shouldn't have to

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.220 
fall into place you shouldn't have to
push<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.579> what<00:02:42.579> you'll<00:02:42.760> do<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.569> now<00:02:43.810> lock<00:02:44.079> that

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
push it what you'll do is now lock that

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.770 
push it what you'll do is now lock that
lever<00:02:44.470> your<00:02:45.340> processor<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.060> now<00:02:46.209> installed<00:02:46.480> on

this for real I'm doing this with a gear
that<00:03:06.819> happens<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.209> be<00:03:07.299> dead<00:03:07.540> but<00:03:07.810> when<00:03:07.959> you're

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
that happens to be dead but when you're

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.390 
that happens to be dead but when you're
doing<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:08.379> actually<00:03:08.769> build<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.040> computer

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
doing this actually build a computer

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.129 
doing this actually build a computer
this<00:03:09.910> is<00:03:10.060> where<00:03:10.209> you'll<00:03:10.389> apply<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.720> thermal

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
this is where you'll apply the thermal

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:12.300 
this is where you'll apply the thermal
paste<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.560> you'll<00:03:11.650> want<00:03:11.769> to<00:03:11.829> make<00:03:11.889> sure<00:03:12.010> that

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
paste and you'll want to make sure that

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.490 
paste and you'll want to make sure that
it's<00:03:12.430> nice<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:12.730> smooth<00:03:13.389> nice<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.079> thick<00:03:14.290> on

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
it's nice and smooth nice and thick on

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.140 
it's nice and smooth nice and thick on
that<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:16.269> install<00:03:16.720> this<00:03:17.609> there's<00:03:18.609> a<00:03:18.700> couple<00:03:18.880> of

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
that to install this there's a couple of

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.910 
that to install this there's a couple of
there's<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.510> bracket<00:03:20.019> around<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.650> switch

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
there's a bracket around that switch

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.440 
there's a bracket around that switch
again<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.430> know<00:03:21.519> it's<00:03:21.730> kind<00:03:21.910> of<00:03:21.940> hard<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.180> see

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
again I know it's kind of hard to see

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.250 
again I know it's kind of hard to see
I'll<00:03:22.780> have<00:03:23.079> very<00:03:23.290> much<00:03:23.410> light<00:03:23.680> in<00:03:23.859> here<00:03:25.260> it

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
I'll have very much light in here it

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.110 
I'll have very much light in here it
locks<00:03:26.500> into<00:03:26.769> place<00:03:26.950> underneath<00:03:27.489> these<00:03:27.760> little

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
locks into place underneath these little

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.250 
locks into place underneath these little
Clips<00:03:28.870> here<00:03:29.139> so<00:03:29.500> all<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.799> simply<00:03:30.010> do<00:03:31.049> pop<00:03:32.049> it

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
Clips here so all you simply do pop it

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.980 
Clips here so all you simply do pop it
in<00:03:32.410> here<00:03:33.599> just<00:03:34.599> like<00:03:34.780> so

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
in here just like so

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.510 
in here just like so
now<00:03:36.610> there's<00:03:37.610> a<00:03:37.670> wire<00:03:37.940> coming<00:03:38.360> off<00:03:38.600> of<00:03:38.630> this

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
now there's a wire coming off of this

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.020 
now there's a wire coming off of this
which<00:03:40.520> is<00:03:41.210> going<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.810> get<00:03:41.930> plugged<00:03:42.230> in<00:03:42.500> right

which is going to get plugged in right
next<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.920> put<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.010> motherboard<00:03:46.490> or<00:03:46.640> right

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
next to put the motherboard or right

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.960 
next to put the motherboard or right
next<00:03:47.300> to<00:03:47.360> where<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.480> processor<00:03:48.020> is<00:03:48.050> I'm<00:03:48.230> sorry
