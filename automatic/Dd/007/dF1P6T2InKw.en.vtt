is<00:00:59.739> where<00:00:59.949> my<00:01:00.129> hem<00:01:00.339> will<00:01:00.550> be<00:01:00.730> something<00:01:01.089> that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
is where my hem will be something that

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.599 
is where my hem will be something that
will<00:01:01.569> be<00:01:01.809> pretty<00:01:02.079> good<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:03.069> other<00:01:03.219> thing<00:01:03.579> that

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
will be pretty good the other thing that

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.990 
will be pretty good the other thing that
i<00:01:03.789> looked<00:01:04.180> at<00:01:04.390> was<00:01:04.720> this<00:01:05.530> side<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.759> top

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
i looked at was this side of the top

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.109 
i looked at was this side of the top
really<00:01:07.720> moves<00:01:07.960> this<00:01:08.200> way<00:01:08.470> and<00:01:08.799> even<00:01:09.430> though<00:01:10.090> i

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
really moves this way and even though i

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.469 
really moves this way and even though i
think<00:01:10.570> when<00:01:10.689> i<00:01:10.720> put<00:01:11.020> this<00:01:11.170> little<00:01:11.970> base<00:01:12.970> on<00:01:13.210> for

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
think when i put this little base on for

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.810 
think when i put this little base on for
the<00:01:13.600> skirt<00:01:13.960> it<00:01:14.200> might<00:01:14.710> help<00:01:14.979> it<00:01:15.189> out<00:01:15.280> just<00:01:15.640> a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
the skirt it might help it out just a

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.810 
the skirt it might help it out just a
little<00:01:15.850> bit<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:17.170> i<00:01:17.439> think<00:01:18.399> what<00:01:18.549> i'm<00:01:18.640> going<00:01:18.759> to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
little bit but i think what i'm going to

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.660 
little bit but i think what i'm going to
do<00:01:19.030> is<00:01:19.060> I'm<00:01:19.210> going<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.420> move<00:01:19.600> this<00:01:19.899> down<00:01:20.229> um<00:01:20.670> i

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
do is I'm going to move this down um i

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.609 
do is I'm going to move this down um i
have<00:01:21.729> put<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.299> notches<00:01:22.570> on<00:01:23.079> top<00:01:23.320> of<00:01:23.469> the

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
have put the notches on top of the

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.770 
have put the notches on top of the
notches<00:01:23.860> at<00:01:24.189> the<00:01:24.310> bottom<00:01:24.820> but<00:01:25.420> i<00:01:25.450> do<00:01:25.570> think

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
notches at the bottom but i do think

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.020 
notches at the bottom but i do think
that<00:01:26.110> this<00:01:26.350> needs<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.770> move<00:01:27.040> down<00:01:27.460> just<00:01:27.939> a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
that this needs to move down just a

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.730 
that this needs to move down just a
little<00:01:28.180> bit<00:01:28.329> you<00:01:28.600> see<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:29.049> that<00:01:29.079> you<00:01:29.469> can<00:01:29.710> have

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
little bit you see so that you can have

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.690 
little bit you see so that you can have
it<00:01:30.159> perfectly<00:01:31.119> just<00:01:31.450> like<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:33.369> you<00:01:33.579> know

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
it perfectly just like that and you know

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.810 
it perfectly just like that and you know
what<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:33.880> will<00:01:34.210> just<00:01:34.420> be<00:01:34.570> with<00:01:34.719> a<00:01:34.750> little

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
what that will just be with a little

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.840 
what that will just be with a little
probably<00:01:36.820> not<00:01:37.060> even<00:01:37.689> a<00:01:38.430> quarter<00:01:39.430> reach<00:01:39.700> that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
probably not even a quarter reach that

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.910 
probably not even a quarter reach that
you<00:01:40.000> have<00:01:40.149> to<00:01:40.299> you<00:01:40.479> see<00:01:40.719> not<00:01:41.229> even<00:01:41.469> a<00:01:41.680> cold

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920

you have to you see not even a cold
arrange<00:01:42.189> that<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.490> have<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.789> pull<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.119> down<00:01:43.299> so

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
arrange that you have to pull it down so

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.630 
arrange that you have to pull it down so
