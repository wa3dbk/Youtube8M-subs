West<00:00:17.220> Country<00:00:17.539> taught<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.720> balance<00:00:19.020> of

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
West Country taught the balance of

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.200 
West Country taught the balance of

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
divorce and accounts in the showjumping

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.910 
divorce and accounts in the showjumping
the<00:00:21.540> flying<00:00:21.780> changes<00:00:22.200> and<00:00:22.350> balance<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.860> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the flying changes and balance and the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.070 
the flying changes and balance and the
obedience<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.700> so<00:00:24.240> we<00:00:24.360> have<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.810> get<00:00:24.990> on

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
obedience and so we have to just get on

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.110 
obedience and so we have to just get on
bit<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.650> think<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.400> probably<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:27.030> the

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
bit I think it's probably just the

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.180 
bit I think it's probably just the
frustration<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:28.020> the<00:00:28.170> whole<00:00:28.350> thing<00:00:28.620> you<00:00:29.160> know

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
frustration of the whole thing you know

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.999 
frustration of the whole thing you know
you<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.550> do<00:00:29.730> maybe<00:00:30.360> the<00:00:30.539> personal<00:00:31.530> best<00:00:31.770> or

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
you can do maybe the personal best or

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.279 
you can do maybe the personal best or
test<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.550> your<00:00:32.699> life<00:00:32.879> and<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.750> come<00:00:33.960> out<00:00:34.140> and

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 
test of your life and you come out and

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:35.510 
test of your life and you come out and
they're<00:00:34.350> still<00:00:34.620> little<00:00:34.800> things<00:00:35.129> that<00:00:35.370> could

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
they're still little things that could

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.069 
they're still little things that could
have<00:00:35.610> been<00:00:35.700> better<00:00:35.970> it's<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.630> way<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
have been better it's in a way the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.200 
have been better it's in a way the
toughest<00:00:37.410> discipline<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.790> does<00:00:38.940> take<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
toughest discipline and it does take the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
toughest discipline and it does take the
longest<00:00:39.540> time<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.780> establish<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.710> good<00:00:41.220> result

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
longest time to establish a good result

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.860 
longest time to establish a good result
and<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.850> can't<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> goodra<00:00:42.600> Sarge

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
and if you can't do a goodra Sarge

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.270 
and if you can't do a goodra Sarge
you're<00:00:43.440> not<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:43.860> any<00:00:44.010> good<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you're not going to do any good and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.160 
you're not going to do any good and
eventing<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.120> very<00:00:45.300> very<00:00:45.450> frustrating

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
eventing so it's very very frustrating

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.560 
eventing so it's very very frustrating
now<00:00:46.950> maybe<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.310> mystery<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.790> some<00:00:48.000> but<00:00:48.239> one<00:00:48.420> man

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
now maybe a mystery to some but one man

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.210 
now maybe a mystery to some but one man
who<00:00:48.690> does<00:00:48.899> understand<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> sydney

example of a fantastic walk here the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.750 
example of a fantastic walk here the
overstepping<00:04:58.620> is<00:04:58.920> one<00:04:59.160> thing<00:04:59.460> that<00:04:59.490> the

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
overstepping is one thing that the

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
again this test is a an example of the

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.100 
again this test is a an example of the
relaxation<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:19.130> harmony<00:05:19.520> that<00:05:19.669> is<00:05:20.110> what

that invisible communication is what

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.779 
that invisible communication is what
you're<00:06:21.650> looking<00:06:21.889> for<00:06:22.130> and<00:06:22.400> that's<00:06:22.610> an

you're looking for and that's an
exercise<00:06:23.240> that<00:06:23.539> is<00:06:23.900> used<00:06:24.169> so<00:06:24.500> much<00:06:24.800> on<00:06:25.010> the

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
exercise that is used so much on the

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.270 
exercise that is used so much on the
cross-country<00:06:25.370> about<00:06:26.360> changes<00:06:26.810> of<00:06:26.960> speed

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
cross-country about changes of speed

cross-country about changes of speed
back<00:06:28.280> to<00:06:28.580> the<00:06:29.389> serpentine<00:06:30.080> the<00:06:30.530> first<00:06:31.430> loop

back to the serpentine the first loop

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.839 
back to the serpentine the first loop
you<00:06:31.880> see<00:06:32.120> that<00:06:32.419> is<00:06:33.130> with<00:06:34.130> a<00:06:34.160> horse<00:06:34.430> on<00:06:34.669> the

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
you see that is with a horse on the

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:38.080 
you see that is with a horse on the
wrong<00:06:35.060> lead<00:06:35.300> with<00:06:35.570> this<00:06:35.800> that's<00:06:36.800> not<00:06:37.789> natural

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
wrong lead with this that's not natural

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.640 
wrong lead with this that's not natural
for<00:06:38.570> the<00:06:38.630> way<00:06:38.750> that<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.050> horse<00:06:39.229> Canter's<00:06:39.620> and

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
for the way that the horse Canter's and

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.980 
for the way that the horse Canter's and
then<00:06:39.919> he<00:06:40.039> changes<00:06:40.970> this<00:06:41.090> lead<00:06:41.300> directly<00:06:41.780> at

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
then he changes this lead directly at

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.409 
then he changes this lead directly at
the<00:06:42.260> judge<00:06:42.500> a<00:06:42.710> flying<00:06:43.310> change<00:06:43.580> on<00:06:43.849> the<00:06:44.180> center

the judge a flying change on the center

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.140 
the judge a flying change on the center
line

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.980 

one<00:06:47.990> more<00:06:48.230> movement<00:06:48.680> go<00:06:49.370> across<00:06:49.700> the<00:06:50.090> short

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
one more movement go across the short
