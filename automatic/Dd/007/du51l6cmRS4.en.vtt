more<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> g11<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.250> three<00:00:48.030> bursts

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
more like the g11 with the three bursts

great<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:16.030> know<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> degree<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:17.020> find<00:02:17.830> it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
great you know to a degree I find it

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.740 
great you know to a degree I find it
really<00:02:18.280> friggin<00:02:18.910> useful<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.480> actually

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
really friggin useful it's actually

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.420 
really friggin useful it's actually
really<00:02:19.900> fun<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.590> find<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.130> be<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.250> lot

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
really fun and so I find it to be a lot

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.400 
really fun and so I find it to be a lot
better<00:02:21.520> than<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.850> predator<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:23.170> have<00:02:23.290> to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
better than the predator you have to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.050 
better than the predator you have to
wait<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.560> little<00:02:23.650> bit<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.920> kikyo<00:02:24.220> but<00:02:24.550> i<00:02:24.580> would

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
wait a little bit to kikyo but i would

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.460 
wait a little bit to kikyo but i would
recommend<00:02:25.420> using<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.780> over<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.200> predator

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
recommend using that over the predator

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.940 
recommend using that over the predator

level 30 or so when you unlock this gun

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.240 
level 30 or so when you unlock this gun
is<00:03:01.150> difficult<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:02.320> will<00:03:02.560> die<00:03:02.740> a<00:03:02.770> lot<00:03:03.040> and

you'll die from all different directions
I'd<00:03:05.020> say<00:03:05.260> stick<00:03:05.680> between<00:03:05.860> teammates

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
I'd say stick between teammates

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.570 
I'd say stick between teammates
throughout<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.600> game<00:03:07.780> because<00:03:07.990> you<00:03:08.550> want<00:03:09.550> to

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
throughout this game because you want to

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.370 
throughout this game because you want to
have<00:03:09.700> your<00:03:09.820> flanks<00:03:10.300> covered<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:11.200> want<00:03:11.350> to

have your flanks covered you you want to

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.410 
have your flanks covered you you want to
sort<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.590> kick<00:03:11.860> off<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.220> enemy's<00:03:12.550> arm<00:03:12.850> as<00:03:13.060> your

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
teammates do that way you're more likely

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.960 
teammates do that way you're more likely
to<00:03:16.030> stay<00:03:16.210> alive<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:17.160> if<00:03:18.160> you<00:03:18.310> don't<00:03:18.820> think

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
was that yes um salt wise i'd say the

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.520 
was that yes um salt wise i'd say the
scar-h<00:04:24.789> is<00:04:25.120> actually<00:04:25.510> um<00:04:25.690> it's<00:04:26.080> not<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.350> best

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
scar-h is actually um it's not the best

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.330 
scar-h is actually um it's not the best
gun

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
gun

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.730 
gun
but<00:04:27.910> it<00:04:28.030> on<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.210> delta<00:04:28.660> Java<00:04:28.870> has<00:04:29.020> on<00:04:29.230> fairly<00:04:29.530> low

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
but it on a delta Java has on fairly low

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.960 
but it on a delta Java has on fairly low
recoil<00:04:29.919> especially<00:04:30.550> when<00:04:30.639> you<00:04:30.699> get<00:04:30.790> the

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
recoil especially when you get the

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.040 
recoil especially when you get the
proficiency<00:04:31.570> that<00:04:31.600> lowers<00:04:31.930> recoil<00:04:32.350> and

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
proficiency that lowers recoil and

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.189 
proficiency that lowers recoil and
basically<00:04:35.050> sort<00:04:35.290> of<00:04:35.410> use<00:04:36.280> those<00:04:36.490> 2<00:04:36.760> i'd<00:04:36.910> say

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
basically sort of use those 2 i'd say

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.570 
basically sort of use those 2 i'd say
you<00:04:38.199> can't<00:04:38.380> experiment<00:04:38.710> around<00:04:38.949> like<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.370> think

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
you can't experiment around like I think

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.850 
you can't experiment around like I think
that<00:04:39.699> I'm<00:04:39.850> PP<00:04:40.210> 290<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:40.870> believe<00:04:41.199> it's<00:04:41.350> called<00:04:41.530> is

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
that I'm PP 290 I believe it's called is
