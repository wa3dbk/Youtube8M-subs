00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:12.530
 It's about the stem cells that are used to treat anti-aging. 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:17.680
 Did you ever not know cropped know for example, holding a long Mohan 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:22.880
 Woo-suk , you've been on a lot for a while because you're a doctor . 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.839
 I could hear a lot of stories saying that he could be younger than a stem cell. 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.550
 is that so 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:32.210
 That's right . I'll give you three phones to 210 different kinds of human cells. 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.289
 It is called pluripotent cell because it is differentiated . 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.760
 It is also used in the prevention and treatment of various stem cells from Noah's family. 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:42.350
 We are talking about 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.489
 I also found out about this. 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.629
 I've got it together. 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.629
 Let's meet on the screen. 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:58.700
 Harbor Pier I not die forever. What does that even grimace 4 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:01.600
 I liked the film when I made the material for my thoughts, 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:08.580
 It's just a story. 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.580
 I just could not achieve a win, even in the hands of the First Qin Emperor who built the whole world 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.619
 The Hollywood Topstar Dam, which I boasted in advance , 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.270
 I could not be free. 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:26.040
 Four law schools boasted of three deadly citizens 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.159
 I really can not stop Noah. 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:34.409
 I do not want this to be fair 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:39.360
 I think you want to read a little less than others. 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.600
 I do not want anyone to like it anymore. 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.649
 I write a lot of care, such as cosmetics or geureongeo 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.649
 Let it go. 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.119
 I think both sexes are sad. 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:02:00.250
 So the 5th so I hungry habits best pub 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:06.400
 The first is to drink 2 liters of water a day 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.740
 Secondly, the light of the hot one week buck out, as well as indoor sun cream 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.290
 Grooming 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.980
 Third, only the joint lives. 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.730
 Always a constant exercise is essential 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:24.430
 Fourth Place is also no spirit dries nails 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:30.490
 I'm more of structural brain training path as well as how the free party anyway matters 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:36.490
 Anti-aging habits are effective when both body and mind are considered together 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:40.540
 The market is growing fast as much interest in anti-aging habits. 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:45.580
 Of these, Kaizel is the area of ​​interest. 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:50.680
 The twigs that come down the full moon y and the fruit are just like this 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:57.720
 It's derived from me. It 's all three minutes 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.720
 Do you know that stem cells come from stem cells? 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:07.859
 Stem cells refer to subcellular cells or cells. 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:11.060
 Muscle and bony intestinal and skin regeneration Various complex and complex organ systems 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:15.829
 It comes from here. 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:20.420
 Currently, the research and treatment of these stem cells is very active. 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:26.770
 Recently, they created human mini brain with stem cells. 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:31.300
 So I was doing on stem cells also relevant as to prevent aging 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.430
 To investigate this , a research institute in Seoul 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.320
 I've been looking. 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:41.010
 Stem cells are associated with Noah and can be cured by stem cells 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:46.230
 Is it true? 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:48.270
 When a person is older, the stem cell in the body tissue b 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.620
 You'll lose less. 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:58.740
 I can say that it is now five. 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:00.570
 Nowadays, it classified the nonghwal in Europe, yet the disease reporting disease 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.980
 There is 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:08.160
 Currently, there are many studies on stem cells in Korea 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:14.280
 How is it applied? 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:16.170
 The domestic research on embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells, cell differentiation Station 2 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.459
 We're actively working on it. 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:26.130
 Agriculture is the number of the world's 7th level 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:28.080
 In the past 10 years around the world, preparations for three putt cuts have been made in 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.250
 5600 passport 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:37.999
 Itguyo 302 degree or not at confess UK passport in Japan 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:41.449
 There are 220 inns in Korea and they are neglecting the oil. 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:44.900
 In the outside of the no-first-line disease 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:47.930
 Corneal regeneration or stroke 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:55.620
 Itguyo other genius to use every stem cells 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:59.520
 In Korea, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's RAD incurable diseases and anti-aging 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:05.370
 We appear in power and use fur of inhabitants 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:10.800
 How many people are enjoying the beauty of all walks ? 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:15.360
 I sometimes look geseo've heard of new treatments disease is a good lunch 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.310
 Oh procedure is seven won'm not sure I know where to buy damaged cells geolro 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.070
 I have it 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.010
 The world of tangled stem cells 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:28.470
 So here 's where I found it. 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:32.760
 It is a specialized hospital for aging in Seoul that utilizes stem cell receptor antagonization7 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:37.920
 What treatment will I That can be seen in three 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:43.380
 Local treatment : Systemic treatment Surgical treatment is localized 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:50.190
 Pia is a method for treating a second shot in the face and systemic approach 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:55.160
 The third method of administration is by the intravenous to the surgery, such as in surgery room 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.160
 There are three kinds of therapies that can be combined. 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:03.969
 Noah I have a lot of facial wrinkles now. 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.870
 But this may also require households to envy the fact then also live carte 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:09.969
 To 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:15.069
 Stem cells and seems to be a bit younger without a trace 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:19.360
 From the side of the customer and the cuticle to the cosmetic surgery without surgery, 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:22.509
 Stem cells that are widely used in the field 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:27.580
 The possibilities are endless. 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:30.880
 Have malyijyo is the development of medical technology, as now, look at this way, one day English 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:35.740
 Would not it be possible to do the same thing? 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:39.669
 So the procedure with stem cells is up to a certain level. 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:43.330
 At the current stage of stem cell research, stage 4 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:48.220
 It will be more than you imagine. 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:54.400
 Including incompetent disorders such as upper parkinson and intracranial damage 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:55.180
 It can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases ranging from nerve damage or autoimmune diseases 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.270
 I have. 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:07.180
 In addition , the range of treatment is very wide ranging from anti-aging and molding 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:11.590
 In the future , these stem cell treatments can be used to 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.889
 It is also very obvious that it will develop as a core technology. 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:18.380
 U 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:22.880
 For this reason, the current global active little progress in stem cell research 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:25.720
 In Korea, which has slowed down recently, 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:31.420
 I'm working. 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:33.200
 4 There are a lot of 800's broken in this way. 

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:37.460
 I think there is. 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:40.100
 It was fitted in the foil and there was a lot of active oxygen , 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:45.440
 help 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:50.690
 Stem cell therapy itself, there are no side effects, so by the United States fda 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:54.890
 So it is clear that those who are treated are treated without any 

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:59.150
 I think it's culture and cheese 

00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:03.500
 You can not catch the ages, but you can not stop the eating line. 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:06.230
 But it's everyone's mind that wants to slow it down a bit. 

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:11.300
 Meeting such minds and high technology 

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:13.810
 Those in the movie, which were considered impossible, 

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.810
 Maybe not
