00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.559
 The principle of operation of the modern electric 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.780
 meat grinder is no different from the one that else 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.700
 mom she asked twist the difference only 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.350
 is that all physical effort for 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.450
 work with this device is reduced to 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.310
 minimum work that was capable 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.470
 pump biceps like a schwarz 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.210
 now performs an electric motor if 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.310
 engine improvement gives 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.050
 the obvious advantage then I became 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.790
 I wonder what else can boast 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.040
 modern meat grinder let's check 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.040
 This is an example of kenwood mg 516 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.640
 first pay attention to the features 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.740
 construction and principle of operation of this 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.630
 grinder for grinding let's say meat and 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.370
 put it in a bowl set under 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.380
 feed pipe then this meat through 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.150
 the hole in the dish using the pusher 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.590
 we get the primary pirates 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.630
 crushed and then gets on 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.850
 the main self-sharpening knife which 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.739
 grinds meat stuffing interacting with 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.660
 one-to-one mesh design 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.610
 hand our hands everything is going easy and 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.710
 Quickly set there are three grids for cutting 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.570
 with holes of different diameter large 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.119
 for pork and fish average for beef 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.710
 and vegetables and small for chicken using 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.509
 special tips different lengths and 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.569
 thickness grinder can make sausage 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.380
 from arteries and kmb dag uh you 

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:16.689
 imagine 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.459
 the main thing is not having learned about this 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.319
 I looked for functions and understood that it 

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:22.329
 delicious meat things that you 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:24.520
 worth trying to do by the way keep 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.469
 nozzles are very convenient to their manufacturer 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.090
 I'll just stick in the pusher in the set 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.439
 exclusive for clamping nut but not 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.310
 overdo it from you risk 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.200
 wedge moto 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.969
 in addition to the main nozzle included 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.069
 drumhead attachment she 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.479
 it is arranged even easier than its main need 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.700
 just attach to the main unit 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.679
 insert the desired drum and fasten the screw 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.270
 spinning drum cut rubs 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.369
 grinds still with experience doing 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.560
 tubeable products 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.880
 still on this drum there is a prize sector and 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.889
 your leonid yakubovich 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.109
 In total there are 5 different reels 2 for 

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:55.179
 shredders of different sizes and 3 graters for 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.539
 solid foods fine grater and large 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.359
 grater 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.560
 and if you want from this you can do 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.779
 the bell around the neck is all made of 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.189
 present harsh metals reliability 

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:05.049
 designs and individual parts not 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.789
 makes you doubt more precisely makes 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.440
 I doubt, unlike manual 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.119
 sisters setting this meat grinder not 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.650
 requires special dancing with a tambourine 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.209
 it does not need some special way 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.799
 set and fasten 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.659
 rubber feet do not allow and 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.250
 slide on the table the main unit too 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.140
 completely metal but it is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.819
 just two buttons big toggle switch 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.769
 engine start and reverse button 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.110
 side of a large wine clamping nozzle 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.120
 engine power 1600 watts and speed 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.890
 meat processing two kilograms per minute 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.390
 of the disadvantages can be noted too 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.129
 a large weight of five and a half kilograms 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.690
 but this is due to the use of metal 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.420
 I was also confused by a small feature 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.599
 this unit is noise if you never 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.599
 did not hear how fly an-72 like this 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.340
 but in general it is simple and convenient 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.380
 meat grinder and of course it makes it easier 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.270
 Work on the hell but at the same time its device 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.040
 not too intricate to cope with it 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.720
 any person even without working skills with 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.400
 grinder i recommend this thing to those 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.170
 whom big family and time want 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.280
 give more to your family than get ready 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.870
