bass<00:00:30.240> lines<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:31.140> you're<00:00:31.410> playing<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> song

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
bass lines if you're playing on a song

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.319 
bass lines if you're playing on a song
that<00:00:32.460> has<00:00:32.550> two<00:00:32.820> chords

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
that has two chords

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.959 
that has two chords
maybe<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.230> song<00:00:34.380> alternates<00:00:34.920> between<00:00:35.070> D<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
maybe the song alternates between D and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.869 
maybe the song alternates between D and
G<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.960> could<00:00:37.380> start<00:00:37.649> by<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.730> practicing

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
G you could start by just practicing

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
G you could start by just practicing
playing<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.540> root<00:00:39.750> notes<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.230> those<00:00:40.739> two

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
playing the root notes of those two

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.819 
playing the root notes of those two
chords<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.460> time<00:00:42.290> maybe<00:00:43.290> we'll<00:00:43.500> start<00:00:43.710> with

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
chords in time maybe we'll start with

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.750 
chords in time maybe we'll start with
quarter<00:00:44.100> notes<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.940> could<00:00:45.090> play<00:00:49.640> and<00:00:50.640> maybe

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
quarter notes you could play and maybe

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.150 
quarter notes you could play and maybe
that's<00:00:51.000> appropriate<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.600> situation<00:00:55.160> if

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
that's appropriate for this situation if

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.500 
that's appropriate for this situation if
you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.430> add<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> couple<00:00:56.789> other<00:00:57.000> notes<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.449> you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
you can add a couple other notes as you

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:10.590 
you can add a couple other notes as you
hear<00:00:57.690> them<00:01:02.000> keep<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.120> simple

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.110 

maybe<00:01:11.600> then<00:01:12.550> it<00:01:13.550> might<00:01:13.700> even<00:01:13.820> just<00:01:14.030> be

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
maybe then it might even just be

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.490 
maybe then it might even just be
appropriate<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:14.630> just<00:01:14.659> play<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:14.990> rhythm<00:01:15.320> you

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
appropriate to just play a rhythm you

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.070 
appropriate to just play a rhythm you
can<00:01:16.460> still<00:01:16.700> play<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:16.820> Roo<00:01:17.060> notes<00:01:17.330> but<00:01:17.930> maybe

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
can still play the Roo notes but maybe

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.719 
can still play the Roo notes but maybe
you<00:01:18.170> don't<00:01:18.260> have<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.470> play<00:01:18.680> all<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.220> all<00:01:19.550> the

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
you don't have to play all the all the

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:33.550 
you don't have to play all the all the
beats<00:01:31.750> well<00:01:32.750> maybe<00:01:32.900> it's<00:01:33.050> a<00:01:33.110> permit<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.440> play

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
beats well maybe it's a permit to play

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:45.690 
beats well maybe it's a permit to play
something<00:01:33.920> more<00:01:34.220> like<00:01:34.640> melodic<00:01:35.240> longer<00:01:35.930> tones

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:02:17.430 

or<00:01:46.700> maybe<00:01:46.910> just<00:01:47.180> something<00:01:47.360> shorter

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:30.640 

sometimes<00:02:18.440> less<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:18.650> more<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:30.140> basically<00:02:30.440> you

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
sometimes less is more so basically you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.830 
sometimes less is more so basically you
can<00:02:30.739> provide<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.250> whole<00:02:31.489> set<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:31.940> options<00:02:32.690> for

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
can provide a whole set of options for

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.690 
can provide a whole set of options for
yourself<00:02:33.200> maybe<00:02:33.709> three<00:02:34.130> or<00:02:34.220> four<00:02:34.370> things<00:02:34.519> you

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
yourself maybe three or four things you

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.180 
yourself maybe three or four things you
really<00:02:34.940> like<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.329> do<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.750> if<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:36.799> have<00:02:36.829> those

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
really like to do and if you have those

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.800 
really like to do and if you have those
in<00:02:37.310> your<00:02:37.400> back<00:02:37.549> pocket<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.030> can<00:02:38.239> try<00:02:38.420> them<00:02:38.600> and

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
in your back pocket you can try them and

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.539 
in your back pocket you can try them and
if<00:02:38.930> none<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.170> them<00:02:39.380> work<00:02:39.560> maybe<00:02:40.070> one<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.400> them

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
if none of them work maybe one of them

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.500 
if none of them work maybe one of them
will<00:02:40.730> lead<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.000> hearing<00:02:41.299> something

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
will lead you to hearing something

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.940 
will lead you to hearing something
brand-new<00:02:41.989> that<00:02:42.079> you've<00:02:42.260> never<00:02:42.440> done<00:02:42.620> before

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
brand-new that you've never done before

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.500 
brand-new that you've never done before
maybe<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.820> will<00:02:43.910> become<00:02:44.180> one<00:02:44.329> of<00:02:44.360> your

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
maybe that will become one of your

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.110 
maybe that will become one of your
basics<00:02:44.870> but<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:46.010> principle<00:02:46.459> is<00:02:46.579> get<00:02:46.970> some

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
basics but the principle is get some

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.430 
basics but the principle is get some
things<00:02:47.329> under<00:02:47.630> your<00:02:47.660> belt<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:48.019> you<00:02:48.140> really

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
things under your belt that you really

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.199 
things under your belt that you really
know<00:02:48.590> how<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.739> do<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.610> when<00:02:49.940> you're<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
know how to do so that when you're in a

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.729 
know how to do so that when you're in a
situation<00:02:50.390> where<00:02:50.720> someone<00:02:51.079> requires<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.709> to

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
situation where someone requires you to

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.979 
situation where someone requires you to
be<00:02:51.829> a<00:02:52.040> bass<00:02:52.250> player<00:02:52.430> play<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.329> bass<00:02:53.570> line<00:02:53.690> you

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
be a bass player play a bass line you

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.810 
be a bass player play a bass line you
want<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.230> be<00:02:54.320> supportive<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.400> want<00:02:55.579> it<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.730> be

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
want to be supportive you want it to be

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.060 
want to be supportive you want it to be
strong<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:57.380> want<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.680> feel<00:02:57.829> really
