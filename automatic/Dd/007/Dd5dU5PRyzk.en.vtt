00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:07.600
 or you want to learn how to make this bread 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:11.360
 Well, in these simple steps and 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.129
 this rich bread will come out 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.920
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:19.160
 to make our beginners bread 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.680
 are the following a packet of yeast 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.240
 of bakery or any other yeast 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.110
 that you have but it is better to 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.689
 bakery a suitable glass container 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.380
 for oven with lid this is very 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.380
 important 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.859
 olive oil 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.980
 Salt 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:46.000
 175 milliliters of water and 310 grams of 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.000
 flour 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.010
 The first thing we are going to do is take 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:59.260
 a tablespoon of olive oil 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.260
 to 175 milliliters of water 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.350
 we put this container in the microwave 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.350
 about 30 seconds 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.710
 when we have the warm mixture 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.540
 we throw the envelope of yeast 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.080
 in a larger bowl we throw the mixture 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.800
 subsequently the 310 grams of flour 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.689
 and a teaspoon of salt coffee 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.940
 we knead the mixture 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.640
 as we just said 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.640
 let's knead our mix 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.530
 we are on a flat surface a little 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.970
 Of flour 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.970
 and the mixture 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.960
 we knead well with our hands 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.380
 if you see that also up a little 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.750
 sticky we will incorporate a little more 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.670
 flour and if on the contrary you see that 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.120
 It's very hard, you throw a little more 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.120
 of water 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.230
 we give it a rounded shape 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.720
 as rounded as possible but neither 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.650
 it needs to be left 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.650
 amazing 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.130
 once we have the desired shape 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.819
 let's introduce it in our 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.819
 container previously having it 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.209
 I have stained a little with oil 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.209
 olive 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.750
 so that the bread does not stick to us then 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.750
 the oven 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.400
 let's make some marquitas with a 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.400
 sharp knife 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.569
 so that it looks nice 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.580
 we raise a little bit with oil and 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.580
 you have a 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.230
 a much better brush was easier 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.019
 do it but good if it's not a role of 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.800
 cook and sprinkle a little 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.800
 flour for the purpose 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.660
 to your liking 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.150
 we cover the container 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:18.970
 and with the cold oven is not necessary 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:23.310
 preheat what we introduce about 40 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.310
 220 degrees minutes 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.289
 and that's how our bread has been for 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.419
 beginners when you take it out of the oven 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.400
 put it on a grid so it does not 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.060
 dry 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.060
 see you later
