00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.080
 the personal speech 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.380
 I'm going to record a video here today for whoever 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.760
 Do you have questions about driving in Holland? 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.740
 We get lots of emails. 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.349
 people asking about renting 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.679
 car you can ride a bus if you give 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.680
 to walk to how it works that the 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.180
 transit and there in the video 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.420
 Today I'll explain a little better. 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.010
 Optionally things here you are 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.350
 watching the video here the streets here are 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.110
 almost all in this pattern only very large 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.660
 very wide of sun are avenues 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.640
 So you're going from somewhere to the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.680
 another that is considered close here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.649
 You will give great distances. 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.690
 then walking is not an option and then 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.960
 as it would be a normal tourist town 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.600
 like new york eg los angeles 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.710
 even in brazil rio são paulo to catch the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.610
 subway 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.830
 there is no one who has not only subway 11 years 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.500
 by bus but is very restricted 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.830
 the lines take you sometimes 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.259
 half an hour at the bus stop and in the areas 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.450
 where the buses have not only very 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.670
 is not very touristy. 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.790
 advisable not to wait so it has 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.220
 the bus that haiti mec on the internet 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.990
 a drive that is the main avenue but 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.970
 he does not take for example from to disney 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.110
 person is restricted to a particular 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.180
 city ​​area 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.829
 then it is not an option as well you walk 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.299
 by bus 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.909
 You are seeing here on the right side. 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.090
 passing by a bus stop 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.040
 It's kind of tricky for you to catch the bus 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.020
 here because the lines are 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.509
 very specific and very restricted 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.159
 give you freedom to cross the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.829
 to a place where you go 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.790
 taking it is far, so it's the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.229
 possibilities here the most commotion 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.229
 hire a private driver and 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.629
 rent a car the private driver 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.330
 It replaces the taxi very well here too. 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.099
 a very expensive service if you stay 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.440
 depending on the taxi here you will spend 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.400
 a big money because sometimes to go 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.290
 from a place that far away if not 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.629
 I'm going to say that's a good example because 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.970
 Maybe you do not know but to go to 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.900
 places that you would normally pay a 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.840
 taxi is reasonable here you will pay 60 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.150
 $ 70 sometimes 80 in some places 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.030
 no meter is the pre- race 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.769
 defined and so it's really expensive right taxi 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.709
 so the old private driver you 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.610
 you have the possibility to pre- define the 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.680
 your destinations 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.360
 Are you already going to line up with your driver? 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.050
 But it's the days he'll take you to 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.819
 at where 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.489
 and so it will be calmer for you 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.940
 getting the price comes out plus one 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.220
 point than the taxi due to the total 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.920
 The races you're going to do ends up leaving. 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.129
 and the most common option of 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.379
 all the more so than hiring a 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.140
 driver of the car because it is very 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.780
 simple if you are over 25 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.330
 years even better because who has 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.659
 less than 25 pays an extra fee per 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.239
 insurance account so it's quite simple you 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.640
 rent a car and here comes that fear more 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.310
 I could not drive there, I'm going. 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.470
 I can adapt the traffic 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.190
 many different rules how it works 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.349
 speed limits police bug 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.780
 of seven heads is not very calm 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.209
 drive here 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.250
 everything very well-marked people have 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.200
 strong trend and very respectful of the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.150
 traffic laws here that should be 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.740
 normal but unfortunately has places that 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.060
 We know people do not 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.980
 respect 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.830
 So you can come and take the place of your 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.600
 car and driving with no side and xvii 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.489
 some things you need to stay 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.510
 in relation to driving here by 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.709
 example some rules that are a 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.709
 little different 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.360
 in a red light and you can turn to 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.040
 right 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.060
 provided you are not seeing anything of your 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.920
 left 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.200
 We already posted it on the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.790
 page is one thing is well known for 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.820
 who is already researching about the trip 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.669
 is one of the most basic things they have 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.230
 difference against the south of Brazil has 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.880
 more other things that are rules here 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.160
 in transit in the United States not only 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.500
 here holland eg the bus 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.479
 and a school bus stopped at his 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.970
 front to dissipate as children 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.250
 and then he's hazard lights opens a certain 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.410
 a left-hand stop sign 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.000
 No one can get on the bus until 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.780
 to switch off the warning and move on 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.310
 front 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.320
 nor if you have come on the track 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.390
 contrary to what they do to 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.160
 respect even children do not run the 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.700
 risk of being trampled 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.500
 type 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.900
 We've already seen some people here. 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.850
 steal from the school bus in this situation 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.910
 where child stopped landing from the 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.220
 people carrying buses because it 's because 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.710
 I purposely did not know 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.250
 that worked that way it 's good to have 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.850
 stay a little aware of these differences 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:10.070
 but in general everything is similar is the same in 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.139
 Truly the rules of traffic vary 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.490
 very 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.830
 It is also very common that 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.580
 people do here is put a gps one 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.310
 car 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.430
 yes, yes, it is necessary because 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.930
 although players 100% of them well 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.659
 city map 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.300
 we were in the age of the pope 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:32.050
 people may well use the technology to 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.930
 our favor 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.009
 gps does it very well, everything here is 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.360
 Can you find the address on gps? 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:43.539
 you set there you put in 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.699
 Portuguese you define if the GPS will get you 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:49.449
 take the smallest distances or 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:52.840
 faster paths is that wall from scratch 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:55.090
 for him and faster through the 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.460
 less traffic is super simple 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.550
 set up if you have any problems 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.449
 it is you ask for help in time 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.129
 rental agency 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.849
 most of the attendants here are 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:10.300
 Popular student rental rex in 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:12.069
 dollar bandit and attendant who speak in 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.469
 how can you ask for help 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:16.200
 configure your gps does not need to stay 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:19.500
 afraid of it 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.480
 You can drive here in the quiet or you 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.860
 You're there, too. It 's fine. 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.510

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.470
 Who has plaque for everything that is place? 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:32.550
 if you happen to have some fear 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:35.010
 speed does not know what to do 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.990
 so afraid of being stopped by the police only 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.410
 following a flow accompanied by the 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.720
 traffic is not too slow nor 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.060
 too fast you sure will not 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.280
 and the police will not cause 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.000
 no problem for you or you to
