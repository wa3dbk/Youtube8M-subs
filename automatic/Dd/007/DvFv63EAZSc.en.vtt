00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
subtraction for a core size you must

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.990 
subtraction for a core size you must
take<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.229> whole<00:01:51.560> split<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.070> into<00:01:52.280> four<00:01:52.610> and

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
take a whole split it into four and

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.950 
take a whole split it into four and
before<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:53.510> know<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:53.780> made<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.280> fraction

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.749 

okay<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.020> who<00:02:00.740> would<00:02:00.890> remember<00:02:01.100> what<00:02:01.250> happens

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
can remember what happens when you split

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.410 
can remember what happens when you split
a<00:02:13.850> hole<00:02:14.150> into<00:02:14.510> four<00:02:18.910> that's<00:02:19.910> right<00:02:20.180> if<00:02:20.269> you

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
a hole into four that's right if you

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.520 
a hole into four that's right if you
make<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.660> quarter<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:22.670> here's<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:23.030> problem<00:02:23.530> what

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
make a quarter so here's a problem what

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.830 
make a quarter so here's a problem what
would<00:02:24.650> we<00:02:24.799> get<00:02:25.010> if<00:02:25.340> we<00:02:25.400> split<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.910> pizza<00:02:26.209> into

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
would we get if we split a pizza into

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:40.839 
would we get if we split a pizza into
