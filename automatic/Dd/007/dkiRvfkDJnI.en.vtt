00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.200 
will do it this way first just copy this
little<00:00:39.059> code<00:00:39.239> right<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:43.700> go<00:00:44.700> over<00:00:44.969> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
little code right here and go over to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.150 
little code right here and go over to
your<00:00:46.520> your<00:00:47.520> internet<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:49.140> we'll<00:00:49.649> type<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> in

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
your your internet and we'll type it in

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.619 
your your internet and we'll type it in
here<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:53.190> you'll<00:00:53.399> get<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.699> you'll<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.480> that

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
here and you'll get the you'll see that

here and you'll get the you'll see that
this<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> advanced<00:00:55.410> warfare<00:00:55.829> same<00:00:56.129> same

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
this is the advanced warfare same same

this is the advanced warfare same same
way<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:57.180> find<00:00:57.420> out<00:00:58.070> what<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> BL<00:00:59.430> US<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.270> BL<00:01:00.660> es

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
way to find out what the BL US or BL es

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.650 
way to find out what the BL US or BL es
code<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.280> um<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:03.329> type<00:01:03.480> in

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
code is is you can um just type in

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.359 
code is is you can um just type in
advanced<00:01:04.589> warfare<00:01:07.189> BL<00:01:08.189> es<00:01:08.520> code<00:01:09.920> um<00:01:10.920> see<00:01:11.220> it

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
advanced warfare BL es code um see it

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.700 
advanced warfare BL es code um see it
popped<00:01:11.580> up<00:01:11.729> right<00:01:11.939> there<00:01:12.119> but<00:01:12.380> I'll<00:01:13.380> show<00:01:13.650> you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
popped up right there but I'll show you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.070 
popped up right there but I'll show you
anyway<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.220> yeah<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.390> zoom<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.990> little

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
anyway so yeah that is zoom in a little

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.289 
anyway so yeah that is zoom in a little
bit<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.590> guys<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.700> usually<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.270> find

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
bit for you guys so usually you can find

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.749 
bit for you guys so usually you can find
it<00:01:18.630> within<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.960> first<00:01:19.170> couple<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.759> actually

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
it within the first couple and actually

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.620 
it within the first couple and actually
we<00:01:20.850> got<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> right<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.450> right<00:01:21.689> right<00:01:22.170> away<00:01:22.430> so

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
we got a right here right right away so

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.920 
we got a right here right right away so
we'll<00:01:24.630> copy<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.990> put<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.549> and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
we'll copy that and put this up here and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.390 
we'll copy that and put this up here and
you<00:01:30.930> should<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.439> able<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> go<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.920> images

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
you should just be able to go to images

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.460 
you should just be able to go to images
and<00:01:32.430> it'll<00:01:33.000> pop<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.869> bunch<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.170> images

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and it'll pop up a bunch of images

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.249 
and it'll pop up a bunch of images
referring<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.549> code<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:37.079> know<00:01:37.229> that

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
referring to your code so we know that

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.929 
referring to your code so we know that
this<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> correct<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.790> go

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
this is the correct one so we can go

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.260 
this is the correct one so we can go
ahead<00:01:38.970> ctrl<00:01:39.750> copy<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:42.110> close<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.320> down<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
ahead ctrl copy and close that down and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.690 
ahead ctrl copy and close that down and
rename<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.509> first<00:01:46.229> thing<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:48.500> actually<00:01:49.700> take

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
rename this first thing so actually take

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.399 
rename this first thing so actually take
that<00:01:50.939> up<00:01:51.119> or<00:01:51.540> make<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.110> caps<00:01:52.409> BL

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
that up or make it all caps BL

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.060 
that up or make it all caps BL
yes<00:01:53.590> okay<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:55.450> once<00:01:55.750> you<00:01:55.869> did<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.200> just<00:01:56.740> open

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
yes okay so once you did that just open

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.859 
yes okay so once you did that just open
this<00:01:57.159> up<00:01:57.369> real<00:01:57.640> quick<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.000> we're<00:01:58.719> going<00:01:58.840> to

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
this up real quick and we're going to

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.359 
this up real quick and we're going to
need<00:01:58.990> three<00:01:59.320> files<00:01:59.619> out<00:01:59.890> of<00:01:59.920> here<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.250> it's

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
need three files out of here and it's

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.950 
need three files out of here and it's
gonna<00:02:00.549> be<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:00.969> ps3<00:02:01.570> disk

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
gonna be the ps3 disk

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.969 
gonna be the ps3 disk
sfb<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.850> copy<00:02:04.539> it<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:04.960> paste<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.829> on<00:02:05.950> your

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.410 
desktop I wouldn't know I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:08.890> dragging<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.759> out<00:02:09.880> because<00:02:10.090> then

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
recommend dragging it out because then
