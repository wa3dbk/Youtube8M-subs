substitution jutsu which should help a
lot<00:00:28.429> so<00:00:29.429> let's<00:00:29.820> go<00:00:30.210> oh<00:00:33.500> we<00:00:34.500> only<00:00:34.620> know<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.010> it

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
lot so let's go oh we only know what it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:48.529 
lot so let's go oh we only know what it
is<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:45.620> of<00:00:46.620> course<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:47.309> always<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> lot<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
is and so of course it's always a lot of

00:00:48.539 --> 00:01:02.540 
is and so of course it's always a lot of
packing<00:00:48.960> before<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:50.160> battle<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:55.940> puppy

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.250 

well<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.640> first<00:01:03.880> thing<00:01:03.940> I<00:01:04.120> would<00:01:04.180> do<00:01:04.570> or

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
well the first thing I would do or

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.550 
well the first thing I would do or
consider<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.220> this<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.240> what<00:01:07.450> my<00:01:07.990> strategy

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
consider and this is what my strategy

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.890 
consider and this is what my strategy
was<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:09.570> use<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.750> substitution<00:01:11.080> jutsu<00:01:11.680> first

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
was and use the substitution jutsu first

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.050 
was and use the substitution jutsu first
then<00:01:13.900> um<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.479> multi<00:01:16.930> clone<00:01:17.290> jutsu<00:01:17.619> and<00:01:18.250> if

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
then um do the multi clone jutsu and if

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.469 
then um do the multi clone jutsu and if
you're<00:01:19.300> low<00:01:19.510> on<00:01:19.540> health<00:01:19.810> heal<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:22.270> should

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
you're low on health heal and you should

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.420 
you're low on health heal and you should
have<00:01:22.720> an<00:01:22.869> advantage<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.650> then<00:01:23.890> just<00:01:24.100> attack

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
have an advantage and then just attack

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.770 
have an advantage and then just attack
Cuba<00:01:24.790> first<00:01:25.410> then<00:01:26.410> he's<00:01:26.740> down<00:01:27.070> on<00:01:27.430> or<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.630> can

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
Cuba first then he's down on or you can

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.170 
Cuba first then he's down on or you can
attack<00:01:29.080> them<00:01:29.229> up<00:01:29.470> timati<00:01:30.070> first<00:01:30.520> because<00:01:31.000> he

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
attack them up timati first because he

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.540 
attack them up timati first because he
has<00:01:31.300> lower<00:01:31.720> health<00:01:32.020> I<00:01:32.170> guess<00:01:32.410> and<00:01:33.340> then<00:01:33.460> he

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
has lower health I guess and then he

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.450 
has lower health I guess and then he
couldn't<00:01:33.910> do<00:01:34.030> finger<00:01:34.390> or<00:01:34.509> thing<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:36.280> um

couldn't do finger or thing but um

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.460 
couldn't do finger or thing but um
either<00:01:36.759> way<00:01:36.970> just<00:01:37.240> attack<00:01:37.570> one<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.840> them<00:01:38.050> at<00:01:38.410> a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
either way just attack one of them at a

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.830 
either way just attack one of them at a
time<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:39.100> then<00:01:39.160> one<00:01:39.910> goes<00:01:40.149> down<00:01:40.180> you're

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
time and then one goes down you're

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.990 
time and then one goes down you're
pretty<00:01:41.080> much<00:01:41.140> safe<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.220> win<00:01:42.369> because<00:01:42.580> you

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
pretty much safe to win because you

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.730 
pretty much safe to win because you
don't<00:01:43.119> have<00:01:43.149> both<00:01:43.420> them<00:01:43.660> to<00:01:43.810> worry<00:01:43.930> about<00:01:44.050> so
