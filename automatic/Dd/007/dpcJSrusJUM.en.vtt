and<00:01:53.850> see<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.970> rubber<00:01:55.149> feet<00:01:55.450> they<00:01:55.750> they<00:01:56.500> keep

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
and see the rubber feet they they keep

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.580 
and see the rubber feet they they keep
it<00:01:57.310> from<00:01:57.490> blocking<00:01:57.789> also<00:01:58.240> under<00:01:58.539> here<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.080> air

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
it from blocking also under here the air

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.370 
it from blocking also under here the air
flows<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:00.850> keeps<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.149> really<00:02:01.360> cool<00:02:01.720> this

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
flows and it keeps it really cool this

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.800 
flows and it keeps it really cool this
little<00:02:02.679> fan<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.250> okay<00:02:03.670> but<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.270> still<00:02:04.600> gets

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
little fan is okay but it still gets

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.440 
little fan is okay but it still gets
very<00:02:05.049> hot<00:02:05.380> under<00:02:06.069> some<00:02:06.460> circumstances<00:02:07.240> like

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
very hot under some circumstances like

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.630 
very hot under some circumstances like
discharging<00:02:08.549> but<00:02:09.630> that's<00:02:10.630> that's<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.640> so

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
them up in there I mean there's

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.500 
them up in there I mean there's
potential<00:04:08.880> for

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
potential for

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.350

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
possibility down the line I may need

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.229 
possibility down the line I may need
that<00:04:14.690> five<00:04:15.019> or<00:04:15.409> three-point<00:04:15.980> movements<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:17.150> I

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
that five or three-point movements and I

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.689 
that five or three-point movements and I
made<00:04:17.419> this<00:04:17.600> little<00:04:17.750> housing<00:04:18.290> owned<00:04:19.070> core<00:04:19.430> and

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
made this little housing owned core and

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.200 
made this little housing owned core and
hot<00:04:20.120> glue<00:04:20.979> it<00:04:21.979> works<00:04:22.310> great<00:04:22.550> just

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
hot glue it works great just

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.230 
hot glue it works great just
contacts<00:04:24.810> away<00:04:25.080> from<00:04:25.259> each<00:04:25.380> other

it's<00:04:28.240> kind<00:04:28.480> of<00:04:28.510> cool<00:04:29.490> so

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
it's kind of cool so

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.560 
it's kind of cool so
basically<00:04:32.690> that's<00:04:32.930> about<00:04:33.500> it<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.390> want

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
basically that's about it that you want

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.200 
basically that's about it that you want
to<00:04:35.890> combine<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:37.250> cables<00:04:37.610> that's<00:04:37.790> a<00:04:38.000> big

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
to combine the cables that's a big

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.040 
to combine the cables that's a big
question<00:04:38.390> I<00:04:38.930> saw<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:40.100> comments<00:04:41.030> that

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
question I saw the comments that

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.800 
question I saw the comments that
okay<00:04:42.610> well<00:04:43.610> what<00:04:43.789> about<00:04:43.819> the<00:04:44.180> other<00:04:44.360> cables

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
okay well what about the other cables

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.050 
okay well what about the other cables
can<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.110> combine<00:04:45.319> them<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.800> get<00:04:45.949> more<00:04:46.160> ants<00:04:46.430> or

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
can I combine them to get more ants or

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.469 
can I combine them to get more ants or
is<00:04:47.990> it<00:04:48.169> just<00:04:48.199> an

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
is it just an

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.129 
is it just an
-<00:04:49.719> hands<00:04:49.900> across<00:04:50.259> the<00:04:51.120> am<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.240> getting<00:04:52.419> the<00:04:52.599> full

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
- hands across the am I getting the full

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.739 
- hands across the am I getting the full
ants<00:04:53.499> across<00:04:53.770> one<00:04:54.009> wire<00:04:54.219> so<00:04:55.090> you<00:04:55.419> know<00:04:55.569> the

00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:55.749 
ants across one wire so you know the

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:57.689 
ants across one wire so you know the

the<00:04:58.029> full<00:04:58.300> amperage<00:04:59.400> my<00:05:00.400> charger<00:05:00.879> is<00:05:00.999> 5<00:05:01.719> amp

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
the full amperage my charger is 5 amp

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.439 
the full amperage my charger is 5 amp
charger<00:05:03.009> so<00:05:03.249> I<00:05:03.279> won't<00:05:03.639> even<00:05:03.759> be<00:05:03.969> using<00:05:04.210> the

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
charger so I won't even be using the

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.369 
charger so I won't even be using the
full<00:05:04.659> 10<00:05:04.930> amps<00:05:05.639> so<00:05:06.639> that's<00:05:07.270> fine<00:05:07.599> only<00:05:07.960> having

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
full 10 amps so that's fine only having

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.909 
full 10 amps so that's fine only having
one<00:05:08.819> so<00:05:09.819> I<00:05:10.150> mean<00:05:10.719> this<00:05:10.930> is<00:05:10.990> this<00:05:11.559> is<00:05:11.740> pretty

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
one so I mean this is this is pretty

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.189 
one so I mean this is this is pretty
slick<00:05:12.129> I<00:05:12.430> like<00:05:12.580> this<00:05:12.759> it's<00:05:13.689> working<00:05:13.990> out<00:05:14.080> for

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
slick I like this it's working out for

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:19.469 
slick I like this it's working out for
me<00:05:14.550> so<00:05:17.099> well<00:05:18.099> I<00:05:18.339> guess<00:05:18.669> that's<00:05:18.939> the<00:05:19.059> end<00:05:19.180> of

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
me so well I guess that's the end of

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:26.179 
me so well I guess that's the end of
that<00:05:19.599> I<00:05:20.430> have<00:05:21.430> more<00:05:22.029> videos<00:05:22.599> coming<00:05:22.839> up<00:05:23.199> soon<00:05:23.939> I

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:26.189 
that I have more videos coming up soon I

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:28.679
