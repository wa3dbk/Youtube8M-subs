00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello kittens and mice today I came here 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.020
 in itself on the very cool nail 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.820
 in fact I was going to make a video only that is 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.590
 gradient with the zebra 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.509
 It was just going to get very long so I 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.210
 I'm doing this first part that is 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.609
 just a gradient and in another video teach 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.619
 zebrinha and it gets a really cool effect I 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.460
 I'm going to advance the drawing of the zebrinha. 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.699
 how it's going to be and it's just a gradient 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.189
 In this video, it's cool that the gradient 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.830
 can you serve as a basis for 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.130
 several or the air before you can stamp 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.770
 On top you can do is drawings with the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.620
 scorer to do on 11 spaces what 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.360
 you want it to have a very cool effect and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.660
 so when I started to make a 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.090
 degraded he did not stay he stayed 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.059
 full of bubbles because I was a little 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.980
 enamel and kept doing so much and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.170
 now find a way that is the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.480
 more perfect gradient then you know 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.300
 You want to learn these tips there is 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.940
 Just keep watching the video. 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.769
 We're going to need a white glaze. 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.960
 two shades of the chosen color to make a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.850
 I chose pink and one 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.240
 sponge I picked up sponge 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.610
 cooks only the yellow part 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.060
 The first step is to pass on all 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.060
 the nails 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.229
 After drying we will pass the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.939
 white enamel does not need to stay 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.470
 perfect because we're going to make a 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.689
 gradient on top then it will not 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.390
 a lot of things are just to stay 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.520
 base the white background even the gradient 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.340
 more visible and the color becomes more 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.020
 vibrant too 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.850
 we will then pass the toothpick on the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.950
 cuticle to remove excess enamel 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.780
 but you do not even need to talk because the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.009
 people will do a gradient and it will end 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.200
 dirty all over again after the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.159
 white enamel to dry we'll make one 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.310
 gradient 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.640
 So you pick up the sponge, go to the top. 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.979
 clearer color of the chosen color and 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.939
 underneath you'll pass the other 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.920
 tone 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.119
 so no problem, it's going to be two 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.860
 Colors 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.670
 then you will get the enamel 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.800
 clear again and make and pass between the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.550
 two colors and then it will form a 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.470
 gradient 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.270
 you can master the layers of 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.680
 then nail polish and nail polish 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.330
 he was thankful right 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.340
 after stamping all the nails you 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.440
 will chant the corner of the nails take everything 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.310
 excess enamel and finish with a 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.310
 base layer 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.319
 so this is what I hope you 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.750
 have liked and do not forget to 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.730
 check the second part of the video that is 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.580
 to make the zebra on top of that 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.580
 Sort down a kiss the next goodbye
