 more than half of the industrially produced food and that is 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.969
 For sale, our products contain palm oil as well as a 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.279
 wide range of cosmetics 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.849
 it is supposed to be healthier than animal fat and can be used as 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.349
 fuel by or replacing fossil fuels 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.469
 but ironically this greener energy source destroys the environment 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:33.700
 and that because most of it is grown in Malaysia and Indonesia where 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.140
 continues the exploitation and burning of tropical forests to make way for 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 crops 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.230
 in front of a pact with the cleaning of forests for oil plantations 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.530
 of palm and other objectives 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.330
 the burning of forests in the rebirth of the swamps have become 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.680
 indonesia in the third cause of greenhouse gas missions process 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.110
 deforestation also destroys the orangutan's natural habitat 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.850
 endangered species 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 particularly those who live in sumatra 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.300
 maybe these swamp forests have the highest level of biological diversity 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.410
 known in Southeast Asia 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.650
 i probably in the world the flagship species is the orangutan of sumatra have 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.070
 with the largest population in that place 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.280
 we know that if that habitat is destroyed or we will lose approximately 10% of 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.090
 the sumatra orangutans 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.490

 Sumatran orangutan 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.940
 she and the biologist Monica Borner built the first center for 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.730
 rehabilitation of the orangutan 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.970
 in the national park 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.970
 I did the sumatra 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.520
 but he established it then the panic orangutan protection program 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.730
 the national park do and be is now one of the two rooms tantes del 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.680
 orangutan trans sum but even there the rainforests are being 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.629
 destroyed for oil palm cultivation 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.230
 A round table for sustainable palm oil rcp oo was installed in 2003 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.649
 to model the production 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:30.389
 the entity groups the producers of palm oil-producing food 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:31.480
 retailers 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.459
 and other nonprofits like panic 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.909
 but the environmental organization 26 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.229
 says that the table does not work correctly 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:44.169
 pagán the problem is that in reality many members of the entity continue 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.879
 destroying rainforests and wetlands this is certainly a 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.689
 big problem because the rspo loses credibility aspires to ski 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.219
 It is our true face 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.319
 one of the main causes of the problem according to currín pisey without arms 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.209
 one of the largest oil palm producer groupings in 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.289
 Indonesia 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:07.329
 the ig before wanted of food nestlé based in switzerland uses the 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.399
 importing oil without weapons to develop kick-ass hence the campaign 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.399
 turin pee 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:23.959
 nestlé as well as micros and coplas larger supermarket chains 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.679
 Swiss cut their ties with Sinar more 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:30.529
 the rcp was in whose establishment participated micros 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:34.449
 may have flaws but the Swiss still consider it the best 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.449
 organization to achieve sustainability 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:42.859
 the miklosik chains or buy certificates through the rspo or for 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.309
 support the production of sustainable palm oil 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:50.759
 at this time we use the reservation and claim system this means 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:55.010
 that we buy certified for the amount of palm oil that we use 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.939
 in our sensitive products that amount is given to the producers of 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.939
 oil in malaysia 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.649
 when we are aware that the production of palm oil 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:09.929
 manages enormous pressure on tropical forests 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:14.119
 cc entire implantations at the expense of the tropical forests and the 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.749
 rights of local people we want to make sure that our 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:21.729
 products do not leave a carbon footprint and we do everything possible to achieve a 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.729
 sustainable palm oil 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:33.499
 foto its cost since 2008 have been certified plantation néstor one 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:38.529
 as to 5 million tons this corresponds to 30% of the European demand 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:40.400
 francisco 80 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.490
 but 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.950
 but the sustainable oil and the one that is not are poured together we feel 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.440
 gigantic and delivered mixed 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.830
 then the challenge can separate the supply of the sustainable city 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.980
 nor do we now use the claim reservation system but we 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.110
 like to change the segregation system 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.740
 that will only be possible if we join other manufacturers and retailers 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.270
 palm oil importers 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.770
 He urged the United States of China and India or join European groups selling to 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.340
 public in its struggle for sustainable 1 6t 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.620
 but consumers also have a role to play according to memphis 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.600
 we hope to continue this way the companies warn that for the consumer it is 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.090
 really important that palm oil does not come from deforestation 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.819
 then to act 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.190
 in that way the consumer can also pressure companies 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.710
 authors 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.180
 as for example sending emails to companies so that 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.469
 take measures 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:43.449
 I am a simple index that politicians can also help 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.379
 putting pressure on Indonesia to provide fallow land 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.499
 palm producers 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:55.319
 dahlán dice halle find between 10 and 15 million hectares of land which 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:01.259
 are not used piqué can be used for oil palm what 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.169
 would reduce the pressure on the supports the other 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.169
 13 poor points 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.969
 with respect to the ground 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:16.360
 panic tries to convince Indonesian palm producers of these the 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.379
 dock 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.899
 offering them financial incentives in accordance with the kioto protocol 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.539
 about climate change 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.069
 my son tractors china we hope that through this trading system of 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:40.760
 carbon 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.820
 perhaps with the additional help of foundations or grants we are 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.490
 able to reach an agreement that allows us to rehabilitate those cells 

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:52.619
 wild bill clinton 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:57.409
 a concerted effort between political oil-producing retailers and 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.409
 consumers would accelerate the process of sustainability 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.889
 but do not be a little late 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:06.360
 Experts estimate that if deforestation continues at the current level 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.219
 these great apes are not closer relationship will be different in 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.839
 ten years
