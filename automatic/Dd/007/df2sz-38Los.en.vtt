00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.550
 so today we have insulation 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.750
 sky 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.190
 now parsed by 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:27.010
 arose look 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:28.960
 naked absolutely arches right bright 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:35.150
 wings 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.430
 absolutely nothing there is the other wing 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.629
 interesting 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.629
 spare hole 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.300
 the so-called pan here we see 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.879
 staff noise vibration isolation let's 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.640
 let's see what he is 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.790
 Here is such a construction that can be 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.489
 just take 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.500
 throw out do not know 2 stick 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:09.350
 and here I do not know 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:14.050
 very poorly visible principle flashlight here 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:20.150
 full of water is a lot of water 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:30.760
 what contributes in a year or two here 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:30.760
 see, yes, seconds never turned off 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:42.840
 Well, in general, this is what glitters 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:47.479
 This is actually some water which 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.880
 accumulates under a wonderful staff 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.250
 vibration isolation which respectively 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.890
 it will be necessary to dismantle and put 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.890
 new good quality 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:09.570
 so we removed the nominal vibration isolation 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.670
 the trunk so that tightly held 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.300
 under which there are no air bubbles in 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.300
 principle you can leave 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:27.349
 so we removed the nominal vibration isolation 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.450
 the trunk so that tightly held 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.590
 under which there are no air bubbles in 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:40.129
 principle you can leave 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:43.969
 and our task is to clean all degrease and 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:46.969
 proceed with the installation of the first layer 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.969
 vibration isolation 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:56.599
 also dismantled floor trim panel 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.890
 fully seats as we see nissan 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.110
 qashqai relatively 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:08.959
 I repeat relatively good regular 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:12.349
 vibration isolation see these pieces yes and 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.170
 good staff insulation thickness 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:22.659
 about 10 centimeters so dense 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.659
 foam rubber under the passenger seats 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.079
 No sound insulation per se 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.950
 now our task is also to degrease 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:37.459
 clean and degrease the surface and 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:41.560
 proceed with the application of the installation of the first 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.560
 vibration isolation layer 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.200
 so installed on the trunk 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:57.580
 vibration isolation 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:59.100
 solid layer on the arch on the inside 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.430
 part 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.430
 on the wing 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:23.790
 Ali Paul 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:29.060
 also taped vibration isolation with 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.060
 maximum on the roads under the pedals 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:38.190
 tunnel stiffeners do not peel off 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.820
 vibration isolation due to it 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.350
 unnecessary sense from pasting ribs 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:50.210
 no stiffness 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.600
 they themselves already dampen vibrations 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.720
 see the floor 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:02.850
 completely glued all flat 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:07.190
 specifying the details taped place 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.190
 passengers also taped 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.590
 orcs inside also taped 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.150
 vibration isolation 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.150
 I will clarify that vibration isolation in this case 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.930
 Lobbied shumoff m3 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.930
 attacked the trunk 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:32.190
 the second layer is set to sing 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.830
 pasted the maximum amount 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:46.610
 surfaces again so that there is no 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.610
 air bubbles tightly rolled 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:54.199
 the same and the cabin on the floor is also the second 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.199
 layer splen 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:20.819
 took the door as we see inside everything 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:23.659
 doesn't even resemble the presence of hints 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.659
 sound insulation 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:32.870
 so the first layer set 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:38.970
 vibration isolation on the whole flat surface 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:41.150
 The inner wall is the next layer 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.620
 Splena eight 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:49.009
 this is which layer set 8 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:55.639
 millimeters splen all flat parts 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:55.639
 plastered with captivity except stiffener 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:03.090
 Next, we put a metal card exactly 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.039
 Do not apply vibration isolation so 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.310
 inner wall 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:10.940
 just pieces of glass pro insulation for 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:14.419
 eliminate excessive noise 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.419
 now you can collect
