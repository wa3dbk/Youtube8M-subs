there's always been a core group of

barefoot runners and just recently in

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.970 
barefoot runners and just recently in
recent<00:00:17.360> years<00:00:17.390> has<00:00:17.690> it<00:00:17.780> become<00:00:18.140> a<00:00:18.350> phenomenon

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
recent years has it become a phenomenon

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.520 
recent years has it become a phenomenon
or<00:00:19.670> fad<00:00:20.330> you<00:00:20.960> know<00:00:21.050> you<00:00:21.110> look<00:00:21.320> at<00:00:21.470> a

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.530 
or fad you know you look at a

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.160 
or fad you know you look at a
traditional<00:00:21.740> shoe<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:22.490> has<00:00:23.210> an<00:00:23.660> excessive

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
traditional shoe and has an excessive

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.390 
traditional shoe and has an excessive
amount<00:00:24.200> of<00:00:24.410> arch<00:00:24.620> support<00:00:25.070> they're<00:00:25.280> also

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
amount of arch support they're also

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.640 
amount of arch support they're also
built<00:00:25.850> with<00:00:26.030> the<00:00:26.150> extensive<00:00:26.810> elevated<00:00:27.320> heel

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
built with the extensive elevated heel

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.130 
built with the extensive elevated heel
and<00:00:27.860> so<00:00:28.310> we're<00:00:28.520> built<00:00:28.790> on<00:00:28.910> a<00:00:28.940> two-to-one<00:00:29.570> which

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
and so we're built on a two-to-one which

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.380 
and so we're built on a two-to-one which
encourages<00:00:30.800> a<00:00:31.040> heel<00:00:31.370> strike<00:00:31.670> because<00:00:31.940> of<00:00:32.239> that

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
encourages a heel strike because of that

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.389 
encourages a heel strike because of that
weight<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:33.260> that<00:00:33.500> extension<00:00:33.890> in<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.190> heel

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
weight and that extension in the heel

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.830 
weight and that extension in the heel
when<00:00:34.610> people<00:00:34.879> run<00:00:35.000> in<00:00:35.149> a<00:00:35.210> traditional<00:00:35.629> shoe

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
when people run in a traditional shoe

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.930 
when people run in a traditional shoe
they<00:00:36.020> tend<00:00:36.320> to<00:00:36.590> as<00:00:37.070> their<00:00:37.219> foot<00:00:37.429> swings<00:00:37.670> out<00:00:37.850> in

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
they tend to as their foot swings out in

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.189 
they tend to as their foot swings out in
front<00:00:38.059> of<00:00:38.149> their<00:00:38.239> body<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.629> shoe<00:00:38.809> tends<00:00:39.050> to

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
front of their body the shoe tends to

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.380 
front of their body the shoe tends to
drop<00:00:39.559> their<00:00:39.920> foot<00:00:40.129> tends<00:00:40.309> to<00:00:40.460> drop<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:40.910> then

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
drop their foot tends to drop and then

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.419 
drop their foot tends to drop and then
it<00:00:41.749> tends<00:00:42.109> to<00:00:42.199> catch<00:00:42.530> underneath<00:00:43.070> their<00:00:43.219> body

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:43.429 
it tends to catch underneath their body

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:45.279 
it tends to catch underneath their body
so<00:00:43.909> the<00:00:43.999> heel<00:00:44.179> contacts<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:44.749> ground<00:00:44.780> first

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
so the heel contacts the ground first

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.979 
so the heel contacts the ground first
their<00:00:45.769> knee<00:00:45.980> is<00:00:46.129> more<00:00:46.370> straight<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.269> this

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
their knee is more straight and this

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.410 
their knee is more straight and this
causes<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.440> body<00:00:48.679> to<00:00:49.059> be<00:00:50.059> in<00:00:50.149> a<00:00:50.210> place<00:00:50.390> where

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
causes the body to be in a place where

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.479 
causes the body to be in a place where
it's<00:00:50.690> not<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:50.929> a<00:00:51.620> good<00:00:51.739> place<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.100> absorb

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
it's not in a good place to absorb

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.509 
it's not in a good place to absorb

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
all over the place and it's all you know

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.520 
all over the place and it's all you know
a<00:01:11.270> lot<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.479> it<00:01:11.630> has<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.780> do<00:01:11.960> with<00:01:12.079> spending<00:01:12.320> more

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
a lot of it has to do with spending more

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.690 
a lot of it has to do with spending more
time<00:01:12.590> on<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.950> ground<00:01:13.159> they're<00:01:13.280> contacting

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
the ground out and from their body

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.780 
the ground out and from their body
spending<00:01:15.500> all<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:15.740> time<00:01:15.799> on<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:16.159> ground<00:01:16.490> and

spending all this time on the ground and

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.580 
spending all this time on the ground and
therefore<00:01:17.570> everything<00:01:17.990> else<00:01:18.229> kind<00:01:18.350> of<00:01:18.439> goes

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
therefore everything else kind of goes

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.990 
therefore everything else kind of goes
to<00:01:18.710> pot<00:01:18.920> too<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:19.369> they<00:01:19.490> close<00:01:19.670> down<00:01:19.850> their

their<00:01:21.860> their<00:01:22.250> back<00:01:22.490> gets<00:01:22.759> out<00:01:22.909> of<00:01:23.030> whack<00:01:23.210> and

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
sold these type of footwear for years we

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.279 
sold these type of footwear for years we
saw<00:01:28.009> a<00:01:28.250> problem<00:01:28.729> with<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.420> shoe<00:01:29.630> industry<00:01:29.750> and

saw a problem with the shoe industry and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:31.600 
saw a problem with the shoe industry and
with<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:30.560> traditional<00:01:30.979> Footwear<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.369> that's

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
with the traditional Footwear and that's

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.149 
with the traditional Footwear and that's
why<00:01:31.850> we<00:01:32.180> quit<00:01:32.570> our<00:01:32.750> retail<00:01:33.289> jobs<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.859> start<00:01:34.070> at

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
why we quit our retail jobs and start at

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.580 
why we quit our retail jobs and start at
our<00:01:34.280> own<00:01:34.399> Footwear<00:01:34.670> company<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.869> try<00:01:36.530> to
