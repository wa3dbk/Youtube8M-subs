00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.369
 today the gesture consists in realizing 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.140
 a custard firstly put 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.600
 milk to boil 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.890
 we will add in the milk a pod of 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.480
 vanilla just split in two will 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 recover the seeds of a guitar 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.850
 lightly vanilla us for that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.449
 all the seeds are released in the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.260
 milk now we're going to launder the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.559
 sugar and yolks the action of whitening 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.530
 the yellows can release what we 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.570
 call lecithin in the yellows that 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.850
 is the part thanks that will give 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.090
 a lot so close it and to your cream 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.090
 pastry 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.789
 our mixture must whiten it remains 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.020
 more than to add the flour to 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.020
 inside our preparations 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.189
 gently 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.189
 mix well 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.500
 we keep this preparation on hold 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.960
 we will make sure to mix the milk 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.240
 to boil it much more 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:51.010
 quickly to have a cream 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:53.729
 pastryman well we pour some of the 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:58.440
 milk on our preparation 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.440
 we put the partons to boil 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.310
 we wait for the eddy milk in the 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:16.750
 pan and we will pour the contents of 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:20.490
 our room had inside 1900 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.989
 wait we'll whip and mix 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.739
 our pastry train and especially the 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.310
 thicken 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.620
 we consider that our pastry cream 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.280
 written from the moment she delivers 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.100
 ouf we will be able to put it aside 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.560
 it must be creamy for the 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.110
 conservation I could put a little 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.590
 film on the surface for which does not dry 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.080
 or a dab of butter that you 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.580
 go applied to prevent it from 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.019
 crust 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.019
 Now, it's your turn to play
