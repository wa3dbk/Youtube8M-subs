now<00:00:24.000> let's<00:00:24.240> turn<00:00:24.450> our<00:00:24.510> attention<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.290> tail

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
now let's turn our attention to the tail

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.130 
now let's turn our attention to the tail
assembly

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.920 

test<00:00:30.830> fit<00:00:31.100> the<00:00:31.130> styrene<00:00:31.550> panel<00:00:32.150> by<00:00:32.390> placing<00:00:32.840> it

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
test fit the styrene panel by placing it

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.980 
test fit the styrene panel by placing it
over<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.260> tail<00:00:33.560> framework<00:00:34.310> and<00:00:34.550> gently<00:00:35.300> bend

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
over the tail framework and gently bend

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
over the tail framework and gently bend
it<00:00:36.170> across<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.830> frame

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.970

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.490 

use<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.710> one-inch<00:01:19.130> self-drilling<00:01:19.850> screws<00:01:20.500> to

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
use the one-inch self-drilling screws to

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.389 
use the one-inch self-drilling screws to
hold<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.920> styrene<00:01:22.220> in<00:01:22.520> place<00:01:23.680> also<00:01:24.680> use<00:01:25.220> the

one-inch<00:01:25.790> fender<00:01:26.210> washers<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.950> screws<00:01:28.250> won't

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
one-inch fender washers the screws won't

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.550 
one-inch fender washers the screws won't
work<00:01:28.759> by<00:01:28.970> themselves

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.590 

we're<00:01:33.159> drilling<00:01:33.400> this<00:01:33.610> first<00:01:33.970> screw<00:01:34.299> at<00:01:34.570> the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
we're drilling this first screw at the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.350 
we're drilling this first screw at the
back<00:01:34.869> of<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.140> tail<00:01:35.320> assembly<00:01:35.470> in<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.250> center

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.480 

this<00:01:40.930> is<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.140> method<00:01:41.380> for<00:01:41.710> holding<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.190> styrene

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
this is a method for holding the styrene

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.050 
this is a method for holding the styrene
panel<00:01:43.120> in<00:01:43.240> place<00:01:43.570> while<00:01:43.960> we<00:01:44.020> glue<00:01:44.470> it<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:45.790> tried

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
panel in place while we glue it we tried

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.690 
panel in place while we glue it we tried
using<00:01:46.270> masking<00:01:46.840> tape<00:01:47.050> but<00:01:47.740> that<00:01:48.340> didn't<00:01:48.670> work

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
using masking tape but that didn't work

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.940 
using masking tape but that didn't work
because<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.510> tape<00:01:49.720> peeled<00:01:50.050> off<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.320> plastic

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
because the tape peeled off the plastic

00:01:50.950 --> 00:02:17.660 
because the tape peeled off the plastic
lamination<00:01:51.760> when<00:01:52.060> we<00:01:52.270> removed<00:01:52.780> it

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.240 

do<00:02:18.330> not<00:02:18.480> tighten<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.080> screw<00:02:19.380> too<00:02:19.590> tight<00:02:19.890> it

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
do not tighten the screw too tight it

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.830 
do not tighten the screw too tight it
could<00:02:20.490> damage<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.480> styrene<00:02:22.280> if<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:24.300> warp<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
could damage the styrene if you warp the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.140 
could damage the styrene if you warp the
styrene<00:02:25.140> with<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.590> screw<00:02:25.950> then<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:26.910> too

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
styrene with the screw then it's too

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.520 
styrene with the screw then it's too
tight<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.840> loosen<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.800> little

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.280 

gently<00:02:37.430> bend<00:02:37.910> down<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.510> sides<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:39.200> the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
gently bend down the sides of the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:03:05.140 
gently bend down the sides of the
styrene

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.630

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
attach more screws to fasten the styrene

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.229 
attach more screws to fasten the styrene
to<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.090> frame<00:03:09.069> fasten<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.220> diagonal<00:03:10.909> parts
