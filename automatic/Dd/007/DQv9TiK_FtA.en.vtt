00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.320

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.790
 throughout his life in the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.730
 Devil and amazing world is not a 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.550
 novelty we will say so because the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.910
 English version already left already makes a good 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.430
 time and is the Portuguese version of 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.969
 brazil left also does not 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.920
 already a while ago but bringing here 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.449
 if you have already seen if you already have 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.420
 Sorry this video is not for you 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.309

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.950

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.200

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.310
 you do not know, enjoy to meet 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:19.110
 particularly because I really like 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.409
 What books do you have is a good job 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:31.950
 good finish like this book here that 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:35.909
 you feel the relief finish and if this 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.970
 The whole detail of this style is that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.299
 even style customization is cool 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.070
 of book or any other 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:51.060
 thing that we like to buy games 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.030
 of dvd and bluray the interesting is always 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.920
 to have a thing that hisses is that there is something 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.509
 the more you know that you can then goin to 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.159
 making your bookshelf more beautiful with 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.380
 item you like 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.590
 if you also want to revolutionize then 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.450
 I find this kind of work 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.060
 the cane and in the case of this book here only 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.060
 show it just to know the style 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.610
 nor does it give the work they do with 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.040
 the sheet to look like it was a 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.730
 parchment an old sheet 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.450
 The other cool thing is the art work. 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.390
 No of the drawings in this style 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.840
 it's just to see it as a pencil that you 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.390
 see and some animations of the devil 3 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.239
 I think it's too cool, you look. 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.230
 here in the book intensive repairs you have not 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:50.060
 been cut a thing well thus not 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:54.560
 industrialized countries is very 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.349
 quickly and 30 here like this one 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.620
 piece here the letter style could have 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:07.849
 It's been a lot cooler to get a thing 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:24.799
 medieval but I do not know the delivery letter 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:31.609
 more gothic from the ground and take away is the 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:34.099
 angels of the characters of the points of 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:37.190
 I think all this history 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.620
 universe is cool because it is 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.829
 type a complement is always 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.910
 complementing the work of art here 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:50.019
 of this image 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.019
 My goodness, look what's cool. 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.540
 is the cool thing is beyond the data 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.830
 information 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:03.060
 it's a work of art here look at the 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:09.600
 Devil summing up who remembers what I saw 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:13.470
 there is no legal way everything was 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.990
 open the time it takes to launch the 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.570
 games of the most this 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.269
 this structure this structure that gives 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:26.430
 clean for you and go deeper in 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:37.260
 I only know how to work on it and with what it gives 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:41.160
 to make history until I'm just gonna give 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.660
 a quick pass to stay 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.240
 talking about the contents of the legal book 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:50.480
 you have you and he calmly you 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.480
 finish this art work 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.370
 Look, just talk b all this style work. 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.720
 of drawing you like illustration 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.480
 to draw I think this is a plate 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.490
 full but if you like this style of 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:11.340
 characters from the fictional fantasy world 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.919
 I think it's the channel for you to talk 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.919
 past that you can only see 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:25.980
 these illustrations are so cool 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:29.490
 Look at the other one because there is not much of 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:33.690
 understanding that you will stay at the maximum and 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:40.200
 to be there in seven months just to give 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:43.860
 race here in time to show more 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.460
 I hope that in the end it comes 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.520
 a note 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:06:00.289
