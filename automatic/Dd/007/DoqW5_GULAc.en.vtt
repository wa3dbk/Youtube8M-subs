of the best things about the carbine so

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.970 
of the best things about the carbine so
my<00:03:33.700> opinion<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.480> car<00:03:34.720> bind<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.079> m20<00:03:35.470> titling

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
my opinion the car bind the m20 titling

my opinion the car bind the m20 titling
on<00:03:36.069> carbon<00:03:36.430> would<00:03:36.549> probably<00:03:36.910> suit<00:03:37.120> an<00:03:37.239> assault

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569

staying on target and number two I was

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.699 
staying on target and number two I was
wasting<00:04:06.669> a<00:04:06.819> lot<00:04:07.060> of<00:04:07.120> ammo<00:04:07.510> if<00:04:08.319> you<00:04:08.470> find

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
wasting a lot of ammo if you find

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.170 
wasting a lot of ammo if you find
yourself<00:04:08.859> with<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.370> assault<00:04:09.639> rifles<00:04:10.000> or

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
yourself with the assault rifles or

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.789

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
carbines wasting a lot of ammo i

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.860 
carbines wasting a lot of ammo i
definitely<00:04:12.430> recommend<00:04:12.549> going<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.209> burst<00:04:13.480> fire

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
definitely recommend going to burst fire

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.900 
definitely recommend going to burst fire
or<00:04:14.139> single<00:04:14.859> shot<00:04:15.040> fired<00:04:15.250> definitely<00:04:15.730> save

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
or single shot fired definitely save

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.779 
or single shot fired definitely save
yourself<00:04:16.329> a<00:04:16.510> lot<00:04:16.599> of<00:04:16.930> ammo<00:04:17.260> that<00:04:17.289> way<00:04:17.789> so

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
yourself a lot of ammo that way so

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.759 
yourself a lot of ammo that way so

think you get four shots with it you

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.990 
think you get four shots with it you
just<00:04:35.500> place<00:04:35.800> them<00:04:36.040> wherever<00:04:36.400> on<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.639> map<00:04:36.790> you

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
just place them wherever on the map you

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.730 
just place them wherever on the map you
want<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.300> place<00:04:37.449> them<00:04:37.750> it<00:04:38.050> doesn't<00:04:38.380> seem<00:04:38.530> too

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.110 
want to place them it doesn't seem too
powerful<00:04:39.250> mean<00:04:39.460> I<00:04:39.580> don't<00:04:39.760> know<00:04:39.820> if<00:04:39.880> I'm<00:04:39.970> not

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
powerful mean I don't know if I'm not

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.180 
powerful mean I don't know if I'm not
using<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.570> properly<00:04:40.690> but<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.020> used<00:04:41.440> it<00:04:41.650> didn't

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
using it properly but I used it didn't

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.530 
using it properly but I used it didn't
really<00:04:42.310> get<00:04:42.520> too<00:04:42.729> many<00:04:42.850> killers<00:04:43.180> but<00:04:43.389> it's

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
really get too many killers but it's

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.610 
really get too many killers but it's
something<00:04:43.720> that's<00:04:44.020> just<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.260> little<00:04:44.380> bit<00:04:44.560> of

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
something that's just a little bit of

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.409 
something that's just a little bit of
fun<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:45.040> there's<00:04:45.340> an<00:04:45.520> extra<00:04:45.880> dynamic<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.389> the

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
fun and there's an extra dynamic to the

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.260 
fun and there's an extra dynamic to the
game<00:04:46.690> which<00:04:47.350> is<00:04:47.500> always<00:04:47.650> good<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:49.150> I<00:04:49.180> think

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
game which is always good so I think

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.270 
game which is always good so I think
this<00:04:49.540> expansion<00:04:50.020> pack<00:04:50.380> probably<00:04:50.860> suits<00:04:51.130> you

get in the air although there are

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.560 
get in the air although there are
smaller<00:05:00.160> versions<00:05:00.580> of<00:05:00.639> these<00:05:00.790> maps<00:05:01.060> as<00:05:01.210> well<00:05:01.240> I

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
smaller versions of these maps as well I

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.330 
smaller versions of these maps as well I
tend<00:05:01.990> to<00:05:02.050> find<00:05:02.169> there's<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:02.530> lot<00:05:02.860> of<00:05:02.889> long-range

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
tend to find there's a lot of long-range

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.520 
tend to find there's a lot of long-range
sight<00:05:03.610> line<00:05:03.820> so<00:05:04.000> snipers<00:05:04.540> as<00:05:04.630> well<00:05:04.840> be<00:05:05.290> quite

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
sight line so snipers as well be quite

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.170 
sight line so snipers as well be quite
happy<00:05:05.680> I've<00:05:05.919> got<00:05:06.040> a<00:05:06.070> couple<00:05:06.340> of<00:05:06.610> sniper<00:05:06.850> clips

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
a sniper on a smaller map it allows a

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.560 
a sniper on a smaller map it allows a
recon<00:05:15.460> class<00:05:15.669> to<00:05:15.820> actually<00:05:16.060> be<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.180> lot<00:05:16.540> more

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570
