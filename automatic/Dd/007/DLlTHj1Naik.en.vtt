00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
pipeline here you just hook that up to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.889 
pipeline here you just hook that up to
your<00:00:43.230> farm<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.710> here's<00:00:44.700> where<00:00:45.030> your<00:00:45.360> storage

just demonstrate once again let me grab

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.899 
just demonstrate once again let me grab
some<00:01:02.730> some<00:01:03.480> zombie<00:01:04.049> flesh<00:01:04.409> pop<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.489> here

some some zombie flesh pop it in here

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.550 
some some zombie flesh pop it in here
and<00:01:06.090> you'll<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.350> basically

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and you'll see that because basically

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.310 
and you'll see that because basically
this<00:01:08.250> hopper<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.210> full<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.930> chest<00:01:10.200> is

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
this hopper is full and this chest is

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
this hopper is full and this chest is
full<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> automatically<00:01:11.880> come

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
full it's going to automatically come

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.969 
full it's going to automatically come
into<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.659> dropper<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.380> facing<00:01:13.619> into

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
into this dropper that's facing into

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.969 
into this dropper that's facing into
this<00:01:14.100> cactus<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.960> basically<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.259> destroy

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
this cactus and basically just destroy

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.370 
this cactus and basically just destroy
it<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.689> take<00:01:18.840> some<00:01:19.110> out<00:01:19.259> of

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
it so you know if I take some out of

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.660 
it so you know if I take some out of
here<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> start<00:01:20.490> collecting

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
here it's going to start collecting

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.969 
here it's going to start collecting
again<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.570> stop<00:01:21.780> destroying<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.470> until<00:01:22.830> this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
again and stop destroying it until this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.350 
again and stop destroying it until this
is<00:01:23.159> full<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.970> will<00:01:24.060> start<00:01:24.240> getting

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
is full and then it will start getting

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.270 
is full and then it will start getting
destroyed<00:01:24.689> again<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:25.799> basically<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
destroyed again so that's basically the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.800 
destroyed again so that's basically the
premise<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.790> could<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.000> useful<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.479> many

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
premise this could be useful in many

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.569 
premise this could be useful in many
different<00:01:27.990> situations<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.130> mentioned

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
different situations like I mentioned

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.370 
different situations like I mentioned
you<00:01:29.939> know<00:01:30.150> overworld<00:01:30.540> mob<00:01:30.750> farm<00:01:31.020> where<00:01:31.290> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you know overworld mob farm where you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.100 
you know overworld mob farm where you
have<00:01:31.530> rotten<00:01:31.920> zombie<00:01:32.220> flesh<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.909> even<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:34.020> an

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
have rotten zombie flesh or even like an

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.530 
have rotten zombie flesh or even like an
animal<00:01:34.470> farm<00:01:34.650> where<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.640> got<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.119> many<00:01:36.270> ender

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
animal farm where you got so many ender

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.700 
animal farm where you got so many ender
pearls<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> don't<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.530> with

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
pearls you don't know what to do with

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.170 
pearls you don't know what to do with
them<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.700> want<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> get<00:01:39.030> rid<00:01:39.150> of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.760 
them and you just want to get rid of
them<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.960> know<00:01:40.049> stop<00:01:40.380> collecting

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
them so they you know stop collecting

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.120 
them so they you know stop collecting
everywhere<00:01:41.220> causing<00:01:41.850> lag<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.450> game<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
yeah so now that I've kind of given you

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.899 
yeah so now that I've kind of given you
the<00:01:46.380> idea<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.710> what<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.979> does<00:01:47.159> let<00:01:47.579> me<00:01:47.700> show<00:01:47.850> you

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the idea of what it does let me show you

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.240 
the idea of what it does let me show you
how<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.060> make<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:48.390> okay<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.770> we'll<00:01:49.920> start<00:01:50.009> by

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
how to make one okay so we'll start by

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.980 
how to make one okay so we'll start by
placing<00:01:50.520> our<00:01:50.759> chests<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> items<00:01:51.780> we

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
placing our chests that the items we

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.960 
placing our chests that the items we
want<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.259> keep<00:01:52.500> are<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> go<00:01:52.950> into<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
want to keep are going to go into on the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.999 
want to keep are going to go into on the
backside<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.540> put<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> hopper<00:01:55.590> facing

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
backside of that put a hopper facing

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.499 
backside of that put a hopper facing
into<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.060> we're<00:01:57.149> going<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.299> put<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
into it and then we're going to put a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.630 
into it and then we're going to put a
couple<00:01:57.840> blocks<00:01:58.110> up<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.460> is

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
couple blocks up just like this this is

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.609 
couple blocks up just like this this is
basically<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.030> giving<00:02:00.479> us<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.719> way<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.140> put

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
basically just giving us a way to put

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.249 
basically just giving us a way to put
our<00:02:01.799> upside-down<00:02:02.369> dropper<00:02:03.210> underneath<00:02:03.719> so

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
our upside-down dropper underneath so

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.560 
our upside-down dropper underneath so
you<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.469> get<00:02:04.619> those<00:02:04.799> blocks<00:02:05.159> back<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.969> then

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
you can get those blocks back and then

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.809 
you can get those blocks back and then
we<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.689> fill<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.020> back<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.890> then<00:02:08.700> we

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
we can fill that back in and then we

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.130 
we can fill that back in and then we
want<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.030> come<00:02:09.179> around<00:02:09.270> here<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.660> where<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:09.989> put

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
want to come around here to where we put

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.869 
want to come around here to where we put
that<00:02:10.229> dropper<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.649> put<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.250> hopper<00:02:11.700> facing

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
that dropper and put a hopper facing

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.370 
that dropper and put a hopper facing
into<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.660> dropper

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
into that dropper

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.020 
into that dropper
and<00:02:13.860> then<00:02:14.010> come<00:02:14.190> around<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.550> back<00:02:14.700> side<00:02:14.970> of

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
and then come around the back side of

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.460 
and then come around the back side of
this<00:02:15.240> dropper<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:15.870> we're<00:02:16.170> going<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.350> put<00:02:16.440> a

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
this dropper and we're going to put a

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.620 
this dropper and we're going to put a
comparator<00:02:17.100> coming<00:02:17.610> off<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.180> that's

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
comparator coming off of that that's

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.260 
comparator coming off of that that's
going<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.960> be<00:02:19.110> going<00:02:19.320> into<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.950> solid<00:02:20.520> block<00:02:20.940> and

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
going to be going into a solid block and

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.240 
going to be going into a solid block and
then<00:02:21.660> we're<00:02:21.750> going<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.900> wrap<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.470> redstone<00:02:22.860> line

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
then we're going to wrap a redstone line

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.850 
then we're going to wrap a redstone line
around<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.150> like<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.690> then<00:02:25.320> also<00:02:25.530> put

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
around it just like so then also put

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.770 
around it just like so then also put
dust<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:26.550> top<00:02:26.730> right<00:02:27.120> there<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.600> then<00:02:27.690> we're

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
dust on top right there and then we're

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.150 
dust on top right there and then we're
going<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.930> place<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.170> couple<00:02:28.440> blocks<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
going to place a couple blocks on the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.940 
going to place a couple blocks on the
edges<00:02:29.520> here<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> cut<00:02:30.330> off<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.810> wire<00:02:31.230> so

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
edges here just to cut off that wire so

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.620 
edges here just to cut off that wire so
at<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> end<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.550> should<00:02:32.850> have<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
at the end you should have just the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.110 
at the end you should have just the
circular<00:02:34.260> redstone<00:02:34.770> right<00:02:34.980> there<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.400> then

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
circular redstone right there and then

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.430 
circular redstone right there and then
on<00:02:36.240> top<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.780> dropper<00:02:37.140> we're<00:02:37.260> going<00:02:37.380> to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
on top of the dropper we're going to

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.080 
on top of the dropper we're going to
place<00:02:37.650> an<00:02:37.860> activator<00:02:38.370> rail<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.790> could<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.030> a

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
place an activator rail this could be a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.000 
place an activator rail this could be a
powered<00:02:39.420> rail<00:02:39.540> or<00:02:40.080> activator<00:02:40.740> rail<00:02:40.950> it

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
powered rail or activator rail it

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.080 
powered rail or activator rail it
doesn't<00:02:41.250> really<00:02:41.340> matter<00:02:41.610> whatever<00:02:41.910> is

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
doesn't really matter whatever is

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.900 
doesn't really matter whatever is
cheaper<00:02:42.780> for<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.470> then<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.550> put<00:02:44.730> our

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
cheaper for you and then we can put our

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.420 
cheaper for you and then we can put our
input<00:02:45.390> line<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.780> hoppers<00:02:46.200> here<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:46.860> I'll<00:02:47.400> just

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
input line of hoppers here and I'll just

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.280 
input line of hoppers here and I'll just
put<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> chest<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.270> top<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.900> we'll<00:02:48.990> kind<00:02:49.200> of

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
put a chest on top and we'll kind of

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.260 
put a chest on top and we'll kind of
simulate<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:50.040> we<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.340> some<00:02:50.550> items<00:02:50.880> coming

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
simulate that we have some items coming

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.710 
simulate that we have some items coming
in<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.130> right<00:02:54.120> now<00:02:54.300> they<00:02:54.450> should

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
in like this and right now they should

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.960 
in like this and right now they should
be<00:02:54.870> coming<00:02:55.110> into<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.620> chest<00:02:55.980> here<00:02:56.370> because

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
be coming into this chest here because

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.970 
be coming into this chest here because
it<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.120> not<00:02:57.420> full<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.410> now<00:02:58.500> while<00:02:58.800> that's

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
it is not full so now while that's

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.860 
it is not full so now while that's
filling<00:02:59.340> up<00:02:59.460> let's<00:02:59.640> go<00:02:59.790> ahead<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.330> make<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.630> way

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
filling up let's go ahead and make a way

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.390 
filling up let's go ahead and make a way
to<00:03:00.930> dispose<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.560> items<00:03:01.830> now<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:01.980> showed<00:03:02.250> you

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
to dispose the items now I showed you

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.880 
to dispose the items now I showed you
cactus<00:03:02.910> below<00:03:03.300> before<00:03:03.960> you<00:03:04.140> can<00:03:04.290> put<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.470> cactus

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
cactus below before you can put a cactus

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.190 
cactus below before you can put a cactus
in<00:03:05.040> here<00:03:05.250> or<00:03:05.430> if<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:06.300> like<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.750> put<00:03:06.990> lava

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
in here or if you like you can put lava

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.960 
in here or if you like you can put lava
so<00:03:07.590> all<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.010> can<00:03:08.130> just<00:03:08.160> pour<00:03:08.460> a<00:03:08.490> lava<00:03:08.700> source

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
so all you can just pour a lava source

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.720 
so all you can just pour a lava source
like<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:09.530> put<00:03:10.530> some<00:03:10.680> blocks<00:03:10.920> around<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.460> and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
like that put some blocks around it and

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.460 
like that put some blocks around it and
now<00:03:12.180> any<00:03:12.390> items<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:12.870> shoot<00:03:13.140> out<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.380> that

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
now any items that shoot out of that

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.780 
now any items that shoot out of that
will<00:03:13.620> shoot<00:03:13.800> directly<00:03:14.190> into<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.430> lava

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
will shoot directly into that lava

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.660 
will shoot directly into that lava
source<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.480> get<00:03:16.140> destroyed<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:17.400> let<00:03:17.520> me<00:03:17.580> go

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
source and get destroyed so let me go

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.520 
source and get destroyed so let me go
ahead<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.880> fill<00:03:18.240> this<00:03:18.420> thing<00:03:18.480> up<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.110> then

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
ahead and fill this thing up and then

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.660 
ahead and fill this thing up and then
we'll<00:03:19.740> watch<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.460> work<00:03:21.680> okay<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:23.490> is

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
we'll watch it work okay so this is

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.190 
we'll watch it work okay so this is
almost<00:03:24.090> filled<00:03:24.450> up<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.810> can<00:03:24.930> see<00:03:25.080> this

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
almost filled up you can see this

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.080 
almost filled up you can see this
hoppers<00:03:25.590> about<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.190> fill<00:03:26.370> up<00:03:26.490> all<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.790> way<00:03:26.940> and

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
hoppers about to fill up all the way and

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.570 
hoppers about to fill up all the way and
once<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.660> does<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.140> items<00:03:28.530> coming<00:03:28.800> in<00:03:29.040> from

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
once it does the items coming in from

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.520 
once it does the items coming in from
this<00:03:29.730> input<00:03:30.120> chest<00:03:30.360> should<00:03:30.690> start<00:03:31.020> shooting

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
this input chest should start shooting

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.770 
this input chest should start shooting
into<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.130> lava<00:03:32.310> there<00:03:33.300> we<00:03:33.420> go

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
into the lava there we go

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.650 
into the lava there we go
and<00:03:34.820> they<00:03:35.820> will<00:03:35.940> basically<00:03:36.090> just<00:03:36.330> keep

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
and they will basically just keep

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.900 
and they will basically just keep
getting<00:03:36.960> destroyed<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.770> tell<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.760> know<00:03:38.850> you

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
getting destroyed and tell you know you

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.880 
getting destroyed and tell you know you
either<00:03:39.090> take<00:03:39.360> items<00:03:39.720> out<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.230> then<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.800> will

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
either take items out and then it will

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.000 
either take items out and then it will
start<00:03:41.130> filling<00:03:41.460> this<00:03:41.670> back<00:03:41.940> up<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.860> use<00:03:43.860> your

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
start filling this back up and use your

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.400 
start filling this back up and use your
seat<00:03:44.220> phone<00:03:44.430> up<00:03:44.550> there<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:45.170> then<00:03:46.170> once<00:03:46.320> that's

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
seat phone up there and then once that's

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.110 
seat phone up there and then once that's
full<00:03:46.680> again<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.100> will<00:03:47.190> start<00:03:47.250> Auto<00:03:47.700> destroying

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
full again it will start Auto destroying

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.650 
full again it will start Auto destroying
again<00:03:48.420> so<00:03:49.020> pretty<00:03:49.860> easy<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.370> build<00:03:50.520> and<00:03:50.880> like<00:03:51.570> I

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
again so pretty easy to build and like I

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.120 
again so pretty easy to build and like I
said<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.870> can<00:03:52.050> think<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.350> couple<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.680> usage

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
said I can think of a couple of usage

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.340 
said I can think of a couple of usage
scenarios<00:03:53.700> where<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.330> would<00:03:54.630> be<00:03:54.840> useful<00:03:55.050> in

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
scenarios where this would be useful in

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.990 
scenarios where this would be useful in
my<00:03:55.830> world<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.310> know<00:03:56.340> especially<00:03:56.640> with<00:03:56.940> the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
my world you know especially with the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.750 
my world you know especially with the
Enderman<00:03:57.960> farm<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.460> know<00:03:59.550> have<00:03:59.700> a

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
Enderman farm and and you know have a

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.580 
Enderman farm and and you know have a
gold<00:04:00.000> farm<00:04:00.330> that<00:04:00.570> I<00:04:00.630> separate<00:04:01.140> out<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.380> rotten

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
gold farm that I separate out the rotten

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.260 
gold farm that I separate out the rotten
flesh<00:04:01.890> from<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.520> could<00:04:02.670> auto<00:04:02.820> dispose

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
flesh from that it could auto dispose

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.110 
flesh from that it could auto dispose
there<00:04:03.510> as<00:04:03.600> well<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:04.590> yep<00:04:05.370> hopefully<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:05.910> find

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
there as well so yep hopefully you find

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.850 
there as well so yep hopefully you find
it<00:04:06.270> useful<00:04:06.390> in<00:04:06.660> your<00:04:06.720> world<00:04:07.020> there<00:04:07.440> we<00:04:07.530> go

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
it useful in your world there we go

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.770 
it useful in your world there we go
still<00:04:08.430> back<00:04:08.670> up<00:04:08.880> now<00:04:09.090> it's<00:04:09.210> destroying<00:04:09.510> again

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
still back up now it's destroying again

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.470 
still back up now it's destroying again
and<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:11.130> know<00:04:11.220> if<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.580> do<00:04:11.670> find<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:11.970> useful<00:04:12.060> be
