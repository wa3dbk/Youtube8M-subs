00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.279
 I will tell you the epic of 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.870
 minecraft in six dates it was once 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.860
 a mysterious creators and for a year 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.110
 of markus persson nicknamed notch having 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.089
 a little game idea all started on 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.859
 May 10, 2009 when the project started 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.270
 cavier while the business maugendre 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.800
 had just been newly created and we 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.630
 so here is before the very first test 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.740
 technique of a future great game to true 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.210
 to say he does not look like yet 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.470
 today's minecraft but his epic 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.029
 has just begun 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.900
 combining only three types of cube 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.820
 with a display distance 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.560
 extremely limited this technical test 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.329
 still shows us a game not yet 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.100
 well optimized but do not worry 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.170
 it will not be long before the project 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.149
 cash game at minecraft order of the stone 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.559
 with noting a radical change 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.090
 we are nearing the end 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.950
 of the development of the game it would 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.360
 actually wait until June 2010 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.460
 the 28 to be more specific for 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 finally perceive the end of the project thanks to 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.820
 the alfa's exit from the minecraft game 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.770
 so we finally have the name of the game 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.539
 definitive but the capacity of this one 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.460
 seemed to be still a bit limited to 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.960
 that time a lot of blocks 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.609
 are still missing despite 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.809
 its rare block and as and when 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.280
 updates new things 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.750
 come to consolidate the game like the cheek 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.610
 for example an ugly halloween 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.990
 besides, a little anecdote about it 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.070
 desire was to be a simple extension 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.360
 for halloween parties 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.799
 but it turns out that the community has 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.570
 so much hooked on this little bit of 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.130
 to make that match decided to leave brief 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.960
 the alpha does not yet contain all the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.460
 rapes neither the food bar and so on 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.850
 but after all that remains only one 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.560
 alfa 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.750
 it will be necessary to wait until December 20 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.430
 2010 for the beta to come out finally and 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.810
 there after several versions of it 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.250
 Well, that's the drama 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.600
 no it's not good actually after 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.009
 blow there are many more things that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.390
 have been added in this beta as 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.159
 what was missing for example at the alpha and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.259
 so we finally could have this 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.700
 wonderful not at all messy food 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.229
 you have to raise chickens and 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.670
 to be closed to plant wheat until 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.700
 that a wild pig has just trampled 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.079
 you're culture a short fucking this beta 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.119
 brings a lot of good surprises 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.829
 like for example the villages the mines 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.390
 abandoned let's leave the fault 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.009
 or new guillaume 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.360
 new blocks of food short of 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.070
 what to advance the game until its 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.590
 final version and this final version 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.299
 it's also November 19th 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.039
 11 that she will go out after more than 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.630
 two years of hard work for the match since 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.799
 the beginning of his project this outing 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.329
 was accompanied by his 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.619
 thriller that happened on youtube 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.719
 a few days later on December 6th 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.549
 2011 to be more precise and against the 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.259
 modest sum of 100 million views to 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.000
 this day passes a person by the name of 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.280
 James Verguin Stan, better known as 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.840
 jane's pseudo joins a match for the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.400
 development of the game follows several 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.049
 updates at which the game is going to get 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.849
 perfect and become what you 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.620
 know now but be careful 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.239
 the epic is not over yet because 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.950
 adventures of this game will know a 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.870
 appreciable turning point for the players of 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.790
 console from the beginning only on 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.650
 pc the console players started to 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.510
 depress not to see her pretty little ones 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.310
 cubes all pixelated and that's when a 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.870
 new studio named 4j studios makes 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.290
 his entry for the greatest pleasure of 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.700
 all 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.680
 it goes without saying that a port on 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.450
 consoles had to be inevitable he 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.310
 will have to wait until 9 May 2012 for 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.989
 see finally the first dating of this 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.190
 game on xbox 360 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.480
 follows as years go by 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.920
 new versions for others 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.329
 unfortunate who in turn have had 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.650
 the chance to host minecraft in 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.569
 their games library like the 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.280
 playstation 3 the xbox live the 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.640
 playstation 4 or even the playstation 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.049
 vita 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.730
 and besides, even the laptops have not 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.500
 not escaped as time goes by 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.209
 the game has been phenomenally successful and 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.709
 so lightning that notch has 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.090
 failed to be struck down by so many 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.230
 communities on his shoulders and that's 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.799
 for that they learn to great 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.090
 decisions 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.069
 the decisions taken there he 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.599
 officially on 15 September 2014 in 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.160
 announcing his departure from the studio 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.900
 following the takeover of the maujean company 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.609
 by microsoft for the modest sum of 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.510
 2.5 billion dollars 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.980
 it goes without saying that the studio 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.079
 independent loses its independence 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.790
 for the benefit perhaps of a better future 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.959
 after all the time we will say it well and 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.639
 that's when I ask you 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.470
 a question do you think 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:30.609
 the minecraft epic is over or 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.609
 will she continue more beautiful
