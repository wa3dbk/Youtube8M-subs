items and models that I worked on I

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.810 
items and models that I worked on I
began<00:00:24.360> at<00:00:24.570> Indiana<00:00:24.869> Jones<00:00:25.369> where<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> did<00:00:26.669> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
began at Indiana Jones where I did the

began at Indiana Jones where I did the
temple<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.180> escaped<00:00:27.419> then<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.290> swooped<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:28.800> just

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
temple I escaped then I swooped for just

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.339 
temple I escaped then I swooped for just
half<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.340> year<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.610> Stowers<00:00:30.000> where<00:00:30.239> I<00:00:30.270> was<00:00:30.540> had<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
half a year to Stowers where I was had a

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.900 
half a year to Stowers where I was had a
chance<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.739> build<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.009> republic<00:00:32.220> gunship<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
chance to build a republic gunship and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.060 
chance to build a republic gunship and
then<00:00:33.870> there<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:34.710> some<00:00:35.300> sketch<00:00:36.300> modeling<00:00:36.720> for

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
then there was some sketch modeling for

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.940 
then there was some sketch modeling for
Space<00:00:38.070> Police<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.770> spongebob

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
Space Police and for a spongebob

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.990 
Space Police and for a spongebob
and<00:00:41.269> then<00:00:42.269> Stowers<00:00:42.809> again<00:00:43.109> and<00:00:43.530> power<00:00:44.250> -<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
and then Stowers again and power - and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.020 
and then Stowers again and power - and
then<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.960> swooped<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.859> Stowers<00:00:47.460> again<00:00:47.760> for

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
then I swooped to Stowers again for

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.450 
then I swooped to Stowers again for
about<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.750> half<00:00:48.780> years<00:00:49.460> working

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
about one and a half years working

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.160 
about one and a half years working
continuously<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.269> on<00:00:51.480> Star<00:00:51.690> Wars<00:00:51.719> models

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
continuously just on Star Wars models

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.430 
continuously just on Star Wars models
and<00:00:53.210> in<00:00:54.210> Paris<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> last<00:00:55.109> model

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and in Paris that was the last model

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.380 
and in Paris that was the last model
that<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.589> did<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.129> Star<00:00:56.309> Wars<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:57.059> research

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
that I did for Star Wars the research

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.349 
that I did for Star Wars the research
that<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.660> used<00:00:57.929> to<00:00:58.230> do<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.499> model<00:00:58.800> was

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
that I used to do the model was

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.689 
that I used to do the model was
obviously<00:01:00.359> first<00:01:01.159> watching<00:01:02.159> the<00:01:02.249> movies<00:01:02.519> over

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
obviously first watching the movies over

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.570 
obviously first watching the movies over
and<00:01:02.909> over<00:01:03.120> again<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.559> asking<00:01:04.559> Lucas<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:05.370> four

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
and over again and asking Lucas for four

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.700 
and over again and asking Lucas for four
pictures<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.409> actual

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
pictures of the of the of the actual

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.710 
pictures of the of the of the actual
model<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.250> was<00:01:08.400> used<00:01:08.670> back<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> days<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
model that was used back in the days to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.460 
model that was used back in the days to
shoot<00:01:10.050> the<00:01:10.200> scenes<00:01:10.440> and<00:01:11.690> after<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.810> initial

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
shoot the scenes and after the initial

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.960 
shoot the scenes and after the initial
prototype<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.159> went<00:01:14.579> to<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> friend<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> mine

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
prototype I went to a friend of mine

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.490 
prototype I went to a friend of mine
who's<00:01:17.970> from<00:01:18.149> Poland<00:01:18.479> he's<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> fan<00:01:19.020> design<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
who's from Poland he's a fan design and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.370 
who's from Poland he's a fan design and
magic<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.270> he<00:01:21.270> already<00:01:21.450> built<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
magic and he already built this one as a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.280 
magic and he already built this one as a
fan<00:01:22.680> model<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.820> thought<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.930> might<00:01:25.229> be

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
fan model so we thought that it might be

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.530 
fan model so we thought that it might be
smart<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.040> actually<00:01:26.460> ask<00:01:26.579> him<00:01:26.820> if<00:01:26.969> we<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.240> use

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
smart to actually ask him if we can use

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.600 
smart to actually ask him if we can use
some<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.020> features<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.380> he<00:01:29.100> used<00:01:29.340> for

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
some of the features that he used for

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.179 
some of the features that he used for
his<00:01:29.640> model<00:01:29.909> because<00:01:30.299> obviously<00:01:30.509> he<00:01:30.869> spends<00:01:31.740> so

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
his model because obviously he spends so

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.889 
his model because obviously he spends so
much<00:01:32.219> time<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.149> many<00:01:33.240> thoughts<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.719> it

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
much time and so many thoughts in it

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.950 
much time and so many thoughts in it
that<00:01:34.079> there<00:01:34.829> was<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.579> possibility<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.479> actually

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that there was a possibility to actually

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
that there was a possibility to actually
take<00:01:37.110> an<00:01:37.290> almost<00:01:37.649> perfect<00:01:38.189> model<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.640> just

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
take an almost perfect model and just

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.209 
take an almost perfect model and just
turn<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> into<00:01:39.539> a<00:01:39.659> set<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.170> think<00:01:40.950> without

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
turn it into a set I think without

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.160 
turn it into a set I think without
changing<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:43.649> best<00:01:43.860> things<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.520> about<00:01:45.170> 65%

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
changing the best things it's about 65%

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.459 
changing the best things it's about 65%
that<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.920> thought<00:01:47.159> out<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.579> 45%<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.600> its<00:01:49.020> model

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
that we thought out and 45% is its model

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.050 
that we thought out and 45% is its model
that<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.909> magic<00:01:51.450> did<00:01:51.630> well<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:53.700> hardest

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
that that magic did well the hardest

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.399 
that that magic did well the hardest
part<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.390> model<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.229> obviously

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
part on a model like this is obviously

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.090 
part on a model like this is obviously
the<00:01:55.740> size<00:01:56.420> as<00:01:57.420> long<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.100> reasonably

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the size as long as it is reasonably

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.160 
the size as long as it is reasonably
easy<00:01:59.609> to<00:01:59.880> build<00:02:00.090> something<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.960> for

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
easy to build something like that for

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.560 
easy to build something like that for
yourself<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.090> doesn't<00:02:03.329> need<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.539> be

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
yourself so that it doesn't need to be

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.360 
yourself so that it doesn't need to be
split<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
split and and

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.660 
split and and
doesn't<00:02:05.940> need<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.800> be<00:02:07.800> shown<00:02:08.130> on<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.310> building

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
doesn't need to be shown on a building

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.850 
doesn't need to be shown on a building
instructions<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.600> seems<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.350> be<00:02:10.440> quite<00:02:10.650> easy

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
instructions it seems to be quite easy

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.590 
instructions it seems to be quite easy
but<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:12.600> think<00:02:13.110> out<00:02:13.320> a<00:02:13.350> way<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
but to think out a way so that that the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.300 
but to think out a way so that that the
elements<00:02:16.080> aren't<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.710> certain<00:02:17.130> order

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
elements aren't in a certain order

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.840 
elements aren't in a certain order
that's<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.390> that's<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.440> very<00:02:19.710> hard<00:02:20.010> one

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
that's that that's that is very hard one

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.030 
that's that that's that is very hard one
of<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> favorite<00:02:21.450> things<00:02:21.660> or<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.680> model<00:02:22.950> is

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
of the favorite things or the model is

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.770 
of the favorite things or the model is
definitely<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.760> size<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.210> not<00:02:24.270> every<00:02:24.630> day

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
definitely the size it's not every day

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.110 
definitely the size it's not every day
that<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.080> build<00:02:25.290> something<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.710> Bing<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
that you build something that Bing the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.400 
that you build something that Bing the
other<00:02:27.240> thing<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.720> really<00:02:27.990> like<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.380> that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
other thing that I really like is that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.500 
other thing that I really like is that
you<00:02:28.650> don't<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.370> ever<00:02:29.670> display<00:02:30.120> like<00:02:30.330> this

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
you don't have to ever display like this

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.480 
you don't have to ever display like this
because<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:32.100> actually<00:02:33.020> has<00:02:34.020> lending<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.680> as

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
because it actually has lending you as

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.180 
because it actually has lending you as
soon<00:02:35.760> as<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.090> put<00:02:36.690> up<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.930> wings<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.920> can

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
soon as you put up the wings you can

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.410 
soon as you put up the wings you can
take<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.520> lady<00:02:38.700> off<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.740> then<00:02:41.210> put<00:02:42.210> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
take the lady off and then put the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.040 
take the lady off and then put the
landing<00:02:42.780> gear<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.200> mean<00:02:43.820> obviously<00:02:44.960> there<00:02:45.960> will

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
landing gear I mean obviously there will

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.420 
landing gear I mean obviously there will
be<00:02:46.080> many<00:02:46.350> people<00:02:46.500> who<00:02:46.680> ask<00:02:46.890> themselves<00:02:47.280> why

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
be many people who ask themselves why

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.730 
be many people who ask themselves why
didn't<00:02:47.760> we<00:02:47.880> make<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.380> retractable<00:02:49.380> landing

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
didn't we make a retractable landing

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.440 
didn't we make a retractable landing
gear<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.370> why<00:02:50.550> do<00:02:50.610> we<00:02:50.730> have<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.030> put<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.270> off

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
gear and why do we have to put it off

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.560 
gear and why do we have to put it off
from<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.320> only<00:02:52.440> needs<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:52.920> stuff<00:02:53.070> but<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.850> mean

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
from the only needs and stuff but I mean

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.970 
from the only needs and stuff but I mean
it's<00:02:54.960> all<00:02:55.350> I<00:02:56.090> think<00:02:57.090> about<00:02:57.360> stability<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:58.230> how

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
it's all I think about stability and how

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.340 
it's all I think about stability and how
it<00:02:59.130> works<00:02:59.340> but<00:02:59.820> on<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> other<00:03:00.270> side<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.720> mean<00:03:00.930> it

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
it works but on the other side I mean it

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.310 
it works but on the other side I mean it
stands<00:03:01.980> on<00:03:02.190> two<00:03:02.700> feet<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.180> then<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.020> can<00:03:04.170> have

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
stands on two feet and then you can have

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.560 
stands on two feet and then you can have
it<00:03:04.370> displayed<00:03:05.370> next<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.730> your<00:03:05.850> mini<00:03:06.150> Falcon

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
it displayed next to your mini Falcon

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.740 
it displayed next to your mini Falcon
which<00:03:07.440> i<00:03:07.590> think<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.340> brilliant<00:03:08.880> thinkers<00:03:09.450> up

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
which i think is a brilliant thinkers up

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.510 
which i think is a brilliant thinkers up
until<00:03:10.260> now<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.709> Millennium<00:03:11.040> Falcon<00:03:11.070> was<00:03:11.489> a

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
until now the Millennium Falcon was a

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.910 
until now the Millennium Falcon was a
kind<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.000> stand-alone<00:03:12.480> thing<00:03:12.900> now<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.590> have<00:03:13.770> to

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
kind of stand-alone thing now we have to

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.630 
kind of stand-alone thing now we have to
think<00:03:14.160> where<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.820> put<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.150> one<00:03:15.330> as<00:03:15.480> well
