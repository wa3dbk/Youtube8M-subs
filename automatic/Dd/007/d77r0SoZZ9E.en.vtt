ejected<00:01:18.000> right<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:21.500> came<00:01:22.500> up<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.840> Infinix

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
ejected right this came up so Infinix

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.440 
ejected right this came up so Infinix
zero<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.780> having<00:01:27.950> growth<00:01:28.950> MCAD<00:01:29.400> capability<00:01:30.240> as

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
zero is having growth MCAD capability as

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.289 
zero is having growth MCAD capability as

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
slot focusing so let's put the same here

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.550 
slot focusing so let's put the same here
in<00:01:37.680> Detroit<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.000> nano<00:01:39.780> SIM<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.409> I

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
in Detroit this one is nano SIM and as I

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.440 
in Detroit this one is nano SIM and as I
am<00:01:40.680> told<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.640> having<00:01:41.909> another<00:01:42.119> thing<00:01:42.329> you

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
am told you for having another thing you

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.620 
am told you for having another thing you
will<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.869> convert<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:44.450> micro<00:01:45.450> SIM

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
will have to convert it to micro SIM

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.649 
will have to convert it to micro SIM
using<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.170> micro<00:01:48.950> sim<00:01:49.950> adapter<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.659> this

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
using a micro sim adapter like this this

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.179 
using a micro sim adapter like this this
the<00:01:52.619> same<00:01:52.920> here<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.490> here<00:01:55.549> we<00:01:56.549> go<00:01:57.920> now<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:58.979> are

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
the same here and here we go now we are

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.560 
the same here and here we go now we are
having<00:02:00.799> micro<00:02:01.799> sim<00:02:01.979> instead<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.399> nano<00:02:02.640> say<00:02:02.880> so

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
having micro sim instead of nano say so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.170 
having micro sim instead of nano say so
this<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.680> our<00:02:04.890> SIM<00:02:05.250> card<00:02:05.490> tray<00:02:05.610> tool<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.119> you

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
this is our SIM card tray tool as you

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.210 
this is our SIM card tray tool as you
can<00:02:06.509> see<00:02:06.689> here<00:02:07.310> yes

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
can see here yes

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:22.750 
can see here yes
put<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:13.120> single<00:02:15.760> like<00:02:16.760> this

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:33.820 

so

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.970 

like<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:37.330> for<00:02:38.330> having<00:02:38.660> true<00:02:39.560> SIM<00:02:39.710> cards

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
like this and for having true SIM cards

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.220 
like this and for having true SIM cards
who<00:02:40.070> can<00:02:40.220> put<00:02:40.400> another<00:02:40.580> one<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:41.600> slot<00:02:41.930> and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
who can put another one this slot and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.690 
who can put another one this slot and
now<00:02:42.430> just<00:02:43.430> put<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.420> back<00:02:44.980> see<00:02:45.980> how<00:02:46.370> i<00:02:46.670> am

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
now just put it back see how i am

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.940 
now just put it back see how i am
putting<00:02:46.760> this<00:02:47.360> back<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:48.170> silicon<00:02:48.560> part<00:02:48.800> is

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
putting this back the silicon part is

00:02:48.950 --> 00:03:00.280 
putting this back the silicon part is
upwards<00:02:49.930> so
