I've<00:00:00.240> been<00:00:00.450> testing<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.199> microsoft<00:00:01.709> lumia

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
I've been testing the microsoft lumia

535<00:00:03.049> windows<00:00:04.049> phone<00:00:04.350> with<00:00:05.040> windows<00:00:05.490> 10

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
535 windows phone with windows 10

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.810 
535 windows phone with windows 10
pre-installed<00:00:06.720> for<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> while<00:00:07.710> now<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.250> I

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
pre-installed for a while now and I

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.549 
pre-installed for a while now and I
think<00:00:08.849> it's<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.840> great<00:00:10.110> phone<00:00:10.559> quite<00:00:11.130> cheap<00:00:11.969> and

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
think it's a great phone quite cheap and

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.160 
think it's a great phone quite cheap and
feels<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.740> bit<00:00:13.860> plastic<00:00:14.460> though<00:00:14.670> but<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.750> feels

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
feels a bit plastic though but it feels

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.240 
feels a bit plastic though but it feels
a<00:00:16.560> bit<00:00:16.830> like<00:00:17.539> Nokia's<00:00:18.539> design<00:00:19.289> Nokia's<00:00:19.949> build

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
a bit like Nokia's design Nokia's build

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.120 
a bit like Nokia's design Nokia's build
quality<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:21.029> don't<00:00:21.390> like<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.619> phone<00:00:22.920> has

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
quality I don't like that this phone has

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.210 
quality I don't like that this phone has
a<00:00:23.220> detachable<00:00:24.320> backside<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.800> replaceable

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
a detachable backside and a replaceable

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.929 
a detachable backside and a replaceable
battery<00:00:26.550> though<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.510> prefer<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.740> a

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
battery though I prefer to have a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.450 
battery though I prefer to have a
unibody<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.539> can't<00:00:30.810> open<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:32.250> so

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
unibody that you can't open and have so

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.389 
unibody that you can't open and have so
few<00:00:32.880> porch<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:33.930> long<00:00:34.140> as<00:00:34.320> possible<00:00:34.860> I

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
few porch and so long as possible I

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.030 
few porch and so long as possible I
don't<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.570> battery<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
don't like to have a battery that you

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.610 
don't like to have a battery that you
can<00:00:38.309> change<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.899> think<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.350> size<00:00:40.590> is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
can change and so I think the size is

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.240 
can change and so I think the size is
perfect<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.850> 5-inch<00:00:42.540> display<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
perfect it's a 5-inch display but the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.389 
perfect it's a 5-inch display but the
sharp<00:00:44.910> edges<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.870> front<00:00:46.320> feels<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.950> bit<00:00:47.100> too

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
sharp edges on the front feels a bit too

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.959 
sharp edges on the front feels a bit too
plastic<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.860> back<00:00:50.129> side<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.730> phone

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
plastic but the back side of the phone

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.000 
plastic but the back side of the phone
feels<00:00:51.300> quite<00:00:51.660> nice<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.289> your<00:00:52.320> hand<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.800> it's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
feels quite nice in your hand and it's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.430 
feels quite nice in your hand and it's
very<00:00:53.250> nice<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.440> 5-megapixel

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
very nice to have a 5-megapixel

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.049 
very nice to have a 5-megapixel
front-facing<00:00:56.219> camera<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:58.140> vlogs

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
front-facing camera so you can do vlogs

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.439 
front-facing camera so you can do vlogs
really<00:01:00.059> good<00:01:00.210> blogs<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.930> thousand<00:01:01.410> ATP<00:01:01.859> but

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
really good blogs in thousand ATP but

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.219 
really good blogs in thousand ATP but
the<00:01:03.449> camera<00:01:04.110> app<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.739> Windows<00:01:05.549> 10<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.420> quite

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the camera app on Windows 10 is quite

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.530 
the camera app on Windows 10 is quite
buggy<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.430> example<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
buggy you can for example not see the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.530 
buggy you can for example not see the
buttons<00:01:10.340> completely<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> bottom<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
buttons completely at the bottom of the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.460 
buttons completely at the bottom of the
camera<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.700> because

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
camera so I think this is because

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.580 
camera so I think this is because
Windows<00:01:16.470> 10<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.799> buggy<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.540> phone<00:01:18.930> maybe

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
Windows 10 is buggy and this phone maybe

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.450 
Windows 10 is buggy and this phone maybe
it's<00:01:19.799> not<00:01:19.920> meant<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.630> run<00:01:21.630> Windows<00:01:22.170> 10<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:23.100> we

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it's not meant to run Windows 10 so we

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
it's not meant to run Windows 10 so we
will<00:01:23.610> see<00:01:23.790> if<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.060> will<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.570> better<00:01:25.110> when

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
will see if that will be better when

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.160 
will see if that will be better when
Windows<00:01:26.100> 10<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.430> released<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.960> like

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
Windows 10 is released but I really like

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.520 
Windows 10 is released but I really like
the<00:01:28.470> UI<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.400> Windows<00:01:29.970> 10<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the UI and Windows 10 I like the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.240 
the UI and Windows 10 I like the
operating<00:01:32.189> system<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.329> very<00:01:33.659> snappy<00:01:34.439> no

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
operating system and it's very snappy no

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.760 
operating system and it's very snappy no
lag<00:01:35.579> at<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.390> some<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> apps<00:01:37.140> takes<00:01:37.530> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
lag at all but some of the apps takes a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.340 
lag at all but some of the apps takes a
while<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.250> start<00:01:38.640> though<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:39.990> that's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
while to start though and I think that's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.889 
while to start though and I think that's
because<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> quite<00:01:41.820> low<00:01:42.299> end<00:01:42.600> phone

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
because this is a quite low end phone

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.090 
because this is a quite low end phone
with<00:01:43.229> no<00:01:43.470> fast<00:01:44.280> cpu<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.360> not<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.200> much<00:01:46.229> RAM<00:01:46.829> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
with no fast cpu and not so much RAM and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.819 
with no fast cpu and not so much RAM and
to<00:01:47.790> me<00:01:47.939> that's<00:01:48.210> quite<00:01:48.540> annoying<00:01:48.960> because<00:01:49.380> I

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
to me that's quite annoying because I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.310 
to me that's quite annoying because I
don't<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.700> waiting<00:01:51.570> time<00:01:51.869> when<00:01:52.140> I'm

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
don't like to have waiting time when I'm

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.280 
don't like to have waiting time when I'm
will<00:01:52.979> start<00:01:53.310> them<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:54.600> example<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.079> my

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
will start them up for example on my

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.130 
will start them up for example on my
iphone<00:01:55.680> 6<00:01:55.920> all<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.490> app<00:01:56.850> starts<00:01:57.180> instantly

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
iphone 6 all the app starts instantly

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.889 
iphone 6 all the app starts instantly
with<00:01:58.500> no<00:01:58.700> waiting<00:01:59.700> time<00:01:59.729> I<00:02:00.180> really<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.659> what

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
with no waiting time I really like what

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.660 
with no waiting time I really like what
Microsoft<00:02:01.439> are<00:02:01.590> doing<00:02:01.920> at<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> moment<00:02:02.280> I

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
Microsoft are doing at the moment I

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.850 
Microsoft are doing at the moment I
really<00:02:02.969> liked<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.390> new<00:02:03.600> combing<00:02:04.110> Windows<00:02:04.530> 10

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
really liked a new combing Windows 10

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.690 
really liked a new combing Windows 10
and<00:02:05.329> that<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.659> use<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> mobile<00:02:07.350> phone<00:02:07.890> as<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
and that you can use a mobile phone as a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.660 
and that you can use a mobile phone as a
computer<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.690> connect<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.979> display

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
computer if you connect it to display

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.950 
computer if you connect it to display
and<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.150> on

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
and so on

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.620 
and so on
really<00:02:13.230> like<00:02:13.410> these<00:02:13.700> ideas<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:15.000> Microsoft

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
really like these ideas that Microsoft

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.690 
really like these ideas that Microsoft
have<00:02:15.840> about<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.440> future<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.250> their

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
have about the future and so their

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.910 
have about the future and so their
vision<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.570> hopefully<00:02:19.020> all<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.470> will<00:02:19.530> be<00:02:19.890> a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
vision so hopefully all this will be a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.940 
vision so hopefully all this will be a
reality<00:02:20.190> too<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.330> not<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.710> fantasy<00:02:22.710> and

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
reality too so it's not the fantasy and

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.150 
reality too so it's not the fantasy and
Microsoft<00:02:23.610> fantasy<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.330> think<00:02:24.750> if<00:02:25.020> they<00:02:25.590> can

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
Microsoft fantasy I think if they can

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.810 
Microsoft fantasy I think if they can
deliver<00:02:26.970> what<00:02:27.360> they<00:02:27.390> promise<00:02:27.600> then<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:29.520> will

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
deliver what they promise then this will

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.540 
deliver what they promise then this will
be<00:02:30.090> really<00:02:30.810> interesting<00:02:31.710> ok<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.520> was

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
be really interesting ok so that was

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.790 
be really interesting ok so that was
some<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.060> my<00:02:33.240> thoughts<00:02:33.480> about<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.110> Microsoft

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
some of my thoughts about the Microsoft

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.360 
some of my thoughts about the Microsoft
Lumia<00:02:35.600> 535<00:02:36.600> windows<00:02:37.410> phone<00:02:37.830> okay<00:02:38.520> bye
