00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.879
 in side 

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:12.410
 the champix tiger hello very good 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.509
 kids that happens I'm step and here 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.970
 we are in a new video of gta 5 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.160
 guys and today I come to show you a 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.830
 way to be able to teleport by 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.359
 the whole map is worth this way to 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.460
 our transport as it was 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.230
 saying works for all 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.869
 consoles worth works current equipment 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.849
 playstation 4 playstation3 and xbox 360 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.920
 here as always my videos 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.110
 they run over I do not know how I do it but 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.160
 good guys what we need what 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.470
 first I will put here the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.740
 location of the map and then what 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.840
 what we need is a friend and a 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.460
 bike is worth that yes we need a friend 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.500
 but you are going to see that we can have 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.560
 transport us anywhere in the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.330
 map in just a few seconds then 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.800
 once we have our friend 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.140
 mounted the bike we are going to have to come 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.360
 to this location and go through this 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.550
 wall is worth if at the moment it leaves us 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.990
 like me, you have to do it 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.449
 little bit down is wrong to go testing 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.350
 here as you can see there are some files 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.450
 because he has not just entered 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.479
 but it's pretty cool pretty this 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.250
 way and there was a long time ago 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.240
 I do not know for sure you will already know 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.619
 but it's very good as you see we jump and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.840
 we appear here as in the middle of nowhere 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.729
 and all we have to do now is a 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.710
 bit complicated at the beginning is 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.750
 indicate that is to put the motorcycle in the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.210
 where we want to go and throw the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.039
 body backwards it is worth looking at how 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.600
 is moving our little arrow by the 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.280
 map I wanted to go to my great angel 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.890
 second grace I was pretty 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.929
 pretty far away and see how fast 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.520
 we are moving once we are already 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.920
 close the only thing we have to do is 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.080
 get off the bike and as you see 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.539
 if we appear on the map I'm super 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.280
 super close to the garage is a trick that 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.140
 I loved it, it's a curiosity 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.090
 quite pretty big and now I'm going 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.860
 to teach how I do as I go to another 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.170
 location this time I wanted 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.970
 try to go then near the base 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.560
 military now you are going to see that I approached 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.690
 It is also worth a little bit 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.369
 at the beginning so direct the motorcycle not 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.259
 it's easy we have to take a little bit the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.549
 direction and then already throw the body 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.440
 backwards and you will see that the arrow 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.840
 our arrow that marks on the map 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.720
 It starts to go very fast, it's worth fixing 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.730
 and they were trying to take the position 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.980
 good inclining very fixed how fast 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.069
 that the arrow moves right now in 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.720
 only about 20 seconds a thing like that 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.750
 I will go then near the military base 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.060
 that normally, well, I would not know 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.340
 ten minutes five or ten minutes worth 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.049
 now you're going to notice that when I'm 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.209
 Well, I'm going to tell the friend 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.489
 bat or be me under me and then and 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.989
 we appear on the map I have to say 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.450
 that this is pretty good 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.799
 for long distances you are going to flip 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.930
 see how he is saying I have taken 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.390
 about 20 seconds and now I'm going to 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.480
 show on the map all the way that 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.069
 I have done here I tell the friend to get off 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.079
 I mean, I'm sorry, I forgive him 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.420
 I think it also serves but good 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.160
 I usually get low and it's worth here 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.140
 We were close because I also 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.200
 I say it costs a little at the beginning 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.440
 handle it, I'm low and as you can see we're already 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.390
 very very close to the military base I'm going 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.970
 to teach the time that we have been 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.549
 been like 20 seconds the piece that we have 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.230
 done on the map is brutal they are like 6 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.660
 kilometers that what I say is more or 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.380
 minus 10 minutes like it 's guys here 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.480
 we're 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.630
 and I'm going to show you where we've been 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.580
 party that is brutal and nothing else arrived 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.920
 I hope you like pop the button 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.410
 by this tricked by this piece of 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.640
 curiosity and nothing else we see ourselves in the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.640
 next video goodbye
