00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:23.039
 The people are passing you on this. 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.890
 second example is the same idea of 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.490
 harmony, let's use the fifth too. 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.309
 however I'll add more information 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.250
 here would be the independent chromatism 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.340
 which would be this descending chromatic 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.670
 I take the minor chord I want to get 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.480
 to a reconciliation agreement and 9th here 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.090
 What are you going to do? I'll think of a house. 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.480
 after the challenge that in the case of the note me 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.440
 the mall the rest extended until you reach the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.440
 hair for example 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.210
 now I want to get in the sunshine agreement 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.890
 think a house above ground 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.630
 he already was what we call 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:17.500
 chromatic recipe is just the system not only 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:22.750
 now I go for a toothpick of beauty 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.510
 So stay put, let's suppose that I 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.649
 I want to go, I do not know everything there. 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:36.399
 I want to go pro profaa half pound is 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:40.229
 I 'm not going to pick up the note 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.229
 after the false scenario there is a single couple 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.310
 so I'll pass on to you 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.570
 the example now we will use 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:54.550
 then the fifth and the chromatism also in the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.789
 In case what happens is you do not stay 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.789
 like this 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.769
 now make slow for you can 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.769
 to accompany the tablature 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
 is 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.970
 then in this second example you can 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:00.250
 see in what I do the fifth here in case 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:04.150
 of the false extension in the case of a rope 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.810
 up and turn it back on if a 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.120
 home does not do the chromatic with a sim 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.310
 because he already own the fifth of the accord 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.310
 which generates this chromatism for example 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.470
 no need to put another 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.630
 note why we did not have both 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.970
 move like the others chord 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.390
 so in the second example now people 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.740
 already has the same idea of ​​the fifth 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.110
 only now the diplomatic approach 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.250
 It's not going to be more downward and it's going to be 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:39.370
 be ascended for example in there minor 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.490
 I want to get back and give me what I want 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:48.300
 I'll play a string a note 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.300
 before arriving at the straight note for example 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.960
 do you want to go to the sun now play a note? 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:04:00.490
 before reaching the sun a note arrives 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:04.720
 easy goal scored a note where 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.500
 he even came to join himself in a single note 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:13.040
 before 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:16.810
 and so I'll play for you to understand 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.810
 that's how it's going to be 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.490
 is 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.200
 now I'll slow it down for you 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.200
 accompany with the height table 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.349
 in one 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.750
 then guys will're going to you 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.060
 now in that fourth example the junction that 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.260
 everything that I have been to you today being 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.210
 approximation with the fifth approximation 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.190
 descending and ascending chromatic 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.830
 will see that it will have enough movement 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.360
 there will be very interesting is 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.480
 passing to you now let's go 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.480
 go along 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.560
 So people, how have you seen that you have? 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.850
 enough movement 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.860
 then I will make you lentinha 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.860
 follow up and let's go 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.169
 is 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.050
 so folks 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.090
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.970
 next class but we will also 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.640
 some ideas and the beige oc where we 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.230
 Let's get the scales you play not only 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.260
 the jazz but also some things of 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.420
 blues some things bossa nova samba 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.550
 And how did I say at the beginning of class? 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.770
 so I hope you have enjoyed a 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.770
 hug and see you in the next class
