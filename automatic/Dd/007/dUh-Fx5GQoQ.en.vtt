that we prepared what happens is why I'm

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.380 
that we prepared what happens is why I'm
doing<00:05:26.220> this<00:05:26.340> in<00:05:26.460> two<00:05:26.550> layers<00:05:26.790> is<00:05:27.060> that<00:05:27.270> the

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
doing this in two layers is that the

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.000 
doing this in two layers is that the
cheese<00:05:27.660> in<00:05:27.930> this<00:05:28.050> mixture<00:05:28.350> really<00:05:28.680> helps<00:05:28.920> the
