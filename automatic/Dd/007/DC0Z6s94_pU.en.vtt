00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.980
 and Ireland the next video that you 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.680
 I will present is about strange clouds 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.760
 in the sky of Dublin on March 15 , 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.100
 2014 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.410
 many people alerted the media 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.300
 about this strange phenomenon and many 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.720
 they went out to say that they were 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.720
 UFOs 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.910
 Unfortunately the lack of 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.560
 knowledge in natural phenomena 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.520
 makes us always interpret them from a 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.520
 paranormal form 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.220
 these clouds that we see in these 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.320
 photographs are not UFOs but a 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.540
 phenomenon called lenticular cloud 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.070
 next I will explain what is 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.950
 is this phenomenon of sitting in Dublin 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.620
 a lenticular cloud is a cloud of form 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.420
 lenticular as indicated by its name or 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.970
 of saucer or convergent lens 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.400
 although under certain conditions 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.040
 lenticular clouds can be formed in 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.340
 flat places the most common thing is that what 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.080
 do near mountainous areas between 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.340
 the mountaineers these clouds are 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.009
 considered as a harbinger of storm 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.679
 The first thing that is needed is a mass of 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.780
 air moving towards a mountain to 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.719
 a speed of about 30 kilometers per 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.210
 hour and the second is an investment 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.189
 Thermal which reaches 46 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.229
 kilometers in height and that begins 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.209
 near the top 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.280
 airline pilots avoid them 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.500
 due to the turbulence created in the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.390
 rotor systems 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.620
 these types of clouds have been the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.520
 causing several assumptions 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.320
 UFO sightings around the world 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.540
 then I will leave several photos 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.540
 of 9 lenticular taken in Dublin 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.290
 to conclude these clouds are not UFOs 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:32.040
 but a phenomenon called lenticular cloud 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.040
 look for yourselves
