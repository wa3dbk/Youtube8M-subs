00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello how you will welcome them I'm going to 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.400
 present a new job that is 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.530
 modeling today we are going to devote ourselves to 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.369
 work on the little arms of the 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.170
 dolls so pay close attention 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:21.050
 because we're going to be details about 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.109
 details to be able to achieve expressiveness 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.289
 in fingers in hands and arms so that 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.890
 your work is perfect and with 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.890
 a lot of naturalness 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.730
 here I have a portion of dough first 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.530
 what we have to do is knead in a 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.860
 moment for it to be very smooth 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.440
 and make it tender 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.910
 you can work with porcelain 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.790
 cold or with modeling paste 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.020
 then let's make a good ball 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.610
 couple so you do not have any crack 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.930
 if you are working with 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 cracks the work is going to be messy and 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.610
 it will not look good 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.600
 once we make the ball we start 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.710
 to stretch the dough and we will try to 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.550
 that in a sector is thinner and in the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.290
 another a little more chubby for this I'm going to 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.890
 try to use the palm of your hand 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.620
 so that no fingers are marked here 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.610
 I'm going to cut a piece because it's going to 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.850
 left over 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.880
 then we have fine delgadito this 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.500
 sector and more chubby this would be the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.810
 top arm 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.540
 once I have done this I am going to 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.350
 embark 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.980
 near the little hand what would be the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.310
 doll I will start to spin all the 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.250
 piece with the little finger I 'm not just going to 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.030
 do this but I'm going to lower a 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.210
 side and the other so that it does not form a 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.600
 well directly on the wrist 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.910
 after this I'm going to press this 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.910
 part because it would be the hand 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.030
 this would be the little fist 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.480
 I'm going to take a little scissors and I'm going to do 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.650
 a cut at this height this is the cut 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.310
 of the famous number 1 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.370
 to mark the protrusion of the finger 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.370
 Fat 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.380
 all the cuts that I make 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.319
 then I'm going to accommodate them so that 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.480
 you notice the cut of the scissors you 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.370
 notice that I'm crushing so that 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.040
 this sector is also not too 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.950
 beautiful 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:55.150
 or that is where I am giving shape to the finger 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:59.189
 fat once we have done this 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.560
 let's continue with the scissors cutting 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:05.470
 first this sector in the middle 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.010
 you notice that the cut reaches 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.950
 this height I do not go higher because I 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.739
 What I'm doing is cutting these 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.550
 two fingers there and leave the part of 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.920
 above the sleeve 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:25.900
 once I do this, I cut it again 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.900
 here in two and here in two so I'll 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.190
 generate the four fingers each of 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.750
 these fingers are going to be retouched because 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.000
 if you do not keep the vertices straight 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.900
 then the tips will be 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.150
 untidy if possible helped me with 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.640
 an aesthetic or with some element an 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.700
 little more finite to be able to enter 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.660
 in the fingers 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.970
 all the prolixity of this hand goes to 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.440
 depend on the time they spend for 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.760
 make it 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.040
 notice that the index finger I can 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.790
 Stretch a little bit more to 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.060
 start to open it and here I'm going to do 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.950
 a container to the inside of the hand 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.370
 so that the fingers can start 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.370
 close 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.530
 modified the little doll if it is 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.590
 that got bigger and here I can 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.340
 make a pinch that would be the part of 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.910
 here by the hand 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:34.690
 once I have done the fingers 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:38.350
 and the little hand is almost finished I will 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.200
 go to the elbow the elbow will depend 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.110
 of the size of the wrist too but 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.050
 remember that how does it always come to the 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.590
 waist of a human body so 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:54.670
 you control those dimensions for 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.880
 to be able to generate a suitable wrist size 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.670
 and symmetrical so it's not a long arm 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.910
 short arm and that is untidy efe a 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.540
 there I will start bending and pinching 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.540
 the code eh 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.660
 we have human forearm and the part of 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:19.420
 up here is where I 'm going to 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:23.710
 cut in such an angle way 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.800
 to then place it on the wrist and 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.030
 Do not bulge or leave a shoulder 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.030
 Too big 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.280
 thank you very much for accompanying me this has 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.260
 been a new explanation of how to do 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.160
 a little arm so we can do the 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.640
 dolls and decorate our beautiful cakes 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.980
 I wait for you in the next meeting 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.870
 remember to subscribe like this when I go up 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.510
 videos you will receive them 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.900
 automatically until the next many 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.900
 Thank you
