00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.050 
right as you can see the ground has
gotten<00:02:51.590> dry<00:02:51.829> here<00:02:53.200> protected<00:02:54.200> from<00:02:54.469> the<00:02:55.060> rain

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
gotten dry here protected from the rain

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.170 
gotten dry here protected from the rain
and<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.299> wind<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:01.370> probably<00:03:01.670> haven't<00:03:01.849> really

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
and the wind you probably haven't really

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.099 
and the wind you probably haven't really
noticed<00:03:02.420> yet<00:03:02.870> but<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:04.250> is<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.459> lake<00:03:08.049> it<00:03:09.049> is

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
noticed yet but that is a lake it is

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.309 
noticed yet but that is a lake it is
water<00:03:09.799> coming<00:03:10.189> from<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:11.319> underground

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
water coming from the underground

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.699 
water coming from the underground
aquifer<00:03:13.299> so<00:03:14.299> it's<00:03:14.450> not<00:03:14.599> rain<00:03:14.930> water<00:03:15.200> dribbling

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
aquifer so it's not rain water dribbling

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.039 
aquifer so it's not rain water dribbling
down<00:03:15.920> from<00:03:16.280> up<00:03:16.879> there<00:03:17.239> or<00:03:17.420> something<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:18.049> is

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
down from up there or something it is

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.220 
down from up there or something it is
water<00:03:21.049> coming<00:03:21.530> from<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.950> vast<00:03:22.280> underground

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
water coming from the vast underground

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.849 
water coming from the vast underground
network<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:25.870> aquifers<00:03:26.870> under<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:27.470> island

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
network of of aquifers under the island

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.619 
network of of aquifers under the island
coming<00:03:28.849> from<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.150> rains<00:03:29.359> of<00:03:29.599> course<00:03:31.629> coming

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629

down<00:03:32.750> through<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.049> center<00:03:33.260> of<00:03:33.319> the<00:03:33.409> island

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
down through the center of the island

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.289 
down through the center of the island
because<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.129> fresh<00:03:34.370> water<00:03:34.609> it's<00:03:35.090> not

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
because it is fresh water it's not

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.390 
because it is fresh water it's not
seawater<00:03:35.810> even<00:03:36.530> though<00:03:36.650> we're<00:03:36.799> very<00:03:36.829> close<00:03:37.189> to

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
seawater even though we're very close to

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.170 
seawater even though we're very close to
the<00:03:37.489> sea<00:03:37.669> here<00:03:37.909> or<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.299> ocean<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:41.060> is

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
the sea here or the ocean and it is

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.699 
the sea here or the ocean and it is
incredibly<00:03:42.430> pure<00:03:43.430> water<00:03:43.819> and<00:03:44.329> a<00:03:45.049> very<00:03:45.079> very

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
incredibly pure water and a very very

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.830 
incredibly pure water and a very very
refreshing<00:03:46.510> swim<00:03:47.739> which<00:03:49.180> if<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.329> was<00:03:50.479> up<00:03:50.599> for<00:03:50.810> it

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
refreshing swim which if I was up for it

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.439 
refreshing swim which if I was up for it
this<00:03:51.199> would<00:03:51.379> be<00:03:51.409> a<00:03:51.530> good<00:03:52.000> good<00:03:53.000> night<00:03:53.060> time<00:03:53.359> to

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
this would be a good good night time to

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:54.580 
this would be a good good night time to
take<00:03:53.569> a<00:03:53.599> swim<00:03:53.840> but<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:54.079> just<00:03:54.199> kind<00:03:54.409> of<00:03:54.440> don't

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
take a swim but I just kind of don't

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.580 
take a swim but I just kind of don't
feel<00:03:54.650> like<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:55.280> bother<00:03:55.489> is<00:03:56.319> getting<00:03:57.319> wet<00:03:57.500> and

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
feel like the bother is getting wet and

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.339 
feel like the bother is getting wet and
everything<00:03:57.979> at<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.400> moment<00:03:58.430> but<00:03:59.290> it's<00:04:00.290> a

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
everything at the moment but it's a

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:01.869 
everything at the moment but it's a
little<00:04:00.560> bit<00:04:00.799> cool<00:04:01.040> I<00:04:01.069> think<00:04:01.310> it's<00:04:01.549> cooler<00:04:01.849> than

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
little bit cool I think it's cooler than

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.309 
little bit cool I think it's cooler than
the<00:04:02.299> ocean<00:04:02.629> water<00:04:03.729> but<00:04:04.810> it's<00:04:05.810> very<00:04:05.989> refreshing

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
the ocean water but it's very refreshing

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.500 
the ocean water but it's very refreshing
you<00:04:07.069> can't<00:04:07.340> really<00:04:07.609> see<00:04:07.909> in<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.180> video

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
you can't really see in this video

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.809 
you can't really see in this video
what's<00:04:08.810> going<00:04:09.049> on<00:04:09.260> here<00:04:09.560> not<00:04:10.280> enough<00:04:10.549> light

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
what's going on here not enough light

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.050 
what's going on here not enough light
but<00:04:11.319> I'm<00:04:12.319> pointing<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.159> camera<00:04:13.310> right<00:04:13.669> now<00:04:13.819> at

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
but I'm pointing the camera right now at

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.649 
but I'm pointing the camera right now at
a<00:04:14.359> lake<00:04:14.629> so<00:04:15.349> just<00:04:15.620> imagine<00:04:16.239> water<00:04:17.239> let<00:04:17.449> me<00:04:17.539> see

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:17.659 
a lake so just imagine water let me see

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.029 
a lake so just imagine water let me see
if<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:17.840> can<00:04:17.959> get<00:04:18.079> another<00:04:18.260> perspective<00:04:18.590> that

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
if I can get another perspective that

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.009 
if I can get another perspective that
might<00:04:19.220> that<00:04:19.909> might<00:04:19.970> do<00:04:20.389> a<00:04:20.419> little<00:04:20.630> better<00:04:20.900> job

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
might that might do a little better job

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:28.689 
might that might do a little better job
here<00:04:25.599> so<00:04:26.599> this<00:04:26.810> is<00:04:27.020> I'm<00:04:27.199> I'm<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.620> foot<00:04:27.979> away<00:04:28.099> two

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
here so this is I'm I'm a foot away two

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.770 
here so this is I'm I'm a foot away two
feet<00:04:28.940> away<00:04:29.030> from<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.449> water<00:04:29.659> right<00:04:29.840> now<00:04:29.870> and

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
feet away from the water right now and

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.430 
feet away from the water right now and
the<00:04:32.780> lake<00:04:33.020> heads<00:04:33.320> out<00:04:34.840> going<00:04:35.840> that<00:04:36.080> direction

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
the lake heads out going that direction

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.939 
the lake heads out going that direction
and<00:04:36.800> then<00:04:36.949> the<00:04:36.979> cave<00:04:37.699> walls<00:04:38.060> come<00:04:38.479> down<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:39.800> it

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
and then the cave walls come down to it

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.100 
and then the cave walls come down to it
so<00:04:40.159> there's<00:04:40.340> a<00:04:40.400> big<00:04:40.639> sloping<00:04:41.270> there<00:04:41.870> you<00:04:41.960> can

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
so there's a big sloping there you can

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.860 
so there's a big sloping there you can
see<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:43.460> opening<00:04:43.759> of<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:43.970> cave<00:04:44.150> you<00:04:44.720> can

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
see the the opening of the cave you can

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.379 
see the the opening of the cave you can
see<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.110> sloping<00:04:45.560> down<00:04:45.740> like<00:04:45.919> this<00:04:46.159> it<00:04:46.909> slopes

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
see it sloping down like this it slopes

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.790 
see it sloping down like this it slopes
down<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:49.070> then<00:04:49.490> about

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
down and then about

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.730 
down and then about
thirty<00:04:51.430> forty<00:04:51.849> feet<00:04:52.030> out<00:04:52.270> there<00:04:52.300> is<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.530> cave

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
thirty forty feet out there is the cave

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.379 
thirty forty feet out there is the cave
wall

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
wall

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.089 
wall
and<00:04:55.630> then<00:04:55.840> and<00:04:56.169> then<00:04:56.319> there's<00:04:56.530> an<00:04:56.650> overhang

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
and then and then there's an overhang

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.460 
and then and then there's an overhang
and<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.370> goes<00:04:57.550> under<00:04:58.210> and<00:04:58.630> then<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:58.990> then

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
and it goes under and then and then

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.620 
and it goes under and then and then
there's<00:04:59.620> a<00:04:59.710> gap<00:04:59.919> of<00:05:00.220> maybe<00:05:00.789> six<00:05:01.150> to<00:05:01.270> eight<00:05:01.360> feet

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
there's a gap of maybe six to eight feet

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.629 
there's a gap of maybe six to eight feet
of<00:05:01.810> air<00:05:02.020> between<00:05:02.289> the<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:03.220> lake<00:05:03.520> and<00:05:03.819> the<00:05:05.639> the

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
of air between the the lake and the the

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.790 
of air between the the lake and the the
rock<00:05:06.849> wall<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.660> so<00:05:08.289> you<00:05:08.380> can<00:05:08.530> continue

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
rock wall and so you can continue

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.430 
rock wall and so you can continue
swimming<00:05:10.410> on<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.440> lake<00:05:12.280> there<00:05:12.639> under<00:05:13.240> that

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
swimming on the lake there under that

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.290 
swimming on the lake there under that
that<00:05:14.440> that<00:05:16.620> overhang<00:05:17.620> and<00:05:17.940> then<00:05:18.940> you<00:05:19.060> kind<00:05:19.240> of

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
that that overhang and then you kind of

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.180 
that that overhang and then you kind of
end<00:05:19.479> up<00:05:19.599> in<00:05:19.720> a<00:05:19.810> little<00:05:19.930> tunnel<00:05:20.319> that's<00:05:20.830> that's

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
end up in a little tunnel that's that's

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.850 
end up in a little tunnel that's that's
partly<00:05:21.520> submerged<00:05:21.789> but<00:05:22.240> partly<00:05:22.599> open<00:05:22.930> to<00:05:23.740> the

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
partly submerged but partly open to the

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.920 
partly submerged but partly open to the
air<00:05:24.009> and<00:05:24.430> so<00:05:25.000> you<00:05:25.090> can<00:05:25.240> you<00:05:25.419> know<00:05:25.509> you<00:05:25.569> can<00:05:25.659> have

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
air and so you can you know you can have

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.210 
air and so you can you know you can have
your<00:05:26.050> head<00:05:26.169> above<00:05:26.349> water<00:05:26.409> and<00:05:26.830> then<00:05:26.979> you<00:05:27.069> and

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
your head above water and then you and

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.950 
your head above water and then you and
then<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.759> kind<00:05:27.970> of<00:05:28.030> goes<00:05:28.539> through<00:05:28.690> a<00:05:28.720> tunnel

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
then it kind of goes through a tunnel

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.469 
then it kind of goes through a tunnel
then<00:05:29.139> opens<00:05:29.500> up<00:05:29.650> into<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:29.979> slightly<00:05:30.479> bigger

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
then opens up into a slightly bigger

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:37.980 
then opens up into a slightly bigger
space<00:05:31.930> on<00:05:32.759> a<00:05:34.860> good<00:05:35.860> sunny<00:05:36.190> day<00:05:36.460> like<00:05:36.750> if<00:05:37.750> the

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
space on a good sunny day like if the

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.469 
space on a good sunny day like if the
Suns<00:05:38.259> in<00:05:38.409> the<00:05:38.530> right<00:05:38.680> spot<00:05:39.270> coming<00:05:40.270> down

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
Suns in the right spot coming down

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.719 
Suns in the right spot coming down
through<00:05:40.720> that<00:05:40.930> opening<00:05:41.349> up<00:05:41.500> there<00:05:41.710> in<00:05:42.069> the

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
through that opening up there in the

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.309 
through that opening up there in the
right<00:05:42.909> way<00:05:43.090> then<00:05:43.300> it<00:05:43.449> got<00:05:43.569> at<00:05:43.720> shines<00:05:44.020> into

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
right way then it got at shines into

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.159 
right way then it got at shines into
there<00:05:44.580> in<00:05:45.580> such<00:05:45.880> a<00:05:45.909> way<00:05:46.120> that<00:05:46.150> it<00:05:46.419> brightens<00:05:47.020> it

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
there in such a way that it brightens it

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.740 
there in such a way that it brightens it
up<00:05:47.229> a<00:05:47.349> little<00:05:47.440> bit<00:05:47.680> more<00:05:47.830> and<00:05:48.190> so<00:05:48.759> I<00:05:48.789> think<00:05:49.509> it

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
up a little bit more and so I think it

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.200 
up a little bit more and so I think it
kind<00:05:50.139> of<00:05:50.169> makes<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.470> water<00:05:50.759> look<00:05:51.759> more<00:05:51.970> blue

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
kind of makes the water look more blue

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.420 
kind of makes the water look more blue
or<00:05:52.389> something<00:05:52.690> you<00:05:53.020> can<00:05:53.169> see<00:05:53.380> see<00:05:54.159> through<00:05:54.370> the

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
or something you can see see through the

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.510 
or something you can see see through the
water<00:05:54.610> a<00:05:54.940> lot<00:05:55.180> better<00:05:55.889> definitely<00:05:56.889> a<00:05:56.949> really

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
water a lot better definitely a really

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.909 
water a lot better definitely a really
cool<00:05:57.789> spot<00:05:59.039> and<00:06:00.300> nice<00:06:01.300> to<00:06:01.449> have<00:06:01.599> it<00:06:01.830> to<00:06:02.830> myself

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
cool spot and nice to have it to myself

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.820 
cool spot and nice to have it to myself
often<00:06:03.820> times<00:06:04.000> there's<00:06:04.240> a<00:06:04.300> couple<00:06:05.259> people<00:06:05.469> here

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
often times there's a couple people here

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.620 
often times there's a couple people here
but<00:06:06.750> wish<00:06:07.750> you<00:06:07.840> could<00:06:07.960> see<00:06:08.139> the<00:06:08.759> the<00:06:09.759> lake

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
but wish you could see the the lake

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.499 
but wish you could see the the lake
itself<00:06:10.990> to<00:06:11.229> get<00:06:11.349> the<00:06:11.940> get<00:06:12.940> the<00:06:12.969> full<00:06:13.210> effect

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509 
itself to get the get the full effect

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.230 
itself to get the get the full effect
here<00:06:13.539> but<00:06:13.870> I<00:06:14.050> guess<00:06:14.229> we'll<00:06:14.409> just<00:06:14.440> have<00:06:14.710> to<00:06:14.919> come

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
here but I guess we'll just have to come

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.920 
here but I guess we'll just have to come
all<00:06:16.240> right<00:06:16.389> take<00:06:16.659> it<00:06:16.690> easy
