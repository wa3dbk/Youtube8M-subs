have a old school tuner that's on the
floor<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.659> I<00:01:11.690> have<00:01:11.869> from<00:01:12.049> Fender<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.680> it's

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
floor that I have from Fender and it's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.130 
floor that I have from Fender and it's
hard<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.430> see<00:01:13.640> but<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:14.240> makes<00:01:14.540> it<00:01:14.690> much<00:01:14.840> more

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
hard to see but this makes it much more

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.590 
hard to see but this makes it much more
simpler<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.010> of<00:01:16.670> course<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.060> tutor<00:01:17.299> itself

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
simpler and of course the tutor itself

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.080 
simpler and of course the tutor itself
works<00:01:17.810> very<00:01:18.080> well<00:01:18.220> well<00:01:19.220> um

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
works very well well um

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.149 
works very well well um
the<00:01:20.330> things<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:20.750> I<00:01:20.780> don't<00:01:21.260> like<00:01:21.470> about<00:01:21.650> it<00:01:22.010> is

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
the things that I don't like about it is

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.789 
the things that I don't like about it is
its<00:01:22.490> swivel<00:01:22.970> action<00:01:23.150> it's<00:01:23.780> not<00:01:24.049> bad<00:01:24.350> in<00:01:24.530> range

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
its swivel action it's not bad in range

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.490 
its swivel action it's not bad in range
but<00:01:25.250> depending<00:01:25.729> on<00:01:25.850> how<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.260> hold<00:01:27.260> your

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
but depending on how you hold your

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.530 
but depending on how you hold your
ukulele<00:01:28.010> how<00:01:28.189> you<00:01:28.250> position<00:01:28.880> it<00:01:29.000> you're<00:01:29.390> going

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
ukulele how you position it you're going

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.170 
ukulele how you position it you're going
to<00:01:29.600> have<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.990> use<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:30.619> swivel<00:01:31.280> in<00:01:31.460> order<00:01:32.060> to

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
to have to use that swivel in order to

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.730 
to have to use that swivel in order to
get<00:01:32.439> it<00:01:33.439> at<00:01:33.650> its<00:01:33.799> finest<00:01:34.210> clarity<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.750> it

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
get it at its finest clarity so that it

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.800 
get it at its finest clarity so that it
was<00:01:36.890> designed<00:01:37.250> actually<00:01:37.549> to<00:01:38.060> be<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:38.330> an<00:01:38.450> angle

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
was designed actually to be in an angle

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.070 
was designed actually to be in an angle
so<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:39.320> can<00:01:39.470> see<00:01:39.650> it<00:01:39.979> more<00:01:40.490> clearly<00:01:40.900> but<00:01:41.900> some

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
so you can see it more clearly but some

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.600 
so you can see it more clearly but some
people<00:01:42.380> again<00:01:42.590> like<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.890> position<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.460> that

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
people again like to position it that

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.640 
people again like to position it that
way<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.880> elected<00:01:44.210> position<00:01:44.659> but<00:01:45.229> something

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
way the elected position but something

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.490 
way the elected position but something
very<00:01:45.890> good<00:01:46.159> about<00:01:46.430> this<00:01:46.640> is<00:01:46.900> again<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.259> color

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
very good about this is again the color

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.160 
very good about this is again the color
the<00:01:49.100> con<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:49.729> have<00:01:49.970> with<00:01:50.180> this<00:01:50.329> is<00:01:50.479> the

the con that I have with this is the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.700 
the con that I have with this is the
swivel<00:01:51.650> that<00:01:52.009> from<00:01:52.640> every<00:01:53.000> direction<00:01:53.180> it's<00:01:53.750> it
