added a new thing called interrogation
which<00:01:52.360> in<00:01:52.540> my<00:01:52.750> opinion<00:01:52.930> slows<00:01:53.740> of<00:01:53.950> pacing<00:01:54.340> on

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
which in my opinion slows of pacing on

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.880 
which in my opinion slows of pacing on
the<00:01:54.490> game<00:01:54.760> down<00:01:55.000> drastically<00:01:55.600> because<00:01:56.410> it's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
the game down drastically because it's

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.400 
the game down drastically because it's
pretty<00:01:57.790> much<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:58.000> cutscene<00:01:58.690> it's<00:01:58.960> like<00:01:59.200> an

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
pretty much a cutscene it's like an

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.140 
pretty much a cutscene it's like an
interactive<00:02:00.190> cutscene<00:02:00.670> that's<00:02:00.910> what<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.060> is

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
interactive cutscene that's what it is

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.140 
interactive cutscene that's what it is
right<00:02:01.480> and<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:02.290> don't<00:02:02.320> like<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:02.910> overall<00:02:03.910> I

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
right and I don't like that overall I

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.570 
right and I don't like that overall I
like<00:02:04.480> the<00:02:04.690> way<00:02:04.870> Ruby<00:02:05.320> soft<00:02:05.710> decided<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.370> tell

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
like the way Ruby soft decided to tell

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.580 
like the way Ruby soft decided to tell
the<00:02:06.610> story<00:02:07.030> because<00:02:07.660> it<00:02:07.780> sets<00:02:07.990> up<00:02:08.200> for<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.440> lot

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
the story because it sets up for a lot

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.590 
the story because it sets up for a lot
of<00:02:08.619> twists<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.070> turns<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:09.850> really<00:02:10.479> won't

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
of twists and turns and you really won't

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.210 
of twists and turns and you really won't
