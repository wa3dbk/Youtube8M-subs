00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
first spoken off and copied down and so

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.890 
first spoken off and copied down and so
it's<00:04:05.859> dishonest<00:04:06.549> to<00:04:06.940> perpetuate<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.690> false

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
it's dishonest to perpetuate the false
