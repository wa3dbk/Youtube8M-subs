workouts<00:03:18.769> on<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.220> 1st<00:03:19.430> 2nd<00:03:19.790> 3rd<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:19.970> 4th<00:03:20.500> and

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
workouts on the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.470 
workouts on the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th and
I<00:03:21.709> miss<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.730> can<00:03:22.880> end<00:03:23.000> up<00:03:23.090> being<00:03:23.269> that<00:03:23.420> I

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
I miss it I can end up being that I

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.030 
I miss it I can end up being that I
already<00:03:23.840> missed<00:03:24.109> it<00:03:24.260> might<00:03:24.500> as<00:03:24.560> well<00:03:24.620> not<00:03:24.859> do

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
already missed it might as well not do

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.039 
already missed it might as well not do
it<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:25.430> that's<00:03:25.880> why<00:03:26.030> it's<00:03:26.180> important<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.630> set

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
it so that's why it's important to set

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.250 
it so that's why it's important to set
up<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.410> workout<00:03:27.980> calendar<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.720> make<00:03:30.109> sure

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
you follow it and you want to schedule

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.140 
you follow it and you want to schedule
