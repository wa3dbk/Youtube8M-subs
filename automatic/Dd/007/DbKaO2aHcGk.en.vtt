00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
fuel system this is a proper fuel system

now<00:01:00.219> proper<00:01:01.219> pump<00:01:01.520> I'm<00:01:02.360> telling<00:01:02.719> you<00:01:02.809> right

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
now proper pump I'm telling you right

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.680 
now proper pump I'm telling you right
now<00:01:03.050> if<00:01:03.320> that<00:01:03.500> Dino<00:01:04.070> has<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.460> Barry<00:01:04.820> grant<00:01:05.119> fuel

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
now if that Dino has a Barry grant fuel

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.930 
now if that Dino has a Barry grant fuel
pump<00:01:05.930> probably<00:01:06.890> is<00:01:06.979> not<00:01:07.190> gonna<00:01:07.369> work<00:01:07.670> I

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
pump probably is not gonna work I

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.639 
pump probably is not gonna work I
wouldn't<00:01:08.690> even<00:01:08.780> probably<00:01:09.110> waste<00:01:09.320> your<00:01:09.500> time

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
wouldn't even probably waste your time

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.910 
wouldn't even probably waste your time
on<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:10.009> yeah<00:01:10.330> proper<00:01:11.330> fuel<00:01:11.570> pump<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.530> best

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920

now<00:02:38.920> these<00:02:39.640> turbines<00:02:40.090> are<00:02:40.300> good<00:02:40.780> for<00:02:41.100> 1,300

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100

all<00:03:23.150> right<00:03:23.390> now<00:03:23.599> we're<00:03:23.780> gonna<00:03:23.840> go<00:03:24.049> out<00:03:24.080> look<00:03:24.349> at

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
all right now we're gonna go out look at

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.140 
all right now we're gonna go out look at
the<00:03:24.530> numbers<00:03:24.860> all<00:03:25.370> right<00:03:25.519> now<00:03:25.670> he<00:03:25.730> just<00:03:25.970> made

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
the numbers all right now he just made

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.660 
the numbers all right now he just made
that<00:03:26.180> steady<00:03:27.140> pull<00:03:27.409> we<00:03:27.830> come<00:03:28.040> out<00:03:28.069> here<00:03:28.250> and

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
that steady pull we come out here and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.839 
that steady pull we come out here and
you<00:03:28.849> look<00:03:29.030> at<00:03:29.180> this<00:03:30.069> first<00:03:31.069> thing<00:03:31.370> see<00:03:31.640> that

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
you look at this first thing see that

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.820 
you look at this first thing see that
you<00:03:32.659> just<00:03:32.840> collected<00:03:33.200> data

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
you just collected data

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.339 
you just collected data
you<00:03:34.459> saw<00:03:34.700> how<00:03:34.879> short<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.330> pole<00:03:35.510> was<00:03:35.720> not<00:03:36.200> gonna

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
you saw how short the pole was not gonna

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.690 
you saw how short the pole was not gonna
hurt<00:03:36.500> anything<00:03:36.709> like<00:03:36.980> that<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.340> when<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.549> went

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
hurt anything like that and when I went

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.490 
hurt anything like that and when I went
up<00:03:37.760> 36<00:03:38.330> or<00:03:38.510> 39<00:03:38.840> 66<00:03:40.540> horsepower<00:03:41.540> torque<00:03:42.140> that's

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
up 36 or 39 66 horsepower torque that's

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.350 
up 36 or 39 66 horsepower torque that's
all<00:03:42.680> nice<00:03:42.920> doesn't<00:03:43.280> really<00:03:43.459> matter<00:03:43.700> but<00:03:44.150> what

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
all nice doesn't really matter but what

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.350 
all nice doesn't really matter but what
we're<00:03:44.599> looking<00:03:44.870> at<00:03:44.989> here<00:03:45.280> first<00:03:46.280> off<00:03:46.549> while<00:03:47.150> I

we're looking at here first off while I
was<00:03:47.510> dying<00:03:47.750> on<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.140> here<00:03:48.829> I'll<00:03:48.980> show<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.220> on<00:03:49.310> my

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
was dying on it here I'll show you on my

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.839 
was dying on it here I'll show you on my
graph<00:03:50.269> numbers<00:03:50.840> or<00:03:51.260> my<00:03:51.470> bar<00:03:51.680> right<00:03:52.640> while<00:03:52.819> I

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
graph numbers or my bar right while I

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.670 
graph numbers or my bar right while I
was<00:03:53.120> dying<00:03:53.360> on<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:53.720> I'm<00:03:54.049> looking<00:03:54.379> at<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.650> Oh

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
was dying on it I'm looking at the Oh

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.610 
was dying on it I'm looking at the Oh
twos<00:03:55.069> and<00:03:55.750> watching<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:56.870> as<00:03:57.049> it<00:03:57.079> was<00:03:57.319> running

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
twos and watching it as it was running

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:08.780 
twos and watching it as it was running
if<00:03:57.920> this<00:03:58.129> thing<00:03:58.370> skyrocketed<00:03:59.150> up<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.359> 15<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.870> 1

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.890 

getting<00:04:12.709> jerky<00:04:13.129> and<00:04:13.760> really<00:04:14.269> starts<00:04:14.510> bouncing

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
getting jerky and really starts bouncing

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.940 
getting jerky and really starts bouncing
around<00:04:14.989> fight<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.319> bit<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.620> just<00:04:15.650> kind<00:04:15.920> of

enough<00:04:18.949> timing<00:04:19.489> in<00:04:19.579> it<00:04:19.729> now<00:04:20.419> anytime<00:04:20.959> you're

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
enough timing in it now anytime you're

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.930 
enough timing in it now anytime you're
ahead<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.680> timing<00:04:22.130> you<00:04:22.490> better<00:04:22.699> make<00:04:22.880> sure

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
ahead and timing you better make sure

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:32.500 
ahead and timing you better make sure
that<00:04:23.180> it<00:04:23.419> has<00:04:23.539> enough<00:04:23.570> fuel<00:04:24.289> limit
