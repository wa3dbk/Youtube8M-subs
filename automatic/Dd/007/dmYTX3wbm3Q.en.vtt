he'll<00:01:52.729> reflex<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:53.539> it<00:01:53.630> gives<00:01:53.780> us<00:01:53.899> something<00:01:53.929> a

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:54.349 
he'll reflex and it gives us something a

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:55.990 
he'll reflex and it gives us something a
little<00:01:54.679> special<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.489> it's<00:01:55.610> definitely<00:01:55.880> not

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
little special and it's definitely not

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.630 
little special and it's definitely not
just<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.899> normal<00:01:57.259> neutral<00:01:57.800> eye<00:01:57.950> maybe<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:58.520> looks

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
just a normal neutral eye maybe it looks

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.460 
just a normal neutral eye maybe it looks
that<00:01:58.819> way<00:01:58.940> at<00:01:59.090> first<00:01:59.119> glance<00:01:59.539> but<00:01:59.899> then<00:02:00.349> you

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
that way at first glance but then you

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.419 
that way at first glance but then you
can<00:02:00.590> really<00:02:00.739> see<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.099> there's<00:02:01.280> something

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
can really see that there's something

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.040 
can really see that there's something
interesting<00:02:01.670> going<00:02:02.090> on<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.479> shadows<00:02:02.869> here

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
interesting going on the shadows here

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.710 
interesting going on the shadows here
because<00:02:03.319> of<00:02:03.470> that<00:02:03.590> one<00:02:03.739> shadow<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:05.360> if<00:02:05.569> you
