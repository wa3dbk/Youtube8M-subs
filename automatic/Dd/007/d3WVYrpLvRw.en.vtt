Omega vert VRT 330 juicer and i'm going

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.570 
Omega vert VRT 330 juicer and i'm going
to<00:00:07.109> demonstrate<00:00:07.200> using<00:00:07.620> some<00:00:07.950> techniques<00:00:08.370> to

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
to demonstrate using some techniques to

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.490 
to demonstrate using some techniques to
minimize<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.420> amount<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.870> pulp<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.440> your

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
minimize the amount of pulp in your

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.499 
minimize the amount of pulp in your
juice<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.519> number<00:00:11.759> one<00:00:11.910> way<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.150> basically

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
juice the number one way is basically

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.700 
juice the number one way is basically
you're<00:00:12.599> going<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.780> cut<00:00:13.049> especially<00:00:13.559> things

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
you're going to cut especially things

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.670 
you're going to cut especially things
like<00:00:13.830> celery<00:00:14.190> up<00:00:14.870> into<00:00:15.870> smaller<00:00:16.230> pieces<00:00:16.440> so

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
like celery up into smaller pieces so

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.080 
like celery up into smaller pieces so
instead<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.100> being<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.550> long<00:00:17.820> you're<00:00:17.970> going

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
instead of being this long you're going

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.170 
instead of being this long you're going
to<00:00:18.150> cut<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.420> into<00:00:18.539> about<00:00:18.660> 1-inch<00:00:19.230> pieces<00:00:20.180> when

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
to cut it into about 1-inch pieces when

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.240 
to cut it into about 1-inch pieces when
you<00:00:21.300> feed<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.660> into<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.990> Machine<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.560> this

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
you feed that into the Machine and this

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.439 
you feed that into the Machine and this
will<00:00:23.460> prevent<00:00:25.279> you<00:00:26.279> blocking<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.849> outlet

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
will prevent you blocking the outlet

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.960 
will prevent you blocking the outlet
shoot<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> pulp<00:00:29.010> same<00:00:29.429> thing<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:29.849> your

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
shoot with the pulp same thing with your

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.540 
shoot with the pulp same thing with your
kale<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.869> some<00:00:30.990> Dino<00:00:31.199> kale<00:00:31.470> here<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
kale so we have some Dino kale here and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.620 
kale so we have some Dino kale here and
we're<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> cut<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.180> into<00:00:33.360> little

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
we're going to cut that into little

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.350 
we're going to cut that into little
pieces<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.260> well<00:00:35.190> now<00:00:35.940> if<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> don't<00:00:36.239> mind

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
pieces as well now if you don't mind

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.209 
pieces as well now if you don't mind
your<00:00:36.719> pulp<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.530> juice<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.890> don't<00:00:38.070> need

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
your pulp in your juice you don't need

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.709 
your pulp in your juice you don't need
to<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.579> step<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.059> an<00:00:39.149> optional<00:00:39.660> step

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
to do this step this is an optional step

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.690 
to do this step this is an optional step
for<00:00:40.079> people<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.469> really<00:00:40.649> don't<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
for people that really don't like the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400 
for people that really don't like the
pulp<00:00:41.910> actually<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.360> don't<00:00:42.450> mind<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> poke<00:00:43.200> my

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
pulp actually I don't mind the poke my

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.560 
pulp actually I don't mind the poke my
juice<00:00:43.590> i<00:00:43.710> think<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.010> actually<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.280> good<00:00:44.460> thing

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
juice i think it's actually a good thing

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
juice i think it's actually a good thing
extra<00:00:45.570> pulp<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.930> juice<00:00:46.010> basically<00:00:47.010> slows

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
extra pulp in the juice basically slows

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.130 
extra pulp in the juice basically slows
down<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> absorption<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.600> sugar<00:00:48.870> into

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
down the absorption of the sugar into

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.979 
down the absorption of the sugar into
your<00:00:49.289> bloodstream<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.550> also<00:00:50.809> based<00:00:51.809> on

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
your bloodstream and it also based on

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.979 
your bloodstream and it also based on
some<00:00:52.140> scientific<00:00:52.559> studies<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.100> I've<00:00:53.160> read

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
some scientific studies that I've read

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.479 
some scientific studies that I've read
the<00:00:54.989> fiber<00:00:55.260> actually<00:00:55.649> are<00:00:55.800> some<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the fiber actually are some of the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.689 
the fiber actually are some of the
antioxidants<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:58.530> produce<00:00:58.949> 2xu<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.640> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
antioxidants in the produce 2xu so it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.430 
antioxidants in the produce 2xu so it
doesn't<00:01:00.000> oxidize<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.629> fast<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.079> if<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.230> make

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
doesn't oxidize as fast so if you make

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.689 
doesn't oxidize as fast so if you make
your<00:01:01.620> juice<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.190> probably<00:01:02.340> save

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
your juice it's going to probably save

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.880 
your juice it's going to probably save
longer<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.270> there's<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.899> know<00:01:03.930> some<00:01:04.260> fiber<00:01:04.619> in

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
longer if there's you know some fiber in

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.370 
longer if there's you know some fiber in
the<00:01:05.040> juice<00:01:05.280> left<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.750> let's<00:01:06.869> go<00:01:07.049> ahead<00:01:07.080> without

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the juice left so let's go ahead without

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.920 
the juice left so let's go ahead without
further<00:01:07.680> ado<00:01:07.890> turn<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> vert<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
further ado turn the vert on and you

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.240 
further ado turn the vert on and you
know<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.080> always<00:01:10.380> want<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.710> rotate<00:01:10.890> your

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
know you always want to rotate your

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.590 
know you always want to rotate your
produce<00:01:11.490> when<00:01:11.820> you're<00:01:11.939> juicing<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> vert

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
produce when you're juicing in the vert

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.030 
produce when you're juicing in the vert
so<00:01:12.720> we're<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.990> dump<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.470> carrot<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.890> there

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
so we're going to dump a carrot in there

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.980 
so we're going to dump a carrot in there
now<00:01:14.970> we're<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> dump<00:01:15.509> all<00:01:15.689> these<00:01:15.810> little

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
now we're going to dump all these little

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.910 
now we're going to dump all these little
kale<00:01:16.590> pieces<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.280> there<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:18.770> some<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
kale pieces in there and some of the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.320 
kale pieces in there and some of the
celery<00:01:20.220> pieces<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:22.880> remain<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.060> don't<00:01:24.240> need

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
celery pieces and remain you don't need

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.210 
celery pieces and remain you don't need
to<00:01:24.390> chop<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.049> soft<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> remain

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
to chop it's really soft this is remain

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.550 
to chop it's really soft this is remain
heart

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.130 

put<00:01:34.159> that<00:01:34.280> in<00:01:34.340> there<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:34.850> we<00:01:35.479> got<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.659> nice<00:01:35.899> big

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
put that in there and we got a nice big

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.319 
put that in there and we got a nice big
fatty<00:01:36.530> coming<00:01:36.860> out<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:37.399> like<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:37.820> pulp

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
fatty coming out so like the pulp

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.420 
fatty coming out so like the pulp
ejection<00:01:38.869> port<00:01:39.170> nice<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:39.920> fat<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.130> that's

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
ejection port nice and fat and that's

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.310 
ejection port nice and fat and that's
because<00:01:40.579> what<00:01:41.390> i<00:01:41.420> did<00:01:41.659> on<00:01:41.689> this<00:01:41.930> you'll<00:01:42.200> have

did<00:01:44.270> a<00:01:44.299> plug<00:01:44.689> modification<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:45.740> there's

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
did a plug modification so there's

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.760 
did a plug modification so there's
basically<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:48.049> Pope<00:01:48.289> is<00:01:48.439> going<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.649> be<00:01:48.740> a

definitely get a more pulp free juice by
doing<00:01:52.100> that<00:01:52.189> modification<00:01:52.850> i'm<00:01:52.939> not<00:01:53.119> going<00:01:53.299> to

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
doing that modification i'm not going to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.700 
doing that modification i'm not going to

hit<00:03:46.849> the<00:03:46.970> reverse<00:03:47.090> button<00:03:47.560> it's<00:03:48.560> going<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:48.829> run

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
hit the reverse button it's going to run

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.770 
hit the reverse button it's going to run
the<00:03:49.069> machine<00:03:49.370> backwards<00:03:49.879> and<00:03:50.180> then<00:03:50.629> you're

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
the machine backwards and then you're

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.390 
the machine backwards and then you're
going<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.930> go<00:03:51.019> ahead<00:03:51.139> and<00:03:51.260> then<00:03:51.650> hit<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:51.980> again

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
going to go ahead and then hit it again

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.360 
going to go ahead and then hit it again
to<00:03:52.639> go<00:03:52.760> forwards<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:54.650> all<00:03:54.769> usually<00:03:55.129> work

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
to go forwards and it all usually work

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.670 
to go forwards and it all usually work
through<00:03:55.700> whatever<00:03:55.909> got<00:03:56.359> stuck<00:03:56.720> that's<00:03:57.470> in

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
through whatever got stuck that's in

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.309 
through whatever got stuck that's in
there<00:03:57.889> and<00:03:58.540> there<00:03:59.540> it<00:03:59.629> is<00:03:59.690> work<00:04:00.019> right<00:04:00.290> through

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
there and there it is work right through

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.649 
there and there it is work right through
so<00:04:00.709> deftly<00:04:01.370> important<00:04:01.819> to<00:04:01.879> slow<00:04:02.209> down<00:04:02.389> when

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
so deftly important to slow down when

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.210 
so deftly important to slow down when
you're<00:04:02.780> feeding<00:04:03.019> produce<00:04:03.440> in<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.709> Omega<00:04:03.950> vert

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
you're feeding produce in the Omega vert

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.710 
you're feeding produce in the Omega vert
so<00:04:04.819> that<00:04:05.480> just<00:04:05.690> doesn't<00:04:05.870> happen<00:04:05.989> for<00:04:06.230> you

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
so that just doesn't happen for you

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.030 
so that just doesn't happen for you
let's<00:04:08.720> go<00:04:08.870> ahead<00:04:08.959> and<00:04:09.049> put<00:04:09.290> some<00:04:09.410> more<00:04:09.560> kale<00:04:09.829> in

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
let's go ahead and put some more kale in

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:21.060 
let's go ahead and put some more kale in
there<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.540> some<00:04:11.540> cut<00:04:11.959> up<00:04:11.989> celery<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.530> have

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.610 

but<00:04:21.640> another<00:04:21.850> carrot

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.310 

more<00:04:29.620> cucumber<00:04:33.449> all<00:04:34.449> right<00:04:34.630> definitely<00:04:35.050> once

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
more cucumber all right definitely once

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.930 
more cucumber all right definitely once
again<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.800> collared<00:04:36.160> lose<00:04:36.340> you<00:04:36.490> want<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.729> cut

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
again the collared lose you want to cut

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.189 
again the collared lose you want to cut
those<00:04:37.120> up<00:04:37.330> before<00:04:37.690> we<00:04:37.780> put<00:04:37.960> them<00:04:38.020> in<00:04:38.110> the

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
those up before we put them in the

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:49.810 
those up before we put them in the
juicer<00:04:38.590> one-inch<00:04:39.550> pieces<00:04:39.820> are<00:04:40.120> best

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.390 

so<00:04:50.810> you<00:04:50.870> can<00:04:51.080> see<00:04:51.320> in<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.860> Omega<00:04:52.130> vert<00:04:52.340> juicer

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
so you can see in the Omega vert juicer

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.920 
so you can see in the Omega vert juicer
because<00:04:52.730> we<00:04:53.030> did<00:04:53.180> what's<00:04:53.360> called<00:04:53.450> the<00:04:53.630> plug

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
because we did what's called the plug

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.130 
because we did what's called the plug
the<00:04:54.320> plug<00:04:54.500> mod<00:04:55.180> you<00:04:56.180> know<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.390> Pope<00:04:56.630> continues

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
the plug mod you know the Pope continues

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.170 
the plug mod you know the Pope continues
to<00:04:57.230> flow<00:04:57.440> out<00:04:57.470> in<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.920> nice<00:04:58.100> wide<00:04:58.460> fashion<00:04:59.060> in

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
to flow out in a nice wide fashion in

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.140 
to flow out in a nice wide fashion in
some<00:04:59.750> cases<00:05:00.020> you<00:05:00.290> know<00:05:00.410> basically<00:05:01.340> half<00:05:01.820> or

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
some cases you know basically half or

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.450 
some cases you know basically half or
even<00:05:02.210> one<00:05:02.570> quarter<00:05:03.080> of<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:03.950> pulp<00:05:04.190> is<00:05:04.340> only

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
even one quarter of the pulp is only

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.910 
even one quarter of the pulp is only
going<00:05:04.640> to<00:05:04.700> pull<00:05:04.910> out<00:05:04.940> of<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.150> machine<00:05:05.240> when

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
going to pull out of the machine when

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.250 
going to pull out of the machine when
the<00:05:06.920> the<00:05:07.460> outlet<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:08.120> outlet<00:05:08.540> basically<00:05:09.080> gets

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
the the outlet the outlet basically gets

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.200 
the the outlet the outlet basically gets
plugged<00:05:09.590> up<00:05:11.290> so<00:05:12.290> what<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.530> plug<00:05:12.770> mod

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
plugged up so what the plug mod

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.160 
plugged up so what the plug mod
basically<00:05:14.210> it's<00:05:14.330> going<00:05:14.450> to<00:05:14.510> free<00:05:14.780> flow<00:05:14.990> out

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
basically it's going to free flow out

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.010 
basically it's going to free flow out
but<00:05:15.890> what<00:05:16.130> it<00:05:16.220> does<00:05:16.400> is<00:05:16.640> basically<00:05:17.020> you're

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
but what it does is basically you're

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.240 
but what it does is basically you're
going<00:05:18.140> to<00:05:18.200> lose<00:05:18.350> a<00:05:18.410> little<00:05:18.530> bit<00:05:18.650> of<00:05:18.740> heel<00:05:19.010> but

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
going to lose a little bit of heel but

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.800 
going to lose a little bit of heel but
it's<00:05:19.370> looking<00:05:19.820> like<00:05:19.940> I'm<00:05:20.090> not<00:05:20.180> losing<00:05:20.510> much

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
it's looking like I'm not losing much

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.600 
it's looking like I'm not losing much
and<00:05:21.170> if<00:05:21.410> I'm<00:05:21.500> getting<00:05:21.710> a<00:05:21.770> fall<00:05:21.980> produced<00:05:22.430> it

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
and if I'm getting a fall produced it

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.400 
and if I'm getting a fall produced it
may<00:05:22.910> be<00:05:22.970> worth<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.420> compromise<00:05:23.900> once<00:05:24.320> again

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
may be worth that compromise once again

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.590 
may be worth that compromise once again
