steeplechase whatnot also melded

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.370 
steeplechase whatnot also melded
together<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.569> way<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.690> was<00:02:54.870> fluid<00:02:55.230> and

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
together in a way that was fluid and

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.960 
together in a way that was fluid and
didn't<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:55.680> ever<00:02:55.829> interrupt<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.489> pace<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.880> the

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
didn't so ever interrupt the pace of the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.539 
didn't so ever interrupt the pace of the
game<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.420> will<00:02:58.079> how<00:02:58.200> difficult<00:02:58.980> was<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.280> sort

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
game I will how difficult was it to sort

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.970 
game I will how difficult was it to sort
of<00:02:59.579> bring<00:02:59.700> all<00:02:59.850> those<00:02:59.940> elements<00:03:00.120> together<00:03:00.389> and

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
of bring all those elements together and

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.710 
of bring all those elements together and
make<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> bit<00:03:02.370> more<00:03:02.400> fit<00:03:02.760> be<00:03:02.970> something<00:03:03.269> so<00:03:03.690> I

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
make a bit more fit be something so I

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.270 
make a bit more fit be something so I
think<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.109> question<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.530> how<00:03:04.799> difficult<00:03:05.220> was

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
think the question is how difficult was

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.559 
think the question is how difficult was
it<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.459> bring<00:03:05.610> all<00:03:05.790> these<00:03:05.909> elements<00:03:06.239> together

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
it to bring all these elements together

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:07.530 
it to bring all these elements together
in<00:03:06.870> one

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
in one

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.170 
in one

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.880 
iving hand-to-hand combat gunplay and
that's<00:03:10.450> directed<00:03:10.810> at<00:03:10.900> Nick<00:03:11.110> yeah<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.739> was

that's directed at Nick yeah it was

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.369 
that's directed at Nick yeah it was

involve we made sure that the flow of

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.170 
involve we made sure that the flow of
them<00:03:33.010> fitting<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.430> pace<00:03:33.639> of<00:03:33.819> them<00:03:33.909> fit<00:03:34.060> into

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
them fitting the pace of them fit into

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.490 
them fitting the pace of them fit into
the<00:03:34.329> game<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:34.959> when<00:03:35.079> you<00:03:35.139> when<00:03:35.349> you've

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
analyzed that you've got that pace set

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.580 
analyzed that you've got that pace set
up<00:03:37.150> in<00:03:37.269> your<00:03:37.299> structure<00:03:37.780> with<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.319> other<00:03:38.469> guys

are the experts then we can go in and
kind<00:03:40.329> of<00:03:40.420> blend<00:03:40.659> that<00:03:40.780> in<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.200> yeah<00:03:41.530> it's<00:03:41.650> a

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
kind of blend that in so yeah it's a

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.740 
kind of blend that in so yeah it's a
difficult<00:03:41.829> ass<00:03:42.159> for<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.760> game<00:03:43.120> such<00:03:43.389> as<00:03:43.510> bond

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.789 
had to be doing which is that's a bit of
rise<00:03:51.849> to<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.090> challenge<00:03:52.450> do<00:03:52.629> it<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:52.959> think<00:03:53.650> Nick

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
rise to the challenge do it I think Nick

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.530 
rise to the challenge do it I think Nick
is<00:03:53.829> being<00:03:54.189> a<00:03:54.250> little<00:03:54.430> modest<00:03:54.970> here<00:03:55.209> because

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
is being a little modest here because

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.990 
is being a little modest here because
because<00:03:56.379> in<00:03:56.620> fact<00:03:56.919> one<00:03:57.609> of<00:03:57.639> the<00:03:57.760> things<00:03:57.909> I

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
because in fact one of the things I

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.920 
because in fact one of the things I
think<00:03:58.090> is<00:03:58.209> really<00:03:58.269> exciting<00:03:58.720> about<00:03:58.810> this

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
think is really exciting about this

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.140 
think is really exciting about this
particular<00:03:59.230> game<00:03:59.560> is<00:03:59.799> at<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.159> there's<00:04:00.849> a<00:04:00.970> very

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
particular game is at the there's a very

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.879 
particular game is at the there's a very
fluid<00:04:01.480> movement<00:04:02.109> between<00:04:02.230> hand-to-hand

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
fluid movement between hand-to-hand

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.349 
fluid movement between hand-to-hand
combat<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.310> shooting<00:04:03.760> which<00:04:03.939> I<00:04:04.120> think

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
combat and shooting which I think

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.869 
combat and shooting which I think
they've<00:04:04.569> done<00:04:04.900> in<00:04:05.230> an<00:04:05.409> exemplary<00:04:05.829> way<00:04:06.099> and<00:04:06.430> I

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
they've done in an exemplary way and I

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.610 
they've done in an exemplary way and I
personally<00:04:07.239> haven't<00:04:07.450> seen<00:04:07.750> before<00:04:08.049> and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
personally haven't seen before and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.619 
personally haven't seen before and
thought<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.519> was<00:04:09.669> really<00:04:09.819> really<00:04:10.090> exciting

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
thought that was really really exciting

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.170 
thought that was really really exciting
so<00:04:11.109> overall<00:04:11.769> in<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.310> pacing<00:04:12.699> is<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.849> very

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
so overall in the pacing is a very

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.939 
so overall in the pacing is a very
difficult<00:04:13.359> thing<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.900> juggle<00:04:14.379> but<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.590> think<00:04:14.829> as

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
difficult thing to juggle but I think as

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:16.379 
difficult thing to juggle but I think as
you<00:04:15.069> can<00:04:15.190> see<00:04:15.370> from<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:15.669> clips<00:04:15.909> a<00:04:16.000> little<00:04:16.209> bit

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
you can see from the clips a little bit

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.479 
you can see from the clips a little bit
you<00:04:16.959> know<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.109> can<00:04:17.349> move<00:04:17.530> seamlessly<00:04:17.979> from

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
you know you can move seamlessly from

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.699 
you know you can move seamlessly from
one<00:04:18.699> to<00:04:18.789> the<00:04:18.849> other<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:20.199> think<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.590> makes

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
one to the other and I think it makes

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.980 
one to the other and I think it makes
the<00:04:20.919> game<00:04:21.430> more<00:04:21.639> exciting<00:04:21.940> because<00:04:22.389> as<00:04:22.930> a

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
the game more exciting because as a

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.770 
the game more exciting because as a
secret-agent<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:23.860> have<00:04:24.099> to<00:04:24.370> make<00:04:25.210> choices<00:04:25.449> of

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
secret-agent you have to make choices of

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.510 
secret-agent you have to make choices of
consequences<00:04:26.530> and<00:04:26.860> it<00:04:27.220> makes<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.490> think

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
consequences and it makes you think

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.680 
consequences and it makes you think
about<00:04:27.820> how<00:04:28.120> you're<00:04:28.240> going<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.419> deal<00:04:28.570> the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
about how you're going to deal the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.990 
about how you're going to deal the
situation<00:04:29.229> I<00:04:29.320> mean<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:30.099> can<00:04:30.310> go<00:04:30.370> in<00:04:30.729> guns

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
situation I mean you can go in guns

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.640 
situation I mean you can go in guns
a-blazing<00:04:31.659> but<00:04:31.810> that's<00:04:31.960> not<00:04:32.110> always<00:04:32.289> a<00:04:32.409> very

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
a-blazing but that's not always a very

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.040 
a-blazing but that's not always a very
good<00:04:32.770> idea<00:04:32.889> and<00:04:33.430> so<00:04:34.150> this<00:04:34.300> game<00:04:34.659> really<00:04:34.780> kind

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
good idea and so this game really kind

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.210 
good idea and so this game really kind
of<00:04:35.110> heightens<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.590> tension<00:04:35.979> and<00:04:36.130> that

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
of heightens that tension and that

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.950 
of heightens that tension and that
drawing

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
drawing

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:48.580 
drawing
