the<00:01:33.380> problem<00:01:33.770> for<00:01:33.920> me<00:01:34.039> is<00:01:34.069> it's<00:01:34.399> about<00:01:34.579> 30

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
the problem for me is it's about 30

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.730 
the problem for me is it's about 30
minutes<00:01:35.240> too<00:01:35.450> long<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:35.990> pacing<00:01:36.409> is<00:01:36.499> all

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
minutes too long and the pacing is all

over the place

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.800 
over the place
then<00:01:37.909> there's<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.299> rule<00:01:38.509> breaking

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
then there's the rule breaking

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.870 
then there's the rule breaking
time-turner<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:40.069> certainly<00:01:40.609> should<00:01:40.850> have

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
time-turner that certainly should have

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.330 
time-turner that certainly should have
been<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.119> deathly<00:01:41.539> hallow<00:01:41.749> instead<00:01:42.679> it's<00:01:42.950> put

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
installments I think nailed the tone

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.520 
installments I think nailed the tone
perfectly<00:03:05.790> here<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.239> matches<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.959> book<00:03:07.230> and

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
perfectly here it matches the book and

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.490 
perfectly here it matches the book and
everything<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.670> somber<00:03:09.420> as

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
everything is somber as

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.500

at Hogwarts the muted color palette

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.339 
at Hogwarts the muted color palette
reflects<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:15.959> not<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.290> most

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
reflects that it's not the most

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.530 
reflects that it's not the most
interesting<00:03:16.590> story<00:03:17.340> by<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.549> long<00:03:17.819> shot<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.359> acts

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
interesting story by a long shot it acts

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.559 
interesting story by a long shot it acts
as<00:03:18.720> more<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.049> bridge<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.829> final<00:03:20.220> chapter

as more of a bridge to the final chapter

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.500 
as more of a bridge to the final chapter
but<00:03:21.569> it's<00:03:22.230> done<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.069> well<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:24.090> think<00:03:24.420> it

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
but it's done so well that I think it

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.569 
but it's done so well that I think it
deserves<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.959> higher<00:03:25.140> spot<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.069> has<00:03:26.370> some

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
deserves a higher spot that it has some

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.099 
deserves a higher spot that it has some
