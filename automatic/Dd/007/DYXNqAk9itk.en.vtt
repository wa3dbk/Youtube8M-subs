one<00:01:02.750> is<00:01:03.019> a<00:01:03.289> little<00:01:03.500> lighter<00:01:04.009> we<00:01:04.909> did<00:01:05.089> away<00:01:05.269> with

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
one is a little lighter we did away with

one is a little lighter we did away with
the<00:01:05.479> board<00:01:05.780> we<00:01:06.409> decided<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:06.979> as<00:01:07.880> nice<00:01:08.149> as

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
the board we decided that as nice as

the board we decided that as nice as
that<00:01:08.390> board<00:01:08.780> might<00:01:08.990> have<00:01:09.140> been<00:01:09.320> we<00:01:09.710> could<00:01:09.920> do

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
that board might have been we could do

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.460 
that board might have been we could do
it<00:01:10.190> with<00:01:10.369> less<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.450> actually<00:01:11.930> here's<00:01:12.289> the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
it with less and so actually here's the

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.889 
it with less and so actually here's the
layout<00:01:12.680> of<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.250> entire<00:01:13.369> game<00:01:13.820> if<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:14.570> want<00:01:14.780> it

to<00:01:15.049> be<00:01:15.080> this<00:01:15.409> small<00:01:15.619> we<00:01:15.950> sort<00:01:16.190> of<00:01:16.250> formed<00:01:16.549> a

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
to be this small we sort of formed a

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.639 
to be this small we sort of formed a
grid<00:01:16.909> with<00:01:16.940> all<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.479> cards<00:01:17.899> it's<00:01:18.080> again<00:01:18.409> it's

a<00:01:18.920> grid<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:20.210> board<00:01:20.420> did<00:01:20.659> much<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.080> same

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
a grid and the board did much the same

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.320 
a grid and the board did much the same
for<00:01:21.619> you<00:01:21.830> but<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.550> was<00:01:22.670> one<00:01:22.819> more<00:01:23.000> piece<00:01:23.179> of

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
for you but it was one more piece of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.230 
for you but it was one more piece of
cardboard<00:01:23.539> that<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:23.960> don't<00:01:24.140> have<00:01:24.289> to<00:01:24.440> pay<00:01:24.590> for

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
cardboard that you don't have to pay for

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.270 
cardboard that you don't have to pay for
otherwise<00:01:26.240> those<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.929> you<00:01:27.080> know<00:01:27.319> the<00:01:27.530> game<00:01:27.740> can

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
otherwise those of you know the game can

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.300 
otherwise those of you know the game can
see<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:29.720> hasn't<00:01:30.289> changed<00:01:30.350> it's<00:01:30.860> got<00:01:31.009> ten

percent fewer cards but it just means

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.370 
percent fewer cards but it just means

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
fewer duplications it's the same cards

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.899 
fewer duplications it's the same cards
