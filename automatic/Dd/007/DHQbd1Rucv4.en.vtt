00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.439
 Video lessons 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:12.479
 today I'm going to teach how to set up the steppe of the also called chapel heber 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.239
 of stamps 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.810
 to post to your site 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.410
 It is tremendously agricultural chapel from there files 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.130
 and click Choose a web space 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.579
 but not the window that appears click here in Publish parameters 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.660
 here we have states that I will say says are referring to the server where 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.280
 you want to put your site 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.729
 in terms of life in this third party sep 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:45.900
 other 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.420
 usually the name of the site is the name of the last pain they offer the service on 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.910
 if they were web single i 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.970
 it is unacceptable you should check out these coyotes needs and hosting and 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.810
 they probably sent you an email 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.190
 with this information 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.170
 the guinean government the placement of user and password the word partnership 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.890
 password 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.440
 is since you are entering this data only here in these fields click 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.440
 on test collection 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.729
 if it marks the success is because the configuration state what 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.480
 good down here I felt set up with the data referring to the pib 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.450
 to sites that in the case is not our new home that would make sites score 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.700
 neighborhood dot com 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700
 your pouting clear what the address of your site 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.800
 down here I can not even explain and searched the remote folder 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.790
 which would be the place where we will publish with the site 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.890
 emilio that this policeman does not injure himself another folder he will be 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.259
 published in the root of your site is left with the edp sa folder that for example 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.880
 on the site to publish inside a web page in the chapel 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.930
 in case you install it, move on to it 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.930
 notice that depending on which server you are using 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:14.349
 she passed on her site it seemed like this was one thing I concluded that html thousand 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.249
 www am 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.139
 tas http rotation agathe or something like that 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.230
 is this to verify this occurs due to the losses that amused 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.159
 my case would be to pass on themselves or the rock 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.049
 close all 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.049
 and I'll post it on the site 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.209
 It is a crisis that is being sent 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:52.689

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.929
 sites scored on stage with a stump 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:58.929
 let's take a look 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.509
 here is the newly published site 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.249
 with the kleber pocket chapeau chapel 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.849

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.339
 tips on building sites until the next
