look great

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.410 
look great
corals<00:02:13.490> look<00:02:13.730> great<00:02:15.700> some<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:16.820> my<00:02:16.910> corals<00:02:17.270> that

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
corals look great some of my corals that

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.860 
corals look great some of my corals that
weren't<00:02:17.690> opening<00:02:18.020> up<00:02:18.230> very<00:02:18.680> much<00:02:18.770> or<00:02:19.420> out<00:02:20.420> more

how it goes I'm gonna get a couple of

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.170 
how it goes I'm gonna get a couple of
SPS<00:02:48.680> frags<00:02:49.070> because<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.520> just<00:02:49.670> got<00:02:49.820> my<00:02:49.880> water

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
SPS frags because I just got my water

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.680 
SPS frags because I just got my water
tested<00:02:50.690> today<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:50.960> should<00:02:51.140> be<00:02:51.470> fine<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:53.570> I'll

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
tested today I should be fine and I'll

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.110 
tested today I should be fine and I'll
place<00:02:53.960> them<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.350> there<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.710> see<00:02:54.950> how<00:02:54.980> they<00:02:55.280> do

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.430 

like<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.240> said<00:02:59.300> you<00:02:59.690> know<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.810> lot<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.140> people

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
like I said you know a lot of people

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.060 
like I said you know a lot of people
said<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:00.830> they<00:03:00.950> think<00:03:01.010> it's<00:03:01.340> too<00:03:01.580> blue<00:03:01.910> and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
said that they think it's too blue and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.620 
said that they think it's too blue and
there<00:03:04.070> were<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.280> few<00:03:04.670> people<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:05.270> said<00:03:05.510> you

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
there were a few people that said you

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.770 
there were a few people that said you
know<00:03:05.750> they<00:03:05.930> can't<00:03:06.170> grow<00:03:07.240> SPS<00:03:08.240> at<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.510> bottom

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
know they can't grow SPS at the bottom

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
know they can't grow SPS at the bottom
of<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.990> tank<00:03:09.230> with<00:03:09.440> them<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.710> everything<00:03:11.800> you

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
of the tank with them and everything you

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.930 
of the tank with them and everything you
know<00:03:12.890> I'm<00:03:13.010> gonna<00:03:13.130> I'm<00:03:13.430> gonna<00:03:13.550> test<00:03:13.820> that

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
know I'm gonna I'm gonna test that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.120 
know I'm gonna I'm gonna test that
theory<00:03:14.270> and<00:03:14.450> at<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.660> same<00:03:14.810> time<00:03:15.080> if<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.739> decide

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
theory and at the same time if I decide

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.960 
theory and at the same time if I decide
that<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:16.550> is<00:03:16.760> too<00:03:17.000> blue<00:03:17.330> or<00:03:18.070> I<00:03:19.070> don't<00:03:19.640> have

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
that this is too blue or I don't have

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.430 
that this is too blue or I don't have
enough<00:03:20.360> light<00:03:20.570> at<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.810> bottom<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.200> tank

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
enough light at the bottom of the tank

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.080 
enough light at the bottom of the tank
which<00:03:21.650> I'm<00:03:21.800> I'm<00:03:22.040> sure<00:03:22.459> there's<00:03:22.730> gonna<00:03:22.880> be

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
which I'm I'm sure there's gonna be

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.120 
which I'm I'm sure there's gonna be
enough<00:03:23.360> light<00:03:23.540> for<00:03:23.600> my<00:03:23.930> LPS<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.410> my<00:03:24.680> softies

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
enough light for my LPS and my softies

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.500 
enough light for my LPS and my softies
and<00:03:25.340> stuff<00:03:25.520> which<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:25.730> all<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:26.000> really<00:03:26.209> care

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
and stuff which is all I really care

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.270 
and stuff which is all I really care
about<00:03:26.540> I'm<00:03:26.870> not<00:03:27.050> a<00:03:27.080> huge<00:03:27.350> SPS<00:03:27.830> person<00:03:29.890> but<00:03:30.890> you

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
about I'm not a huge SPS person but you

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.010 
about I'm not a huge SPS person but you
know<00:03:31.370> if<00:03:31.520> all<00:03:31.670> else<00:03:31.880> fails<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.420> can<00:03:32.570> always<00:03:32.720> do

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
know if all else fails I can always do

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.110 
know if all else fails I can always do
this

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
this

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.720 
this
obviously<00:03:35.410> angle<00:03:36.410> it<00:03:36.500> somewhere<00:03:36.860> else<00:03:37.100> but<00:03:37.400> I

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
obviously angle it somewhere else but I

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.270 
obviously angle it somewhere else but I
still<00:03:38.510> have<00:03:38.720> my<00:03:38.900> beams<00:03:39.170> work<00:03:39.440> led<00:03:39.770> so<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.070> can

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
still have my beams work led so I can

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.160 
still have my beams work led so I can
throw<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:40.670> over<00:03:40.850> it<00:03:41.090> with<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.630> Kessel's<00:03:42.050> if

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
throw that over it with the Kessel's if

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.199 
throw that over it with the Kessel's if
I<00:03:42.290> really<00:03:42.560> want<00:03:42.770> to<00:03:44.470> but<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.530> don't<00:03:45.800> I<00:03:46.250> don't

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
I really want to but I don't I don't

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.780 
I really want to but I don't I don't
really<00:03:47.540> plan<00:03:47.750> on<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.290> kind<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.590> have<00:03:48.770> it<00:03:48.800> up

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
really plan on it I kind of have it up

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.430 
really plan on it I kind of have it up
here<00:03:49.850> under<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.600> Kessel's<00:03:50.989> just<00:03:51.230> so<00:03:51.320> I<00:03:51.380> can

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
here under the Kessel's just so I can

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.210 
here under the Kessel's just so I can
use<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.830> actinic<00:03:52.280> for<00:03:52.550> it<00:03:53.590> or<00:03:54.590> frum<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:55.010> for

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
use the actinic for it or frum it for

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.130 
use the actinic for it or frum it for
night<00:03:55.400> lights<00:03:55.640> right<00:03:56.330> now<00:03:57.880> but

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
night lights right now but

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.870 
night lights right now but
yeah<00:04:01.140> that's<00:04:01.530> um<00:04:03.680> it's<00:04:04.680> my<00:04:04.860> first<00:04:05.310> impression

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
yeah that's um it's my first impression

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.250 
yeah that's um it's my first impression
another<00:04:06.120> thing<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.480> was<00:04:06.600> reading<00:04:06.780> about<00:04:06.990> was

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
another thing I was reading about was

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.900 
another thing I was reading about was
people<00:04:07.590> were<00:04:07.680> one<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.550> things<00:04:08.730> that

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
people were one of the things that

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.110 
people were one of the things that
people<00:04:09.030> were<00:04:09.270> complaining<00:04:09.630> about<00:04:09.840> on<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:11.120> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
people were complaining about on the the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.760 
people were complaining about on the the
goosenecks<00:04:12.690> was<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.170> they<00:04:13.319> only<00:04:13.470> had<00:04:13.740> one

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
goosenecks was that they only had one
