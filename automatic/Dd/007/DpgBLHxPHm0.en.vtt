00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.279
 Welcome to one today 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.769
 further review of the infotainment system 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:12.280
 of the nissan qashqai in cooperation with 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:16.270
 car drove today yes here we have that 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.970
 system what with a big 5 inch 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.430
 display shines with a resolution there 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.170
 can you count the pixels so to speak 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.880
 not that the latest version but for that 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.680
 it offers virtually all possibilities 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.660
 which one would like to have here now 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.480
 for example, the navigation maps 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.890
 view there you can still in the menu 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.450
 make some settings 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.890
 for example, in two of the view if 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.480
 you like that better or 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.160
 I have to search automatically 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.290
 always very good find that very little 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.899
 slower then when the card 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.489
 purely zooms in and he so for example the 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.079
 city a better cutout downforce 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.630
 otherwise to other functions too 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.620
 say so as an iphone user I want 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.969
 Of course my iphone always 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.110
 then a system that works 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.520
 we also have a usb here 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.320
 connection available 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.600
 there you can with your normal 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.730
 iphone cable as a fancy iphone 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.450
 connect 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.180
 of course from tomorrow the film band and yes 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.229
 then you can talk about that 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.990
 ochs you have here almost your ipod and 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.570
 can even take over the control 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.460
 menu you have here almost your titles 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.260
 listen and of course you can also here 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.490
 playlists manage your to can 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.380
 we go back and have yours 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.850
 playlists half a year et cetera 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.520
 This is also off, for example 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.659
 itunes knows look let's go we drive 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.659
 into the top 25 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.970
 yes what you hear is the bose sound system 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.770
 I think a lot is rejected 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:06.770
 66 speakers in front we have the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.770
 most beautiful rose logo provided 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.960
 the system does and the bus system 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.510
 pretty bad I do not know 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.900
 standard fabian or standard installed 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.530
 bose system data right raushauen what 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.510
 a box 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.540
 you have to stop with that 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.270
 narrow display life cover illustration 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.630
 is missing but you can just quasi 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.820
 sift through the menu 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.010
 yes else is there fm radio, we have 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.350
 also not available though 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.050
 I is finally very well find the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.530
 quality has much better but rds 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.990
 we have bargain over rds he pulls 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.520
 For example, from the navi the 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.170
 traffic message 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.660
 which one is then here under this 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:07.010
 traffic data quasi can look at and 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.180
 stuttgart as always believe in themselves 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.920
 gives me a lot we still have here 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.590
 a setup button where you have a few more 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.780
 You can do things roughly, for example 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.019
 pair the mobile phone with bluetooth and 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.040
 Use the hands-free system over it 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:23.269
 or audio you can still enjoy 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.739
 the different attitude to mine 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:31.489
 time on our plates or from others 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.409
 equipment knows here the steering wheel in the view 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.390
 the navi can be further about it here 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.599
 do not serve so we only have one here 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.959
 loud and quiet and that 's it here 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.790
 We still have the ad 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.920
 However, no further information about the navi 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.200
 or rad is indicating each other's other 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.190
 is just kept very spartan like 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.290
 even the costumes display size that 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.150
 it finally happened roughly tsunami and 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.739
 Now they say a little round trip 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:16.820
 and then I'll show you that again 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:18.940
 Navigation device on the way to 50 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.070
 meters turn left 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.139
 the goal is limited to one 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:30.680
 driving on the road 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:32.600
 that they turn left 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.100
 yes now I have you now once briefly 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.880
 in use 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.500
 this is the 3d display with 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.500
 unsuspected more detailed 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.880
 how do you like the navigation device? 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:57.300
 say I already have better matches 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:59.390
 but have seen that are already ten 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.390
 years 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.940
 I'm not that kind of friend now 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.330
 the navis has me now more often 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.430
 times through the campaign leads to 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.690
 example here on the way wanted 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.210
 it does not argue about the sore 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.630
 but over the beetle I was like that 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.300
 free 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.940
 followed then ten minutes longer 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.180
 used as originally estimated 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.180
 not so nice 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.310
 and now I turn it on again 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:49.450
 the 2d views 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:49.450
 in road running continue to follow yes 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.360
 by now have here 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.360
 his view 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:14.169
 hereafter nice feature camera but her 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.190
 also have a page change 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:20.740
 camera and you can down here after the 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.110
 Switch camera so that you just 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.060
 right, the camera probably have the sense 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.040
 infected would be great just to the cameras 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.830
 a highly wish could sortimo 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:34.510
 arrange the camera that could mirror 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.460
 to do that with what one to one to four 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:41.340
 marins rum, for example, the buttons 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.340
 Moves the cameras each to divorce
