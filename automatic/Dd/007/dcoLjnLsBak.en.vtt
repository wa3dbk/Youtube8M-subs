00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
kind of a three-prong approach for that

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:19.680 
kind of a three-prong approach for that
that<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.370> was<00:03:18.730> interested<00:03:19.209> talking<00:03:19.330> about<00:03:19.510> it

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
arma2 Daisy was a pain to install yet oh

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.360 
arma2 Daisy was a pain to install yet oh
these<00:04:02.349> little<00:04:02.590> things<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:02.920> had<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.040> do<00:04:03.220> and

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
these little things you had to do and

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.339 
these little things you had to do and
switches<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:03.910> packages<00:04:04.299> to<00:04:04.390> download<00:04:04.780> but

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
switches and packages to download but

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:06.539 
switches and packages to download but
the<00:04:05.440> idea<00:04:05.739> is<00:04:05.799> you<00:04:05.890> go<00:04:06.099> into<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.370> Steam

thing that has taken a lot of time for
us<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.860> develop<00:04:51.160> daisy<00:04:51.460> is<00:04:51.669> we're<00:04:51.850> also

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
us to develop daisy is we're also

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.390 
us to develop daisy is we're also
developing<00:04:52.270> its<00:04:52.660> engine<00:04:52.990> in<00:04:53.139> tandem<00:04:53.590> infusion

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
developing its engine in tandem infusion

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.909 
developing its engine in tandem infusion
of<00:04:54.460> course<00:04:54.669> and<00:04:54.880> as<00:04:55.150> we<00:04:55.330> get<00:04:55.539> to<00:04:55.810> towards<00:04:56.740> our
