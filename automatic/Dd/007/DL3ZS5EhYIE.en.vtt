00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.620
 welcome to the reislingen 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.550
 channel today we learn the first 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.920
 combination 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.049
 Last time we learned 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.480
 once to wrap the vandals 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.670
 for getting started with the training then 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.220
 individual techniques job and have pleasure 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.609
 over the whole combined Japanese 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.070
 a technology is first with the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.640
 combination consisting of the technology 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.250
 the jet and at the handshake of 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.140
 We sleep in the place in our house 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.480
 stand again as you already explained 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.910
 in the fight position 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.649
 the double think we work only 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.250
 with the leader handshake with the left 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.539
 hand forward as right-handed 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.930
 Pay attention again at work on the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.780
 Inside is again called dress and many 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.989
 People may think again 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.989
 go with you in front of foot call right away 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.170
 I watch build and weaken power 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.410
 we draw leaken again 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.720
 back completely in the headgear and 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.700
 now now fresh air legally after 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.140
 ahead 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.700
 if now right hip again 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.170
 standing in front of the left hip 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.670
 Double cover came now with the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.040
 next hit with the deposit on the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.880
 glove thought eighth here again 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.950
 the fact that the shoulder is quite break 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.040
 it occurred left fist remains up 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.410
 and pull the punch again 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.840
 change back then then stand 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.479
 Again the fight is the whole thing 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.060
 We now try a little faster is 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.510
 go back out again in the fight 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.270
 position 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.880
 some dare they pay attention that you 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 body always complete for all 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.170
 come is the count also on it 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.080
 that the body does not go forward 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.720
 and completely turned the weight and you 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.070
 from the fight position women are like 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.360
 always stand in the fight position 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:08.660
 stay and found back back 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.660
 The double coverage was a bit faster 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.130
 important we should have heard that 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.000
 exhale 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.580
 then comes stress in the body in order 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.730
 back again the speed of the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.320
 shock is thereby the chance again 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.160
 retreat and in the fight position 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.660
 stand at the end 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.060
 important if he is with the 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.950
 permanently partitioned with water 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.959
 my blow goes forward 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.050
 accordingly my wrists around 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.000
 to protect a man and almost again 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.450
 build to back into shape position 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.630
 to lead 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.340
 this is where the technology comes from 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:53.620
 perfect and up the mountain on the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.830
 again, make it all over again 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.830
 fast 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.530
 Okay, today you have learned 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.160
 Japanese a combination too 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.800
 beat 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.420
 important as I said what you on it 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.989
 respects the double coverage permanently 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.280
 hold 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.680
 clean again in the fight position 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.900
 stand and get power for purely 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.819
 and to achieve speed so important 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.790
 just as the fist forward 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.480
 is going to pull back 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.480
 I hope to see it
