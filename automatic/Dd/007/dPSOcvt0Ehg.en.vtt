was the whole other set so this is all
the<00:05:42.970> three<00:05:43.690> worlds<00:05:44.020> and<00:05:44.530> it<00:05:44.680> did<00:05:44.919> together<00:05:45.789> and

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
the three worlds and it did together and

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.999 
the three worlds and it did together and
I<00:05:47.319> also<00:05:47.620> hope<00:05:48.220> they<00:05:48.879> will<00:05:49.090> make<00:05:49.120> a<00:05:49.740> Inder<00:05:50.740> world

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
I also hope they will make a Inder world

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:53.730 
I also hope they will make a Inder world
so<00:05:51.639> I<00:05:51.669> can<00:05:51.729> put<00:05:52.120> right<00:05:52.300> here<00:05:52.870> with<00:05:53.440> a<00:05:53.470> little

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
so I can put right here with a little

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.189 
so I can put right here with a little
ender<00:05:54.190> dragon<00:05:54.759> and<00:05:54.940> in<00:05:55.120> ermine<00:05:55.509> to<00:05:55.900> put<00:05:56.110> around

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
ender dragon and in ermine to put around

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.249 
ender dragon and in ermine to put around
and<00:05:57.099> that<00:05:57.849> will<00:05:58.000> be<00:05:58.150> cool<00:05:58.389> to<00:05:58.659> have<00:05:58.690> a<00:05:58.810> fourth

00:05:59.249 --> 00:05:59.259 
and that will be cool to have a fourth

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.399 
and that will be cool to have a fourth
set<00:05:59.830> and<00:06:00.069> I<00:06:00.669> also<00:06:00.909> hope<00:06:01.360> they<00:06:01.629> make<00:06:01.900> a<00:06:02.080> fifth

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
set and I also hope they make a fifth

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.999
