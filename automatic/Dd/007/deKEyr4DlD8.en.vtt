 considered faulty and she is from

 digital camera apparatus tool 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.370

 soldering iron and for fujifilm cameras 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.520

 Please refer to the repair before the repair 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.860

 Do the repair after ours 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.910
 through the video 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.260
 if you are not a camera technician 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.550
 Can problems with display installation 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.000
 occur 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.760
 if the display is only white or dark 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.570
 is the problem probably 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.790
 following first, that ribbon cable 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.990
 is not quite in the connection 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.840
 secondly, the model of 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:54.570
 backlight does not fit 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.700
 For example, Kodak 863 has three 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.380
 different 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.400
 backlit with a 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.950
 wrong model of 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.660
 Backlight can be the display 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.350
 dark black or overexposed 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.500
 in that case, please use the old one 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:16.230
 backlight continues 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.120
 Third, the board is broken in 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.450
 In that case, please build that 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.580
 spare part once again if that 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.709
 this does not solve the problem 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.250
 please send us as cameras 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.250

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.000
 Camera can be installed after installation 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.310
 do not turn on 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.490
 then we recommend the camera for 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:43.300
 to send the examination to our workshop 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.170

 after installing a new objective 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.730
 Sometimes the camera does not make sharp ones 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.350
 Pictures our workshop can be the camera 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.920

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.280
 One tip you can do without the lens 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.800
 software successfully a tree in which one 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.860
