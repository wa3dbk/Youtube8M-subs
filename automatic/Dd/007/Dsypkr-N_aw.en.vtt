the<00:01:19.350> metal<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.850> play<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.360> with<00:01:21.630> our<00:01:21.930> jawan

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the metal that play here with our jawan

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.770 
the metal that play here with our jawan
gaming<00:01:22.619> logo<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:24.210> g<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.390> game<00:01:24.630> in

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
gaming logo here and the g one game in

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.940 
gaming logo here and the g one game in
series<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.320> all<00:01:25.500> high-end<00:01:25.920> VJ<00:01:26.820> car<00:01:27.090> series<00:01:27.540> so

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
series is all high-end VJ car series so

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.580 
series is all high-end VJ car series so
you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:29.900> an<00:01:30.900> obvious<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.439> this

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
you can see it here an obvious that this

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.710 
you can see it here an obvious that this
obviously<00:01:32.310> will<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.880> basic<00:01:33.329> OSI<00:01:33.689> model

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
obviously will have the basic OSI model

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.640 
obviously will have the basic OSI model
yeah<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> custom<00:01:36.750> pc<00:01:36.990> d<00:01:37.229> yeah

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
yeah this one is it a custom pc d yeah

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.069 
yeah this one is it a custom pc d yeah
this<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.250> totally<00:01:38.640> custom<00:01:39.060> PCB<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:39.600> so

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
this one is a totally custom PCB here so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.899 
this one is a totally custom PCB here so
i<00:01:40.110> guess<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.530> means<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.040> users<00:01:41.400> want<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> use

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
i guess it means if I users want to use

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.630 
i guess it means if I users want to use
a<00:01:41.939> liquid<00:01:42.840> cooling<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.860> cut<00:01:44.130> they<00:01:44.340> they

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
a liquid cooling they cut they they

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.380 
a liquid cooling they cut they they
can't<00:01:44.880> use<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
can't use a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.710 
can't use a
no<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.020> cannot<00:01:46.470> use<00:01:46.650> them<00:01:46.860> okay<00:01:47.280> yeah<00:01:48.090> what

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
no you cannot use them okay yeah what

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.140 
no you cannot use them okay yeah what
else<00:01:48.900> can<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.050> tell<00:01:49.140> us<00:01:49.290> about<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.650> and<00:01:50.010> uh

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
else can you tell us about this and uh

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.460 
else can you tell us about this and uh
for<00:01:51.150> like<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.600> power<00:01:51.780> connector<00:01:52.290> here

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
for like the power connector here

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.250 
for like the power connector here
compared<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.400> a<00:01:53.430> reference<00:01:54.360> card<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:54.900> to

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
compared to a reference card we have to

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.070 
compared to a reference card we have to
a<00:01:55.290> pin<00:01:55.710> connector<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.150> he<00:01:57.270> has<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.690> it

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
a pin connector here so he has like it

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.899 
a pin connector here so he has like it
comes<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.500> more<00:01:58.770> hard<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.430> more<00:01:59.580> strong

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
comes you more hard but it's more strong

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.040 
comes you more hard but it's more strong
it's<00:02:00.750> stronger<00:02:01.200> yeah

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.340 

what's<00:02:05.620> the<00:02:05.770> maximum<00:02:06.160> cooling<00:02:06.520> capacity<00:02:07.350> 600

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350
