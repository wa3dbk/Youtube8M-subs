00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
a jump smash attack that just leaves you

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.830 
a jump smash attack that just leaves you
open<00:04:50.260> to<00:04:50.470> getting<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.830> hit<00:04:50.920> and<00:04:51.280> you'll<00:04:51.640> die<00:04:51.840> the

r1<00:04:53.260> r1<00:04:53.470> r2<00:04:53.830> combo<00:04:54.460> is<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.760> quickest<00:04:55.360> way<00:04:55.450> to

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
r1 r1 r2 combo is the quickest way to

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.060 
r1 r1 r2 combo is the quickest way to
take<00:04:55.960> these<00:04:56.110> out<00:04:56.260> you<00:04:56.470> do<00:04:56.620> that<00:04:56.800> three<00:04:57.040> times

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
take these out you do that three times

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.580 
take these out you do that three times
the<00:04:57.790> gatekeepers<00:04:58.300> will<00:04:58.480> fall<00:04:58.720> if<00:04:58.900> you<00:04:59.230> fail<00:04:59.560> to

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
the gatekeepers will fall if you fail to

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.160 
the gatekeepers will fall if you fail to
kill<00:04:59.920> the<00:05:00.130> gatekeeper<00:05:00.700> then<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.300> next<00:05:01.600> person

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
kill the gatekeeper then the next person

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.720 
kill the gatekeeper then the next person
that<00:05:02.290> comes<00:05:02.320> across<00:05:02.770> with<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.100> sword<00:05:03.370> well<00:05:03.580> then

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
that comes across with a sword well then

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.910 
that comes across with a sword well then
how<00:05:03.850> to<00:05:03.880> have<00:05:04.270> to<00:05:04.420> kill<00:05:04.690> two<00:05:05.140> gatekeepers<00:05:05.890> and

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
how to have to kill two gatekeepers and

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.640 
how to have to kill two gatekeepers and
that's<00:05:06.220> very<00:05:06.820> difficult<00:05:07.120> so<00:05:07.840> each<00:05:08.110> person's

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
that's very difficult so each person's

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.740 
that's very difficult so each person's
job<00:05:08.950> when<00:05:09.280> they<00:05:09.430> come<00:05:09.610> across<00:05:09.850> is<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.480> kill

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
job when they come across is to kill

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.540 
job when they come across is to kill
that<00:05:10.930> gatekeeper<00:05:11.200> what<00:05:12.010> causes<00:05:12.460> the

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
that gatekeeper what causes the

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.580 
that gatekeeper what causes the
gatekeepers<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.090> spawn<00:05:13.480> is<00:05:13.780> when<00:05:14.140> you<00:05:14.290> kill

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
gatekeepers to spawn is when you kill

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.250 
gatekeepers to spawn is when you kill
the<00:05:14.770> sword-bearer<00:05:15.220> on<00:05:15.640> the<00:05:15.790> other<00:05:16.000> side<00:05:16.420> now

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
the sword-bearer on the other side now

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.590 
the sword-bearer on the other side now
what<00:05:17.440> we<00:05:17.530> found<00:05:17.770> that<00:05:17.950> helps<00:05:18.430> is<00:05:18.610> if<00:05:19.270> the

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
what we found that helps is if the

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.030 
what we found that helps is if the
person<00:05:20.170> that's<00:05:20.260> standing<00:05:20.410> over<00:05:20.860> on<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:21.010> other

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
person that's standing over on the other

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.700 
person that's standing over on the other
side<00:05:21.190> can<00:05:21.700> distract<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.540> gatekeeper<00:05:23.110> with

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
side can distract the gatekeeper with

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.800 
side can distract the gatekeeper with
like<00:05:24.430> a<00:05:24.460> couple<00:05:24.820> shots<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:25.300> his<00:05:25.420> head<00:05:25.600> and<00:05:25.630> then

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
like a couple shots to his head and then

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.410 
like a couple shots to his head and then
a<00:05:25.840> run<00:05:26.140> around<00:05:26.280> jus<00:05:27.280> come<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.520> little<00:05:27.640> bit<00:05:27.880> leave

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
a run around jus come a little bit leave

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.940 
a run around jus come a little bit leave
some<00:05:28.570> time<00:05:28.720> for<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:29.140> guardian<00:05:29.740> with<00:05:29.830> the

gatekeeper<00:05:57.220> will<00:05:57.370> keep<00:05:57.610> spawning<00:05:58.030> so<00:05:58.510> every

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
gatekeeper will keep spawning so every

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.480 
gatekeeper will keep spawning so every
time<00:05:59.320> that<00:05:59.530> person<00:05:59.740> comes<00:06:00.070> over<00:06:00.340> they're

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
time that person comes over they're

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.740 
time that person comes over they're
gonna<00:06:00.610> need<00:06:00.820> to<00:06:00.910> take<00:06:00.970> priority<00:06:01.330> on<00:06:01.660> the

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
gonna need to take priority on the

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.480 
gonna need to take priority on the
gatekeeper<00:06:02.290> during<00:06:02.710> this<00:06:02.800> entire<00:06:03.190> time

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
gatekeeper during this entire time

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.010 
gatekeeper during this entire time
there's<00:06:03.730> going<00:06:03.910> to<00:06:04.000> be<00:06:04.030> ads<00:06:04.240> coming<00:06:04.690> out<00:06:04.840> on

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
there's going to be ads coming out on

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.010 
there's going to be ads coming out on
both<00:06:05.320> sides<00:06:05.620> it's<00:06:05.950> going<00:06:06.310> to<00:06:06.460> get<00:06:06.580> very

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
both sides it's going to get very

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.050 
both sides it's going to get very
overwhelming<00:06:08.020> so<00:06:08.350> use<00:06:08.950> maximum<00:06:09.550> level

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
overwhelming so use maximum level

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.060 
overwhelming so use maximum level
weapons<00:06:10.510> and<00:06:10.720> I<00:06:10.900> hope<00:06:11.170> your<00:06:11.350> level<00:06:11.620> third<00:06:11.860> here

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070

you're<00:06:12.250> gonna<00:06:12.340> have<00:06:12.580> a<00:06:12.610> rough<00:06:12.970> time<00:06:13.030> key

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
you're gonna have a rough time key

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.690 
you're gonna have a rough time key
prints<00:06:14.290> and<00:06:14.470> repeating<00:06:14.890> hopefully<00:06:15.460> you<00:06:15.580> can

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
prints and repeating hopefully you can

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.360 
prints and repeating hopefully you can
get<00:06:15.910> all<00:06:16.120> six<00:06:16.510> Guardians<00:06:17.050> over<00:06:17.530> once<00:06:18.040> you<00:06:18.160> get

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
get all six Guardians over once you get
