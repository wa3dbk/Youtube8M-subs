00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
these spectacular cinematic

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
extra damage the combo system also can

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.070 
extra damage the combo system also can
be<00:01:38.670> exploited<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.299> different<00:01:39.630> ways<00:01:39.780> depending

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
be exploited in different ways depending

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.950 
be exploited in different ways depending
on<00:01:40.409> what<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:40.830> of<00:01:40.860> opponent<00:01:41.130> you're<00:01:41.430> fighting

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
on what kind of opponent you're fighting

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.210 
on what kind of opponent you're fighting
so<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.170> example<00:01:43.590> when<00:01:43.710> you're<00:01:43.830> fighting<00:01:44.009> in

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
so for example when you're fighting in

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.039 
so for example when you're fighting in
character<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.030> hunter<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:45.840> best

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
character like the hunter your best

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.560 
character like the hunter your best
strategy<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.619> probably<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.610> try<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.880> do<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
strategy is probably to try to do the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.320 
strategy is probably to try to do the
longest<00:01:49.020> combo<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.649> could<00:01:49.799> branch<00:01:50.100> into<00:01:50.490> but

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
longest combo you could branch into but

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.670 
longest combo you could branch into but
you<00:01:51.450> might<00:01:51.659> want<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> little<00:01:52.470> defensive

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
you might want to be a little defensive

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.830 
you might want to be a little defensive
at<00:01:53.189> first<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.759> you'll<00:01:53.909> you'll<00:01:54.240> you'll<00:01:54.270> want<00:01:54.750> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
at first so you'll you'll you'll want to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.020 
at first so you'll you'll you'll want to
let<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.710> hunter<00:01:56.039> himself<00:01:56.130> start<00:01:56.909> his

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
let the the hunter himself start his
