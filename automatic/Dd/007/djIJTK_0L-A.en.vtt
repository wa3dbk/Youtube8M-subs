00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
like a sleeping kind of thing but I

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.710 
like a sleeping kind of thing but I
didn't<00:02:44.860> realize<00:02:45.130> how<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:45.580> long<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.360> stuff

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
didn't realize how like long and stuff

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.230 
didn't realize how like long and stuff
it<00:02:46.900> was<00:02:47.190> which<00:02:48.190> I'm<00:02:48.370> sure<00:02:48.520> is<00:02:48.670> fine<00:02:48.910> but<00:02:49.120> it

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
it was which I'm sure is fine but it

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.730 
it was which I'm sure is fine but it
seems<00:02:49.450> like<00:02:49.600> kind<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.840> heavier<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.350> Florida

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
seems like kind of heavier for Florida

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.650 
seems like kind of heavier for Florida
but<00:02:50.980> we'll<00:02:51.100> see<00:02:51.310> it's<00:02:51.850> like<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.000> big<00:02:52.300> long

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
but we'll see it's like a big long

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.600 
but we'll see it's like a big long
sleeping<00:02:53.170> bag<00:02:53.350> it's<00:02:53.560> like<00:02:53.710> really<00:02:54.460> really

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
sleeping bag it's like really really

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.220 
sleeping bag it's like really really
long<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:56.890> don't<00:02:57.340> know<00:02:57.490> it<00:02:57.940> seems<00:02:58.900> good<00:02:59.170> I

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
long so I don't know it seems good I

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.900 
long so I don't know it seems good I
think<00:02:59.410> it'll<00:02:59.650> be<00:02:59.770> fine<00:02:59.950> for<00:03:00.220> him<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.580> sleep<00:03:00.760> in

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
think it'll be fine for him to sleep in

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.570 
think it'll be fine for him to sleep in
and<00:03:01.090> everything<00:03:01.540> but<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:02.020> seems<00:03:02.709> extra<00:03:03.400> long

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
and everything but just seems extra long

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.310 
and everything but just seems extra long

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810

absolutely<00:06:31.560> adorable<00:06:31.949> and<00:06:32.250> great<00:06:32.550> for

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
absolutely adorable and great for

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.240 
absolutely adorable and great for

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
storage so I'm really happy that's the

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.320 
storage so I'm really happy that's the
only<00:06:35.460> thing<00:06:35.639> that<00:06:35.759> I<00:06:35.820> thought<00:06:35.970> was<00:06:36.120> kind<00:06:36.240> of

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
only thing that I thought was kind of

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.870 
only thing that I thought was kind of
weird<00:06:36.389> was<00:06:36.720> the<00:06:36.810> petite<00:06:37.080> butoh<00:06:37.410> really<00:06:38.280> long<00:06:38.520> I

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
weird was the petite butoh really long I

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.580 
weird was the petite butoh really long I
just<00:06:38.940> guess<00:06:39.539> you<00:06:39.720> probably<00:06:40.020> don't<00:06:40.169> see<00:06:40.229> stuff
