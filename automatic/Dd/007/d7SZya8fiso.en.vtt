00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
good I I don't know if my hands on as

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.410 
good I I don't know if my hands on as
wide<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:48.899> some<00:00:49.020> others<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:50.340> handcuff<00:00:51.149> is

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
wide as some others but my handcuff is

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.209 
wide as some others but my handcuff is
the<00:00:52.020> Middle's<00:00:52.289> down<00:00:52.440> here<00:00:52.710> obviously<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the Middle's down here obviously the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.799 
the Middle's down here obviously the
swell<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.910> see<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.390> that's<00:00:54.480> where<00:00:54.690> my

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
swell you can see so that's where my

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.060 
swell you can see so that's where my
hand<00:00:55.050> goes<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.440> middle<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.739> right<00:00:55.920> over

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
hand goes in the middle is right over

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.920 
hand goes in the middle is right over
the<00:00:56.219> swell<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.940> when<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.539> there's<00:00:57.840> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the swell and when I do that there's a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.209 
the swell and when I do that there's a
bit<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.109> room<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:58.739> where<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.920> feel<00:00:59.100> like

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
bit of room up here where I feel like

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.130 
bit of room up here where I feel like
I'm<00:00:59.430> losing<00:00:59.789> some<00:01:00.180> control<00:01:00.570> because<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:00.899> hand

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
I'm losing some control because my hand

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.180 
I'm losing some control because my hand
doesn't<00:01:01.230> come<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> way<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> top

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
doesn't come all the way up to the top

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.820 
doesn't come all the way up to the top
like<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.730> wanted<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.359> think<00:01:04.229> ideally<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.710> would

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
like I wanted to I think ideally I would

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.320 
like I wanted to I think ideally I would
want<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.250> frontal<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> little

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
want this frontal to be a little

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.660 
want this frontal to be a little
lessened<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.260> swell<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.280> moved<00:01:08.490> up

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
lessened and this swell to be moved up

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.980 
lessened and this swell to be moved up
just<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.060> bit<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.240> then<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.570> would<00:01:09.689> really<00:01:09.869> be

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
just a bit and then it would really be

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.250 
just a bit and then it would really be
perfectly<00:01:10.979> comfortable<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.880> me<00:01:12.170> it's<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
perfectly comfortable for me it's a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.410 
perfectly comfortable for me it's a
little<00:01:13.530> bit<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:14.250> as<00:01:14.430> large<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.909> circumference

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
little bit not as large in circumference

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.760 
little bit not as large in circumference
as<00:01:15.840> i<00:01:15.900> would<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.520> but<00:01:18.259> it<00:01:19.259> certainly<00:01:19.409> sharp

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
as i would like but it certainly sharp

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.310 
as i would like but it certainly sharp
enough<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.670> think<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> 316<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.110> know<00:01:22.200> you're

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
enough you think it 316 you know you're

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.710 
enough you think it 316 you know you're
pretty<00:01:22.409> wary<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.360> our<00:01:24.360> curve<00:01:24.509> does<00:01:24.689> a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
pretty wary of it but our curve does a

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.120 
pretty wary of it but our curve does a
really<00:01:24.930> good<00:01:25.080> job<00:01:25.140> with<00:01:25.290> their<00:01:25.470> grinds<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
really good job with their grinds and so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.010 
really good job with their grinds and so
is<00:01:26.250> still<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> good<00:01:26.640> slicer<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:27.990> make

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
is still a good slicer but it can make

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.569 
is still a good slicer but it can make
up<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.500> know<00:01:28.590> make<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:28.979> fuss<00:01:29.159> stick<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
up you know make a good fuss stick and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.490 
up you know make a good fuss stick and
still<00:01:29.790> go<00:01:29.970> baton<00:01:30.689> through<00:01:30.930> some<00:01:31.110> wood<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.380> get

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
still go baton through some wood to get

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.280 
still go baton through some wood to get
you<00:01:31.590> something<00:01:31.829> dry<00:01:32.390> it's<00:01:33.390> good<00:01:33.540> knife<00:01:33.720> solid

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you something dry it's good knife solid

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.050 
you something dry it's good knife solid

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
makes for a extraordinarily sharp edge

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.559 
makes for a extraordinarily sharp edge
again<00:03:23.010> like<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> 510<00:03:23.700> I've<00:03:23.849> cut<00:03:24.180> myself<00:03:24.329> on

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
again like the 510 I've cut myself on

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.259 
again like the 510 I've cut myself on
this<00:03:24.720> more<00:03:25.079> than<00:03:25.169> a<00:03:25.260> few<00:03:25.380> times<00:03:25.669> a<00:03:26.669> friend

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
this more than a few times a friend

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.140 
this more than a few times a friend
noted<00:03:27.599> right<00:03:28.019> away<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:29.130> guess<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.910> kind<00:03:30.090> of

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
noted right away and I guess I kind of

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.900 
noted right away and I guess I kind of
noticed<00:03:30.269> in<00:03:30.959> practice<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.010> use<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.669> has<00:03:32.880> a

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
noticed in practice and use this has a

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.690 
noticed in practice and use this has a
constant<00:03:33.870> elliptical<00:03:34.739> edge<00:03:34.919> of<00:03:35.099> this<00:03:35.220> this

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
constant elliptical edge of this this

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.099 
constant elliptical edge of this this
constant<00:03:36.180> curve<00:03:37.069> really<00:03:38.069> makes<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.579> cut

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
constant curve really makes this cut

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.589 
constant curve really makes this cut
just<00:03:40.430> impressively<00:03:41.430> well<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.940> does<00:03:42.090> amazing

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
just impressively well it does amazing

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.860 
just impressively well it does amazing
on<00:03:42.750> food<00:03:43.260> or<00:03:43.470> wood<00:03:44.209> what<00:03:45.209> are<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.389> doing<00:03:45.720> it

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
on food or wood what are you doing it

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.440 
on food or wood what are you doing it
some<00:03:46.200> comes<00:03:46.829> up<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.160> an<00:03:47.310> ice<00:03:47.549> spear<00:03:47.730> point

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
some comes up to an ice spear point

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.210 
some comes up to an ice spear point
I've<00:03:49.629> had<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.900> put<00:03:50.080> just<00:03:50.349> a<00:03:50.500> slight<00:03:50.739> secondary

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
I've had to put just a slight secondary

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.500 
I've had to put just a slight secondary
bevel<00:03:51.370> up<00:03:51.550> here<00:03:51.700> towards<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:51.940> tip<00:03:52.209> because

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
bevel up here towards the tip because

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.990 
bevel up here towards the tip because
once<00:03:52.780> when<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:52.989> was<00:03:53.340> drilling<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.430> fireboard<00:03:54.879> I'd

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
once when I was drilling a fireboard I'd

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.880 
once when I was drilling a fireboard I'd
used<00:03:55.180> some<00:03:55.330> sand<00:03:55.629> to<00:03:55.989> try<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.170> work<00:03:56.379> it<00:03:56.470> out<00:03:56.620> and

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
used some sand to try to work it out and

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.350 
used some sand to try to work it out and
didn't<00:03:57.220> clean<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.550> well<00:03:57.730> enough<00:03:57.940> using<00:03:58.300> this

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
didn't clean that well enough using this

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.300 
didn't clean that well enough using this
to<00:03:58.510> keep<00:03:58.629> drilling<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.440> thus<00:03:59.769> and<00:04:00.190> my

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
to keep drilling and thus and my

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.680 
to keep drilling and thus and my
edge<00:04:00.489> has<00:04:00.940> nothing<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.300> do<00:04:01.360> with<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.510> maker

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
edge has nothing to do with the maker

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.650 
edge has nothing to do with the maker
that's<00:04:02.080> just<00:04:02.319> user<00:04:02.739> stupidity<00:04:03.400> but<00:04:04.239> in<00:04:04.420> hand

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
that's just user stupidity but in hand

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.729 
that's just user stupidity but in hand
it's<00:04:04.870> just<00:04:05.080> it<00:04:05.260> fits<00:04:05.530> me<00:04:05.709> perfectly<00:04:07.739> it's

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
it's just it fits me perfectly it's

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.110 
it's just it fits me perfectly it's
another<00:04:08.980> egg<00:04:09.250> shape<00:04:09.550> sort<00:04:09.849> of<00:04:09.910> been<00:04:10.000> there

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
another egg shape sort of been there

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.850 
another egg shape sort of been there
sort<00:04:10.390> of<00:04:10.420> like<00:04:10.540> Brendan's<00:04:10.930> Brendan's<00:04:11.709> is<00:04:11.830> a

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
sort of like Brendan's Brendan's is a

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.370 
sort of like Brendan's Brendan's is a
little<00:04:12.099> wider<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:12.910> more<00:04:13.030> broad<00:04:13.360> this<00:04:14.200> is

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
little wider and more broad this is

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.620 
little wider and more broad this is
actually<00:04:14.709> a<00:04:14.739> better<00:04:14.980> fit<00:04:15.310> for<00:04:15.340> me<00:04:15.630> he's

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
actually a better fit for me he's

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.750 
actually a better fit for me he's
obviously<00:04:16.870> got<00:04:17.079> these<00:04:17.290> down<00:04:17.500> so<00:04:18.340> that<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.579> can

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
obviously got these down so that you can

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.550 
obviously got these down so that you can
use<00:04:18.940> some<00:04:19.359> really<00:04:19.660> comfortable<00:04:20.079> side<00:04:20.260> grips

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
use some really comfortable side grips

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.760 
use some really comfortable side grips
you<00:04:21.489> really<00:04:21.700> got<00:04:21.820> good<00:04:22.000> control<00:04:22.210> there<00:04:22.770> but

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
you really got good control there but

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.159 
you really got good control there but
it's<00:04:24.040> um<00:04:24.250> it's<00:04:24.639> also<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:25.389> little<00:04:25.660> longer<00:04:25.960> than

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
it's um it's also a little longer than

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.820 
it's um it's also a little longer than
the<00:04:26.260> others<00:04:26.440> at<00:04:26.560> nine<00:04:26.740> inches<00:04:27.570> but<00:04:28.570> easily<00:04:28.930> my

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
the others at nine inches but easily my

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.409 
the others at nine inches but easily my
favorite<00:04:30.220> bushcraft<00:04:30.610> knife<00:04:30.700> I<00:04:31.000> believe<00:04:31.270> this

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
favorite bushcraft knife I believe this

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.090 
favorite bushcraft knife I believe this
one<00:04:31.570> comes<00:04:31.780> in<00:04:31.930> around<00:04:32.080> 1<00:04:32.290> 45<00:04:32.530> right<00:04:32.950> now

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
one comes in around 1 45 right now

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.190 
one comes in around 1 45 right now
roughly<00:04:33.460> um<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.360> don't<00:04:34.419> believe<00:04:34.840> that's<00:04:34.990> where

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
roughly um I don't believe that's where

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.250 
roughly um I don't believe that's where
the<00:04:35.290> sheath<00:04:35.530> but<00:04:35.889> if<00:04:36.790> you<00:04:37.300> have<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.690> means<00:04:37.900> and

the sheath but if you have the means and

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.469 
these are now reviews i guess so much it
just<00:04:54.010> thoughts<00:04:54.610> on<00:04:54.789> the<00:04:54.850> knife's<00:04:55.060> I've<00:04:55.180> gotten

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479

so<00:04:55.630> you<00:04:55.720> guys<00:04:55.840> can<00:04:55.990> get<00:04:56.110> a<00:04:56.169> better<00:04:56.320> idea<00:04:56.440> of

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
so you guys can get a better idea of

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.620 
so you guys can get a better idea of
size<00:04:56.919> and<00:04:56.950> stuff<00:04:57.520> like<00:04:57.639> that<00:04:57.729> so<00:04:58.120> we'll<00:04:58.539> get
