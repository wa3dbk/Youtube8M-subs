00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.959
 Hello 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.370
 the week is already said and this week we 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.950
 let's focus on a technique that is the 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.080
 thumb harmonious hated in columns 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.240
 acquired by others today I come to you 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.220
 explain two recommendations before 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.960
 start working if they have 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.910
 problems with the leak or you feel that 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.040
 have problems with the leak I invite you to 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.040
 see my video of three tips or three 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.350
 tips for the tank and right hand for 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.809
 then work on this other advice 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.500
 what I am going to give you is in this exercise 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.020
 please occupy of intention and in addition you 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.060
 I'm going to ask you to fill the volume of the 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:04.600
 guitar in 10 to the maximum and in addition 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.270
 you occupy the capsule or microphone of the bridge 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.770
 Now that we are clear about this, I am going to 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.070
 ask us to run a small 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.180
 exercise on the rope 3 in space 5 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.180
 with the finger 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.190
 and then with him I have one we play 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.960
 gently somewhere in space in 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.060
 the string where the fingerboard ends and 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.060
 start the bridge in this way 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.360
 when which is an appropriate sound 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.300
 look at where you are playing and 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.330
 memorizes that the execution of the technique 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.220
 it's not complicated at all, there's only 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.190
 to realize what we are 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.850
 doing and for that I divided this 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.280
 exercise in three simple steps the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.830
 first step let's imagine that this is a 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:03.060
 rope the first step is going to be run 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.460
 the second step is going to be to feel like the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.320
 Rope touches on this part of the thumb 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.370
 is 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.800
 and then remove step 1 I touch step 2 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.270
 I feel the string I hear a harmonic and 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.940
 I remove the finger step 1 executed 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.750
 Step 2 executed but instead of now 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.150
 get your hand out so the rope will sound 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.150
 I'm going to run and I'm going to lower my hand 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.150
 and I'm going to leave her in this position in this 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.940
 moment my thumb is touching the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.440
 rope number 3 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.620
 and then I just withdraw and when 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.570
 retirement let the harmonic sound if you have 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.390
 complications to sound this 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.670
 technique the number one problem is 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.460
 normally we occupy the barb very 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:02.340
 outside instead of occupying the inside 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:04.900
 when the she executed and knocked on the rope 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.910
 this rope has to bounce a little 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.220
 to touch the thumb if you have 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.960
 many played outside will get here 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.490
 and will reach us to touch it but that 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.990
 will get here and it will not sound 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.350
 never try to keep it close to your finger 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.990
 they would now give something else if it really is 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.090
 you want your harmonics are very very 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.330
 strong and very accurately and a lot 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.940
 force and a lot of sound try to lower the 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.530
 rope with force so that after 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.530
 when I execute that the harmonic 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.909
 sound strong 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.440
 well that's what I'd like to deny 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.510
 some things that have to do with the 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.150
 guitar itself many people say I 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.640
 heard that it depends a lot on Cuba 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.860
 that occupies if the harmonic of 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.240
 thumb that works or not that's a big 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.790
 lie and I show it to you 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.790
 I have a Ivan is to return 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.730
 there it is I have a great I went to the garden 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.420
 I have about 3 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:25.960
 and I have a stability I have 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.389
 with my own finger so it's not because 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.490
 this is not for the Cuba do not have accounts 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.340
 it's only technical if the video 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.860
 liked I'm going to ask you to give me a like 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.960
 and I know you liked it a lot I'll ask you 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.599
 that you subscribe because in the channel 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.360
 I'm going up every Sunday of 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:46.210
 classes that are a little broader and 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.550
 this type of exercises that are tips of 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.740
 the week they go every Wednesday and 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.629
 on Thursdays do not miss out on tuning that 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.629
 this is coming very good thank you very much
