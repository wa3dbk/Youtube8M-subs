hi<00:00:00.960> my<00:00:01.140> name's<00:00:01.290> Andy<00:00:01.560> and<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:01.949> part<00:00:02.250> 2<00:00:02.460> of

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hi my name's Andy and this is part 2 of

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.240 
hi my name's Andy and this is part 2 of
my<00:00:02.730> first<00:00:03.360> Raspberry<00:00:03.780> Pi<00:00:03.810> game<00:00:04.200> we're<00:00:05.160> going

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
my first Raspberry Pi game we're going

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.190 
my first Raspberry Pi game we're going
to<00:00:05.339> write<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:06.120> simplest<00:00:06.480> possible<00:00:06.660> program

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
to write the simplest possible program

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.379 
to write the simplest possible program
we<00:00:07.290> can<00:00:07.410> write<00:00:07.620> today<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.670> program<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.360> just

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
we can write today a program that just

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.049 
we can write today a program that just
says<00:00:09.660> hello<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.550> if<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.700> missed<00:00:11.910> out<00:00:12.030> on

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
says hello to you if you missed out on

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.640 
says hello to you if you missed out on
the<00:00:12.179> first<00:00:12.330> part<00:00:12.630> that's<00:00:12.840> how<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.080> get<00:00:13.410> hold

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
the first part that's how you get hold

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.250 
the first part that's how you get hold
of<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.799> Raspberry<00:00:14.190> Pi<00:00:14.250> how<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.240> get<00:00:15.480> get<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.080> set

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
of a Raspberry Pi how to get get it set

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.290 
of a Raspberry Pi how to get get it set
up<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:17.369> looks<00:00:17.670> like<00:00:17.850> how<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.150> going

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
up so that it looks like how it's going

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.929 
up so that it looks like how it's going
to<00:00:18.359> look<00:00:18.480> when<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.900> look<00:00:19.020> at<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.320> second

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
to look when we look at it in a second

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.429 
to look when we look at it in a second
today<00:00:20.939> we're<00:00:21.390> going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.570> cover<00:00:22.020> things<00:00:22.350> like

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
today we're going to cover things like

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.490 
today we're going to cover things like
basically<00:00:22.920> what<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> computer<00:00:23.519> program<00:00:24.500> how

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
basically what is a computer program how

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.890 
basically what is a computer program how
do<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.680> run<00:00:25.859> one<00:00:26.039> how<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.340> write<00:00:26.519> one<00:00:26.900> so

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
do you run one how do you write one so

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.990 
do you run one how do you write one so
if<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.619> followed<00:00:28.920> part<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.460> should<00:00:29.730> have

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
if you followed part one you should have

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.200 
if you followed part one you should have
a<00:00:30.900> Raspberry<00:00:31.470> Pi<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.769> has<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> screen<00:00:33.030> that

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
a Raspberry Pi that has a screen that

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.479 
a Raspberry Pi that has a screen that
looks<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.390> bit<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:34.160> with<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> great<00:00:35.340> big

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
looks a bit like this with a great big

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.790 
looks a bit like this with a great big
raspberry<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.719> your<00:00:36.930> TV<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.500> you've<00:00:37.680> got<00:00:37.770> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
raspberry on your TV and you've got a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.139 
raspberry on your TV and you've got a
mouse<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.160> keyboard<00:00:38.190> plugged<00:00:38.579> into<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.969> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
mouse and a keyboard plugged into it so

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.840 
mouse and a keyboard plugged into it so
you<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.620> control<00:00:40.620> stuff<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.160> yours<00:00:41.700> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
you can control stuff on it yours is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.250 
you can control stuff on it yours is
probably<00:00:42.059> gonna<00:00:42.329> your<00:00:42.629> raspberries<00:00:42.930> probably

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
probably gonna your raspberries probably

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.510 
probably gonna your raspberries probably
look<00:00:43.469> smaller<00:00:43.739> everything<00:00:44.160> probably<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
look smaller everything probably a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.000 
look smaller everything probably a
little<00:00:44.610> bit<00:00:44.820> smaller<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.239> yours<00:00:45.739> unless<00:00:46.739> your

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
little bit smaller on yours unless your

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.540 
little bit smaller on yours unless your
TV<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.370> quite<00:00:47.579> small<00:00:48.770> I'm<00:00:49.770> quite<00:00:50.070> zoomed<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.460> on

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
TV is quite small I'm quite zoomed in on

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.970 
TV is quite small I'm quite zoomed in on
this<00:00:50.730> screen<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> same

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
this screen but it's the same

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.670 
this screen but it's the same
everything's<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> same<00:00:53.100> really<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> first

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
everything's the same really so first

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.840 
everything's the same really so first
I'm<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.280> assuming<00:00:56.640> you've<00:00:56.730> got

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
I'm going to do it assuming you've got

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.450 
I'm going to do it assuming you've got
this<00:00:57.000> very<00:00:57.590> posh<00:00:58.590> screen<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:58.920> set<00:00:59.129> up<00:00:59.309> is

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
this very posh screen all set up is

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.220 
this very posh screen all set up is
we're<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.090> write<00:01:00.539> our<00:01:00.809> first<00:01:01.020> computer

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
we're going to write our first computer

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.750 
we're going to write our first computer
program<00:01:01.649> we're<00:01:01.800> gonna<00:01:01.920> jump<00:01:02.219> straight<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
program we're gonna jump straight in and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.160 
program we're gonna jump straight in and
do<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.539> well<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.780> go<00:01:03.960> down

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
do it so what do you do well you go down

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.679 
do it so what do you do well you go down
here<00:01:04.640> click<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.939> weird<00:01:06.210> little<00:01:06.450> arrow

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
here click on this weird little arrow

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.990 
here click on this weird little arrow
play<00:01:06.869> anything<00:01:07.049> click<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.130> accessories<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
play anything click on accessories and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.810 
play anything click on accessories and
then<00:01:09.150> leafpad<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:10.770> leaf<00:01:10.950> plant<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> text

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
then leafpad the leaf plant is a text

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.870 
then leafpad the leaf plant is a text
editor<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.510> means<00:01:12.750> an<00:01:13.530> editor<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.580> which<00:01:14.700> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
editor that means an editor in which you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.050 
editor that means an editor in which you
can<00:01:15.030> write<00:01:15.259> text<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> write<00:01:16.680> writing<00:01:17.060> so

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
can write text you can write writing so

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.370 
can write text you can write writing so
you<00:01:18.119> don't<00:01:18.600> need<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.020> for<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> first

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you don't need to do this for the first

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.800 
you don't need to do this for the first
thing<00:01:19.560> I'm<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.210> is<00:01:21.210> make<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> font

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
thing I'm going to do is make the font

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.520 
thing I'm going to do is make the font
bigger<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.680> what's<00:01:22.860> going<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:24.530> so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
bigger so you can see what's going on so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.929 
bigger so you can see what's going on so
you<00:01:25.560> might<00:01:25.860> find<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.189> font<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.460> fine<00:01:26.640> how<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you might find the font is fine how it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.569 
you might find the font is fine how it
is<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:27.960> help<00:01:28.080> me<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.220> now<00:01:29.490> I've

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
is but that will help me so now I've

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.069 
is but that will help me so now I've
done<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.759> let's<00:01:30.119> write<00:01:30.299> our<00:01:30.540> first<00:01:30.780> computer

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
done that let's write our first computer

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
done that let's write our first computer
program<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.530> need<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.770> type<00:01:32.009> exactly<00:01:32.189> what<00:01:32.640> I

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
program you need to type exactly what I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.429 
program you need to type exactly what I
type<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.570> later<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.900> I'll<00:01:34.020> show<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.259> what

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
type a bit later on I'll show you what

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.410 
type a bit later on I'll show you what

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
helloworld so we go to the file menu

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.540 
helloworld so we go to the file menu
save<00:02:21.220> us<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:23.410> place<00:02:23.590> we<00:02:23.740> want<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.920> save<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.370> is

save us the place we want to save it is

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.220 
save us the place we want to save it is
in<00:02:24.730> our<00:02:24.850> home<00:02:25.090> folder<00:02:25.510> which<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.660> called<00:02:25.990> pi

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
in our home folder which is called pi

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.010 
in our home folder which is called pi
because<00:02:27.220> our<00:02:27.370> name<00:02:27.880> on<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.180> Raspberry<00:02:28.630> Pi<00:02:28.660> is

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
because our name on this Raspberry Pi is

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.250 
because our name on this Raspberry Pi is
PI<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:29.530> click<00:02:29.800> on<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.040> PI<00:02:30.810> type<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.050> name

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
PI so click on the PI type in the name

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.170 
PI so click on the PI type in the name
and<00:02:32.530> because<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.700> game<00:02:33.880> we're<00:02:34.030> going<00:02:34.120> to

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
and because the game we're going to

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.340 
and because the game we're going to
write<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:34.480> going<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.660> be<00:02:34.720> called<00:02:34.900> red<00:02:35.080> green

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
write is going to be called red green

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.780 
write is going to be called red green
I'm<00:02:35.530> going<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.710> call<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.030> red<00:02:37.030> green<00:02:37.600> dot<00:02:38.560> P<00:02:39.310> Y

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
I'm going to call this red green dot P Y

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.060 
I'm going to call this red green dot P Y
so<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.600> red<00:02:40.750> green<00:02:40.990> part<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.620> name<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:41.830> it

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
so the red green part is the name of it

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.560 
so the red green part is the name of it
notice<00:02:42.550> that<00:02:42.730> there's<00:02:42.940> no<00:02:43.060> capitals<00:02:43.480> or

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
notice that there's no capitals or

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.750 
notice that there's no capitals or
anything<00:02:43.810> just<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:44.020> make<00:02:44.170> my<00:02:44.320> life<00:02:44.530> simpler<00:02:44.860> no

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
anything just to make my life simpler no

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.340 
anything just to make my life simpler no
space<00:02:46.060> there's<00:02:46.360> nothing<00:02:46.690> like<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.170> then

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
space there's nothing like that and then

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.770 
space there's nothing like that and then
there's<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.590> dot<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.160> then<00:02:48.370> there's<00:02:48.580> py<00:02:48.970> which

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
there's a dot and then there's py which

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.330 
there's a dot and then there's py which
means<00:02:49.990> this<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.380> program<00:02:50.770> written<00:02:50.920> in<00:02:51.220> the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
means this is a program written in the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.690 
means this is a program written in the
programming<00:02:51.790> language<00:02:52.210> Python<00:02:53.430> we'll<00:02:54.430> find

programming language Python we'll find

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.480 
programming language Python we'll find
out<00:02:54.820> more<00:02:54.850> about<00:02:55.030> Python<00:02:55.570> as<00:02:55.630> we<00:02:55.720> go<00:02:55.870> on<00:02:56.050> but

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
out more about Python as we go on but

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.560 
out more about Python as we go on but
all<00:02:57.490> you<00:02:57.670> need<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.880> know<00:02:57.970> for<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.180> moment<00:02:58.330> is

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
all you need to know for the moment is

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.540 
all you need to know for the moment is
that<00:02:58.720> it's<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.930> language<00:02:59.110> in<00:02:59.980> which<00:03:00.130> we<00:03:00.400> can

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
that it's a language in which we can

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.100 
that it's a language in which we can
write<00:03:00.700> programs<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.390> reason<00:03:01.660> why<00:03:01.780> print

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
write programs and the reason why print

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.080 
write programs and the reason why print
and<00:03:02.380> in<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:02.680> hello<00:03:03.250> world<00:03:03.520> string<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:04.000> we

and in that hello world string that we
wrote<00:03:04.330> works<00:03:05.080> is<00:03:05.350> because<00:03:05.650> that's<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.950> way

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
wrote works is because that's the way

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.890 
wrote works is because that's the way
you<00:03:06.130> can<00:03:06.310> write<00:03:06.520> commands<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.120> Python<00:03:07.540> so

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900

the font on this window a lot bigger

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.120 
the font on this window a lot bigger
which<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:35.020> may<00:03:35.200> or<00:03:35.350> may<00:03:35.500> not<00:03:35.530> want<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:35.950> do

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
which you may or may not want to do

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.950 
which you may or may not want to do
yourself<00:03:36.730> we're<00:03:37.120> just<00:03:37.240> gonna<00:03:37.360> make<00:03:37.540> our<00:03:37.720> lives

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
yourself we're just gonna make our lives

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.540 
yourself we're just gonna make our lives
easier<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:40.450> there<00:03:40.870> we<00:03:40.959> go

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
easier so there we go

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.150 
easier so there we go
now<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.880> terminal<00:03:43.600> is<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.410> program<00:03:44.860> which

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
now the a terminal is a program which

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.420 
now the a terminal is a program which
runs<00:03:45.490> other<00:03:45.850> programs<00:03:46.740> so<00:03:47.740> this<00:03:47.920> terminal<00:03:48.280> is

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
runs other programs so this terminal is

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.949 
runs other programs so this terminal is
the<00:03:48.490> program<00:03:48.880> we're<00:03:49.000> gonna<00:03:49.180> use<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.510> run<00:03:49.690> our

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
the program we're gonna use to run our

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.720 
the program we're gonna use to run our
program<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.740> way<00:03:50.860> we<00:03:51.010> run<00:03:51.130> our<00:03:51.190> program

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
program and the way we run our program

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.699 
program and the way we run our program
the<00:03:51.940> way<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.120> run<00:03:52.330> any<00:03:52.570> Python<00:03:53.050> program<00:03:53.440> one

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
the way you run any Python program one

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.630 
the way you run any Python program one
way<00:03:53.860> is<00:03:54.520> you<00:03:54.580> talk<00:03:54.910> Python<00:03:55.420> which<00:03:55.750> means<00:03:56.640> run

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
way is you talk Python which means run

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.280 
way is you talk Python which means run
their<00:03:57.850> program<00:03:58.300> called<00:03:58.540> Python<00:03:58.930> which<00:03:59.080> runs

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
their program called Python which runs

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.710 
their program called Python which runs
pison<00:03:59.680> programs<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.760> then<00:04:01.150> we<00:04:01.180> give<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.540> name

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
pison programs and then we give the name

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.050 
pison programs and then we give the name
of<00:04:01.990> our<00:04:02.230> program<00:04:02.410> we're<00:04:03.280> already<00:04:03.459> in<00:04:03.730> our<00:04:03.880> home

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
of our program we're already in our home

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.380 
of our program we're already in our home
directory<00:04:05.459> so<00:04:06.459> we<00:04:06.490> can<00:04:06.700> just<00:04:06.880> type<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.360> name

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
directory so we can just type the name

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.290 
directory so we can just type the name
of<00:04:07.600> our<00:04:07.690> program<00:04:08.020> which<00:04:08.140> is<00:04:08.320> red<00:04:08.890> green<00:04:08.920> hi<00:04:09.610> so

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
of our program which is red green hi so

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.480 
of our program which is red green hi so
what<00:04:10.450> we're<00:04:10.570> saying<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:11.010> run<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.040> Python

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
what we're saying is run a Python

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.070 
what we're saying is run a Python
program<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.240> name<00:04:13.420> of<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:13.660> person<00:04:13.810> river

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
program and the name of the person river

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.820 
program and the name of the person river
we<00:04:14.230> want<00:04:14.380> you<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.590> run<00:04:14.770> is<00:04:15.400> red<00:04:15.910> green<00:04:15.940> dot<00:04:16.359> pi

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
we want you to run is red green dot pi

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.440 
we want you to run is red green dot pi
when<00:04:17.830> I<00:04:17.859> press<00:04:18.100> return<00:04:20.370> our<00:04:21.370> program<00:04:21.820> runs<00:04:22.030> and

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
when I press return our program runs and

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.580 
when I press return our program runs and
what<00:04:22.720> our<00:04:22.840> program<00:04:23.200> does

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
what our program does

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.050 
what our program does
exactly<00:04:24.010> what<00:04:24.130> we<00:04:24.250> told<00:04:24.400> you<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.610> do<00:04:24.730> it<00:04:24.760> writes

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
exactly what we told you to do it writes

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.280 
exactly what we told you to do it writes
to<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.389> screen<00:04:25.919> hello<00:04:26.919> world<00:04:27.660> so<00:04:28.660> well<00:04:28.900> done

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
to the screen hello world so well done

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.860 
to the screen hello world so well done
we've<00:04:29.470> written<00:04:29.650> our<00:04:29.830> first-ever<00:04:30.190> program<00:04:30.870> and

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
we've written our first-ever program and

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.540 
we've written our first-ever program and
it<00:04:32.050> did<00:04:32.229> exactly<00:04:32.470> what<00:04:32.680> we<00:04:32.889> expected<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.400> do

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
it did exactly what we expected it to do

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.909 
it did exactly what we expected it to do
if<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.750> type<00:04:34.990> something<00:04:35.020> wrong<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:35.800> might

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
if you type something wrong you might

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.050 
if you type something wrong you might
get<00:04:36.100> some<00:04:36.220> other<00:04:36.340> message<00:04:36.520> so<00:04:36.850> I'm<00:04:36.910> very

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
get some other message so I'm very

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.250 
get some other message so I'm very
quickly<00:04:37.389> going<00:04:37.630> to<00:04:37.690> show<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:37.930> what<00:04:38.080> might

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
quickly going to show you what might

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.140 
quickly going to show you what might
happen<00:04:38.380> if<00:04:38.949> you<00:04:39.100> type<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.310> name<00:04:39.550> Python<00:04:39.970> wrong

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
happen if you type the name Python wrong

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.360 
happen if you type the name Python wrong
for<00:04:40.330> example<00:04:40.389> you<00:04:41.350> added<00:04:41.620> some<00:04:41.740> extra<00:04:41.860> numbers

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
for example you added some extra numbers

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.980 
for example you added some extra numbers
here<00:04:42.520> so<00:04:42.669> Python<00:04:43.030> was<00:04:43.180> spelled<00:04:43.449> wrongly<00:04:43.690> and

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
here so Python was spelled wrongly and

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.230 
here so Python was spelled wrongly and
then<00:04:44.080> press<00:04:44.260> return<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:45.520> would<00:04:45.639> say<00:04:45.790> that<00:04:45.820> so

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
then press return it would say that so

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.400 
then press return it would say that so
if<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.449> type<00:04:46.600> Python<00:04:46.960> wrong<00:04:47.080> it'll<00:04:47.260> say

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
if you type Python wrong it'll say

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.629 
if you type Python wrong it'll say
command<00:04:47.740> not<00:04:47.860> found<00:04:47.919> because<00:04:48.280> he<00:04:48.460> doesn't

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
command not found because he doesn't

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.800 
command not found because he doesn't
know<00:04:48.850> what<00:04:49.600> piped<00:04:50.410> 546<00:04:51.310> one<00:04:51.760> is<00:04:52.060> it<00:04:52.570> doesn't

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
know what piped 546 one is it doesn't

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.960 
know what piped 546 one is it doesn't
know<00:04:52.870> what<00:04:52.990> python<00:04:53.350> is<00:04:53.500> also<00:04:54.370> if<00:04:54.520> you<00:04:54.639> gave<00:04:54.790> the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
know what python is also if you gave the

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.719 
know what python is also if you gave the
name<00:04:55.180> of<00:04:55.330> your<00:04:55.419> program<00:04:55.660> wrong<00:04:56.139> for<00:04:56.350> example

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
name of your program wrong for example

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.590 
name of your program wrong for example
let's<00:04:57.729> imagine<00:04:57.880> you<00:04:58.150> put<00:04:58.270> a<00:04:58.330> space<00:04:58.600> in<00:04:58.630> there

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
let's imagine you put a space in there

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.360 
let's imagine you put a space in there
then<00:05:01.600> it's<00:05:01.750> gonna<00:05:01.870> say<00:05:02.139> I<00:05:02.530> couldn't<00:05:02.950> find<00:05:03.220> that

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
then it's gonna say I couldn't find that

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.219 
then it's gonna say I couldn't find that
file<00:05:03.700> I<00:05:03.940> can't<00:05:04.180> open<00:05:04.450> that<00:05:04.479> file<00:05:04.810> so<00:05:05.050> that's

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
file I can't open that file so that's

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.360 
file I can't open that file so that's
what<00:05:05.410> it's<00:05:05.530> gonna<00:05:05.590> say<00:05:05.889> if<00:05:06.040> you've<00:05:06.160> got<00:05:06.280> the

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
what it's gonna say if you've got the

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.210 
what it's gonna say if you've got the
name<00:05:06.520> wrong<00:05:07.110> something<00:05:08.110> like<00:05:08.260> that<00:05:08.440> now<00:05:09.010> let's

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
name wrong something like that now let's

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.590 
name wrong something like that now let's
imagine<00:05:09.310> you've<00:05:09.639> got<00:05:09.669> your<00:05:09.880> program<00:05:10.360> wrong

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
imagine you've got your program wrong

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.030 
imagine you've got your program wrong
I'm<00:05:10.780> sure<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:11.260> would<00:05:11.380> never<00:05:11.500> do<00:05:11.680> that<00:05:11.860> because

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
I'm sure you would never do that because

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.340 
I'm sure you would never do that because
you're<00:05:12.280> an<00:05:12.370> expert<00:05:12.639> programmer<00:05:13.120> but<00:05:13.990> some<00:05:14.229> of

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
you're an expert programmer but some of

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.320 
you're an expert programmer but some of
us<00:05:14.410> are<00:05:14.620> amateurs<00:05:15.010> and<00:05:15.190> we<00:05:15.310> might<00:05:15.490> write<00:05:16.150> our

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
us are amateurs and we might write our

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.850 
us are amateurs and we might write our
program<00:05:16.660> wrong<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:17.020> instead<00:05:17.229> of<00:05:17.289> typing<00:05:17.530> print

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
program wrong so instead of typing print

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.290 
program wrong so instead of typing print
let's<00:05:18.070> imagine<00:05:18.760> you<00:05:19.060> type<00:05:19.210> print<00:05:19.510> 23<00:05:20.020> Internet

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
let's imagine you type print 23 Internet

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.090 
let's imagine you type print 23 Internet
and<00:05:22.300> then<00:05:22.449> if<00:05:22.570> I<00:05:22.660> to<00:05:22.720> do<00:05:22.960> save<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.740> save<00:05:23.889> that

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
and then if I to do save to save that

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.790 
and then if I to do save to save that
program<00:05:25.350> and<00:05:26.350> run<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:26.650> again<00:05:28.530> remove<00:05:29.530> that<00:05:29.650> app

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
program and run it again remove that app

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.790 
program and run it again remove that app
so<00:05:29.950> you<00:05:30.039> can<00:05:30.100> see<00:05:31.139> press<00:05:32.139> return<00:05:32.289> what<00:05:32.620> does<00:05:32.710> it

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
so you can see press return what does it

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.700 
so you can see press return what does it
say<00:05:33.010> well<00:05:33.310> it<00:05:33.400> says<00:05:33.580> invalid<00:05:34.000> syntax

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
say well it says invalid syntax

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.510 
say well it says invalid syntax
basically<00:05:35.710> there's<00:05:35.919> something<00:05:36.280> wrong<00:05:36.430> in

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
basically there's something wrong in

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.920 
basically there's something wrong in
your<00:05:36.550> program<00:05:37.000> so<00:05:37.030> those<00:05:37.360> are<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.600> kinds<00:05:37.900> of

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
your program so those are the kinds of

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.570 
your program so those are the kinds of
messages<00:05:38.110> you<00:05:38.350> might<00:05:38.560> see<00:05:38.800> if<00:05:39.190> you<00:05:39.280> see<00:05:39.400> any<00:05:39.520> of

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
messages you might see if you see any of

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.330 
messages you might see if you see any of
those<00:05:39.700> messages<00:05:39.910> just<00:05:40.300> check<00:05:40.570> back<00:05:40.780> over

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
those messages just check back over

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.909 
those messages just check back over

hopefully<00:05:49.240> once<00:05:49.599> you've<00:05:49.780> corrected<00:05:50.200> it<00:05:50.349> so

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
hopefully once you've corrected it so

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.950 
hopefully once you've corrected it so
that<00:05:52.590> it<00:05:53.590> looks<00:05:53.770> exactly<00:05:53.950> as<00:05:54.400> I've<00:05:54.580> shown<00:05:54.789> you

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
that it looks exactly as I've shown you

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.480 
that it looks exactly as I've shown you
then<00:05:55.960> it<00:05:56.080> will<00:05:56.229> act<00:05:56.500> exactly<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:57.220> way<00:05:57.340> I've

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
then it will act exactly the way I've

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.379 
then it will act exactly the way I've
shown<00:05:57.729> you<00:05:59.370> and<00:06:00.370> that's<00:06:00.610> it<00:06:00.729> for<00:06:00.940> today<00:06:01.120> we

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
shown you and that's it for today we

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.000 
shown you and that's it for today we
we've<00:06:01.810> written<00:06:01.960> a<00:06:02.080> program<00:06:02.410> we've<00:06:02.560> run<00:06:02.710> it<00:06:02.830> and

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
we've written a program we've run it and

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.040 
we've written a program we've run it and
it<00:06:03.130> works<00:06:03.450> next<00:06:04.450> time<00:06:04.630> we're<00:06:04.780> going<00:06:04.870> to<00:06:04.930> write

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
it works next time we're going to write

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.210 
it works next time we're going to write
a<00:06:05.080> program<00:06:05.260> that<00:06:05.470> actually<00:06:05.830> looks<00:06:06.010> something

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
a program that actually looks something

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.000 
a program that actually looks something
like<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:06.700> game<00:06:06.849> we<00:06:07.060> want<00:06:07.240> to<00:06:07.360> write<00:06:08.010> explain

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
like the game we want to write explain

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.190 
like the game we want to write explain
exactly<00:06:09.280> what<00:06:09.580> that<00:06:09.610> game<00:06:09.880> is<00:06:10.120> so<00:06:10.599> see<00:06:11.139> you

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
exactly what that game is so see you

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.530 
exactly what that game is so see you
next<00:06:11.410> time
