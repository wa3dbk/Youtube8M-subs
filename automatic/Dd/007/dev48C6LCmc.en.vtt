00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 two 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.960
 i 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.320
 hi here micaela again and today we are going 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.350
 to make a card using part of what 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.320
 what was the car kit or the kit for 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.239
 may cards from simon says stamp 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.340
 I know I'm a bit behind but good 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.129
 with the whole trip in the middle the truth 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.720
 that I could not make time to arrive with 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.250
 all the videos but it does not matter 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.199
 let's start let's use this set of 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.510
 stamps that comes with the kit that you 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.030
 they call congratulations and it also comes 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.840
 with all these papers that are all 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.450
 they have applied a fossil application 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.369
 golden that shines very cute also that 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.110
 I like it better and with those we are going to 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.480
 work with any of these 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.940
 to start this paper measures 6 inches 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.770
 x 6 inches and one card measures 4 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.810
 inches in a quarter by 5 inches and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.240
 mean but that I want each of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.790
 the lines in this case the black gray 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.950
 pink and white have the same width 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.780
 inside a card but as I have 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.310
 that get to 5 inches and a half in 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.979
 actually what I have to do is 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.410
 take away a quarter of a quarter of 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.140
 inch to each color line for that 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.470
 let's use nicotine and in principle 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.720
 let's cut each color strip with its 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.300
 golden line and each color strip 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.390
 let's cut that quarter of a 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.700
 inch I hope you understand we cut 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.950
 the first throws the black with gold and the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.350
 we separate now first the gray him 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.570
 we remove the quarter inch that 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.640
 just that band-aid and now we cut him 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.070
 the quarter inch to the black strip that 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.190
 we removed before that it is also only 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.990
 to satirize in this way I'm 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.560
 balancing the widths of the strips 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.280
 of colors 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.100
 now we cut the strip of cris with its 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.370
 golden strip and we separated it see that 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.470
 they have the same width 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.659
 it's almost the same width and now we do 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.879
 the same with the rose with its golden strip 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.470
 first we separate it from the white one and 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.330
 now we take him out of that room 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.610
 quarter inch now that we have 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.769
 all the separate colors let's look and 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.930
 They are all the same size and if not 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.670
 equipment we compare to the line 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.860
 passed for example has a line 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.690
 golden 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.390
 wider than the others then I'll go 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.280
 to cut penita to its infinite what 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.450
 It's good this guillotine is that he 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.480
 the blade runs through a wire 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.270
 or from a filament that you see then 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.030
 when you support the paper and you go down 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.100
 Walking up the road he 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.100
 biotin the filament will mark us 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.540
 it's exactly where you're going to cut 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.540
 I think it looks in the video but it's 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.320
 super useful much more useful than others 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.880
 guillotine 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.220
 we keep matching the papers for 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.900
 that they are all the same and we achieve it 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.940
 now that we have all the papers 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.010
 we're going to make the base for the 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.320
 card in white paper of solar mine 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.270
 cool 110-pound thick that 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.640
 We cut to the extent of 5 inches and 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.310
 average by 8 and a half inches and then with 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.600
 the board to fold cards we fold 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.510
 to the extent of 4 inches and touch 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.610
 Now that we have the base made 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.650
 we return to put my personal stamp 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.450
 and we're going to start putting together the card or 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.660
 at least do a little bit of planning 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.470
 the planning has been perfect 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.690
 our part but now we take the 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.670
 pink line that is what I want 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.530
 stamp and stamp set 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.300
 congratulations of 'simon 6 are 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.910
 we take the phrase that I am going to stamp 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:55.220
 that is wish you lots of willy true the 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.060
 we assembled a fresh l6 in the press 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.100
 fiscal and to seal in this despite 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.890
 that is not a slippery surface nor 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.380
 nothing can use station set black 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.319
 it is a special ink that is not necessary 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.540
 that the abuse but the most colorful black 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.640
 that I have put together books left with three 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.440
 months 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.480
 the first two times what I did 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.600
 these bars I dried the ink so 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.630
 hurry up to stamp them the third the 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.700
 I managed to seal but a part of the boar 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.070
 I do not know how I wanted to, so I'm going to 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.710
 stamp for the fourth time and thanks to 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.690
 you are a transparent acrylic stamp and 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.760
 that the press is also transparent 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.770
 I can see exactly where they are for 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.260
 so we're going for a fourth time to 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.390
 give in my head but I want it to be 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.520
 perfectly located and in this case the 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.280
 fourth is the expired and it was very good 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.070
 luckily the pencil mark they see 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.720
 the side of the three to mark which 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.400
 it was the average of four inches and a 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.490
 fourth that is the width of the card and 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.680
 locate in that width the central seal 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.919
 well now we start to paste and put together 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.110
 with this we are gaining glue and 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.020
 the card folded so we can 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.650
 cover all the white because then if not 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.470
 we do 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.630
 in this way able later when the 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.090
 we fold a white filament appears that 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.900
 no rubber we will not want to start 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.900
 paste 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.840
 every color strip we have here 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.030
 stops in size then the gray then the 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.540
 rose with the shaft 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.630
 stamps stamped in reality and then 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.520
 the white everything that stands out 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.130
 right of the card we cut it out with 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.200
 a scissors with a precise cut not 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.270
 be afraid and use the base card 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.980
 as ring card and ready this 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.750
