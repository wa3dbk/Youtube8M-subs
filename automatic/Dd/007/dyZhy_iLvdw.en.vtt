00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hi girls then in this video vi 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.610
 I want to show the difference on 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.509
 my cdc size of pic usage 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.759
 ac atcm or that is max's you will see 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.279
 then just something that I will get well 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.310
 see that anyway like that of the ecm 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.380
 put cane cippa lippa now there is a 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.480
 before I used it but often we are 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.640
 heated instead you want to mark I don't have 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.920
 no need to even heat it 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.590
 so I'm not losing the release too 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.200
 directly the demonstration is given 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.700
 it will be a very short video and I hope there is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.820
 may be useful see you next 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.899
 we tell you then I'm doing the test 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.980
 in the sense I would like to see if I can do 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.399
 review the effectiveness on me of 10 e 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.739
 of mark compared to that of the ecm before 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.149
 to throw it we say that they spend it 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.620
 a word because I still don't know if 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.870
 this I will succeed in published because of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.730
 the trick I did but I don't know if 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.250
 what you can appreciate but I try it 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.550
 at the very edge I delete it and do it 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.360
 another type of make-up in short time 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.120
 on this eye 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.920
 I have to look for a way in which light does 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.170
 see better then these are the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:25.270
 that right eyelashes on this I will use that 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:27.580
 of ecm unheated and nothing with 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.110
 this 10m usually used tricks 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:39.270
 precisely of threshing floor to heat the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.270
 eyelash curler then this is the result 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.750
 parolo movement don't go insists because 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.850
 to proceed with the same movement is 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.790
 that of max that is 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.800
 result that succeeds doing the same 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.870
 movement that is not wanting to insist 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.370
 too much I show you the effect of 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.370
 that of mark on the left eye 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.280
 that is, you see the difference with the cia 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.110
 I have appeared so many framework I think 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:28.569
 I have to go and explain it to Rome 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.819
 you will completely see that now you 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.370
 they see 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.870
 let's see now I value the computer if the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.540
 difference between one and the other is seen 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.860
 however as far as I'm concerned this 10 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.209
 will end the garbage is that of max 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.870
 mine is certainly for now 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.190
 favorite 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.870
 I didn't try the chanel one and if 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.500
 they were even better 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.730
 but this is what I'll show you 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.660
 I hope it will have been useful and 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.660
 next time already here
