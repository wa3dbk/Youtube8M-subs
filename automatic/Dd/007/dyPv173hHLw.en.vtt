that takes these down we're gonna take
our<00:03:53.480> masking<00:03:53.870> tape<00:03:54.730> where<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.910> end<00:03:56.030> of<00:03:56.180> this

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
our masking tape where the end of this

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.950 
our masking tape where the end of this
thing<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:58.030> just<00:03:59.030> we're<00:03:59.480> gonna<00:03:59.570> kinda<00:03:59.810> make<00:03:59.900> a

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
thing is just we're gonna kinda make a
