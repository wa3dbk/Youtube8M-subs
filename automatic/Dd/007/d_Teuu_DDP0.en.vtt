00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.520 
ops 2 but I also do like Call of Duty go
so<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.080> different<00:01:19.350> people<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
so I'm one of the different people that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.920 
so I'm one of the different people that
actually<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.130> enjoy<00:01:20.850> ecology<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> go<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.780> lot

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
actually I enjoy ecology to go so a lot

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.570 
actually I enjoy ecology to go so a lot
but<00:01:22.049> either<00:01:22.259> way<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> show<00:01:23.369> time

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
but either way I do think the show time

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.310 
but either way I do think the show time
is<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> best<00:01:24.780> maps<00:01:25.049> one

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
is going to be one of the best maps one

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.230 
is going to be one of the best maps one
of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> maps<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.549> everybody's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
of the one of the maps that everybody's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.460 
of the one of the maps that everybody's
been<00:01:27.360> waiting<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.810> people<00:01:28.080> wanted<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
been waiting for people wanted the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.130 
been waiting for people wanted the
shipment<00:01:28.920> remake<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.909> long<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.390> that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
shipment remake for so long like that

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.319 
shipment remake for so long like that
that<00:01:31.560> well<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.280> smallest<00:01:32.549> map<00:01:32.850> ever<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
that well it is the smallest map ever to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.940 
that well it is the smallest map ever to
be<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.509> any<00:01:33.630> college<00:01:33.869> ID<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> think<00:01:34.740> that's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
be in any college ID so I think that's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
be in any college ID so I think that's
gonna<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.340> an<00:01:35.490> amazing<00:01:35.820> situation<00:01:36.659> for

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
gonna be an amazing situation for

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.149 
gonna be an amazing situation for
college<00:01:37.110> ed<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.650> fit<00:01:37.799> ed<00:01:37.979> ward

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
college ed I think it fit ed ward

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.710 
college ed I think it fit ed ward
