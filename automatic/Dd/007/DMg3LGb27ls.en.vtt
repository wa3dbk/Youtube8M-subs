00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:35.710 

I<00:00:32.350> think<00:00:33.350> for<00:00:33.620> me<00:00:33.800> I<00:00:34.190> felt<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.970> decision<00:00:35.450> to

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
I think for me I felt the decision to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.280 
I think for me I felt the decision to
make<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.320> series<00:00:36.920> of<00:00:36.950> paintings<00:00:37.700> of<00:00:37.970> God<00:00:38.180> was<00:00:38.570> is

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
make a series of paintings of God was is

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.700 
make a series of paintings of God was is
really<00:00:39.879> about<00:00:40.879> a<00:00:41.200> representational<00:00:42.200> problem

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
really about a representational problem

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.740 
really about a representational problem
because<00:00:43.670> there<00:00:43.850> was<00:00:43.970> always<00:00:44.150> the<00:00:44.330> question<00:00:44.360> of

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
because there was always the question of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.700 
because there was always the question of
how<00:00:44.930> do<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.140> represent<00:00:45.350> this<00:00:45.770> thing<00:00:46.129> that

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
how do you represent this thing that

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.110 
how do you represent this thing that
that<00:00:48.710> is<00:00:49.430> only<00:00:50.230> pictured<00:00:51.230> in<00:00:51.379> fiction<00:00:52.160> or<00:00:52.519> in

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
that is only pictured in fiction or in

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.960 
that is only pictured in fiction or in
in<00:00:54.019> other<00:00:54.260> paintings<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:55.519> so<00:00:55.730> I<00:00:55.760> think

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
in other paintings and so I think

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.180 
in other paintings and so I think
thinking<00:00:56.360> about<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:56.720> like<00:00:57.110> I'm<00:00:57.320> I'm<00:00:57.769> not<00:00:58.160> a

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
thinking about it like I'm I'm not a

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.149 
thinking about it like I'm I'm not a
particularly<00:00:58.610> religious<00:00:59.390> person<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.159> also

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
particularly religious person so also

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:02.860 
particularly religious person so also
this<00:01:01.309> question<00:01:01.640> of<00:01:01.729> belief<00:01:02.000> comes<00:01:02.360> up<00:01:02.600> but

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
this question of belief comes up but

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.710 
this question of belief comes up but
there's<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.549> know<00:01:04.670> question<00:01:05.540> of<00:01:05.630> like

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
there's the you know question of like

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.280 
there's the you know question of like
how<00:01:05.870> do<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.110> represent<00:01:06.490> this<00:01:07.490> thing<00:01:08.290> without

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
how do you represent this thing without

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.070 
how do you represent this thing without
calling<00:01:09.770> upon<00:01:10.070> like<00:01:10.549> you<00:01:10.880> know<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.600> person

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
calling upon like you know the person

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.200 
calling upon like you know the person
with<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.229> beard<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:13.880> know<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.000> was<00:01:14.180> thinking

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
with a beard and you know I was thinking

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.210 
with a beard and you know I was thinking
about<00:01:14.570> it<00:01:14.869> you<00:01:14.960> know<00:01:15.020> when<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.229> was<00:01:15.440> a<00:01:15.470> child<00:01:15.920> I

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
about it you know when I was a child I

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.760 
about it you know when I was a child I
thought<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.760> God<00:01:16.970> for<00:01:17.450> sure<00:01:17.600> was<00:01:17.960> orange<00:01:18.440> and

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
thought that God for sure was orange and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.990 
thought that God for sure was orange and
sort<00:01:19.640> of<00:01:19.729> look<00:01:19.880> like<00:01:19.909> Liberace<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:21.200> maybe

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
sort of look like Liberace and maybe

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.050 
sort of look like Liberace and maybe
like<00:01:23.000> this<00:01:23.210> character<00:01:23.860> this<00:01:24.860> roadside<00:01:25.190> stand

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
like this character this roadside stand

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.929 
like this character this roadside stand
in<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.200> town<00:01:27.380> I<00:01:27.409> grew<00:01:27.619> up<00:01:27.710> in<00:01:27.979> Michigan<00:01:28.490> of

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
in the town I grew up in Michigan of

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.770 
in the town I grew up in Michigan of
this<00:01:29.380> character<00:01:30.380> with<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.590> hamburger<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.780> so

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
this character with a hamburger and so

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.230 
this character with a hamburger and so
it<00:01:32.840> was<00:01:32.960> like<00:01:33.080> a<00:01:33.110> lot<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.380> pop<00:01:33.620> culture<00:01:34.070> and

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
it was like a lot of pop culture and

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.120 
it was like a lot of pop culture and
specifically<00:01:35.240> from<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.450> 80's<00:01:35.930> kind<00:01:36.860> of<00:01:36.950> came

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
specifically from the 80's kind of came

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.000 
specifically from the 80's kind of came
into<00:01:37.370> my<00:01:37.700> idea<00:01:38.390> of<00:01:38.480> like<00:01:38.810> what<00:01:38.840> what<00:01:39.530> God<00:01:39.710> could

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
into my idea of like what what God could

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.930 
into my idea of like what what God could
look<00:01:40.250> like<00:01:41.440> but<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.710> approach<00:01:43.040> in<00:01:43.460> in<00:01:43.730> terms

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
look like but the approach in in terms

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.630 
look like but the approach in in terms
of<00:01:44.090> making<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.510> painting<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:45.590> was<00:01:46.190> really

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
of making the painting I was really

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.830 
of making the painting I was really
thinking<00:01:46.850> about<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.360> like<00:01:47.540> the

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
thinking about it like the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.420 
thinking about it like the
simultaneously<00:01:50.840> like<00:01:51.280> constructing<00:01:52.280> a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
simultaneously like constructing a

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.580 
simultaneously like constructing a
subject<00:01:53.030> but<00:01:53.270> also<00:01:53.570> constructing<00:01:54.229> a<00:01:54.320> painting

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
subject but also constructing a painting

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.700 
subject but also constructing a painting
so<00:01:55.580> they<00:01:56.119> may<00:01:56.930> be<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.170> way<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:57.439> I<00:01:57.560> was

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
so they may be the way that I was

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.200 
so they may be the way that I was
approaching<00:01:58.100> them<00:01:58.430> they're<00:01:58.729> very<00:01:58.759> vertical

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
approaching them they're very vertical

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.700 
approaching them they're very vertical
and<00:02:00.310> enlarged<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.729> it<00:02:01.850> felt<00:02:02.509> almost<00:02:03.290> like<00:02:03.590> I

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
and enlarged and it felt almost like I

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.380 
and enlarged and it felt almost like I
was<00:02:03.860> building<00:02:04.420> something<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:05.899> know<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.200> felt

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
was building something you know it felt

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.820 
was building something you know it felt
physical<00:02:08.390> in<00:02:08.509> that<00:02:08.660> way<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.170> I<00:02:09.410> think<00:02:09.619> that

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
physical in that way and I think that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:57.030 
physical in that way and I think that
the<00:02:10.009> approach<00:02:10.340> was<00:02:10.580> maybe<00:02:10.850> more<00:02:11.150> abstract

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.009 

a<00:02:57.099> lot<00:02:57.819> of<00:02:57.849> the<00:02:58.060> paintings<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.599> came<00:02:58.840> from

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
a lot of the paintings that came from

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.750 
a lot of the paintings that came from
drawings<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.920> know<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.219> was<00:03:00.310> making<00:03:00.670> these

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
drawings you know that was making these

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.780 
drawings you know that was making these
drawings<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.450> very<00:03:02.079> much<00:03:02.519> concerned<00:03:03.519> with

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
drawings and very much concerned with

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.929 
drawings and very much concerned with
the<00:03:04.450> edge<00:03:04.689> of<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.409> of<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.950> framing<00:03:06.549> edge<00:03:06.730> of

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
the edge of the of the framing edge of

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.380 
the edge of the of the framing edge of
the<00:03:07.150> paper<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.319> also<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.909> the<00:03:09.909> framing<00:03:10.269> edge

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
the paper and also the the framing edge

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.569 
the paper and also the the framing edge
of<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.629> canvas<00:03:11.109> and<00:03:11.319> I<00:03:11.590> really<00:03:12.069> think<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.430> that

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
of the canvas and I really think of that

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.000 
of the canvas and I really think of that
edge<00:03:12.849> is<00:03:13.150> like<00:03:13.329> a<00:03:13.359> real<00:03:13.720> thing<00:03:13.750> like<00:03:14.530> it's<00:03:14.709> the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
edge is like a real thing like it's the

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.660 
edge is like a real thing like it's the
moment<00:03:15.939> where<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.150> painting<00:03:16.890> begins<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:18.099> have

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
moment where the painting begins to have

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.490 
moment where the painting begins to have
this<00:03:18.879> bump<00:03:19.390> up<00:03:19.540> against<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.989> world<00:03:20.109> or<00:03:20.439> it

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
this bump up against the world or it

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.729 
this bump up against the world or it
feels<00:03:20.620> this<00:03:20.859> tension<00:03:21.129> from<00:03:21.519> that<00:03:21.760> edge<00:03:22.060> and

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
feels this tension from that edge and

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.440 
feels this tension from that edge and
and<00:03:23.739> so<00:03:24.370> it's<00:03:24.519> something<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.819> really<00:03:25.030> consider

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
and so it's something I really consider

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.330 
and so it's something I really consider
and<00:03:25.720> structuring<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.439> paintings<00:03:26.829> they're

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
and structuring the paintings they're

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.629 
and structuring the paintings they're
very<00:03:27.549> much<00:03:27.730> like<00:03:27.840> inside<00:03:28.840> their<00:03:29.230> their<00:03:29.950> space

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
very much like inside their their space

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.360 
very much like inside their their space
and<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.269> very<00:03:31.510> compressed<00:03:32.019> I<00:03:32.409> think<00:03:33.010> more<00:03:33.159> so

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
and and very compressed I think more so

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.309 
and and very compressed I think more so
than<00:03:33.609> maybe<00:03:33.879> other<00:03:34.629> opinions<00:03:35.019> I've<00:03:35.139> made

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
than maybe other opinions I've made

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.679 
than maybe other opinions I've made
these<00:03:35.590> paintings<00:03:35.919> feel<00:03:36.280> like<00:03:37.180> there's<00:03:37.359> a<00:03:37.450> lot

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
these paintings feel like there's a lot

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.649 
these paintings feel like there's a lot
of<00:03:37.840> compression<00:03:38.349> going<00:03:39.040> on<00:03:39.310> in<00:03:39.730> terms<00:03:40.389> of<00:03:40.569> the

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
of compression going on in terms of the

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.110 
of compression going on in terms of the
subject<00:03:40.919> and<00:03:41.919> also<00:03:42.250> like<00:03:42.489> this<00:03:42.669> kind<00:03:42.970> of

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
subject and also like this kind of

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.509 
subject and also like this kind of
frontal<00:03:43.900> address<00:03:44.319> where<00:03:44.680> there's<00:03:44.950> like<00:03:45.220> the

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
frontal address where there's like the

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.690 
frontal address where there's like the
subject<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.750> either<00:03:46.870> looking<00:03:47.500> directly<00:03:48.459> at

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
subject is either looking directly at

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.369 
subject is either looking directly at
the<00:03:48.819> viewer<00:03:49.120> or<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:52.150> then<00:03:52.389> when<00:03:52.629> to<00:03:52.930> have<00:03:53.139> that

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
the viewer or and then when to have that

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.539 
the viewer or and then when to have that
cuz<00:03:53.530> I<00:03:53.590> feel<00:03:53.829> like<00:03:53.980> that's<00:03:54.099> not<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.310> very

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
cuz I feel like that's not a very

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.000 
cuz I feel like that's not a very
narrative<00:03:55.000> thing<00:03:55.359> so<00:03:55.689> a<00:03:55.989> lot<00:03:56.590> of<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.829> god

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
narrative thing so a lot of the god

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.800 
narrative thing so a lot of the god
paintings<00:03:57.400> they<00:03:57.609> don't<00:03:57.879> they<00:03:58.389> don't<00:03:58.419> really

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
paintings they don't they don't really

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.530 
paintings they don't they don't really
have<00:03:59.079> eyes<00:03:59.260> because<00:03:59.919> I<00:04:00.180> felt<00:04:01.180> like<00:04:01.209> at<00:04:01.419> that

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
have eyes because I felt like at that

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.830 
have eyes because I felt like at that
point<00:04:01.870> they<00:04:02.049> become<00:04:02.489> too<00:04:03.489> individuated<00:04:04.479> or

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
point they become too individuated or

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.030 
point they become too individuated or
you<00:04:05.769> know<00:04:05.889> it's<00:04:06.040> it's<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.739> question<00:04:08.739> of<00:04:08.829> like

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
you know it's it's a question of like

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.099 
you know it's it's a question of like
she<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.519> this<00:04:09.729> girl<00:04:10.209> on<00:04:10.329> a<00:04:10.359> horse<00:04:10.629> is<00:04:10.810> just<00:04:11.019> a

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
she and this girl on a horse is just a

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.330 
she and this girl on a horse is just a
girl<00:04:11.290> on<00:04:11.409> the<00:04:11.440> horse<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.829> think<00:04:11.859> she's<00:04:12.159> not

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
girl on the horse I think she's not

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.659 
girl on the horse I think she's not
she's<00:04:13.150> not<00:04:13.180> God<00:04:13.540> but<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:13.900> felt<00:04:14.229> like<00:04:14.669> there's

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
she's not God but I felt like there's

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.449 
she's not God but I felt like there's
something<00:04:16.120> about<00:04:16.419> that<00:04:17.049> painting<00:04:17.919> to<00:04:18.130> me<00:04:18.280> felt

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
something about that painting to me felt

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.159 
something about that painting to me felt
like<00:04:18.549> it<00:04:18.639> was<00:04:18.729> so<00:04:18.820> much<00:04:18.940> more<00:04:19.150> about<00:04:19.359> actually

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
like it was so much more about actually

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.800 
like it was so much more about actually
painting<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:21.039> that<00:04:21.699> kind<00:04:21.909> of<00:04:21.970> action<00:04:22.449> like

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
painting and that kind of action like

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.550 
painting and that kind of action like
fast<00:04:23.080> action<00:04:23.789> coming<00:04:24.789> forward<00:04:25.320> but<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.380> sort

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
fast action coming forward but it sort

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.600 
fast action coming forward but it sort
of<00:04:26.590> seemed<00:04:26.860> exultant

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
of seemed exultant

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:58.679 
of seemed exultant
like<00:04:27.849> she<00:04:28.030> was<00:04:28.229> she's<00:04:29.229> having<00:04:29.470> a<00:04:29.560> good<00:04:29.680> day

00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:58.689
