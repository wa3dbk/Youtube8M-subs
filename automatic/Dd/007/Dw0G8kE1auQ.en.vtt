00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.160
 jolie gaming welcome south east in this 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.930
 brand new review review dedicated 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.429
 to the handcuffs of nothing gloves 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.500
 exotic for the sorcerer's class 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.300
 introduced with the house of wolves without 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.440
 doubt one of the best exotic pieces 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.910
 present in the game 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.710
 not that it's one of my favorites 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.690
 first of all these how many can be 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.130
 use only with the subclass 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.449
 of the walker of emptiness for the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.820
 simple reason that its effects 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.350
 they will be almost exclusively only 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.570
 for that subclass and statistics 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.220
 who will provide will be governed at 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.960
 read in the best that could be 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.000
 wish on the sorcerer's class 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.380
 the why as for all the exotic ones 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.300
 will be three the first one is called 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.160
 projection and energy that will put the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.870
 grenade launch distance because 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.579
 that as you will now know very well useful to 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.200
 have on all classes for the simple 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.760
 reason that at launch distance of the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.950
 greater grenades means that you can 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.600
 use to try to kill an enemy from 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.460
 greater distances precisely and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.809
 second because you will be innervation that 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.340
 find the recovery time of the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.110
 grenades every time you pick one up 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.059
 sphere of light and for how much a why 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.129
 that is not exploited so much because it is 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.109
 in the pd that in the pdl spheres of light are 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.059
 quite rare it is a why that anyway 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.159
 all in all it serves as a donated horse not 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.930
 a piece of armor spits into his mouth 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.549
 which is based on grenades has a reason 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.409
 which eventually uses 6 rather 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.689
 often though often because that is 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.549
 exploited the mind as saying twice and 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.350
 collect spheres of light for those two 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.549
 sometimes because it will help you finally 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.960
 because they are peculiar to this piece 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.850
 from the armor it will be called charge 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.130
 dispersive that in addition to providing you with one 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.259
 second dispersive grenade and I underline 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.030
 only the dispersive one the second 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.530
 of the walker of the vote the one who creates 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.420
 all the little explosions so much for 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.860
 understand each other will allow the darts of these 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.079
 grenades to chase your target 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.110
 and it will be nothing like the dart a 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.920
 sonic that chases him for 20,000 meters 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.479
 simply when you want to launch one 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.240
 grenade behind shelter if there is an enemy 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.250
 type at 12 meters from the grenade and hard yes 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.899
 they will direct him and himself 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.210
 thanks to this pair of gloves 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.770
 exotic I find these grenades the best 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.420
 of the subclass of the walker of 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.950
 empty because they will simply give you the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.810
 advantages of chasing the enemy who 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.340
 you could have it with a sonic dart but 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.439
 with much higher damage than with 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.399
 balanced grenades will suffice to be able to 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.170
 kill an enemy 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.610
 of course because these work 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.150
 gloves however you will have to be you at 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.010
 to launch 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.570
 a grenade in addition to the fact that if the 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.980
 enemy will quickly jump out 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.630
 from the explosion grenade area 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.280
 and hard and will follow him for a yes 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.960
 meter but then do not erupt 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.670
 they will chase for the whole distance that 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.140
 the enemy could then travel 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.090
 you will also need to want to play a little 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.920
 of cunning and to pull only when 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.490
 you will be sure that the opponent will not have 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.140
 escape 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.850
 moreover these gloves can be 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.590
 quietly used are the pvp 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.330
 who in the pd is and even in 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.070
 the latter activity in the pd with i 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.660
 groups of cats all piled up you can 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.860
 quietly kill them all is 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.870
 just to get more help 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.820
 I recommend that you use two whys 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.959
 specific in the subclass build 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.760
 of the walker of emptiness 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.260
 more precisely, annihilation than 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.209
 will enlarge the explosions produced by 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.010
 bomb 9 from the grenades therefore also from 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.510
 these grenades and the dispersive ones e 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.490
 splendor that will make enemies explode 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.840
 killed by your skills and therefore 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.400
 with these grenades they can 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.560
 quietly shock yours 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.610
 opponents exploit a lot having 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.920
 thus the possibility of obtaining 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.170
 multiple killings when enemies are 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.850
 also very close to each other very much 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.709
 recommended to use a build is 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.750
 based mainly on the discipline 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.980
 so guys and last summary 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.780
 two pilots there to use 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.010
 quietly both in pvp and pv e 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.959
 how many will allow you to 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.400
 carry two grenade grenades than if 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.030
 well launched will be able to help yours 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.920
 enemies 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.360
 the only disadvantage is that they are limited 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.310
 to the subclass of the walker of 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.110
 emptiness and dispersive grenade e 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.910
 despite their undisputed usefulness e 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.440
 strength if it were not players who 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.030
 they use grenades whenever they do 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.350
 have the opportunity I do not recommend 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.550
 the use of these gloves for the 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.840
 simple reason that I am not the piece 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.340
 exotic for you 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.959
 so guys regarding the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.550
 handcuffs of nothing is all as usual 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.810
 thank you for your attention vi 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.430
 I invite you to leave me your feedback

 had it done yet share
