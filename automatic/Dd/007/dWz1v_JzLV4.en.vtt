caught for Christmas
the<00:00:25.230> problem<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:27.110> whenever<00:00:28.110> yeah<00:00:28.770> it

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the problem is the whenever yeah it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.880 
the problem is the whenever yeah it
works<00:00:29.279> fine<00:00:29.610> on<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.270> I<00:00:30.540> was<00:00:30.750> wondering

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890

because<00:00:32.000> PlayStation<00:00:33.000> Network<00:00:33.829> won't<00:00:34.829> work

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
because PlayStation Network won't work

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.670 
because PlayStation Network won't work
so<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.940> basically<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.140> PlayStation

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
so it's basically just a PlayStation

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.040 
so it's basically just a PlayStation
Network<00:00:38.010> about<00:00:38.610> working<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.630> don't<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:40.020> a
