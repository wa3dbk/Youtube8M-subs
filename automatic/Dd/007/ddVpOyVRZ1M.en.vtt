 today recognize the existence of life 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.330
 alien the nasa solved to prepare 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.730
 astronauts to communicate with 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:15.420
 alien the details with the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:20.250
 Duarte over the corresponding laís 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.140
 drawings mysterious images signs that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.600
 to this day are found in several 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.400
 corners of the world 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.460
 the most recent was discovered in the last 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.890
 sunday in ipuaçú west of santa 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.730
 catarina were made on a plantation of 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.820
 wheat 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.600
 the oldest dating from the 17th century 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.980
 scientists argue that 80% of these 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.250
 agroglífos as they are called are 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.160
 mounts fraud but consider that 20% 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.890
 are messages from another way of life already 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.250
 that there are no marks of the hand of man 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.800
 to this day the significance of this phenomenon is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.109
 a mystery to nasa believes that these 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.870
 drawings are made by aliens as 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.850
 preparation for the future contact 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.280
 theory is in this book on 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.780
 agency extraterrestrial communication 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 American space 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.510
 released four months ago the publication 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.700
 leaves astrophysics aside and explores 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.600
 way to understand a future 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.110
 from the earth 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.110
 addresses various types of sound 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.860
 visual magnetic waves and symbols 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.829
 mathematical elements and teaching that 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.090
 astronauts would already be receiving 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.430
 training on these forms of 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.890
 communication is the second time that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.619
 space agency speaks in life 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.049
 smart off the ground to the nasa 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.060
 this hypothesis must be confirmed in 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.640
 maximum 20 years 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.560
 this meeting in massachusetts 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.360
 scientists recognized the existence of 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.270
 100 million planets in the Milky Way 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.549
 with conditions to shelter life 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.439
 imagine the surprise when we 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.790
 the human race realizes that it is not 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.130
 alone in the world universe pilon said 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.170
 max montalvão director of the institute of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.030
 spatial sciences of baptism and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.260
 responsible for launching a 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.930
 satellite will track up 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.280
 the contact may be closer than 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.930
 imagine 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.930
 three weeks ago the image of an object 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.930
 unidentified in the Earth's orbit was 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.080
 recorded by the camera attached to the 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.510
 international space station that makes 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.270
 live stream on nasa's website 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.520
 the agency. 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.270
 turned off the camera for a few 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.790
 hours 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.470
 the author has spoken hi for either books to 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.800
 curator of the washington space museum 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.709
 It's really a matter of time she tells 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.020
 space telescopes and satellites 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.780
 astrium and chemical combinations that 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.600
 allow the existence of life seek 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.770
 find planets similar to our 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.560
 here in fifa 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.050
 I wish they would find life in 20 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.550
 years and I'm convinced we have 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.550
 united and win
