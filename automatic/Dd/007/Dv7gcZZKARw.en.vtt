little bit extra I'm gonna go ahead and
see<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.029> little<00:01:36.240> gap<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.689> between<00:01:36.810> which<00:01:37.469> we

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
see the little gap in between which we

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.499 
see the little gap in between which we
will<00:01:37.829> because<00:01:38.159> now<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.399> just<00:01:38.639> have<00:01:38.819> a<00:01:38.849> single

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
will because now we just have a single

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.779 
will because now we just have a single
layer<00:01:40.229> filling<00:01:40.889> that<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.039> it<00:01:41.369> doesn't<00:01:41.700> usually

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
layer filling that in it doesn't usually

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.639 
layer filling that in it doesn't usually
fill<00:01:42.209> in<00:01:42.419> a<00:01:42.539> lot<00:01:42.719> so<00:01:43.139> I'm<00:01:43.229> gonna<00:01:43.319> go<00:01:43.439> ahead<00:01:43.469> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
fill in a lot so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.620 
fill in a lot so I'm gonna go ahead and
move<00:01:43.859> my<00:01:44.069> knife<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.549> little<00:01:44.880> bit<00:01:44.999> further<00:01:45.299> to

the<00:01:45.659> outside<00:01:46.349> let's<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.130> go<00:01:47.249> ahead<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.579> do

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:47.669 
the outside let's just go ahead and do

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:49.519 
the outside let's just go ahead and do
the<00:01:47.789> other<00:01:47.819> side<00:01:48.299> now<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.139> don't<00:01:49.319> want<00:01:49.469> to

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:49.529 
the other side now if you don't want to

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:51.229 
the other side now if you don't want to
cut<00:01:49.709> anything<00:01:49.919> off<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.549> run<00:01:51.029> the

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:51.239 
cut anything off you can just run the

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:53.120 
cut anything off you can just run the
fabric<00:01:51.479> right<00:01:52.049> next<00:01:52.469> to<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.709> blade<00:01:52.919> you<00:01:53.099> can

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
fabric right next to the blade you can

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.370 
fabric right next to the blade you can
move<00:01:53.399> your<00:01:53.579> seam<00:01:54.359> guide<00:01:54.569> which<00:01:54.869> by<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.139> way<00:01:55.259> if

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
move your seam guide which by the way if

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.569 
move your seam guide which by the way if
you<00:01:55.469> lift<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.739> out<00:01:55.889> you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.279> just<00:01:56.429> go<00:01:56.520> ahead

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
you lift this out you can just go ahead

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.609 
you lift this out you can just go ahead
and<00:01:56.789> slide<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> out<00:01:57.179> but<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:58.229> kind<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.469> nice

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and slide it out but it's kind of nice

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.979 
and slide it out but it's kind of nice
because<00:01:58.889> you<00:01:59.069> can<00:01:59.249> set<00:01:59.489> this<00:01:59.669> up<00:01:59.809> play<00:02:00.809> that

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
because you can set this up play that

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.289 
because you can set this up play that
back<00:02:01.169> in<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.679> that<00:02:01.889> is<00:02:02.039> even<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.880> your<00:02:03.029> knife

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
back in so that is even with your knife

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.199 
back in so that is even with your knife
and<00:02:03.630> then<00:02:04.590> not<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:05.099> to<00:02:05.249> not<00:02:05.489> be<00:02:05.700> trimming<00:02:05.999> off

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
and then not have to not be trimming off

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.479 
and then not have to not be trimming off
very<00:02:06.539> much<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:07.349> if<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.529> do<00:02:07.679> trim<00:02:07.950> off<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
very much but if you do trim off just a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.609 
very much but if you do trim off just a
little<00:02:08.520> bit<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.750> gonna<00:02:09.929> give<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.409> nice

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
little bit it is gonna give it a nice

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.990 
little bit it is gonna give it a nice
little<00:02:10.860> edge<00:02:11.129> oh<00:02:11.310> that's<00:02:11.670> pretty

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
little edge oh that's pretty

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000 
little edge oh that's pretty
so<00:02:12.420> see<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.689> difference<00:02:12.719> now<00:02:13.260> it's<00:02:13.469> filled<00:02:13.769> in

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
so see the difference now it's filled in

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.410 
so see the difference now it's filled in
where<00:02:14.670> before<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.090> had<00:02:15.299> a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
where before I had a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.480 
where before I had a
a little<00:02:15.720> bit<00:02:15.900> extra<00:02:16.590> there<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.310> can<00:02:17.430> go

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
a little bit extra there so you can go

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.339 
a little bit extra there so you can go
all<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.910> way<00:02:17.940> around<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.450> edge<00:02:18.599> I've<00:02:19.140> been

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
all the way around the edge I've been

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.960 
all the way around the edge I've been
also<00:02:19.560> probably<00:02:20.040> lengthen<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.580> stitch<00:02:20.790> length

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
also probably lengthen the stitch length

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.220 
also probably lengthen the stitch length
because<00:02:21.209> we<00:02:21.330> don't<00:02:21.480> really<00:02:21.599> need<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.870> this

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
because we don't really need it this

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.680 
because we don't really need it this
tight<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.099> we<00:02:23.280> can<00:02:23.459> make<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.880> little<00:02:24.450> bit

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
tight so we can make that a little bit

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.830 
tight so we can make that a little bit
longer<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.830> spread<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.430> out<00:02:26.550> here<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> great

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
longer and spread it out here is a great

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.900 
longer and spread it out here is a great
example<00:02:27.900> I've<00:02:28.560> got<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.739> coat<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:29.730> actually

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
example I've got a coat that I actually

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.449 
example I've got a coat that I actually
had<00:02:30.330> it's<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.080> beautiful<00:02:31.500> silk<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.160> had<00:02:32.310> it

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
bottom with batting in between and then

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.130 
bottom with batting in between and then
what<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.190> did<00:02:38.310> was<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.760> cut<00:02:39.030> my<00:02:39.239> jacket<00:02:39.750> out<00:02:39.930> of

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
those are probably going to be on things

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.110 
those are probably going to be on things
that<00:03:12.750> are<00:03:12.930> more<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.319> fitted<00:03:13.799> item<00:03:14.220> or<00:03:14.670> maybe

that are more of a fitted item or maybe

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.570 
that are more of a fitted item or maybe
just<00:03:15.360> fun<00:03:15.660> but<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.680> nice<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.220> be<00:03:17.250> able<00:03:17.370> to

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
just fun but it is nice to be able to

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.340 
just fun but it is nice to be able to
search<00:03:18.120> around<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.540> with<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.810> three<00:03:19.019> thread

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
side or the other because they have

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.699

actually<00:03:41.760> been<00:03:41.880> closed<00:03:42.299> up<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.530> have

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
actually been closed up so and I have

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.199 
actually been closed up so and I have
had<00:03:43.890> people<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.640> take<00:03:44.790> those<00:03:45.030> sew

everything<00:03:45.359> together<00:03:45.750> then<00:03:46.410> they'll<00:03:46.590> come

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
everything together then they'll come

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:47.990 
everything together then they'll come
back<00:03:46.920> with<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.190> little<00:03:47.340> three<00:03:47.609> thread<00:03:47.850> and

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.300 
prefer to do it more on the individual
pieces<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:53.910> then<00:03:54.720> go<00:03:55.350> back<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.590> sew<00:03:56.160> them

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
together now we will have a video on how

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.430 
together now we will have a video on how
to<00:03:58.769> do<00:03:59.010> curves<00:03:59.579> both<00:04:00.150> inside<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.079> outside

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
to do curves both inside and outside

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.099 
to do curves both inside and outside
curves<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.670> corners<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:03.660> know<00:04:03.900> how<00:04:04.049> to

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
curves and corners so you know how to

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.470 
curves and corners so you know how to
work<00:04:04.350> around<00:04:04.530> something<00:04:05.069> that's<00:04:05.250> not<00:04:05.700> just<00:04:06.239> a

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
work around something that's not just a

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.140 
work around something that's not just a
straight<00:04:06.900> edge
