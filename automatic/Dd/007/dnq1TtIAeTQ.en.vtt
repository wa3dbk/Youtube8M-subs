00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.260
 and finally let's see 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.489
 what your audio interface 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.439
 good that this is not necessary necessary as well as obligation 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.260
 it has its advantages 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
 an audio interface always 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.609
 who use and not clearer clearer without interference noise 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.929
 for her if you want to mirror her and be a little 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.179
 in the nonsense things of audio music 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.750
 you want to record it will be called more the tension, it is recommended that you 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.040
 buy an audio interface 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.910
 without employment and many advantages this you can make your own songs this with a 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.430
 single interface 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.010
 this 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.880
 here there are also many there are many 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.920
 prices in this one 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.720
 and purposes vih 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.790
 well here we are good or two 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.879
 the first of which rivas kills field 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.370
 It's the one I have 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.469
 and this 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:01.840
 It works very well 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.880
 and this is a demon 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.720
 it's an interface 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.460
 from outdoors never anything else and notice you have nothing more than a 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.490
 you saw a flow entry 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.750
 I tell you a guitar a microphone 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.710
 this 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.620
 it's a little bit simpler but it works bought tunisia 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.020
 which is an advantage 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.520
 and good that you have to take into account 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.780
 input that is compatible with your computer and operating system 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.509
 The specialized interface that does not work with any computer 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.899
 or with any operating system before you have to take very much into account is to the 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.630
 time to commit steps 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.960
 another is to be compatible with the client recovery program 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.649
 It is compatible with most programs of 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:43.960
 to record audio 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.020
 but for example there are interfaces that do not work with 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.240
 type of programs 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 christie's to have that in mind before 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.390
 purchase with a Czech wine interface 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.150
 the specifications of the interface and all that 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.210
 and the last thing that is complete with this is something so mex 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.630
 so extravagant so extreme if you're not going to use it atp to its full capacity 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.619
 3 you want something 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.619
 simple something 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.959
 we do not know why 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.959
 for more homemade recordings what you are going to do 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:17.119
 you have to see also 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.939
 what do you want to see what's the opposite if you want ya fisher themes 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.539
 in first go 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.829
 Well, you have to look for something bigger than what is best suited to what you 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.629
 you are looking for is price 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.539
 up to the purposes or what the interface does 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:34.609
 I'm going to give you I'm going to show you a small hotel was more than what it does 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:35.939
 an interface 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.239
 so I did not get you out of the way when 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.469
 when carlos g from a twitter phase interface 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.999
 it's just a bridge between the computer said instruments got 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.239
 microphone in that diagram 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.619
 we have here the interface is that we require right now 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:53.169
 There are many types 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.549
 but good here we have this box 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.159
 that simulates the the bird 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.189
 in the audio interface 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.229
 that it can be to connect a guitar directly the interface and start 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.509
 record on your computer this 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:07.549
 in the most normal way possible 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:08.900
 Well connect the 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.380
 lobato interface and also start recording 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.549
 this one directly to your computer 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.549
 and if your site connects at the interface times the advantage 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:22.409
 that you can have all the sound in a digital way without any dexia 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.429
 There was no interference 

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:28.139
 then put other things as well as yesteryear to investigate 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:32.339
 a deck of the digits I got married but you can also 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:33.879
 connect 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.439
 they went to the computer 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.840
 the audio interface connects to the computer mind a cable that yields 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:42.500
 that's not no problem 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.640
 on this day all that still comes out horns or headphones 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.889
 an enthusiast is capturing what enters the interface 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.069
 that is to be a little more 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.329
 give a more professional touch to your recordings 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.059
 oo to the pastor's preaching when when he preaches ap on Sundays 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.790
 to give it a little more professionalism 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.229
 wing your recordings 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.170
 but good I had I do not need interface not 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.389
 you do not want me weighed a lot on that 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.199
 that they did not tell me to record the pastor's application 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.329
 well there are others there another way 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.189
 of being able to do it without an interface city 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.389
 and it is that they are of granma 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.389
 an august mixer is also mentioned 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.169
 surely you have seen in assigning in chile ceac 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.509
 they have na 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.240
 something like that 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.240
 the interesting thing here is in these 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.740
 let's say and its connectors that shane kim 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.650
 this between you 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.910
 it's the exit 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.830
 to record 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.939
 this this the survey threw 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.749
 they connect to this cable that is down here 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:55.979
 without research cable 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.349
 a mini club 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:58.599
 this 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:04:59.909
 this one connects 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.719
 to the departures 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:04.699
 d of your mixer 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.080
 and is that after the tip of cable 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.789
 which is at least 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.789
 a club is entering your computer 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.330
 directly when you enter the microphone 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.400
 then once 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.180
 first you connect 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.180
 and then you have to be the change 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.700
 in your program we will see it later 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.770
 to 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.110
 to say the program that you get 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.630
 the sound that enters through the microphone input 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.159
 from your computer 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.229
 and if it is not an interface then it is necessary to tell the program that the entrance 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:41.550
 Sound 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.949
 but not from the microphone but from one from the Portuguese efe 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.410
 and from the interface then those promotions and cheo that is done 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.409
 already directly the program but 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.930
 but we're going to see that later in the in the tutoring seat 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.150
 so this is roughly what you need to be able to record 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.159
 audio on your computer is not very complicated is 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:04.430
 I go real really easy 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.789
 what if 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.169
 if we have information on these positions 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.900
 then send us a month 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.810
 i 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.569
 we can sad you 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:14.830
 haidar with them with what you need 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.529
 then thanks for 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:17.949
 for looking at this 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.050
 this little tutorial god bless you
