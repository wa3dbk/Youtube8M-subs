00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
not put the most on the ends because

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.990 
not put the most on the ends because
whatever<00:06:19.950> is<00:06:20.100> going<00:06:20.250> to<00:06:20.400> fake<00:06:20.520> first<00:06:20.790> it's

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
whatever is going to fake first it's

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.040 
whatever is going to fake first it's
definitely<00:06:21.360> going<00:06:21.480> to<00:06:21.510> be<00:06:21.600> the<00:06:21.720> ends<00:06:21.900> of<00:06:21.990> your

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
definitely going to be the ends of your

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.370 
definitely going to be the ends of your
hair<00:06:22.140> because<00:06:22.550> it's<00:06:23.550> the<00:06:23.790> longest<00:06:24.120> hair<00:06:24.380> then

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380
