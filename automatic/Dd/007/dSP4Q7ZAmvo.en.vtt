both have for the deck you know and

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.130 
both have for the deck you know and
what's<00:00:36.370> cool<00:00:36.580> about<00:00:36.610> this<00:00:36.970> is<00:00:37.030> because<00:00:37.810> I'm

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
what's cool about this is because I'm

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.140 
what's cool about this is because I'm
obviously<00:00:38.350> not<00:00:38.650> an<00:00:39.010> expert<00:00:39.520> on<00:00:39.730> all<00:00:39.940> these

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
obviously not an expert on all these

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.360 
obviously not an expert on all these
debts<00:00:40.510> you<00:00:40.780> guys<00:00:40.990> basically<00:00:41.560> bring<00:00:41.980> more<00:00:42.220> to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
debts you guys basically bring more to

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.460 
debts you guys basically bring more to
the<00:00:42.400> table<00:00:42.490> than<00:00:42.820> I<00:00:43.060> do<00:00:43.120> because<00:00:43.810> some<00:00:44.290> of<00:00:44.320> you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
the table than I do because some of you

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.530 
the table than I do because some of you
have<00:00:44.620> probably<00:00:44.770> tested<00:00:45.670> these<00:00:45.790> decks<00:00:46.150> and<00:00:46.420> art

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
have probably tested these decks and art

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.600 
have probably tested these decks and art
types<00:00:46.780> thoroughly<00:00:47.320> so<00:00:47.830> we're<00:00:48.100> going<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.370> start

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
types thoroughly so we're going to start

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.370 
types thoroughly so we're going to start
with<00:00:48.700> one<00:00:48.970> of<00:00:49.060> my<00:00:49.120> favorite<00:00:49.600> casual<00:00:50.050> decks<00:00:50.230> of

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
with one of my favorite casual decks of

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.980 
with one of my favorite casual decks of
all<00:00:50.470> time<00:00:50.680> crystal<00:00:51.250> beads<00:00:51.400> and<00:00:51.610> I<00:00:52.570> guess<00:00:52.840> we

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
all time crystal beads and I guess we

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.050 
all time crystal beads and I guess we
should<00:00:53.170> start<00:00:53.320> with<00:00:53.560> what<00:00:54.370> I<00:00:54.400> know<00:00:54.580> that

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
should start with what I know that

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.270 
should start with what I know that
crystal<00:00:55.390> beads<00:00:55.570> do<00:00:55.720> well<00:00:55.960> well<00:00:56.650> crystal

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
crystal beads do well well crystal

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.520 
crystal beads do well well crystal
abundance<00:00:57.730> is<00:00:58.030> still<00:00:58.420> in<00:00:58.660> my<00:00:58.780> opinion<00:00:59.110> really

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530

really good I just think

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.580 
really good I just think
abundance<00:01:01.750> is<00:01:01.870> one<00:01:02.020> of<00:01:02.080> those<00:01:02.170> cards<00:01:02.470> that's

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
abundance is one of those cards that's

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.140 
abundance is one of those cards that's
just<00:01:02.770> going<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:02.980> be<00:01:03.010> good<00:01:03.310> until<00:01:03.490> like<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.970> end

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
just going to be good until like the end

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.389 
just going to be good until like the end

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
honest okay so now that we've got the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.160 
honest okay so now that we've got the
good<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:18.730> bad<00:03:18.790> out<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:19.270> way<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.450> guess<00:03:20.020> we

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
good and bad out of the way I guess we

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.900 
good and bad out of the way I guess we
can<00:03:20.290> focus<00:03:20.500> on<00:03:20.710> ways<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:20.920> improve<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.580> crystal

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
can focus on ways to improve the crystal

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.910 
can focus on ways to improve the crystal
beast<00:03:22.060> deck<00:03:22.270> obviously<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.230> deck<00:03:23.410> works<00:03:23.650> best

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
beast deck obviously the deck works best

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.740 
beast deck obviously the deck works best
when<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.220> hit<00:03:24.370> abundance<00:03:24.640> early<00:03:25.270> you<00:03:25.480> know<00:03:25.510> it

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
when you hit abundance early you know it

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.480 
when you hit abundance early you know it
is<00:03:25.990> basically<00:03:26.440> like<00:03:26.530> your<00:03:26.800> wind<00:03:26.980> condition<00:03:27.370> I

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
is basically like your wind condition I

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.400 
is basically like your wind condition I
really<00:03:27.790> feel<00:03:27.970> like<00:03:28.000> since<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:29.050> card<00:03:29.290> is

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
really feel like since that card is

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.800 
really feel like since that card is
really<00:03:29.710> hard<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:29.980> stop<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.490> should<00:03:30.760> be<00:03:31.030> kind<00:03:31.720> of

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
really hard to stop it should be kind of

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.060 
really hard to stop it should be kind of
like<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.080> knockout<00:03:32.440> punch<00:03:32.470> that<00:03:32.890> you're

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
like the knockout punch that you're

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.010 
like the knockout punch that you're
going<00:03:33.400> for<00:03:33.640> I<00:03:33.880> know<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.360> deck<00:03:34.540> works<00:03:34.780> best

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
going for I know the deck works best

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.020 
going for I know the deck works best
when<00:03:35.200> you<00:03:35.320> hit<00:03:35.500> rainbow<00:03:36.070> ruins<00:03:36.430> early<00:03:36.850> and

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
when you hit rainbow ruins early and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.460 
when you hit rainbow ruins early and
that<00:03:37.180> card<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.540> definitely<00:03:38.020> rolling<00:03:38.230> because

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
that card is definitely rolling because

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.890 
that card is definitely rolling because
that's<00:03:39.040> like<00:03:39.190> draw<00:03:39.550> power<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.480> protection

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
that's like draw power and protection

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.920 
that's like draw power and protection
and<00:03:41.890> negation<00:03:42.550> all<00:03:43.030> kind<00:03:43.300> of<00:03:43.390> rolled<00:03:43.630> up<00:03:43.780> in

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
and negation all kind of rolled up in

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.930 
and negation all kind of rolled up in
the<00:03:44.050> one<00:03:44.290> now<00:03:44.800> Crystal<00:03:45.220> Beach<00:03:45.340> does<00:03:45.670> obviously

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
the one now Crystal Beach does obviously

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.910 
the one now Crystal Beach does obviously
need<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.420> little<00:03:46.750> bit<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:46.930> setup<00:03:47.140> time<00:03:47.500> because

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
need a little bit of setup time because

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.220 
need a little bit of setup time because
you<00:03:48.220> know<00:03:48.610> carbs<00:03:48.970> like<00:03:49.060> abundance<00:03:49.390> take<00:03:49.930> for

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
you know carbs like abundance take for

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.690 
you know carbs like abundance take for
crystal<00:03:50.560> beasts<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:50.980> then<00:03:51.070> rainbow<00:03:51.340> ruins

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
crystal beasts and then rainbow ruins

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.920 
crystal beasts and then rainbow ruins
doesn't<00:03:52.000> really<00:03:52.150> get<00:03:52.270> rolling<00:03:52.450> until<00:03:52.750> you

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
doesn't really get rolling until you

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.620 
doesn't really get rolling until you
have<00:03:53.080> three<00:03:53.350> cards<00:03:53.740> and<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.400> back<00:03:54.790> row<00:03:55.060> but<00:03:55.600> I

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
have three cards and the back row but I

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.540 
have three cards and the back row but I
feel<00:03:56.020> like<00:03:56.080> on<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:56.830> deck<00:03:56.980> is<00:03:57.010> just<00:03:57.280> kind<00:03:57.490> of

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
feel like on this deck is just kind of

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.910 
feel like on this deck is just kind of
begging<00:03:58.060> for<00:03:58.330> reckless<00:03:58.990> and<00:03:59.200> upstarts<00:03:59.830> so

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
begging for reckless and upstarts so

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.949 
begging for reckless and upstarts so
that<00:04:00.040> we<00:04:00.160> can<00:04:00.310> reduce<00:04:00.610> that<00:04:00.670> set-up<00:04:01.090> time<00:04:01.209> you

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
that we can reduce that set-up time you

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.420 
that we can reduce that set-up time you
know<00:04:02.110> when<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.380> combine<00:04:02.740> that<00:04:02.770> with<00:04:02.980> cards

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
know when you combine that with cards

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.970 
know when you combine that with cards
like<00:04:03.640> rare<00:04:04.330> value<00:04:04.840> then<00:04:05.080> I<00:04:05.350> feel<00:04:05.560> like<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.800> can

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
like rare value then I feel like you can

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.710 
like rare value then I feel like you can
actually<00:04:06.160> give<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:06.610> deck<00:04:06.820> consistent<00:04:07.450> speed

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
actually give the deck consistent speed

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.230 
actually give the deck consistent speed
the<00:04:08.320> one<00:04:08.560> question<00:04:08.740> I<00:04:09.070> do<00:04:09.130> have<00:04:09.459> about<00:04:09.700> upstart

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
the one question I do have about upstart

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.660 
the one question I do have about upstart
is<00:04:10.360> I'm<00:04:10.630> not<00:04:10.870> sure<00:04:10.930> how<00:04:11.890> much<00:04:12.100> it<00:04:12.250> would<00:04:12.340> clash

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
is I'm not sure how much it would clash

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.060 
is I'm not sure how much it would clash
with<00:04:12.700> crystal<00:04:13.600> abundance<00:04:14.050> because<00:04:14.170> I'm<00:04:14.800> kind

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
with crystal abundance because I'm kind

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.830 
with crystal abundance because I'm kind
of<00:04:15.130> looking<00:04:15.280> for<00:04:15.580> that<00:04:15.610> card<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.090> be<00:04:16.330> an<00:04:16.450> otk

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
of looking for that card to be an otk

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.500 
of looking for that card to be an otk
card<00:04:17.290> especially<00:04:17.530> with<00:04:18.040> again<00:04:18.310> cowboy<00:04:18.730> and<00:04:18.940> I

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
card especially with again cowboy and I

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.539 
card especially with again cowboy and I
don't<00:04:19.750> know<00:04:19.870> if<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.109> 1,000<00:04:20.859> with<00:04:20.980> a<00:04:21.010> conflict

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
don't know if that 1,000 with a conflict

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.760 
don't know if that 1,000 with a conflict
with<00:04:21.669> that<00:04:21.700> as<00:04:22.300> far<00:04:22.600> as<00:04:22.750> defense<00:04:23.229> goes<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.710> know

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
with that as far as defense goes I know

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.469 
with that as far as defense goes I know
it's<00:04:24.040> always<00:04:24.310> kind<00:04:24.520> of<00:04:24.580> been<00:04:24.640> an<00:04:24.820> issue<00:04:25.030> with

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
it's always kind of been an issue with

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.730 
it's always kind of been an issue with
crystal<00:04:26.020> beasts<00:04:26.169> I

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
crystal beasts I

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.050 
crystal beasts I
feel<00:04:26.889> like<00:04:27.009> swift<00:04:27.310> scarecrow<00:04:27.430> should

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
feel like swift scarecrow should

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.390 
feel like swift scarecrow should
probably<00:04:28.660> be<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.990> main<00:04:29.289> defense<00:04:29.889> you<00:04:30.370> know

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
probably be the main defense you know

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.279 
probably be the main defense you know
you<00:04:30.520> don't<00:04:30.669> really<00:04:30.789> need<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.270> invest<00:04:31.630> cards<00:04:32.110> to

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
you don't really need to invest cards to

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.020 
you don't really need to invest cards to
play<00:04:32.380> defense<00:04:32.710> on<00:04:33.069> the<00:04:33.190> field<00:04:33.220> because

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
play defense on the field because

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.370 
play defense on the field because
abundance<00:04:34.300> is<00:04:34.599> going<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:34.870> wipe<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.169> board

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380
