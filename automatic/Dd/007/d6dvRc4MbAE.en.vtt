00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
guide and basically this controller

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.360 
guide and basically this controller
gives<00:00:57.920> every<00:00:58.340> fixture<00:00:58.610> 12<00:00:59.300> channels<00:00:59.890> so<00:01:00.890> for

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
gives every fixture 12 channels so for

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.340 
gives every fixture 12 channels so for

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
every fixture you need to start it on

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.050

channel 1 and then you a lot 12 channels

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.399 
channel 1 and then you a lot 12 channels
for<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:13.999> fixture<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:14.689> then<00:01:15.049> you<00:01:15.170> start<00:01:15.380> your

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.010 
for that fixture and then you start your
next<00:01:15.649> fixture<00:01:16.159> on<00:01:16.189> 13<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.210> it<00:01:17.630> gives<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:17.869> the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
next fixture on 13 and it gives you the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.749
