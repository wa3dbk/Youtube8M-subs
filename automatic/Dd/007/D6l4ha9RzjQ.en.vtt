00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.990
 how about guys again today is going to be 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.680
 a review 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.680
 basically 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.840
 the first one finds a way that empties 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.650
 quite funny since lately 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.020
 I was doing a serious for the 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.330
 colleagues 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.400
 and thank you very much now it has not been 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.530
 fun you know we have used it and we have 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.870
 made compilation there 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.190
 for him a lot of flame and needs a castle 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.350
 for people who do not know how to do 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.090
 castles 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.130
 but 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.540
 it's not that we make castles that 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.780
 after the block and directly in 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.770
 castilla vale you have to capture a block 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.780
 what is this that I have here the hand 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.329
 which is as simple as putting 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.079
 one of the 1 above once will be low 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.079
 an iron 

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:12.000
 in urging the mount 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.090
 As you can see how I'm doing, I 'm going 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.369
 with the armor 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.079
 zito hardcore since cool 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.370
 I will also leave the structure then to 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.070
 who is interested in value 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.020
 funny river pretty funny the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.560
 truth with the sheep have a little 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.560
 face of the troll 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.820
 and up to 64 bits 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.390
 well what is this mode to see me 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.300
 I'm going to put the creative because it's that 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.470
 have a I think that has little something not 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:58.570
 I believe but not to die so they are 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.570
 just choose there 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.090
 place the castle and once placed 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.080
 the castle 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.220
 right button and tachÃ¡n we already have 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.080
 our made castillete is a small 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.319
 strength that makes us directly the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.319
 game 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.930
 that makes us directly the game 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.510
 thanks to this way castilla quite 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.470
 well done is looking a bit according to the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.010
 area that you put in an area 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.010
 d 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.319
 a flat area much better than me 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:42.180
 I have put a mound and have what 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:46.740
 would be the throne tables and such 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:50.010
 you have accessibility to the world above 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.840
 pretty lit that the light are nothing 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.660
 more you can do here we show here 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.150
 page a bit all this and you can put 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.430
 our kraft table and so on I do not 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.790
 I'm going to put mine here. I'm going to play 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.520
 the game within nothing could do a 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.770
 village of castles if you fancy the 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.380
 boat is very easy to install as 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.710
 using the forge or the world to do is 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.200
 and if only in the folder mod you put the cip 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.070
 and ready nothing more I hope that I have 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.260
 liked a bit like tepito I 'll leave in the 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.710
 description the textures and the mode for 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.710
 to download 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.610
 and nothing up there is simply is 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.310
 create block and Italy 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.349
 castle I hope you liked it and 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.349
 until then it hurts 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.140
 when you speak
