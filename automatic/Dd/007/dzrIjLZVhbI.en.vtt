the<00:01:59.990> full<00:02:00.170> circle<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.649> think<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:00.950> would<00:02:01.069> say<00:02:01.159> a

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
the full circle I think I would say a

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.309 
the full circle I think I would say a
rare<00:02:01.459> opportunity<00:02:01.640> does<00:02:02.270> this<00:02:02.390> cut<00:02:02.899> straight

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
rare opportunity does this cut straight

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:04.840 
rare opportunity does this cut straight
