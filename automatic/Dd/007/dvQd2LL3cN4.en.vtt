from<00:03:28.590> three<00:03:29.310> people<00:03:29.610> online<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.510> really

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
from three people online and so I really

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.870 
from three people online and so I really
was<00:03:31.470> unsure<00:03:31.890> what<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.310> would<00:03:32.400> actually<00:03:32.430> look

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
was unsure what it would actually look

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.310 
was unsure what it would actually look
like<00:03:32.940> when<00:03:33.240> it<00:03:33.360> came<00:03:33.600> but<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:33.930> think<00:03:34.200> it

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
like when it came but I think it

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.260 
like when it came but I think it
actually<00:03:34.440> looks<00:03:34.890> very<00:03:35.220> very<00:03:35.310> nice<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.150> well

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
actually looks very very nice and well

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.210 
actually looks very very nice and well
made<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.780> doesn't<00:03:37.380> look<00:03:37.560> cheap<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.130> it

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
made it doesn't look cheap and it

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.470 
made it doesn't look cheap and it
doesn't<00:03:38.490> feel<00:03:38.580> like<00:03:38.640> it's<00:03:38.880> going<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.090> break<00:03:39.270> or

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
doesn't feel like it's going to break or

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.840 
doesn't feel like it's going to break or
anything<00:03:39.780> although<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.950> actual<00:03:41.130> necklace<00:03:41.700> is

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
anything although the actual necklace is

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.550 
anything although the actual necklace is
pretty<00:03:42.090> thin<00:03:42.390> itself<00:03:42.840> but<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.230> definitely

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
pretty thin itself but I definitely

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.260 
pretty thin itself but I definitely
think<00:03:43.860> i'm<00:03:44.070> going<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.460> go<00:03:44.640> ahead<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.000> order
