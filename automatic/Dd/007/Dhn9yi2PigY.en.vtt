 give a score of the number of points that 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 their leaders usually recruit but it seems to me 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.790

 half and at the end of the fourth quarter in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 We have a lot that turned and because of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.079
 this we did such a reserve 15 more 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.760
 points and the result is obvious 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.520

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.260

 as well as always try to play on 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.320
 team to help the club 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.140
 gradually get into the rhythm picking up the form 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.580
 after injury and start to play on defense 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.630
 rebounds from rough work from behind 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.930
 elephant us and I my throws so 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.860

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.140
 oboists 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.400

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.210
 applicant for himself 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.490

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.110
 he completed just the fields of youth 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:47.780
 by and she likes sticks or leave then 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:54.270
 what is necessary so this minute is dangerous. 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:59.580
