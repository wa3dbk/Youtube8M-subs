 Gamers Previous: Assassin's Creed Unity 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.500
 Paris, the City of Light, is submerged in a 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.240
 blood River. Citizens took to the streets crying out for a new life, far from 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.890
 tyranny. The octopus joined in the struggle for their freedoms, 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.890
 while the iron fist unleashed terror. It's years of horror that did not end soon 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 and in which the heads turned terribly literally. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 Ubisoft, the French video game company, 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.550
 tells a definite episode in the history of his nation in Assassin's Creed: Unity. 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.160
 We return to a critical point of the past to incarnate, thanks to the Animus, a link 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.160
 more in the line of murderers. Arno, a cultured and educated young man, lost him to his father 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.079
 tiny. Created alongside the young Elise De la Serre, she will not only have to honor the tradition 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:22.479
 of their ancestors. You should also assume that many of those you love carry in your 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.479
 blood the Templars' inheritance. In the midst of this conflict, France unleashes a revolution 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 that nobody is from outside. The game offers, as the main novelty, a 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.369
 cooperative mode with the ability to let you live the adventure with three other friends. 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.310
 It's an interesting addition considering that teamwork to free France 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.679
 learning as killers if you listen to a great idea for 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:04.679
 to share. In addition, developers promise a recreation 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.369
 spectacular view of Paris at that time. Monumental buildings such as the Notre Dame Cathedral, 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.980
 were rebuilt in the game by a work that lasted months to give the necessary details. 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.610
 This contrasts like the portrait of the Parisian suburb, which also develops much of the adventure. 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.610
 Thousands of people, each with their own behavior, will give a sense of being 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.840
 in front of a living and boiling world. In this we have to add the improvements thanks 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.840
 in combat and parkour. Assassin's Creed Unity will arrive in November 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.099
 exclusive to Xbox One and PlayStation 4. It promises to change the course of the series and we will be 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.900
 pending to find out if it is the time of promise. 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.700
 I'm Alexandra Vicencio and I'm sure that I'll be by your side fighting for Freedom, 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.700
 Equality and Fraternity. You will honor the tradition of your ancestors and will 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.010
 of your octopus? Come with me, that together we will see falling heads of the jerks.
