00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
people's music that's one thing that's

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.680 
people's music that's one thing that's
definitely<00:02:34.310> changed<00:02:34.730> because<00:02:34.820> back<00:02:35.450> when<00:02:35.480> it

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
definitely changed because back when it

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.720 
definitely changed because back when it
was<00:02:35.720> just<00:02:35.810> vinyl<00:02:36.350> you're<00:02:37.280> really<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.610> only

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
was just vinyl you're really the only

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.310 
was just vinyl you're really the only
option<00:02:37.850> was<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.300> play<00:02:38.540> whatever<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.930> had<00:02:39.170> on

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
option was to play whatever you had on

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.710 
option was to play whatever you had on
vinyl<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:40.220> couldn't<00:02:40.550> make<00:02:41.090> your<00:02:41.120> own<00:02:41.390> tracks

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
vinyl you couldn't make your own tracks

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.310 
vinyl you couldn't make your own tracks
or<00:02:42.020> your<00:02:42.800> own<00:02:42.920> videos<00:02:43.280> obviously<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:45.290> I

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
or your own videos obviously and so I

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.750 
or your own videos obviously and so I
think<00:02:45.440> it's<00:02:45.680> really<00:02:45.800> opened<00:02:46.160> up<00:02:46.250> things<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.610> lot

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
think it's really opened up things a lot

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.780 
think it's really opened up things a lot
and<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.660> definition<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.290> DJ<00:02:48.650> that's<00:02:49.550> kind

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
and the definition of a DJ that's kind

00:02:49.790 --> 00:03:02.180 
and the definition of a DJ that's kind
of<00:02:49.880> changed

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.830 

my<00:03:03.190> goal<00:03:03.430> for<00:03:03.460> this<00:03:03.760> upcoming<00:03:03.970> years<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.660> try

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
my goal for this upcoming years to try

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.200 
my goal for this upcoming years to try
and<00:03:04.990> just<00:03:05.140> keep<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.860> art<00:03:06.070> of<00:03:06.250> turntablism

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
and just keep the the art of turntablism

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.380 
and just keep the the art of turntablism
alive<00:03:07.630> whether<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.110> be<00:03:08.230> with<00:03:08.850> video<00:03:09.850> as<00:03:10.330> well

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
alive whether it be with video as well

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.440 
alive whether it be with video as well
and<00:03:11.020> I<00:03:11.530> think<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.980> still<00:03:12.220> still<00:03:12.970> qualifies

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
and I think that still still qualifies

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.410 
and I think that still still qualifies
as<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:14.070> as<00:03:15.070> turntablism<00:03:15.790> because<00:03:16.090> you're<00:03:16.210> still

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
as a as turntablism because you're still

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.690 
as a as turntablism because you're still
the<00:03:17.350> idea<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.740> what<00:03:17.890> i'm<00:03:18.010> doing<00:03:18.310> is<00:03:18.370> still<00:03:18.610> the
