00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
that just because you know there are

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.380 
that just because you know there are
dogs<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.430> they<00:02:47.549> have<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.730> red<00:02:47.910> zone<00:02:47.940> thing

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
dogs and they have that red zone thing

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.530 
dogs and they have that red zone thing
exactly<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:50.010> know<00:02:50.040> worse<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.420> know

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
exactly and you know worse and you know

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.099 
exactly and you know worse and you know
we<00:02:51.750> as<00:02:51.930> police<00:02:52.109> officers<00:02:52.799> are<00:02:53.190> sometimes

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
we as police officers are sometimes

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.559 
we as police officers are sometimes
sending<00:02:55.109> the<00:02:55.319> dogs<00:02:55.560> into<00:02:55.950> places<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.700> we

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
sending the dogs into places that we

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.180 
sending the dogs into places that we
wouldn't<00:02:57.900> necessarily<00:02:58.049> want<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.530> go<00:02:58.680> yet<00:02:59.040> and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
wouldn't necessarily want to go yet and

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.640 
wouldn't necessarily want to go yet and
that's<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.670> reason<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.690> because<00:03:00.810> we<00:03:01.079> you<00:03:01.530> know

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
that's the reason is because we you know

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.090 
that's the reason is because we you know
if<00:03:01.980> God<00:03:02.730> God<00:03:03.150> forbid<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.750> know<00:03:03.959> he<00:03:04.650> gets<00:03:04.859> hurt

if God God forbid you know he gets hurt

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.090 
if God God forbid you know he gets hurt
or<00:03:05.310> something<00:03:05.930> it's<00:03:06.930> not<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.170> officer<00:03:08.069> they<00:03:08.880> got
