00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
don't think there was anything as far as

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.419 
don't think there was anything as far as
I<00:02:04.770> recall<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:06.270> stood<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:06.780> as<00:02:06.990> an<00:02:07.110> issue<00:02:07.429> so

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
yeah everything seems to be going good

for<00:02:10.920> me<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.190> really<00:02:11.220> don't<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.209> having<00:02:12.959> my

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
for me I really don't like having my

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.500 
for me I really don't like having my
blood<00:02:13.410> tested<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.190> don't<00:02:14.550> do<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.790> very<00:02:15.060> often

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
blood tested so I don't do it very often

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.870 
blood tested so I don't do it very often
that<00:02:16.500> was<00:02:16.769> probably<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.220> first<00:02:17.310> time<00:02:17.730> I'd

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
that was probably the first time I'd

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.949 
that was probably the first time I'd
done<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:19.940> don't<00:02:20.940> even<00:02:21.030> know<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.510> couple<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
done it in I don't even know a couple of

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.810 
done it in I don't even know a couple of
years<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:23.580> feels<00:02:23.850> very<00:02:23.940> odd<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.540> me<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.900> have<00:02:25.110> my

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.550 
years it feels very odd to me to have my
blood<00:02:26.820> taken<00:02:27.120> from<00:02:27.330> my<00:02:27.570> body<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:28.110> feels<00:02:28.440> like

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
blood taken from my body it feels like

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.990 
blood taken from my body it feels like
my<00:02:29.070> life<00:02:29.370> force<00:02:29.730> being<00:02:30.060> drained<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.640> don't

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
my life force being drained so I don't

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.270 
my life force being drained so I don't
do<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.239> very<00:02:33.300> often<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:34.080> whenever<00:02:34.410> I've<00:02:35.010> done

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280

game I didn't know what it was at the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.090 
game I didn't know what it was at the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
time but that's what it turned out to be

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.080 
time but that's what it turned out to be
I<00:03:24.200> fainted<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.410> one<00:03:25.620> point<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.160> was

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
I fainted a one point and that was

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.000 
I fainted a one point and that was
really<00:03:27.600> kind<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:27.989> as<00:03:28.170> bad<00:03:28.380> as<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.650> got<00:03:28.769> I'd

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
really kind of as bad as it got I'd

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.710 
really kind of as bad as it got I'd
never<00:03:29.220> fainted<00:03:29.820> I'd<00:03:29.940> never<00:03:30.150> passed<00:03:30.390> out<00:03:30.570> in<00:03:30.690> my

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
never fainted I'd never passed out in my

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.199 
never fainted I'd never passed out in my
life<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:31.380> suddenly<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:32.040> found<00:03:32.370> myself<00:03:32.489> on<00:03:32.940> the

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
life and suddenly I found myself on the

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.240 
life and suddenly I found myself on the
bathroom<00:03:33.390> floor<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:34.079> had<00:03:34.350> no<00:03:34.500> idea<00:03:34.769> why<00:03:34.950> and

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
bathroom floor and had no idea why and

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.240 
bathroom floor and had no idea why and
it<00:03:36.120> turned<00:03:36.299> out<00:03:36.359> to<00:03:36.510> be<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.959> massive<00:03:37.769> b12

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
it turned out to be a massive b12

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.970 
it turned out to be a massive b12
deficiency<00:03:38.989> so<00:03:39.989> that's<00:03:40.200> also<00:03:40.530> one<00:03:40.829> of<00:03:40.859> the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
deficiency so that's also one of the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.729 
deficiency so that's also one of the
reasons<00:03:41.280> why<00:03:41.489> I'm<00:03:41.880> very<00:03:42.120> cautious<00:03:42.900> about<00:03:43.230> b12

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
reasons why I'm very cautious about b12

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.979 
reasons why I'm very cautious about b12
at<00:03:44.070> this<00:03:44.190> point<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.670> don't<00:03:44.750> believe<00:03:45.750> that

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
at this point I don't believe that

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.449 
at this point I don't believe that
everybody<00:03:46.260> probably<00:03:46.800> needs<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.250> be<00:03:47.370> as

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
everybody probably needs to be as

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.230 
everybody probably needs to be as
cautious<00:03:47.670> as<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:48.120> do
