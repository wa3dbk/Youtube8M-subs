guess<00:02:30.360> what<00:02:30.660> i<00:02:30.989> modded<00:02:31.920> i<00:02:32.299> modded<00:02:33.299> it<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.470> is

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
guess what i modded i modded it so it is

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.890 
guess what i modded i modded it so it is
like<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.099> black<00:02:35.310> ops<00:02:35.580> version<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.480> mp5k

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
like the black ops version the mp5k

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.130 
like the black ops version the mp5k
prototype<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.150> main<00:02:39.299> concern<00:02:39.599> mp5k

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
prototype this is the main concern mp5k

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.449 
prototype this is the main concern mp5k
you<00:02:40.920> put<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.250> back<00:02:42.170> push<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.319> up<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.280> stays

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
you put this back push it up so it stays

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.570 
you put this back push it up so it stays
in<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> locked<00:02:44.819> position<00:02:45.019> then<00:02:46.040> like<00:02:47.040> pretend

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
in a locked position then like pretend

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.289 
in a locked position then like pretend
to<00:02:47.700> reload<00:02:48.060> since<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.780> my<00:02:48.810> proc<00:02:49.880> yes<00:02:50.880> a

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
to reload since this is my proc yes a

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.289 
to reload since this is my proc yes a
lot<00:02:51.569> of<00:02:51.720> tape<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.230> stopping<00:02:52.830> me<00:02:52.860> from<00:02:53.299> waiting

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
lot of tape is stopping me from waiting

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:01.280 
lot of tape is stopping me from waiting
list<00:02:54.540> i'm<00:02:54.750> just-just<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.519> park<00:03:00.109> let<00:03:01.109> me

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
list i'm just-just to this park let me

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.510 
list i'm just-just to this park let me
just<00:03:01.560> take<00:03:01.859> this<00:03:02.010> apart<00:03:04.280> okay

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
just take this apart okay

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.630 
just take this apart okay
so<00:03:07.520> yeah<00:03:07.730> now<00:03:08.270> that's<00:03:09.070> when<00:03:10.070> you<00:03:10.190> can<00:03:10.370> just<00:03:10.400> go

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
so yeah now that's when you can just go

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.060 
so yeah now that's when you can just go
like<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:10.940> put<00:03:11.210> it<00:03:11.300> back<00:03:11.450> in<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:12.050> could<00:03:12.290> stack

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
like this put it back in you could stack

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.810 
like this put it back in you could stack
it<00:03:13.280> down<00:03:13.460> here<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.330> back<00:03:15.320> reload<00:03:16.130> put<00:03:16.610> back

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
it down here that back reload put back

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.450 
it down here that back reload put back
up<00:03:17.060> back<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.660> down<00:03:17.810> black<00:03:18.470> ops<00:03:18.680> reload<00:03:19.070> is<00:03:19.310> that

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
up back it down black ops reload is that

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.600 
up back it down black ops reload is that
cool<00:03:19.990> so<00:03:20.990> I<00:03:21.020> did<00:03:21.470> that<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:23.110> Ironsides<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.710> I

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
cool so I did that the Ironsides I I

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.100 
cool so I did that the Ironsides I I
found<00:03:26.600> out<00:03:26.780> were<00:03:27.020> pretty<00:03:27.950> cool<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:30.940> don't<00:03:31.940> know

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
found out were pretty cool I don't know

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.900 
found out were pretty cool I don't know
next<00:03:33.110> mon<00:03:33.260> I'm<00:03:33.440> thinking<00:03:33.770> of<00:03:33.830> doing<00:03:33.910> whichever

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
next mon I'm thinking of doing whichever

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.460 
next mon I'm thinking of doing whichever
there<00:03:35.210> was<00:03:35.330> some<00:03:35.510> guy<00:03:35.720> in<00:03:35.840> YouTube<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.320> did

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
there was some guy in YouTube that did

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.560 
there was some guy in YouTube that did
this<00:03:36.650> he<00:03:37.580> took<00:03:37.790> off<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.030> tactical<00:03:38.420> rail

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
this he took off the tactical rail

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.900 
this he took off the tactical rail
forgot<00:03:38.900> his<00:03:38.990> name<00:03:39.020> they<00:03:39.740> punctured<00:03:40.400> he<00:03:40.700> put<00:03:40.880> a

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
forgot his name they punctured he put a

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.360 
forgot his name they punctured he put a
hole<00:03:41.210> somewhere<00:03:41.540> here<00:03:42.050> so<00:03:42.800> he<00:03:42.980> doesn't<00:03:43.100> have

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
hole somewhere here so he doesn't have

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.670 
hole somewhere here so he doesn't have
to<00:03:43.430> have<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.790> scope<00:03:44.090> on<00:03:44.330> cuz<00:03:45.080> when<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.440> bought

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
to have the scope on cuz when I bought

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.940 
to have the scope on cuz when I bought
this<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.340> was<00:03:46.580> um<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:47.200> didn't<00:03:48.200> know<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.800> the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
this it was um I didn't know that the

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.930 
this it was um I didn't know that the
mag<00:03:49.490> was<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.820> battery<00:03:50.300> and<00:03:50.690> then<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:51.530> scope<00:03:52.010> it

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
mag was a battery and then the scope it

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.460 
mag was a battery and then the scope it
had<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.210> be<00:03:53.240> attached<00:03:53.690> because<00:03:53.960> that<00:03:54.200> was<00:03:54.320> the

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
had to be attached because that was the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.550 
had to be attached because that was the
mag<00:03:54.680> so<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:56.000> then<00:03:56.120> there's<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.720> smart<00:03:57.080> guy<00:03:57.230> who

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
mag so and then there's a smart guy who

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.230 
mag so and then there's a smart guy who
puts<00:03:57.860> his<00:03:58.010> whole<00:03:58.490> there's<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:58.970> hole<00:03:59.210> right

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
puts his whole there's a hole right

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.990 
puts his whole there's a hole right
there<00:03:59.450> and<00:03:59.990> he<00:04:00.260> cuts<00:04:00.440> through<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.740> hole<00:04:00.980> here<00:04:01.460> so

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
there and he cuts through a hole here so

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.400 
there and he cuts through a hole here so
he<00:04:02.270> could<00:04:02.390> just<00:04:02.570> load<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.840> babies<00:04:03.170> through

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
he could just load the babies through

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.290 
he could just load the babies through
here<00:04:03.770> and<00:04:03.920> it<00:04:04.220> was<00:04:04.370> shoot<00:04:04.610> instead<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.210> the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
here and it was shoot instead of the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.300 
here and it was shoot instead of the
scope<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:06.320> problem<00:04:06.590> with<00:04:06.680> that<00:04:06.710> is<00:04:06.860> it<00:04:07.250> could

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
scope the problem with that is it could

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.490 
scope the problem with that is it could
probably<00:04:07.520> hold<00:04:07.730> like<00:04:08.030> 15<00:04:08.900> bullets<00:04:09.140> like<00:04:09.440> a

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
probably hold like 15 bullets like a

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.600 
probably hold like 15 bullets like a
pistol<00:04:09.970> but<00:04:10.970> now<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.090> can't<00:04:11.800> do<00:04:12.800> that<00:04:13.010> so<00:04:13.430> maybe

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
pistol but now I can't do that so maybe

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.250 
pistol but now I can't do that so maybe
I'm<00:04:13.820> probably<00:04:14.090> going<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.450> mod<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:14.690> like<00:04:14.990> that<00:04:15.200> i

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
I'm probably going to mod it like that i

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.580 
I'm probably going to mod it like that i
don't<00:04:15.530> know<00:04:15.830> i<00:04:16.070> don't<00:04:16.100> really<00:04:16.459> care<00:04:16.970> my<00:04:17.750> 8.4

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
don't know i don't really care my 8.4

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.220 
don't know i don't really care my 8.4

I should get another one I don't know

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.600 
I should get another one I don't know
it'll<00:04:32.570> waste<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.680> waste<00:04:33.830> my<00:04:33.980> money<00:04:34.190> because

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
up this video to show you the mod how I

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.880 
up this video to show you the mod how I
did<00:05:59.560> it<00:05:59.680> well<00:05:59.860> basically<00:06:00.460> all<00:06:00.760> I<00:06:00.790> did<00:06:01.230> hear<00:06:02.230> it

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
did it well basically all I did hear it

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.890 
did it well basically all I did hear it
just<00:06:03.160> cut<00:06:03.520> a<00:06:03.760> portion<00:06:04.120> off<00:06:04.900> of<00:06:05.830> this<00:06:06.130> plastic

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
just cut a portion off of this plastic

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.340 
just cut a portion off of this plastic
so<00:06:07.900> I<00:06:08.110> could<00:06:08.380> put<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:08.860> this<00:06:09.729> bolt<00:06:10.240> I<00:06:10.510> think<00:06:11.229> it

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
so I could put the this bolt I think it

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.310 
so I could put the this bolt I think it
is<00:06:11.440> a<00:06:11.470> fake<00:06:11.800> bolt<00:06:12.040> up<00:06:12.340> here<00:06:13.120> so<00:06:13.810> we'll<00:06:13.900> stay<00:06:14.139> and

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
is a fake bolt up here so we'll stay and

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.560 
is a fake bolt up here so we'll stay and
so<00:06:14.860> let<00:06:15.040> me<00:06:15.130> smack<00:06:15.400> it<00:06:15.550> back<00:06:15.700> down<00:06:15.940> you<00:06:16.389> could

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.510 
so let me smack it back down you could
uh<00:06:17.220> it's<00:06:18.220> like<00:06:18.370> a<00:06:18.400> realistic<00:06:18.910> mp5<00:06:19.540> reload
