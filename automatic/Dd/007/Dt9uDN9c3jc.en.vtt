don't use hair products all that kind of
jazz<00:00:43.820> but<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> other<00:00:45.180> side

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
jazz but then on the other side

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.080 
jazz but then on the other side
sometimes<00:00:45.840> I'll<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:46.289> things<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.890> I'll<00:00:47.670> hate

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
sometimes I'll get things and I'll hate

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.020 
sometimes I'll get things and I'll hate
it<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.050> crap<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.710> don't<00:00:49.980> use<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.219> most

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
it and it's crap so I don't use it most

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.130 
it and it's crap so I don't use it most
of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.180> time<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.480> tutorials<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:52.020> don't

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
of the time I do tutorials I don't

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
of the time I do tutorials I don't
really<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> review<00:00:52.620> type<00:00:53.039> things<00:00:53.309> either<00:00:53.640> so

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
really do a review type things either so

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.490 
really do a review type things either so
that's<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.870> another<00:00:55.020> reason<00:00:55.379> why<00:00:55.469> I

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that's kind of another reason why I

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.200 
that's kind of another reason why I
don't<00:00:55.559> want<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> do<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.370> also<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:57.000> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
don't want to do that and also because I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.729

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
it's like kind of like it's shaped like

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.480 
it's like kind of like it's shaped like
this<00:03:12.880> Sigma<00:03:13.150> round<00:03:13.750> top<00:03:14.080> kabuki<00:03:14.340> except<00:03:15.340> it's

this Sigma round top kabuki except it's

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.449 
this Sigma round top kabuki except it's
so<00:03:15.760> much<00:03:16.320> kind<00:03:17.320> of<00:03:17.380> fluffier<00:03:17.800> I<00:03:17.950> guess<00:03:18.220> then

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
so much kind of fluffier I guess then

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.090 
so much kind of fluffier I guess then
there's<00:03:18.640> there's<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.300> like<00:03:19.600> dense<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.770> hard

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
there's there's a so like dense and hard

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.830 
there's there's a so like dense and hard
that<00:03:21.490> it<00:03:21.760> really<00:03:22.150> doesn't<00:03:22.390> blend<00:03:22.750> well

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
that it really doesn't blend well

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.680 
that it really doesn't blend well
because<00:03:23.320> it's<00:03:23.470> just<00:03:23.650> too<00:03:24.100> too<00:03:24.550> dense<00:03:24.850> this<00:03:25.450> is

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
because it's just too too dense this is

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.720 
because it's just too too dense this is
like<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.020> perfect<00:03:26.260> density<00:03:26.860> for<00:03:27.070> liquid<00:03:27.430> and

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
like the perfect density for liquid and

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.820
