into<00:01:03.320> tidal<00:01:03.530> areas<00:01:03.800> and<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:04.250> I<00:01:04.430> think

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
into tidal areas and so I think

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.680 
into tidal areas and so I think
sometimes<00:01:04.940> people<00:01:05.180> think<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:05.570> these

to<00:01:08.600> ares<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.290> water<00:01:09.470> just<00:01:09.650> runs<00:01:09.830> out<00:01:10.040> from

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
to ares and the water just runs out from

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.710 
to ares and the water just runs out from
underneath<00:01:10.370> them<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:11.240> most<00:01:11.540> rewarding

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
underneath them the most rewarding

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.020 
underneath them the most rewarding
situation<00:01:12.680> was<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.250> mass<00:01:13.520> stranding<00:01:13.940> of

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030

the conditions were very treacherous

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.730 
the conditions were very treacherous

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
probably shouldn't have been able to do

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.260 
probably shouldn't have been able to do
what<00:01:18.860> we<00:01:18.920> did<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:19.280> was<00:01:19.370> sheer<00:01:19.610> willpower<00:01:19.850> they

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
to your hips so basically made a bridge

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.760 
to your hips so basically made a bridge
out<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.570> these<00:01:32.690> animals<00:01:33.110> across<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.560> mud<00:01:33.740> and

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
out to these animals across the mud and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.160 
out to these animals across the mud and
what<00:01:37.000> we've<00:01:38.000> transported<00:01:38.540> them<00:01:38.810> in<00:01:39.020> our

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
what we've transported them in our

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.200 
what we've transported them in our
trailers<00:01:39.650> we<00:01:39.770> have<00:01:39.890> two<00:01:40.070> very<00:01:40.340> large<00:01:40.790> recipe

trailers wall in route we run a health

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.230 
trailers wall in route we run a health
assessment<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.490> we're<00:01:43.640> able<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:43.910> draw<00:01:44.030> blood

analysis<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:45.590> we<00:01:45.680> can<00:01:45.800> tell<00:01:46.010> if<00:01:46.130> these<00:01:46.280> are

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
analysis so we can tell if these are

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.710 
analysis so we can tell if these are
healthy<00:01:46.880> enough<00:01:46.910> animals<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:47.480> we<00:01:47.570> can

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
healthy enough animals that we can

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.300 
healthy enough animals that we can
release<00:01:47.930> them<00:01:48.080> south<00:01:48.650> our<00:01:48.770> ultimate<00:01:48.980> goal<00:01:49.160> is

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
release them south our ultimate goal is

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.090 
release them south our ultimate goal is
to<00:01:49.400> do<00:01:49.520> an<00:01:49.640> immediate<00:01:50.150> release

animal that had been through so much and

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.300 
animal that had been through so much and
to<00:02:54.360> make<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:54.810> close<00:02:57.650> yeah<00:02:58.650> animals<00:02:59.160> die

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
to make it so close yeah animals die

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.420 
to make it so close yeah animals die
it's<00:03:00.090> hard<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.420> deal<00:03:00.600> with<00:03:01.040> we<00:03:02.040> don't<00:03:02.190> have<00:03:02.340> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
it's hard to deal with we don't have the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.320 
it's hard to deal with we don't have the
power<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.730> save<00:03:02.970> every<00:03:03.210> single<00:03:03.480> animal<00:03:03.630> but<00:03:05.330> I

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
power to save every single animal but I

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.150 
power to save every single animal but I
will<00:03:06.480> also<00:03:06.510> say<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.900> every<00:03:07.350> single<00:03:07.830> death

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
will also say that every single death

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.380 
will also say that every single death
does<00:03:08.400> take<00:03:08.580> its<00:03:08.730> toll<00:03:08.910> on<00:03:08.970> everybody

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.950 

certainly<00:03:15.390> those<00:03:15.450> animals<00:03:15.780> would<00:03:15.870> have

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
certainly those animals would have

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.090 
certainly those animals would have
suffered<00:03:16.230> having<00:03:16.500> not<00:03:16.590> been<00:03:16.620> able<00:03:16.770> get<00:03:16.980> out

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
suffered having not been able get out

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.230 
suffered having not been able get out
there<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.490> kills<00:03:17.730> us<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.090> weren't

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
there and it kills us that we weren't

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.650 
there and it kills us that we weren't
able<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.510> get<00:03:18.720> those<00:03:19.260> other<00:03:19.440> animals<00:03:23.660> neither
