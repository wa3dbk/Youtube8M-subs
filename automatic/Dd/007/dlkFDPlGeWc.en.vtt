and<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.489> believe<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> first<00:00:42.059> thing<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.780> did<00:00:42.870> was

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and I believe the first thing we did was

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.240 
and I believe the first thing we did was
just<00:00:43.140> walk<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.500> getting<00:00:43.710> used<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> brake

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
just walk it getting used to the brake

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.799 
just walk it getting used to the brake
the<00:00:44.280> front<00:00:44.489> brake<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.570> they<00:00:45.629> look<00:00:45.780> I

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the front brake I think they look I

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.529 
the front brake I think they look I
think<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.050> walked<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.469> first<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:48.180> second

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
think we walked it first and the second

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.060 
think we walked it first and the second
time<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.020> popped<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
time you know we just popped it in the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.100 
time you know we just popped it in the
first<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.700> let<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> clutch<00:00:51.120> go<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.719> we

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
first and just let the clutch go and we

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.439 
first and just let the clutch go and we
just<00:00:52.260> walked<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.039> whole<00:00:53.219> time<00:00:53.460> go

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449

out at first and then in the second gear
once<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.090> get<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> hang<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.540> second<00:01:39.869> gear

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
you're gonna start doing these little

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.319 
you're gonna start doing these little
corner<00:01:41.400> turns<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.820> know<00:01:41.909> they're<00:01:42.000> gonna<00:01:42.090> have

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
corner turns you know they're gonna have

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.260 
corner turns you know they're gonna have
little<00:01:42.810> cones<00:01:43.290> around<00:01:43.560> here<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.939> can<00:01:45.149> go

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
little cones around here you can go

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.730 
little cones around here you can go
through<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.540> turn<00:01:45.750> cones<00:01:46.500> are<00:01:46.560> gonna<00:01:46.649> be

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
through the turn cones are gonna be

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
through the turn cones are gonna be
right<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.070> little<00:01:47.130> triangle<00:01:47.520> go<00:01:48.390> through

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
right in that little triangle go through

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.420 
right in that little triangle go through
the<00:01:48.689> turn<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.170> what<00:01:49.979> they're<00:01:50.100> gonna<00:01:50.189> expect

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the turn now what they're gonna expect

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.370 
the turn now what they're gonna expect
though<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:50.909> when<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.329> turn<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.140> you

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
though is that when you turn you you you

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.960 
though is that when you turn you you you
know<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.799> bike<00:01:53.070> will<00:01:53.280> follow<00:01:53.549> your<00:01:53.729> heads

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
know your bike will follow your heads

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.280 
know your bike will follow your heads
you<00:01:54.180> want<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> turn<00:01:54.570> look<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.990> where<00:01:55.140> you're

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you want to turn look to where you're

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.499 
you want to turn look to where you're
turning<00:01:55.680> your<00:01:56.610> bike<00:01:56.729> will<00:01:56.909> follow<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.299> mean

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.600 
turning your bike will follow I mean
that's<00:01:57.719> just<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.320> general<00:01:58.649> rule<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.920> turning

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
that's just the general rule of turning

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.490 
that's just the general rule of turning
on<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> motorcycle<00:02:00.000> your<00:02:00.689> bike<00:02:00.960> wants<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.320> go

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
on a motorcycle your bike wants to go

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
on a motorcycle your bike wants to go
where<00:02:01.680> you're<00:02:01.799> looking<00:02:01.920> because<00:02:02.219> your<00:02:02.369> body

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
where you're looking because your body

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.660 
where you're looking because your body
wants<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.850> follow<00:02:03.090> your<00:02:03.270> your<00:02:03.719> eyes<00:02:03.810> obviously

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
wants to follow your your eyes obviously

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
so you know just get the hang of that

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.930 
so you know just get the hang of that
and<00:02:07.099> once<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.610> couple<00:02:08.849> times

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.620 
here they have green and red markers on
the<00:02:13.410> graph

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
the graph

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.780 
the graph
put<00:02:13.870> cones<00:02:14.050> here<00:02:14.260> for<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.860> it's<00:02:15.610> the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
to stay under 20 I believe her 15 miles

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.360 
to stay under 20 I believe her 15 miles
now<00:02:29.230> when<00:02:29.440> doing<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:29.710> course<00:02:29.980> it's<00:02:30.250> not

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
now when doing this course it's not

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.440 
now when doing this course it's not
really<00:02:30.400> meant<00:02:30.760> for<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.960> know<00:02:32.080> flying<00:02:32.530> by<00:02:32.890> but

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
really meant for you know flying by but

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.340 
really meant for you know flying by but
once<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.540> get<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.720> hang<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.990> it<00:02:35.110> it's<00:02:35.290> just

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
once you get the hang of it it's just

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.080 
once you get the hang of it it's just
much<00:02:36.190> easy<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.700> do

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.370 

so<00:02:40.090> those<00:02:40.240> are<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.510> those<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.900> first<00:02:41.050> few

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
so those are the those the first few

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.640 
so those are the those the first few
first<00:02:41.740> couple<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.460> few<00:02:42.670> practices<00:02:43.410> later<00:02:44.410> on

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
first couple of few practices later on

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.490 
first couple of few practices later on
you're<00:02:44.830> gonna<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.630> know<00:02:46.720> complete<00:02:47.140> stop

gonna be right over here
and<00:02:53.380> these<00:02:53.500> little<00:02:53.680> marks<00:02:53.980> on<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.130> ground<00:02:54.340> to

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
and these little marks on the ground to

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.610 
and these little marks on the ground to
see<00:02:54.520> how<00:02:54.700> long<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:54.970> takes<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.210> to<00:02:55.270> stop<00:02:55.620> now

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
actually all the way around the track I

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.460 
actually all the way around the track I
think<00:03:55.060> when<00:03:55.360> I<00:03:55.450> did<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:55.690> did<00:03:55.900> that<00:03:56.050> turn<00:03:56.230> then

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
think when I did it I did that turn then

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.220 
think when I did it I did that turn then
we<00:03:56.530> go<00:03:56.680> all<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:56.860> way<00:03:56.980> around<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.990> over<00:03:58.990> here

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
we go all the way around and over here

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.050 
we go all the way around and over here
no<00:03:59.500> no<00:03:59.980> let<00:04:00.160> me<00:04:00.190> rephrase<00:04:00.490> that<00:04:00.550> I<00:04:00.730> did<00:04:00.940> that

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
no no let me rephrase that I did that

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.590 
no no let me rephrase that I did that
turn<00:04:01.270> let<00:04:02.230> me<00:04:02.260> just<00:04:02.709> start<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:03.040> over<00:04:03.600> you're

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
turn let me just start this over you're

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.500 
turn let me just start this over you're
gonna<00:04:04.660> do<00:04:04.840> this<00:04:05.020> turn<00:04:05.170> up<00:04:05.380> here

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.050 

so<00:04:09.510> if<00:04:09.780> we<00:04:09.870> did<00:04:10.079> this<00:04:10.260> turn<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:11.599> afterwards<00:04:12.599> I

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
so if we did this turn and afterwards I

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.110 
so if we did this turn and afterwards I
believe<00:04:15.060> we<00:04:15.180> went<00:04:15.299> over<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.629> this<00:04:15.719> corner<00:04:16.049> and

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
doesn't take much to do but in the long

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.520 
doesn't take much to do but in the long

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.610 
it that it's all useful there's no point
not<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.680> take<00:05:07.860> it<00:05:08.099> I<00:05:08.250> mean<00:05:09.080> it's<00:05:10.080> it's<00:05:10.530> just

right<00:06:01.320> here<00:06:01.770> I<00:06:01.949> see<00:06:02.520> this<00:06:02.639> green<00:06:03.030> line<00:06:03.300> on<00:06:03.509> the

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
right here I see this green line on the

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.060 
right here I see this green line on the
ground<00:06:03.840> and<00:06:03.990> I'm<00:06:04.050> wondering<00:06:04.259> if<00:06:04.560> that's<00:06:04.740> you

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
ground and I'm wondering if that's you

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.469 
ground and I'm wondering if that's you
know<00:06:05.130> like<00:06:05.280> an<00:06:05.370> advanced<00:06:05.729> course<00:06:06.000> cuz<00:06:06.360> I

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
know like an advanced course cuz I

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:07.820 
know like an advanced course cuz I
didn't<00:06:06.690> see<00:06:06.810> that<00:06:06.990> there<00:06:07.169> when<00:06:07.320> I<00:06:07.349> was<00:06:07.530> doing

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
didn't see that there when I was doing

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.390 
didn't see that there when I was doing
this<00:06:08.070> course<00:06:08.930> it's<00:06:09.930> a<00:06:10.080> like<00:06:10.560> an<00:06:10.650> S<00:06:10.860> pattern<00:06:10.889> you

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
this course it's a like an S pattern you

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.330 
this course it's a like an S pattern you
know<00:06:12.710> it's<00:06:13.710> really<00:06:14.009> tight<00:06:14.250> turns<00:06:14.520> too

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
know it's really tight turns too

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.740 
know it's really tight turns too
I<00:06:16.960> went<00:06:17.960> a<00:06:17.990> little<00:06:18.020> out<00:06:18.410> of<00:06:18.440> line<00:06:19.360> but<00:06:20.360> it's<00:06:20.600> an

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
I went a little out of line but it's an

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.540 
I went a little out of line but it's an
S<00:06:20.900> pattern<00:06:20.930> I'm<00:06:21.350> wondering<00:06:21.680> if<00:06:21.740> that's<00:06:21.860> what

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
S pattern I'm wondering if that's what

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.879 
S pattern I'm wondering if that's what
that's<00:06:22.760> there<00:06:22.940> for<00:06:23.530> kinda<00:06:24.530> watch<00:06:24.650> I'm<00:06:24.770> gonna

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
that's there for kinda watch I'm gonna

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:25.480 
that's there for kinda watch I'm gonna
try<00:06:25.010> that<00:06:25.040> again

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
try that again

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.580 
try that again
I'm<00:06:26.479> sure<00:06:26.690> he's<00:06:26.810> supposed<00:06:26.990> to<00:06:27.050> take<00:06:27.199> that<00:06:27.350> you

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
I'm sure he's supposed to take that you

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.150 
I'm sure he's supposed to take that you
know<00:06:27.710> much<00:06:27.949> slower<00:06:28.220> than<00:06:28.310> I<00:06:28.490> had<00:06:28.669> than<00:06:28.820> I<00:06:28.910> did

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
know much slower than I had than I did

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.240 
know much slower than I had than I did
so<00:06:31.160> let's<00:06:31.430> let's<00:06:31.639> try<00:06:31.760> the<00:06:31.880> slower<00:06:33.100> there<00:06:34.100> we

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
so let's let's try the slower there we

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.939 
so let's let's try the slower there we
go

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
go

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.020 
go
I'm<00:06:36.949> sure<00:06:37.160> that's<00:06:37.370> exactly<00:06:37.520> what<00:06:37.940> you're

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
I'm sure that's exactly what you're

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.450
