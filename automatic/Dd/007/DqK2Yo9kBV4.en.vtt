 function when the curtain goes out when 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.650
 everything is deleted is written and point 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.960
 when someone older enjoyed the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.119
 moment that we are together because you and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.880
 I am one I dream you listen to me 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.619
 like many other times that we had like this 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.090
 we decided for it fight and be you 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.290

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.170

 I do not write to you as always, the world turns 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.960
 you can not stop everything changes nothing 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.850
 lasts eternally life continues to live 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.280
 smiling and I do not listen is very vulgar 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.850
 but I do not understand if I'm looking at the sun 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.340
 flight 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.530
 I open my arms to the comfort I leave 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.110
 take by instinct life follows 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.729
 look for your way today everything is the same as 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.560
 yesterday but more older more loses 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.200
 hyperboles invoices and condoms in the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.120
 garbage tie knots points us 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.680
 they surpass the reality both a 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.840
 moment of life that I do not care what 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.060
 they say what they think what they do what 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.160
 to make an effort if they then criticize 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.170
 always live smiling cries when 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.690
 you have to vent with a drink of 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.810
 aguardiente friend shows fidelity 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.550
 one hundred percent without humility to 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.130
 who lives one hundred percent with that 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.959
 disability I'm sorry I do not upload these 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.330
 happy stories I know that everything is a 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.970
 invention of the television for partridge 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.250
 those flocks smile for tricks by 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.620
 false charges commissions of rhymes to 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.140
 terms in the bank murmurs of the street 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.620
 abstract sound on paper lives faithful 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.250
 to instinct be yourself and do not look at 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.980
 the rest 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.810
 if the head said come and the reason that you 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.880
 Do not enter goals because nothing is 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.490
 perfect me and I can not stop myself 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.430
 I write as always I enter tour not 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.760
 you can stop and everything changes nothing lasts 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.490
 eternally life is still alive smiling 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.620
 These are very good but I do not understand if 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.020
 I trip up the flight I open my arms 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.980
 the consolation I let myself be carried away by the 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.590
 life instinct is still seeking its way 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.980
 come back for it fight and come back 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.260
 for all lives and returns they return 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.370
 you want to enjoy in peace for not crying 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.640
 issues come back for it fight and come back 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.550
 Come back soon live us and come back 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.610
 the desire to enjoy in peace for not 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.250
 cry topics if I can not stop myself 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.840
 I write as always the world turns not 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.180
 you can stop him 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.120
 how it changes nothing lasts eternally 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.760
 life is still alive smiling heard 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.560
 murmur but not doing if I stumble 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.930
 until the flight although the arms at 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.900
 consolation was carried away by instinct 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.900
 life is still looking for your way
