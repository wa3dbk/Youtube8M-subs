00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.479
 we are working now with Bonnekessel leaving the tragic figure of this 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:05.770
 game 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.840
 in the first half he had already injured great the one of the 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.930
 Defense holds together but that we as their depots would also suffer 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.409
 somehow the feeling is right now 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.469
 Freescale if I first reading sad reality percent 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.859
 the Reuss whimsical 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.989
 Early out must be different Euro 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.589
 I did not get lost that we meet 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:27.669
 introduced to 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:28.680
 in advance 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.949
 or warm water 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.900
 I wanted the rest of my life 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.320
 the presiding judge 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.570
 that was the best 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.340
 I still think that people see 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.530
 a bit of courage has four new regions so start and end of September 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.200
 It will add to other testimonies that even the big crossroads you look at 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.940
 Makes thoughts 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.260
 But maybe that will make him faster 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.309
 that has always been 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.150
 the more pleasing is the percentage 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.720
 Hundreds of users certainly promised more from the game and word more 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.700
 Standard situation Domestic dogs can play round strengths 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.850
 Unfortunately, we did not manage to get the second one 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.340
 I have it synonymous if sufficient round can make the pace that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.010
 Everyone still so Jung von Matt the mother again so Martina Strutz handle and 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.880
 at that time immediately 17 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.560
 he said that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.670
 and I myself know what it is what it is 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.830
 write 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.920
 Numerous restaurants like him say we leave the wish to go swimming 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.800
 Michelsen is 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.000
 I just have to see that Mr. Corman is changing her 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.970
 Only 40 days better and then again after play 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.369
 who with Dr percent quasi the nÃ¶ 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.069
 the exit of the fights is playing and as well as expected as well prepared as 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.030
 I'm having a nice evening 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.840
 with which impressions and feelings and won thereby also for powerful 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.090
 is disconnected 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.890
 the strikers lost the profile 2 0 percent 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.880
 looks a bit unreal but set 2 0 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.600
 we say they were angry what the coach says about the game 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.030
 yes was exactly right trouble by Friedhelm be accommodated 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.440
 4% want to win that Werder want to come there will be as old as we think 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.860
 also occurred 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.619
 Annette Bernstein outstanding not around but if you profit against such 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.920
 at risk are Walter 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.660
 Roll out there the covenant clear all for that I must have told her and 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.189
 very very much beaten Wacker 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.629
 in all areas at the 90 minute that was the second quarter 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:22.899
 the order is clear 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:27.249
 but ultimately we missed for the first time for 40% for the first time 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.459
 The last minute Sainz built for us, of course 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.260
 pretty bitter that Niklas Bonnekessel an incredibly important player for 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:38.029
 we are so early replaced be angry that was already three points 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:42.560
 because he gave them in midfield one of those who is there but us 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.050
 but you have to say that under me of course but open it in every position 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.499
 Murder 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.019
 absolute optimum 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.780
 Everywhere the included one was the towering wii-remote clerk 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.270
 Obama told ARD that mushrooms would do this 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.970
 what are these last few percentage points 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.410
 by Jens Wegener is very clear there is different on Morgestraich 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.900
 says Morgan made a great fight 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.660
 but now here's what's said in the hall before the game we wanted here 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.809
 win 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.449
 Mouths sharp animal 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:15.009
 Herder says about bricklayer solution body he says he has to dispense just as many 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.129
 Gerda won titles over the dry winter but when so did the scale 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:19.549
 the bigoted interview gave 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.180
 good for just five goals make the defense clear and the Proper is always on 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.159
 work 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.620
 Jarvis requires Oswald Marr's bit more hectic joining 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.279
 Wahlmann who can be held then said to drive to the top 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:31.849
 the list of exhibitors 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.729
 come that may want that can be on the big goal of Siemens for that 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.159
 some players still 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.569
 Federer took off slipping unclear 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.159
 Only our goal was that's in the specially we wanted to go over 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.150
 the one in the interface comes from NEC between Lorenzo and Firth Appetit 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.200
 Percent that means our our tactics that is our first met twice completely 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.400
 well succeeded Peruzzo immediately dangerous but one step 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.030
 Too late at the first post to get close but in the end you have to own one 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.569
 such clear handballerisch German Niederrad yes the on the team too 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.729
 in the morning visibility in three league difference and the work you do 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:09.569
 Of course, not everyone plays every weekend in front of egg-throwers and thousands 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.789
 spectator 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:14.249
 and that you do not want the total combined you want to be 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.309
 Coach I also wish the troupe but that is not always so implemented 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:18.569
 it's also possible to become one 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:19.959
 the outlet center 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.940
 But Latvala was still proud of me anyway 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.500
 Be accused of midweek 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.170
 that all seen or what during the day or at one or the other percentage point 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.949
 say 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.009
 we're already lucky enough to be on the lookout bottom
