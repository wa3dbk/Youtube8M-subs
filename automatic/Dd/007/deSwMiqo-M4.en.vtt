00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello ladies and gentlemen and in this 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.540
 video we 're trying to go personal 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.540
 was puzzled 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:17.000
 15 to j 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.670
 for light tanks honestly say a lot 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.740
 battles tried to accomplish this task because 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.960
 in this problem, you need to devote as many as 4000 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.300
 damage to your soup 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.880
 your light 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:38.239
 it was difficult to do it alone 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:40.510
 the way out it was an aggressive light I decided 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:46.239
 work egrisi 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.239
 Now we have broken that I did 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.760
 so as you see I drove into the hangar and then 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.359
 have enlighten 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.359
 players 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:08.570
 wants to kill me but as you already understand 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.070
 further it failed my 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.070
 allies still carried him 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:23.900
 this is a fight each must 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:29.229
 capture your enemy base defend 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.229
 own or endure all opponents 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:40.280
 so as you see on me su-152 left 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:45.649
 44 entered of course here is not very 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:48.009
 reasonably this way but it brought 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.009
 your results 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:03.900
 and think and they always go backwards and 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.900
 no gravel legs at all for a long time 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.799
 you see even here 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.060
 of 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.440
 with a very incomprehensible nickname 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.440
 said it would be beautiful 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.150
 would like to talk to you about it in 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:29.980
 grooves personal combat missions I don't know who 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:37.150
 thought it up but damn honest 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:37.150
 the idea is so bad 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.210
 and don't know about two hundred played to make 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.160
 this task 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:49.720
 because I only have a Christmas tree 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:54.720
 I even pumped myself am e am x12 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.720
 on it for making it even harder 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.490
 at the moment I'm about shone already 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.700
 thousand three more in the world 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.080
 now our 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.580
 our team fell forward more quickly 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.580
 all that they want to capture the base 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.650
 let's hope that I really 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.650
 enough 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:58.069
 to pull so grab base on 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.209
 his century 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.209
 even managed to become 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:12.439
 so I got it I got 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:14.230
 masters got thousands of experience and look 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.840
 all how much I have seen 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.709
 I enlightened four and a half thousand 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.049
