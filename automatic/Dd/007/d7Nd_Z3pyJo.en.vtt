00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
I think those additions along with kind

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.960 
I think those additions along with kind
of<00:01:00.059> your<00:01:00.210> classic<00:01:00.750> stylings<00:01:01.589> really<00:01:02.549> make<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
possible and certainly for myself I

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.320 
possible and certainly for myself I
found<00:01:28.830> touring<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.490> world<00:01:29.670> over<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> years

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
found touring the world over the years

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.850 
found touring the world over the years
when<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:30.810> from<00:01:31.020> various<00:01:31.350> climates

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860

the<00:01:34.680> graphite<00:01:35.070> reinforcement<00:01:35.880> really<00:01:36.150> helps

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
the graphite reinforcement really helps

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.930 
the graphite reinforcement really helps
to<00:01:36.660> stabilize<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.650> neck<00:01:37.830> it's<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.460> bolt<00:01:38.700> on

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
to stabilize the neck it's a bolt on

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.180 
to stabilize the neck it's a bolt on
construction<00:01:39.510> which<00:01:40.170> adds<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.650> lot<00:01:40.800> of<00:01:40.920> punch

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190
