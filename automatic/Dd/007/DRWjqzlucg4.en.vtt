00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.560 
one of these sea animals under the water
for<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.520> peyote<00:01:35.790> Easter<00:01:36.060> eggs<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.299> want<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> be

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
for the peyote Easter eggs I want to be

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.090 
for the peyote Easter eggs I want to be
able<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> attack<00:01:36.990> people<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> shark

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
able to attack people because a shark

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.830 
able to attack people because a shark
can<00:01:38.280> go<00:01:38.430> around<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.820> bite<00:01:39.060> things<00:01:39.390> but

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
can go around and bite things but

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.450 
can go around and bite things but
there's<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.350> there's<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.009> things

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
there's not like there's you know things

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.490 
there's not like there's you know things
in<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.790> water<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:42.990> attack<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.409> it's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
in the water that you can attack so it's

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.020 
in the water that you can attack so it's
kind<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.710> pointless<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.280> become<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:44.850> of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
kind of pointless to become like one of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.480 
kind of pointless to become like one of
these<00:01:45.149> sea<00:01:45.299> animals<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.840> my<00:01:46.350> take<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:47.040> it's

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
these sea animals in my take but it's

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.010 
these sea animals in my take but it's
fun<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.000> mess<00:01:48.180> around<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> hammerhead

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
fun just a mess around is a hammerhead

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.139 
fun just a mess around is a hammerhead
shark<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.649> see<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.060> see

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
shark and see what you can do and see

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.569 
shark and see what you can do and see
how<00:01:51.420> they<00:01:51.630> act<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> environment<00:01:52.950> they're

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
how they act in the environment they're

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.999 
how they act in the environment they're
very<00:01:53.820> nimble<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.630> don't<00:01:55.409> know<00:01:55.470> how<00:01:55.619> big<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
very nimble and I don't know how big the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.859 
very nimble and I don't know how big the
player<00:01:56.579> models<00:01:56.969> are<00:01:57.119> for<00:01:57.299> these<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.600> some<00:01:57.750> of

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
player models are for these but some of

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.399 
player models are for these but some of
these<00:01:57.960> ocean<00:01:58.829> things<00:01:59.100> are<00:01:59.310> pretty<00:01:59.880> small<00:02:00.409> like

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
these ocean things are pretty small like

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.230 
these ocean things are pretty small like
I'd<00:02:01.590> say<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.189> hammerhead<00:02:02.549> sharks<00:02:02.850> probably

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
I'd say the hammerhead sharks probably

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.090 
I'd say the hammerhead sharks probably
the<00:02:03.299> size<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.689> person<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.829> would<00:02:04.950> see

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the size of a person so if I would see

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.560 
the size of a person so if I would see
this<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.369> real<00:02:05.549> life<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.880> wouldn't<00:02:06.180> be<00:02:06.270> really

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
this in real life I wouldn't be really

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.969 
this in real life I wouldn't be really
threatened<00:02:06.990> by<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> hammerhead<00:02:07.439> shark<00:02:07.829> this

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
threatened by a hammerhead shark this

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.540 
threatened by a hammerhead shark this
size<00:02:08.330> but<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.840> normally<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.920> know<00:02:11.069> hammerhead

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
size but I normally you know hammerhead

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.430 
size but I normally you know hammerhead
sharks<00:02:11.849> are<00:02:11.970> pretty<00:02:12.330> large<00:02:12.629> about<00:02:13.050> like<00:02:13.230> 10

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
sharks are pretty large about like 10

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.170 
sharks are pretty large about like 10
feet<00:02:13.650> long<00:02:13.709> or<00:02:14.099> something<00:02:14.459> like<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.610> it's

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
feet long or something like that it's

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.430 
feet long or something like that it's
also<00:02:15.300> really<00:02:15.599> weird<00:02:15.870> because<00:02:16.020> I've<00:02:16.319> been

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
also really weird because I've been

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.750 
also really weird because I've been
pretty

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
pretty

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.570 
pretty
sure<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.090> sea<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.720> fresh<00:02:18.709> water<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.220> why

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
sure the sea is fresh water and why

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.309 
sure the sea is fresh water and why
would<00:02:19.819> they<00:02:19.849> allow<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.720> become<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:20.989> shark

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
would they allow you to become a shark

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.990 
would they allow you to become a shark
in<00:02:21.470> here<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.799> don't<00:02:22.099> know<00:02:22.189> maybe<00:02:22.459> someone<00:02:22.849> just

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
in here I don't know maybe someone just

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.449 
in here I don't know maybe someone just
