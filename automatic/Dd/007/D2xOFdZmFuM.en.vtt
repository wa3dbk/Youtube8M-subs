 Today I will make Kharcho soup 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:15.630
 for this you need to be beef all 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.830

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.630
 garlic and chili pepper so here I am 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.439
 beautiful beef and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.199

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.199

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.140
 In general, I took this recipe from a book about 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.190
 tasty and healthy food 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.530

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.150
 as soon as the warbler rises 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.500
 need to skimmer remove about half to two 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:35.190

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.760
