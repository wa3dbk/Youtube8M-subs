00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.330 
it I'll be located at least a little bit
further<00:02:44.090> downstream<00:02:44.629> and<00:02:45.019> only<00:02:45.280> leaving<00:02:46.280> a

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
further downstream and only leaving a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.809 
further downstream and only leaving a
real<00:02:46.549> big<00:02:46.790> step<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.920> all<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.159> light<00:02:49.340> stuff<00:02:49.640> is

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
real big step so all the light stuff is

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:50.890 
real big step so all the light stuff is
going<00:02:50.090> over<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.359> top

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
going over the top

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.199 
going over the top
the<00:02:51.620> ham<00:02:51.890> peas<00:02:52.069> are<00:02:52.250> dropping<00:02:52.489> right<00:02:52.790> on<00:02:52.970> into

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
the ham peas are dropping right on into

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.759 
the ham peas are dropping right on into
the<00:02:53.299> catch<00:02:53.599> box<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.900> can<00:02:56.989> see<00:02:57.200> with<00:02:57.379> good<00:02:57.560> flow

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
the catch box you can see with good flow

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.339 
the catch box you can see with good flow
it<00:02:58.129> just<00:02:58.340> pushes<00:02:58.579> it<00:02:58.730> right<00:02:59.000> all<00:02:59.180> through<00:03:02.349> so

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
it just pushes it right all through so

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.920 
it just pushes it right all through so
now<00:03:03.790> all<00:03:04.790> we're<00:03:05.060> left<00:03:05.180> with<00:03:05.510> out<00:03:05.690> of<00:03:05.810> that
