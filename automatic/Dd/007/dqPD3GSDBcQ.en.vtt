00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.500
 Hello, my beloved ones, all registered well with 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.960
 You here the speaker is the magnifying glass and a video 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.740
 I want to make a video about the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.109
 my 10 mega for demonstrating noises yes 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.630
 A lot of people always ask how a Pokémon 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.930
 Favorite is my favorite mega 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.939
 any my favorite fire starter 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.769
 all kinds of stuff then today's video 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.359
 will be focused on the mega pokémon 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.000
 especially mister loupe 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.829
 Let's make this list since now with 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.690
 Pokémon black rubby your daughter who 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.520
 many of you have even finished 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.219
 and I did not even get it right 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.960
 have many deny mega new pokémons 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.070
 biblio mega xilinx mega break son and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.030
 many others 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.559
 logically ignored the two mega 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.280
 evolutions that are not really 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.770
 negotiations on these beaches refuges 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.190
 step down and the guga falls I'm going to ignore 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.920
 then there these two differentiation these 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.020
 there two strange revolutions right there because 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.900
 I'm not exactly maria is bolson 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.450
 so let's improve them as just for 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.200
 Pokémon that megan really bad and 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.180
 beauty to start this list then 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.130
 I put the mega sound in tenth place 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.009
 because I do not like him 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.380
 on the contrary I found it very 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.630
 super superb supercar of com 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.340
 thousand suites to walk very fast and 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.799
 break everybody paulo while he is 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.439
 good book is a pokémon that 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.340
 I like both by appearance and 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.189
 by the competitive potential in ninth place 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.100
 a Pokemon I always sympathized me 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.439
 grab 114 not by mega but by round 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.450
 a good old man always liked the 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.600
 pokémons that resemble enough animals of the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.100
 real life in this case a dog that 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.920
 chapter dog which is one of my 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.579
 my favorite megas like the appearance 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.799
 his 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.530
 although it is far from my favorites 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.020
 by competitive an eighth place a 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.140
 pokémon that is not so far as well 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.660
 a mega dog trick mania you already know is 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.209
 that this is one of my favorite megabytes and 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.210
 I said yes live several times but I 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.220
 I think my mega 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.820
 favorite for power in the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.010
 competitive super agile and super strong he 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.620
 is able to hit very fast by doing 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.960
 with which the opponent does not even know where he came from 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.300
 the beating in addition it escapes 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.780
 easily from the countryside with flights still 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.270
 giving a nice damage so yes it is one of the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.460
 my favorites for both single summer 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.790
 as for the MultiAir he's cool right 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.770
 because it has tooth team it is super useful in 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.690
 seventh place a pokémon that never was 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.960
 very good and now also not very good 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.240
 on the mega sofa is a mega galley di eu 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.700
 I put him in this position for 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.350
 I think pokémon looks great 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.690
 I always liked his looks now. 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.330
 who is the most gallant swordsman 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.190
 but there is not much more that 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.090
 Talk about him, maybe the next time. 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.070
 position has something more exciting and 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.190
 sixth place one of my pokémons 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.800
 favorites in the shine version of the mega metal 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.080
 thick silver with an x in the face and 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.780
 Surreal psychic powers 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.510
 is one of my favorite Pokémon 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.840
 all not so much for the competitive but 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.570
 appearance and appearance in the 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.190
 anime find very cool to see the Pokémon 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.770
 psychics by highlighting their opponents 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.750
 in the air only with the force of thought 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.630
 besides that, only he and I got a 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.640
 Half Samurai face, right? 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.970
 this xis resembles a helmet 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.910
 Samurai, I'm not crazy, you must remember 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.140
 is one of my favorite pokémons the ala 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.420
 Kazan 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.240
 I really like the apparitions of the Pokémon 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.690
 psychics in the anime and of course I also 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.310
 like this kind of games pokemon 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.320
 Honey the house is not very good in 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.280
 competitive because the ability to see 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.610
 It's very difficult to use it well then 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.350
 appearance by food appearances in the 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.600
 fourth position plus a pokémon 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.970
 from the first generation there that I 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.040
 I really like it and I remember until today when 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.530
 I learned that the bus has a 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.460
 evolution in the Kanto region to evolve 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.310
 in the region of jotuomba now with a mega 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.930
 volution in goal in all this is completed 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.270
 is a pokémon that I always liked a lot 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.980
 but I never used it because I did not see much 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.140
 it usefulness in 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.750
 who knows now with this ability that 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.090
 favors it when there is a storm of 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.670
 sand in the field we'll see right? 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.290
 in third place plus a pokémon that I 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.200
 I loved it when I was a child. 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.230
 the game gear now has a mega evolution 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.540
 is from x and y, which made it much more 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.300
 so much cooler and much more 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.610
 wacky even more the shine version of it 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.860
 white I was still much happier 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.050
 when I found out that my people were very 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.180
 powerful in the competitive 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.640
 Of course I was annoyed when he 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.130
 was banned but these things happen 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.420
 I suffered a lot to choose this second 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.210
 place but it's there it's mega charizard x 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.010
 I always really liked charizard always was 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.710
 one of my favorite pokémons 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:18.280
 including the shine version of 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.130
 It was always my favorite shine pokémon 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.380
 now with neg charizard x being black 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.080
 by nature still with this blue fire 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.300
 Wonderful came out of your mouth I passed the 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.820
 Enjoy the mega charizard x 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.100
 including pokémons had a lot in my 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.230
 competitive teams because yes 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.470
 he can do a beautiful job with 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.300
 its powerful claws and a beautiful dragon 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.510
 Dance, that's it. 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.150
 mega second charizard comes x 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:50.260
 closing the first place for the 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:52.930
 giant green minho the mega king quasa 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.850
 so many people thought that a mega 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.270
 it does not fit into an evolution 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:02.140
 but it was soon confirmed that yes he mega 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:05.710
 would evolve to be the best of all he 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.900
 still the key to mega evolution being the 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.940
 single pokémon that does not need a 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.940
 Mega stone to evolve 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.060
 yes the king can almost do it alone 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.880
 with your will power of so powerful 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.340
 that he is and if they covered giant green 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:25.300
 This Chinese Dragon Your Version Denies 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:28.150
 evolved is very powerful and there is my 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.530
 first place maybe many of 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.900
 you do not like it 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.760
 we have better ones and that is 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.490
 absolutely normal after all 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.880
 This video is opinionated so do not forget 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.430
 to leave 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.430
 so your opinion without the potty is yours 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.980
 opinion is very important always beauty 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.750

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.300

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.040
 Forget to give a jewel even though 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.160
 I liked the button because it always helps 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:59.800
 hell the channel beauty then okay 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.800
