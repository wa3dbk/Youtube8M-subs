00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.670

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.070
 American Russian and that's what assessment 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.620
 This product was given by Robert Gates 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.870
 one of the pillars of American politics 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.450
 the former head of the pentagon believes that all 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.520
 these 30 years this policy as he put it 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.390
 suffered from unsuccessful management 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.940
 arrogance of Americans who 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.130
 instructed the Russians how to lead their 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.530
 affairs led deep rejection and 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.530

 cia and pentagon worked with four 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.970
 presidents hurried the inclusion of former 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.460
 Soviet satellites in the Baltic countries

 romania and bulgaria in nato he considers 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.830
 by mistake 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.140
 attempt to invite to nato georgia 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.390
 Ukraine was exaggerating the roots 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.970
 Russian Empire go from Kiev so 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.740
 it was a huge provocation ready 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.780
 whether there were europeans not to mention 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.840
 Americans send their sons and 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.360
 daughters to defend Georgia or Ukraine are unlikely 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.040
 was it so the extension of nato was not 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.320
 elaborate military 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.900
 commitments a political act 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.970
 who undermined the goals of the alliance and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.310
 irresponsibly ignored what 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.250
 Russians considered their vital 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.550
 national interests writes recent 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.740
 the head of the pentagon that notice us gates 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.210
 certainly the enemy is more precisely politically correct 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.830
 potential opponent 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.229
 he just thinks it was necessary 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.060
 slower teacher not and that america 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.790
 must adequately pursue your interest 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.190
 rather than entertain inadequate ambitions 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.229
 so he formulates his full 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.570
 support for obama in regards to 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.940
 restraint realism and readiness 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.200
 agree on what is no different 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.780
 adequacy McCain 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.030
 Republican senator and 1 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.350
 actor gates could have reacted 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.600
 shut up at least until the next election 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.480

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.270

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.050
 also a man he has his weaknesses he 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:33.140
 live wants to forgive the devil a traitor like 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.720
 foot article if the trigger is cocked you need to be 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.520
 ready to shoot I was against the military 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.470
 Intervention describes as an attempt 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.110
 extinguish the fire with petrol 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.900
 Syria canisters too close for Russia 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.260
 and Iran our military intervention could 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.019
 cause their intervention america is tired 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.690
 America does not pull into conflict 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.430
 to the whole world russia america is not a threat with 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.980
 Russia must agree and not 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.290
 provoke her to question bbc much 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.880
 to america lost ability 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.390
 project power to the whole world like 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.060
 earlier gates answered was the price 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.880
 interesting addition as before it is 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.680
 did all the time 50 to other nations 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.350
 getting stronger were recovering 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.600
 after the war with the rise of China and 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.910
 decreasing our share of global GDP in 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.190
 last 50 years while others 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.829
 countries were getting richer than ours 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.810
 one-sided influence between say 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:31.370
 the end of the second world and vietnam 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.709
 obviously for the future it is worth a lot 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.730
 gates america is now weaker in the world than 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.370
 after vietnam 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.260
 that is, when I still live in the USSR 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.510
 no more agreement with Russia 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.400
 alternatives and the current administration then 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.739
 seems to understand only Ukraine for 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.170
 Sorry about an order of magnitude closer and 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.190
 more important than syria and who keeps on 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.799
 short leash 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.170
 Ukrainian opposition know everything so much
