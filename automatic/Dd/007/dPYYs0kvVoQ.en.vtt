00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
and came back to see using kind of the

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.530 
and came back to see using kind of the
folks<00:02:04.140> from<00:02:04.460> it's<00:02:05.460> gonna<00:02:05.610> sound<00:02:05.820> fine<00:02:06.150> so<00:02:06.420> that

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
folks from it's gonna sound fine so that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.330 
folks from it's gonna sound fine so that
was<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.660> measure<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.050> C<00:02:07.350> followed<00:02:07.860> by<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.130> measure

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
was a measure of C followed by a measure

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.760 
was a measure of C followed by a measure
of<00:02:08.460> D<00:02:08.729> followed<00:02:09.539> by<00:02:09.660> two<00:02:09.720> more<00:02:10.110> measures<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.590> C

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
of D followed by two more measures of C

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.700 
of D followed by two more measures of C
so<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.160> block<00:02:11.460> of<00:02:11.820> four<00:02:12.240> measures<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:13.230> really

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
so this block of four measures is really

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.400 
so this block of four measures is really
the<00:02:13.830> main<00:02:14.100> backing<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.120> first<00:02:15.510> big<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
the main backing to the first big the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.530 
the main backing to the first big the
first<00:02:16.620> phrase<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.220> first<00:02:17.430> section<00:02:17.880> before

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
first phrase of the first section before

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.490 
first phrase of the first section before
it<00:02:18.600> gives<00:02:18.720> them<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.840> goes<00:02:19.140> into<00:02:19.320> other

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
it gives them that goes into other

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.710 
it gives them that goes into other
sections<00:02:19.770> using<00:02:20.250> all<00:02:20.520> chords<00:02:20.970> now<00:02:21.030> C<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.480> D

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720

the the lessons that we do at totally
guitars<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.690> always<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.020> get<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.410> little

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
guitars I always like to get a little

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.710 
guitars I always like to get a little
bit<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.920> theory<00:03:05.130> involved<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.730> there<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.060> start

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
bit of theory involved in there to start

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.130 
bit of theory involved in there to start
getting<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.049> little<00:03:07.290> more<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.220> path<00:03:08.489> of

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
getting you a little more on the path of

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.750 
getting you a little more on the path of
learning<00:03:10.140> them<00:03:10.470> yourself<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.220> not<00:03:11.519> just

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
learning them yourself and not just

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.400 
learning them yourself and not just
relying<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:12.269> tablature<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.019> can<00:03:13.140> find

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.199 

now<00:03:41.900> that<00:03:42.110> d-chord<00:03:42.560> I<00:03:42.709> went<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:43.010> there<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.670> got

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
now that d-chord I went to there I got

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.490 
now that d-chord I went to there I got
to<00:03:44.390> just<00:03:44.599> by<00:03:44.750> sliding<00:03:45.170> my<00:03:45.560> C<00:03:45.860> chord<00:03:46.220> or<00:03:46.400> C<00:03:46.640> shape

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
to just by sliding my C chord or C shape

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.800 
to just by sliding my C chord or C shape
up<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.680> whole-step<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.489> then<00:03:50.120> being<00:03:50.390> kind<00:03:50.750> of

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
up a whole-step and then being kind of

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.420 
up a whole-step and then being kind of
careful<00:03:51.349> this<00:03:51.500> would<00:03:51.650> make<00:03:51.800> a<00:03:51.830> D<00:03:52.069> I've<00:03:52.280> gone

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
careful this would make a D I've gone

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.059 
careful this would make a D I've gone
from<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.730> first<00:03:52.940> second<00:03:53.390> third<00:03:53.540> frets<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.860> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
third fourth and fifth but then using

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.820 
third fourth and fifth but then using
what<00:03:58.760> I<00:03:58.790> call<00:03:58.849> focus<00:03:59.480> strumming<00:04:00.080> where<00:04:00.349> I'm
