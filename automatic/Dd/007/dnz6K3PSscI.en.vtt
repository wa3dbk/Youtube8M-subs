build a new wall that will be glass

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.190 
build a new wall that will be glass
because<00:00:24.890> it<00:00:25.040> comes<00:00:25.250> already<00:00:26.020> structured<00:00:27.020> that

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
because it comes already structured that

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
companies in the sunroom industry that

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.310 
companies in the sunroom industry that
don't<00:01:00.110> use<00:01:00.700> aluminum<00:01:01.700> okay<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.660> don't<00:01:03.080> have

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
don't use aluminum okay and don't have

sex sizes

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.810 
sex sizes
okay<00:01:04.970> what's<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:05.689> problems<00:01:06.110> with<00:01:06.290> aluminum

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
okay what's the problems with aluminum

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.109 
okay what's the problems with aluminum
aluminum<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:08.180> old<00:01:08.990> technology<00:01:09.759> it's<00:01:10.759> a<00:01:10.880> good

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
aluminum is old technology it's a good

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.910 
aluminum is old technology it's a good
in<00:01:11.270> taste<00:01:11.509> a<00:01:11.659> good<00:01:11.869> conductor<00:01:12.530> of<00:01:12.560> heat<00:01:12.740> and

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
in taste a good conductor of heat and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.480 
in taste a good conductor of heat and
cold

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
cold

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.179 
cold
so<00:01:13.729> typically<00:01:14.180> people's<00:01:14.920> fear<00:01:15.920> with<00:01:16.159> a

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
so typically people's fear with a

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:17.859 
so typically people's fear with a
sunroom<00:01:16.729> is<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:17.090> it's<00:01:17.179> too<00:01:17.390> hot<00:01:17.570> in<00:01:17.749> the

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
sunroom is that it's too hot in the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.380 
sunroom is that it's too hot in the
summer<00:01:17.899> and<00:01:18.409> too<00:01:19.159> cold<00:01:19.429> in<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.700> winter<00:01:20.149> yeah

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
summer and too cold in the winter yeah

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.300 
summer and too cold in the winter yeah
and<00:01:20.899> basically<00:01:21.229> that's<00:01:21.409> one<00:01:21.619> aluminum<00:01:22.100> does

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
and basically that's one aluminum does

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.489 
and basically that's one aluminum does
it's<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:22.820> conductor<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.420> hatred<00:01:23.659> dr.<00:01:24.259> Cole

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
it's a conductor of hatred dr. Cole

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.889 
it's a conductor of hatred dr. Cole
mm-hmm<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:25.520> can't<00:01:25.850> hate<00:01:26.119> it<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.810> you

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
mm-hmm so you can't hate it and you

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.179 
mm-hmm so you can't hate it and you
can't<00:01:27.140> keep<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.409> cold<00:01:27.619> in<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.829> summer

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
can't keep the cold in the summer

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.190 
can't keep the cold in the summer
so<00:01:28.579> modern<00:01:28.969> technologies<00:01:29.749> that<00:01:29.899> you<00:01:30.020> use<00:01:30.170> a

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
so modern technologies that you use a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.739 
so modern technologies that you use a
composite<00:01:30.649> product<00:01:31.280> it<00:01:32.210> defeats<00:01:32.600> that

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
composite product it defeats that

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.529 
composite product it defeats that
problem<00:01:33.259> yeah<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:34.039> what's<00:01:34.460> wrong<00:01:34.640> with<00:01:34.850> it

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
problem yeah and what's wrong with it

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.899 
problem yeah and what's wrong with it
we're<00:01:35.780> throwing<00:01:36.049> a<00:01:36.380> you<00:01:37.159> know<00:01:37.280> kind<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.609> cookie

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
we're throwing a you know kind of cookie

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.569 
we're throwing a you know kind of cookie
cutter<00:01:38.119> syndrome<00:01:38.630> on<00:01:38.749> the<00:01:38.840> back<00:01:38.990> of<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.200> house

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
cutter syndrome on the back of a house

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.669 
cutter syndrome on the back of a house
nothing<00:01:40.579> wrong<00:01:40.789> but<00:01:41.420> it's<00:01:41.569> set<00:01:41.810> sizes<00:01:42.139> and<00:01:42.619> if

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
nothing wrong but it's set sizes and if

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.669 
nothing wrong but it's set sizes and if
you<00:01:42.710> go<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.009> a<00:01:43.189> house<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:44.439> really<00:01:45.439> you<00:01:45.499> should

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
you go to a house that really you should

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.550 
you go to a house that really you should
have<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.859> 15<00:01:46.310> from<00:01:46.549> 6<00:01:46.850> inch<00:01:47.119> width<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:47.869> if<00:01:48.409> you

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.940 
have a 15 from 6 inch width and if you
jump<00:01:48.829> to<00:01:48.950> 14<00:01:49.429> feet<00:01:49.749> what<00:01:50.749> do<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:50.899> do<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:51.770> then

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
jump to 14 feet what do you do so then

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.319 
jump to 14 feet what do you do so then
you<00:01:52.039> have<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.249> put<00:01:52.369> filler<00:01:52.639> panels<00:01:53.119> in<00:01:53.299> which

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
you have to put filler panels in which

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.639 
you have to put filler panels in which
take<00:01:53.749> away<00:01:53.869> from<00:01:54.289> me<00:01:54.609> the<00:01:55.609> elegance<00:01:55.999> of<00:01:56.209> it

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
take away from me the elegance of it
