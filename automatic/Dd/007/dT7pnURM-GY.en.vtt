old<00:00:29.760> henna<00:00:30.060> tip<00:00:30.359> video<00:00:30.660> when<00:00:30.929> my<00:00:31.050> hair<00:00:31.199> was

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
old henna tip video when my hair was

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.130 
old henna tip video when my hair was
long<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:32.460> was<00:00:32.610> dark<00:00:32.850> brown<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.020> an

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
long and it was dark brown so this is an

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.410 
long and it was dark brown so this is an
extension<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.219> video<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.969> more<00:00:36.120> tips

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
extension of that video just more tips

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.780 
extension of that video just more tips
to<00:00:36.750> make<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.350> henna<00:00:37.559> process<00:00:38.070> easier<00:00:38.579> I

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
to make the henna process easier I

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.340 
to make the henna process easier I
definitely<00:00:39.270> recommend<00:00:39.510> watching<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.110> video

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
definitely recommend watching that video

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.950 
definitely recommend watching that video
first<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.940> has<00:00:42.090> different<00:00:42.329> tips<00:00:42.750> than

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
first because it has different tips than

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.600 
first because it has different tips than
this<00:00:43.079> video<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.280> some<00:00:44.489> more

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
very you can get chunky and it pulls on

recommend<00:01:45.329> using<00:01:46.850> plastic<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:48.240> it's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
recommend using plastic because it's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.499 
recommend using plastic because it's
really<00:01:48.869> easy<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.170> rinse<00:01:50.070> away<00:01:50.399> I've<00:01:51.000> noticed

gets all over my neck area so I have

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.710 
gets all over my neck area so I have

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
because it does stain especially with

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.270 
because it does stain especially with
red<00:03:57.850> Hannah's<00:03:58.300> it<00:03:58.750> will<00:03:58.930> stain<00:03:59.260> very<00:03:59.530> quickly

red Hannah's it will stain very quickly

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.850 
red Hannah's it will stain very quickly
I<00:04:00.640> recommend<00:04:01.300> putting<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.720> trash<00:04:02.140> bag<00:04:02.440> across

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
I recommend putting a trash bag across

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.630 
I recommend putting a trash bag across
your<00:04:03.280> sink<00:04:03.730> because<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.330> will<00:04:04.480> stain<00:04:05.640> it's

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
your sink because it will stain it's

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.690 
your sink because it will stain it's
likely<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.090> stay<00:04:07.300> in<00:04:07.360> your<00:04:07.480> sink<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.110> I<00:04:08.200> do

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
likely to stay in your sink and I do

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.460 
likely to stay in your sink and I do
recommend<00:04:09.700> if<00:04:10.270> you're<00:04:10.780> just<00:04:11.020> starting<00:04:11.230> out

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
recommend if you're just starting out

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.260 
recommend if you're just starting out
with<00:04:11.620> henna<00:04:11.830> to<00:04:12.070> put<00:04:12.310> some<00:04:12.490> newspaper<00:04:12.760> on<00:04:13.240> the

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
with henna to put some newspaper on the

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.990 
with henna to put some newspaper on the
floor<00:04:13.420> so<00:04:14.350> you<00:04:14.410> don't<00:04:14.680> have<00:04:14.890> globs<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.730> henna

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
floor so you don't have globs of henna

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.570 
floor so you don't have globs of henna
flying<00:04:16.630> out<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:16.959> floor<00:04:17.200> it's<00:04:17.709> easier<00:04:18.310> if

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
flying out to the floor it's easier if

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.979 
flying out to the floor it's easier if
you<00:04:18.790> use<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.210> brush<00:04:19.419> because<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:19.750> can

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
you use the brush because you can

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.719 
you use the brush because you can
minimize<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.380> globs<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:21.190> are<00:04:21.310> just<00:04:21.520> flying

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
minimize the globs that are just flying

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.020 
minimize the globs that are just flying
everywhere<00:04:22.120> but

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
everywhere but

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.080 
everywhere but
if<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:23.240> use<00:04:23.510> just<00:04:23.810> gloves<00:04:24.760> some<00:04:25.760> head<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:25.970> will

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
if you use just gloves some head I will

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.690 
if you use just gloves some head I will
probably<00:04:26.660> fall<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:27.980> it's<00:04:28.220> nice<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.670> just

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
probably fall and so it's nice to just

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.120 
probably fall and so it's nice to just
have<00:04:29.030> newspaper<00:04:29.990> down<00:04:30.200> on<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.470> floor<00:04:30.680> the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
have newspaper down on the floor the

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.920 
have newspaper down on the floor the
next<00:04:31.370> thing<00:04:31.490> is<00:04:31.639> probably<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:32.240> number<00:04:32.510> one

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
next thing is probably the number one

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.590 
next thing is probably the number one

doing the mermaid rinse it kind of

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.990 
doing the mermaid rinse it kind of
swishing<00:05:15.590> your<00:05:15.740> hair<00:05:15.950> around<00:05:16.190> loosens

swishing your hair around loosens
everything<00:05:17.150> up<00:05:17.600> I<00:05:17.870> do<00:05:18.200> that<00:05:18.560> for<00:05:18.830> probably

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
everything up I do that for probably

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.560 
everything up I do that for probably
about<00:05:19.220> five<00:05:19.580> minutes<00:05:20.030> just<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.390> loosen

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
about five minutes just to loosen

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.290 
about five minutes just to loosen
everything<00:05:20.960> up<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.530> get<00:05:22.460> all<00:05:22.700> the<00:05:22.910> actual

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
everything up and get all the actual

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.719 
everything up and get all the actual
clumps<00:05:23.840> of<00:05:24.020> henna<00:05:24.229> out<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.950> the<00:05:25.040> hair<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.520> that

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
clumps of henna out of the hair and that

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.450 
clumps of henna out of the hair and that
helps<00:05:26.030> so<00:05:26.240> so<00:05:27.200> much<00:05:27.410> I<00:05:27.620> cannot<00:05:27.890> recommend<00:05:28.220> that

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
helps so so much I cannot recommend that

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.250 
helps so so much I cannot recommend that
enough<00:05:28.729> I<00:05:28.910> don't<00:05:29.000> remember<00:05:29.479> who<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:29.750> heard<00:05:30.080> that

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
enough I don't remember who I heard that

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.760 
enough I don't remember who I heard that
from<00:05:30.500> but<00:05:31.310> if<00:05:31.520> you're<00:05:31.669> gonna<00:05:31.850> do<00:05:32.120> henna

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
from but if you're gonna do henna

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.020 
from but if you're gonna do henna
seriously<00:05:33.770> that<00:05:34.130> is<00:05:34.280> one<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:34.700> biggest

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
seriously that is one of the biggest

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.460 
seriously that is one of the biggest
things<00:05:35.240> or<00:05:35.419> if<00:05:35.540> you<00:05:35.630> have<00:05:35.750> a<00:05:35.780> bucket<00:05:36.290> you<00:05:36.410> can

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
things or if you have a bucket you can

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.680 
things or if you have a bucket you can
try<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:37.400> do<00:05:37.550> that<00:05:37.700> but<00:05:37.940> just<00:05:38.000> filling<00:05:38.450> up<00:05:38.570> the

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
try to do that but just filling up the

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.040 
try to do that but just filling up the
bathtub<00:05:38.870> with<00:05:39.830> water<00:05:40.390> it<00:05:41.390> will<00:05:41.720> probably

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
bathtub with water it will probably

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.620 
bathtub with water it will probably
leave<00:05:42.560> a<00:05:42.590> ring<00:05:43.010> of<00:05:43.340> color<00:05:43.669> around<00:05:44.240> so<00:05:44.600> just

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
leave a ring of color around so just

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.710 
leave a ring of color around so just
when<00:05:45.200> you<00:05:45.289> jump<00:05:45.560> in<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.740> shower<00:05:45.950> to<00:05:46.310> wash<00:05:46.720> the

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
rest of the henna out just make sure

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.230 
rest of the henna out just make sure
that<00:05:49.220> you<00:05:49.310> get<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.550> ring<00:05:49.729> off<00:05:49.940> of<00:05:49.970> your

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
very gritty and kind of stiff in the

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.950 
very gritty and kind of stiff in the
shower<00:06:06.320> so<00:06:06.710> I<00:06:06.919> recommend<00:06:07.460> using<00:06:08.270> a<00:06:08.510> shampoo<00:06:08.930> I

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
shower so I recommend using a shampoo I

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.080 
shower so I recommend using a shampoo I
haven't<00:06:09.440> found<00:06:09.740> that<00:06:09.950> this<00:06:10.190> messes<00:06:10.789> up<00:06:10.940> the

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
haven't found that this messes up the

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.969 
haven't found that this messes up the
color<00:06:11.360> at<00:06:11.539> all<00:06:11.660> with<00:06:11.900> the<00:06:12.020> Burgundy<00:06:12.500> but<00:06:12.950> I

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
color at all with the Burgundy but I

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:14.590 
color at all with the Burgundy but I
recommend<00:06:13.460> using<00:06:13.700> a<00:06:13.940> shampoo<00:06:14.180> that<00:06:14.390> has

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
recommend using a shampoo that has

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.750 
recommend using a shampoo that has
panthenol<00:06:15.410> in<00:06:15.620> it<00:06:15.770> and<00:06:15.950> that's<00:06:16.400> not<00:06:16.580> something

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
panthenol in it and that's not something

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.360 
panthenol in it and that's not something
I<00:06:17.000> like<00:06:17.180> to<00:06:17.330> use<00:06:17.630> in<00:06:17.990> my<00:06:18.020> shampoo<00:06:18.650> everyday

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
I like to use in my shampoo everyday

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.090 
I like to use in my shampoo everyday
because<00:06:20.150> it<00:06:20.419> does<00:06:20.630> coat<00:06:21.110> the<00:06:21.320> hair<00:06:21.470> so<00:06:21.830> I<00:06:21.860> like

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
because it does coat the hair so I like

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.430 
because it does coat the hair so I like
to<00:06:22.130> use<00:06:22.340> my<00:06:22.550> shampoo<00:06:22.700> bars<00:06:23.180> with<00:06:23.810> my<00:06:24.020> vinegar

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
to use my shampoo bars with my vinegar

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.510 
to use my shampoo bars with my vinegar
but<00:06:24.979> the<00:06:25.130> panthenol<00:06:25.729> really<00:06:26.180> does<00:06:26.510> help<00:06:26.840> to

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
but the panthenol really does help to

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.580 
but the panthenol really does help to
loosen<00:06:28.520> up<00:06:28.880> and<00:06:29.120> soften<00:06:29.690> your<00:06:29.720> hair<00:06:30.050> to<00:06:30.350> get

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
loosen up and soften your hair to get

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.890 
loosen up and soften your hair to get
that<00:06:30.830> kind<00:06:31.039> of<00:06:31.099> nasty<00:06:31.640> henna<00:06:32.150> feeling<00:06:32.570> out<00:06:32.690> and

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
that kind of nasty henna feeling out and

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.380 
that kind of nasty henna feeling out and
panthenol<00:06:33.680> is<00:06:33.770> in<00:06:33.890> a<00:06:33.979> lot<00:06:34.130> of<00:06:34.280> conditioners<00:06:34.940> so

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:35.390 
panthenol is in a lot of conditioners so

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.250 
panthenol is in a lot of conditioners so
I<00:06:35.419> will<00:06:35.780> you

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
I will you

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.470 
I will you
use<00:06:36.350> this<00:06:36.590> shampoo<00:06:36.890> and<00:06:37.280> then<00:06:37.370> sometimes<00:06:37.940> I'll

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:38.480 
use this shampoo and then sometimes I'll

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.570 
use this shampoo and then sometimes I'll
use<00:06:38.810> a<00:06:38.840> conditioner<00:06:39.380> with<00:06:39.530> panthenol<00:06:40.070> just<00:06:40.400> to

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
use a conditioner with panthenol just to

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.850 
use a conditioner with panthenol just to
get<00:06:40.820> my<00:06:41.360> hair<00:06:41.540> feeling<00:06:41.810> a<00:06:41.990> little<00:06:42.110> bit<00:06:42.320> softer

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
get my hair feeling a little bit softer

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.530 
get my hair feeling a little bit softer
because<00:06:43.040> it<00:06:43.250> does<00:06:43.430> feel<00:06:43.790> a<00:06:43.880> little<00:06:43.970> bit<00:06:44.180> gritty

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
because it does feel a little bit gritty

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.330 
because it does feel a little bit gritty
but<00:06:44.990> this<00:06:45.110> one's<00:06:45.320> just<00:06:45.380> Aaron's<00:06:45.980> everyday

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.250 
types tea tree and so I do this once
once<00:06:52.940> a<00:06:53.120> month<00:06:53.240> I<00:06:53.420> guess<00:06:53.600> you<00:06:53.720> can<00:06:53.870> consider

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260 
once a month I guess you can consider

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.800 
once a month I guess you can consider
this<00:06:54.740> my<00:06:54.980> once<00:06:55.310> a<00:06:55.430> month<00:06:55.580> cleansing<00:06:56.300> shampoo

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
this my once a month cleansing shampoo

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.720 
this my once a month cleansing shampoo
because<00:06:57.050> every<00:06:57.560> other<00:06:57.680> time<00:06:58.130> I<00:06:58.220> wash<00:06:58.400> my<00:06:58.580> hair

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:58.730 
because every other time I wash my hair

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.790 
because every other time I wash my hair
I<00:06:58.790> use<00:06:59.180> my<00:06:59.420> shampoo<00:06:59.630> bar<00:07:00.080> so<00:07:00.440> I<00:07:00.470> guess<00:07:00.650> that's

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
I use my shampoo bar so I guess that's

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.800 
I use my shampoo bar so I guess that's
