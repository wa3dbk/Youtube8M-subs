00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
 i 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.060
 one 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.060
 i 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.870
 in cute little ones I am me already 10 and 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.550
 super super super happy this is the 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.110
 fourth day that we are together I hope that 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.820
 are enjoying the truth is that I 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.590
 I'm going super super well recording 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.689
 in today as the title says 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.240
 because we had already exaggerated that 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.130
 desserts and all and that the warm things 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.869
 sweet then I think the good option 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.610
 already put something salty and I think that 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.070
 It's perfect for when you have a 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.930
 reunioncita mariÃ±a and that you want to take 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.640
 something but not if it is a dessert desserts 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.650
 here is something more salty if you 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.050
 like a light or it is perfect 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.940
 socially delicious delicious 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.399
 here I could not stop joking 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.620
 that is very rich but really very very 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.630
 rich is something super easy to do that does not 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.700
 you're going to have to bake and that 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.890
 you burn is that sowing is like that and 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.050
 delicious is something salty we are 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.879
 salty but rich you know let's see 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.420
 what is it that I'm charlie 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.969
 chaplin this is super super easy to 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.809
 do and it's delicious you need melon 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.360
 Ham 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.700
 and thick panic sticks decorate them with 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.290
 adhesive tape with decoration and nothing else 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.520
 like I cut the little corners for 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.520
 form like a little flag 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.340
 there are melons in squares you can put 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.830
 in a nice little dish you know so that 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.720
 be more health and you already put that the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.940
 ham serrano and you put him finally 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.650
 the little flag is I think that the 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.450
 little flag gives the touch you know it is 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.280
 super easy to do and as it does more 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.280
 cool all this food 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.330
 and really that's what you have to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.700
 do with all the combination of flavors 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.650
 It is delicious and the pit and ready the truth 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.450
 is that taste is like super cool 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.370
 saladito with sweet and it's a way 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.710
 love how to combine the flavors but 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.890
 that's delicious delicious and super 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.229
 easy and very fast to do I used 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.030
 ones for long lots for skewers and 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.979
 I put the flag on top, I think 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.650
 that looks super nice I put a little bit of 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.200
 tomato basil and kerry I think 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.209
 mozzarella and olive oil really 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.800
 you can put whatever you want 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.380
 but this combination of flavors is 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.390
 super cool it feels light and I think that 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.040
 they go very well together and already really what 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.260
 what I started doing is that I put all 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.390
 like cherry tomato the cheese and all 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.730
 those things together the flavors really 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.870
 they go very well together and finally 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.870
 I put olive oil 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.220
 if you want to do in large quantity I 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.870
 I think it's perfect perfect because 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.390
 it's super easy you do not have to 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.530
 cooking nothing and tastes very very good and that 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.210
 is everything that has definitely is my 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.080
 favorite they need crackers 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.880
 current cream cheese and chipotle to taste 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.770
 for those who should not Mexico do not know 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.690
 that the chipotle good if you do not know is a 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.310
 Spicy thing so if you do not have in your 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.950
 country do not worry you can do it without 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.110
 he we are going to mix everything we are going to put 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.510
 all the blender and we will liquefy it 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.580
 'julito' as well as crushing because 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.290
 as it is in this blender pain is not 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.720
 as the most professional in the world 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.640
 so I went around the corners like 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.070
 squished you know until it was 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.650
 as a nice consistency I put it in 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.300
 a container ready practically that's 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.040
 everything you have to do and know very 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.080
 really rich I think that this is my 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.030
 favorite if you have a meeting with your 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.350
 friends with your family you can do this 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.060
 it's super easy to make you wear it 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.160
 with a container and you give it to your 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.990
 myths that have enchanted is very very 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.550
 very rich and me so you do not look very 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.920
 simple and apart as I love the 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.590
 olives I put some green olives 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:44.540
 apart as well as that very rich contrast 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:51.110
 equal with them practically that is 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:52.880
 the whole process all for today 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.770
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.140
 put into practice definitively the 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.510
 cat does not have a name or you are dying 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.540
 delicious delicious delicious delicious 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.489
 it's fine I thought it was serious and I did not 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.950
 believe that I forget in the video of 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.480
 yesterday we did with a little bit where 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.519
 what you had to do was 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.680
 write to a person and tell her 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.390

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.390

 thing here that I have to do to me 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.860
 It gets very nervous when someone says 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.410

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.700
