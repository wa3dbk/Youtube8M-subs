 crocker here we are in a new video 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.029
 of news in which we will talk about two 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.040
 important issues first 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.380
 we will review the skills record of 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.450
 rise and finally we will see the new 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.060
 pack of colored re skins that have 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.860
 been added to the test server and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.840
 having said that we started with the 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.210
 first news these days has been 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.579
 implemented in the pp the record of 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.530
 Rising skills for more than a 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.120
 year had been announced by part of 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.460
 the managers in the remember the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.649
 champions but as we already know this 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.050
 process is very slow over time 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.000
 here we have the result but before 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.890
 I do not want to tell you that this rewalk alone 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.960
 it's visual skills the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.820
 champion remains the same obviously the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.219
 visual and sound effects of the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.800
 skills if they have been updated 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.620
 we started by analyzing the passive mastery 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.870
 arcana has been completely redesigned and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.570
 now with each cast spell we get 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.670
 an accumulation of arcane mastery at 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.860
 reach five charges gives us two 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.630
 improvements the first one gives us a shield 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.460
 for three seconds that blocks a 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.730
 percent based on your mana 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.890
 maximum 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.560
 when casting spells we reduce the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.210
 cooling others so 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.520
 significant last and within the 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.530
 RAISE passive skills earn 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.590
 strength based on your maximum mana 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.130
 let's see now your skill that you download 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.870
 electric 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.940
 this skill has also been 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.610
 redesigned and now it happens to be a 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.220
 skillsoft we shoot an orb that inflicts 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.310
 magical damage and scale with ap and mana 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.100
 maximum let's continue with ups double prison 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.100
 Runic and mobilize the target during 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.290
 a maximum of 15 seconds inflicting 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.070
 magical damage that scales with the ape and its 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.070
 maximum mana 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.250
 now let's see your skill and storm 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.350
 electric we launch an orb that inflicts 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.110
 magical damage and scale with the ape and the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.909
 maximum mana to the enemy target and reduces 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.489
 some percent your resistance 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.009
 magic for five seconds the effect 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.140
 can accumulate up to three times after 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.360
 hit thunderstorm bounces towards 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.430
 all nearby enemies and towards rise 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.709
 before returning to the original objective 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.690
 after the first attack against this 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.970
 the following cause magical damage 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.810
 also climbing with ace and maximum mana 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.810
 but to a lesser extent 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.860
 and finally we review ultimate 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.769
 strength of weakness has a 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.140
 passive and an active passive we gain a 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.239
 10% cooling reduction that 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.930
 scale with level up to a maximum of one 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.000
 30% the active one we get 80 speed 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.159
 movement and a percentage of 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.900
 Spell sucking for 4 seconds 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.989
 at this time our spells 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.700
 inflict 50% additional damage to 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.500
 located near our enemies 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.350
 objectives 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.570
 and this would be the ridge rise as 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.120
 you know inside the pp can change 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.830
 many things throughout the days as well 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.080
 that I will be aware and with any 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.850

 your opinion about this update 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.959
 of skills obviously to take 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.340
 better conclusions we have to wait 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.740
 to make it available on the server 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.560
 main and can thus prove it more to 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.050
 background and with that said let's move on to the last 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.120
 news as you know during this 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.100
 cycle have added the new pack of 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.590

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.470
 lucian and the leasing skin for a total 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.100
 of 590 riot points we will get three re 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.100
 colored 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.550
 in this latest update they have added 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.160
 three new packs but still not 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.900
 are available as you see we have 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.000
 Three new colors for the appearance 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.100

 party although they have not yet been 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.040
 added the textures within the game 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.620
 thanks to these images we can already 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.270
 get an idea of ​​how they will be 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.730
 sure that little by little they will go 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.440
 adding more champions and skins and I hope 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.630
 Do not delay in implementing it as 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.880
 reward in mastery of champions or 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.250
 by points of influence that yes by 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.170
