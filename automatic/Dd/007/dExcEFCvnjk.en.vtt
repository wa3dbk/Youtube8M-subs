00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.409
 I spend and I am going to ask a few questions ismael ice dropped 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.410
 it is the question 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.410
 why a ran counter a bit 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:12.289
 Yes why 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.560
 but just because I no longer saw PSV and Pastor nothing else 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.560
 so well away 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.169
 nice memories counts two not snap 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.309
 no but away from home away from my suspicion 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.769
 and the training field some of the voices no I don't like it 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.920
 many unfortunate that you no longer play chips 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.269
 yes that's for sure 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.820
 take that with every soccer player 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.250
 nice to be ajax champion again this year to see south sudan 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.750
 play 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.750
 now I am going to piss at psv 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.030
 the derived mac anp 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.490
 he cannot enforce it 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.440
 but precisely in that line 11 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.440
 of course we can do that too 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.720
 after the homes michael 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.050
 live in Amsterdam and I live in Utrecht and I just stay there I just go 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.050
 to the premiere in Amsterdam 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.920
 if you are unlucky 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.730
 If you had a PSV you would have the score 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.730
 yes of course not me but now an ajaxied 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.520
 do you like to make barking work 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.190
 yes it 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.520
 that has been a great soccer player and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.650
 I am looking forward to my together with Marco van Bast but also with Dennis 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.790
 mountain camp to work together 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 take it to bed afterwards in the evening 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.900
 around half past eleven from the room 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.310
 I miss 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.400
 usually sleep before noon 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.940
 in the competition 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.790
 after the match 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.120
 11 hours after the camera 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.610
 that last question 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.820
 as justice 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.330
 they then do not fill malakal of a national football ban forty total 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.850
 year 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.579
 I don't know yet, I'm not sure yet 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.219
 the project to artists 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.219
