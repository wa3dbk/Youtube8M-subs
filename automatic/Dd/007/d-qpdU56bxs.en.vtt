00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
it for him and this is a satellite the C

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:29.300 
it for him and this is a satellite the C
650<00:00:19.050> D<00:00:19.590> /<00:00:23.330> 12<00:00:24.330> J<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.680> I'm<00:00:25.890> not<00:00:26.010> mistaken<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:28.310> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
650 D / 12 J if I'm not mistaken and the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.350 
650 D / 12 J if I'm not mistaken and the
problem<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.760> when<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.859> go<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.890> turn<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
problem is when you go to turn it on you

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.319 
problem is when you go to turn it on you
get<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.930> two<00:00:34.320> sheep<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.620> logo<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.210> then<00:00:36.210> you

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
get the two sheep a logo and then you

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.010 
get the two sheep a logo and then you
just<00:00:36.510> get<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.960> blank<00:00:37.500> screen<00:00:37.860> with<00:00:39.020> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
just get a blank screen with the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.290 
just get a blank screen with the
flashing<00:00:40.469> white<00:00:41.430> curves<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.149> here

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
flashing white curves that are up here

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.840 
flashing white curves that are up here
in<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> corner<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.309> nothing<00:00:44.309> else<00:00:44.430> happens

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
in the corner and nothing else happens

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.450 
in the corner and nothing else happens
and<00:00:46.160> I<00:00:47.160> try<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> access<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.450> BIOS<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.710> it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and I try to access the BIOS but it it

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.360 
and I try to access the BIOS but it it
wouldn't<00:00:50.730> let<00:00:50.910> me<00:00:51.350> just<00:00:52.350> got<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.190> same

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370

wouldn't let me just got the the same
black<00:00:53.579> screen<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:55.489> I've<00:00:56.489> taken<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.559> hard

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
black screen and I've taken the hard

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.349 
black screen and I've taken the hard
drive<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.660> also<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> RAM<00:01:01.620> modules<00:01:01.890> here

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
drive out and also the RAM modules here

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.030 
drive out and also the RAM modules here
you<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> see<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:03.870> they<00:01:04.409> were<00:01:04.470> causing<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
you have to see if they were causing the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.479 
you have to see if they were causing the
trouble

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
trouble

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.390

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
black screen so I started taking it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.700 
black screen so I started taking it
apart<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:18.259> as<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:20.250> laptops<00:01:21.090> it's

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
apart here and as with all laptops it's

hard drive is sitting and this is where

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.310 
hard drive is sitting and this is where
the<00:01:39.299> RAM<00:01:39.930> modules<00:01:40.439> were<00:01:41.250> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the RAM modules were so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.530 
the RAM modules were so
so<00:01:43.950> yeah<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.370> you<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.610> all<00:01:44.760> these<00:01:44.910> these

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.760 
underneath here this is where the
battery<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:53.210> you<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.450> take<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
battery is you have to take that out and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.610

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
there were two screws there and I've

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.060 
there were two screws there and I've
also<00:01:58.740> had<00:01:58.980> to<00:01:59.160> take<00:01:59.370> the<00:02:00.110> DVD<00:02:01.110> player<00:02:01.380> out<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
also had to take the DVD player out and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.210 
also had to take the DVD player out and
there<00:02:03.060> were<00:02:03.120> two<00:02:04.160> screws<00:02:05.160> here<00:02:06.320> but<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.710> got<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
there were two screws here but I got the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.320 
there were two screws here but I got the
all<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.479> screws<00:02:09.720> taken<00:02:10.110> out<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:11.330> started

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
all of the screws taken out and started

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.480 
all of the screws taken out and started
praying<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:14.730> keyboard<00:02:14.970> off<00:02:15.600> here<00:02:15.930> and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
praying the the keyboard off here and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.940 
praying the the keyboard off here and
that's<00:02:17.490> just<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.820> few<00:02:18.290> cables<00:02:19.290> here<00:02:19.440> holding<00:02:19.860> it

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
that's just a few cables here holding it

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.330 
that's just a few cables here holding it
in<00:02:20.100> place<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.340> I'm<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.910> go<00:02:21.750> ahead<00:02:21.840> and

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
in place so I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.510 
in place so I'm going to go ahead and
detach<00:02:23.340> those<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.500> hopefully<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.740> can<00:02:25.800> get<00:02:26.070> the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
detach those and hopefully I can get the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.480 
detach those and hopefully I can get the
keyboard<00:02:26.730> off<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:29.010> reach<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
keyboard off and so that I can reach the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.350 
keyboard off and so that I can reach the
CMOS<00:02:30.000> battery<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:31.790> hopefully<00:02:32.790> clearing<00:02:33.270> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
CMOS battery and hopefully clearing the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.670 
CMOS battery and hopefully clearing the
BIOS<00:02:33.690> will<00:02:34.050> fix<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.040> problem<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.500> I'm<00:02:37.500> going

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
BIOS will fix the problem so I'm going

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.229 
BIOS will fix the problem so I'm going
to<00:02:37.739> go<00:02:37.860> ahead<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.310> take<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.790> keyboard<00:02:39.150> off

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
to go ahead and take the keyboard off

got<00:03:17.730> into<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.360> BIOS<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.530> that's<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.220> good<00:03:20.400> start

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
got into the BIOS so that's a good start

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.960

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.810 
and then now put the hard drive back in
and<00:03:27.260> I'll<00:03:28.260> see<00:03:28.470> if<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:29.220> will<00:03:29.430> boot<00:03:29.610> up

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
and I'll see if it will boot up

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.070 
and I'll see if it will boot up
correctly<00:03:31.850> alright<00:03:32.850> so<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.600> booted<00:03:33.840> up

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
correctly alright so it booted up

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.220 
correctly alright so it booted up
correctly<00:03:34.530> from<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.830> harddrive<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.989> seems

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
correctly from the harddrive so it seems

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.520 
correctly from the harddrive so it seems
that<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:38.209> resetting<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.299> BIOS<00:03:39.630> did<00:03:40.290> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
that the resetting the BIOS did the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.390 
that the resetting the BIOS did the
digit<00:03:41.519> job<00:03:41.700> here<00:03:42.080> so<00:03:43.080> that's<00:03:43.650> all<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.070> have<00:03:44.280> to
