00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.640

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.770
 jose this is mine as you see is mine 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.559
 I have to have it in our position and 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:49.059
 take any car from the street to 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:51.989
 have a must in a game by 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.989
 imitation with a friend 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.550
 put in place the appearance the last 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.640
 location if it does not happen here we are in 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.680
 version 1.0 9 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.659
 then with this car with any 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.659
 street car in the workshop 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.289
 and we will be able to change almost everything 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.140
 double 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.300
 Sanchez or whatever and what we have 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.270
 what to do now is to get into paint 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.750
 and once inside painting we're going to 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.750
 the store 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.329
 once in the store 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.020
 we go back 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.790
 and we really should appear in 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.790
 our fox 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.119
 As you can see we are in our car and we 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.119
 we put inside the workshop 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.739
 you see now you give me to put the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.549
 paint that I want 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:21.140
 in this case it does not stop because it leaves me 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.390
 the painting 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.040
 what are you going to do what do you want to put 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.410
 now some wheels because the same process 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.000
 but with the wheels we take a car from 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.000
 the street because 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.760
 this for example days 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.100
 he is a son of a bitch jose 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.150
 nothing 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:53.870
 good god 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.870
 we take 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.660
 like the night of the street 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.140
 As you can see, it's still there, our car has 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.140
 destroyed we put it in the garage 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.690
 and the same process but in this case that 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.690
 you have the wheel 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.130
 we will not type wheels is 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.130
 the distinction is pain 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.480
 and once inside the playstation 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.480
 stable we go out again 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.650
 help 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.220
 You already know that this takes a little but 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.459
 that is the process have a new and last 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.160
 location as place of appearance we 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.209
 we get with a street car 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.910
 selected what we want in this 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.130
 case we have selected paint and now 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.790
 wheels once inside paint or from 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.560
 tires we get into playstation store 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.890
 we leave it and we get with remains with 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.510
 his playstation in the workshop and then 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.919
 change you have to do the process to 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.549
 everything we want to put into the louvre 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.100
 movies 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.100
 for sanchez to proximal others 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.150
 to feve injection I think that too and 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.390
 good all the cars that 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.020
 and now the new one has looked like a car 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:41.599
 but nothing happens 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.599
 we go here where is my car here 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.279
 if wade is pending 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.279
 and jose 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.690
 well we come with our car 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.900
 and as you can see we can change it from 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.139
 forward the all-rounder put of which 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.139
 we want 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.520
 I have chosen it with the face of 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.520
 address it from claudication 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.419
 let's put one 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:23.590
 is for example accessory as you see 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.590
 can put everything we want 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.970
 Once this is done we leave it and then 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.100
 so on with the turbo with the 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.110
 engine and with everything and I say again that 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.550
 It's worth it for any car we have 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.350
 what 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.960
 that is not going to duplicate and nothing like 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.790
 always like to subscribe if you have 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.440

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.440
 and until another goodbye
