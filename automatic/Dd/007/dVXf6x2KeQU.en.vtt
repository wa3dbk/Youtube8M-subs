out<00:05:49.190> and<00:05:49.780> during<00:05:50.780> that<00:05:50.840> entire<00:05:51.110> run<00:05:51.710> I<00:05:51.919> was

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
out and during that entire run I was

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.960 
out and during that entire run I was
thinking<00:05:53.110> do<00:05:54.110> I<00:05:54.169> just<00:05:54.530> go<00:05:54.710> to<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.919> ground<00:05:55.190> try

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
thinking do I just go to the ground try

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.930 
thinking do I just go to the ground try
just<00:05:56.240> dive<00:05:56.450> and<00:05:56.900> go<00:05:57.440> to<00:05:57.500> the<00:05:57.590> ground<00:05:57.860> so<00:05:58.729> we<00:05:58.820> can

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
just dive and go to the ground so we can

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.270 
just dive and go to the ground so we can
keep<00:05:59.030> her<00:05:59.180> on<00:05:59.270> the<00:05:59.300> clock<00:05:59.570> out<00:05:59.810> and<00:06:00.250> then<00:06:01.250> I

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
keep her on the clock out and then I

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.460 
keep her on the clock out and then I
realize<00:06:01.729> I<00:06:02.060> can't<00:06:03.669> just<00:06:04.669> do<00:06:04.849> that<00:06:04.880> I<00:06:05.330> can't<00:06:06.020> put

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
realize I can't just do that I can't put

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.040 
realize I can't just do that I can't put
my<00:06:06.620> faith<00:06:06.830> in<00:06:06.860> a<00:06:07.130> kicker<00:06:07.599> well<00:06:08.599> I'm<00:06:08.750> putting
