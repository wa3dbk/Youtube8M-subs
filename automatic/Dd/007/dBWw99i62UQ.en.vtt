00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
called development hell so this is

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.540

the game probably so I'm in that's just
the<00:01:35.939> way<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.320> this<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.470> pretty

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
the way this is this is pretty

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.260

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.740 

so<00:01:40.899> let's<00:01:41.170> run<00:01:41.380> through<00:01:41.560> here<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.570> see<00:01:43.570> what's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
so let's run through here and see what's

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.109 
so let's run through here and see what's
