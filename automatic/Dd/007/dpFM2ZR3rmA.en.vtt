 hello friends in this chapter of 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.870
 spaghetti to learn to draw in order 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.580
 that I find that he is one of the 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.619
 bravest and bacanes characters of 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.779
 everything now on tour so let's do 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.699
 good in the case of end more than to start 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.109
 for the face let's start so 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.450
 it is your head and your body since you are 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.940
 together so let's do here the 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.090
 line to make the bottom part of your 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:33.200
 body after 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:37.880
 up there we make one of his 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.739
 ears on his head and on an ear and 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.680
 down again to finish your body 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.230
 as at this point we are going to do the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.870
 hat then in here we are going to do 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.260
 the oval that makes his head and there 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.480
 little dot to little smile and their faces 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.470
 down here we are going to make your pants 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.140
 we're going to do it like that since in reality 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.090
 the end body is super elongated and 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.390
 thin especially his legs and his 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.750
 arms after we're going to do something to each 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.090
 end of his backpack 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.100
 we are going to make the line that separates 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.410
 the two contrasts a lot on each side of 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.680
 your backpack let's make your arms that 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:22.230
 they are like sterile ones yes 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.360
 and that we left that space to be able 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.210
 make your hands that in this case have 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.240
 four fingers down here let's do 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.240

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.020
