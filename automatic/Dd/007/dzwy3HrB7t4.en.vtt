00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.910 
basic as possible either the thumb or
the<00:04:14.510> fingers<00:04:14.989> and<00:04:15.350> we're<00:04:15.470> going<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.650> do<00:04:15.769> what's

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
the fingers and we're going to do what's

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.530 
the fingers and we're going to do what's
called<00:04:15.980> strumming<00:04:16.609> which<00:04:17.000> is<00:04:17.180> basically

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
called strumming which is basically

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.380 
called strumming which is basically
brushing<00:04:18.049> down<00:04:18.260> on<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.560> strings

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.640 

music<00:04:23.390> tends<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:23.870> be<00:04:23.990> broken<00:04:24.350> up<00:04:24.470> in<00:04:24.590> a

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
music tends to be broken up in a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.950 
music tends to be broken up in a
slightly<00:04:24.890> mathematical<00:04:25.670> way<00:04:25.820> so<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:26.750> would

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
slightly mathematical way so I would

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.140 
slightly mathematical way so I would
suggest<00:04:27.140> four<00:04:27.680> strums<00:04:28.100> on<00:04:28.430> each<00:04:28.550> chord<00:04:28.940> let's

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
suggest four strums on each chord let's

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.140 
suggest four strums on each chord let's
try<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.510> very<00:04:29.750> very<00:04:29.930> slowly<00:04:33.700> that's<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:34.940> G

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
try that very very slowly that's the G

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.130 
try that very very slowly that's the G
now<00:04:35.540> let's<00:04:35.750> try<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:35.990> C

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:50.399 

let's<00:04:41.140> go<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.560> D<00:04:45.060> back<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.300> G

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.259 

all<00:04:50.889> right<00:04:51.069> there<00:04:51.309> we<00:04:51.399> go<00:04:51.580> we've<00:04:51.729> got<00:04:51.759> four

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:52.269 
all right there we go we've got four

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:54.269 
all right there we go we've got four
force<00:04:52.749> drums<00:04:53.080> on<00:04:53.319> each<00:04:53.469> let's<00:04:53.769> just<00:04:53.949> try<00:04:54.129> that

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:54.279 
force drums on each let's just try that

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.320 
force drums on each let's just try that
around<00:04:54.639> and<00:04:54.849> around

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
around and around

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.879 
around and around
we'll<00:04:55.539> make<00:04:55.629> it<00:04:55.809> slowly<00:04:56.139> now<00:04:56.259> we'll<00:04:56.559> give<00:04:56.739> it<00:04:56.830> a

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
we'll make it slowly now we'll give it a

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.709 
we'll make it slowly now we'll give it a
little<00:04:57.039> a<00:04:57.309> little<00:04:57.819> beat<00:04:57.999> and<00:04:58.449> we'll<00:04:58.569> be

00:04:58.709 --> 00:04:58.719 
little a little beat and we'll be

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:11.740 
little a little beat and we'll be
playing

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750
