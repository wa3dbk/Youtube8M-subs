00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
I'm really happy i found this ken so

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.030 
I'm really happy i found this ken so
useful<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:40.000> sniper<00:04:40.240> rifle<00:04:40.600> is<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:42.760> is<00:04:43.060> a

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
useful the sniper rifle is it is a

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.939 
useful the sniper rifle is it is a
four-time<00:04:45.780> fire<00:04:46.780> so<00:04:47.290> all<00:04:47.410> that<00:04:47.440> means<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:47.889> that

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
four-time fire so all that means is that

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.710 
four-time fire so all that means is that
it's<00:04:48.850> just<00:04:49.120> four<00:04:49.479> times<00:04:49.750> as<00:04:49.990> likely<00:04:50.139> to<00:04:50.470> shoot

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
it's just four times as likely to shoot

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.590 
it's just four times as likely to shoot
a<00:04:52.720> bullet<00:04:52.870> with<00:04:54.570> you<00:04:55.570> know<00:04:55.690> fire<00:04:57.240> which<00:04:58.240> when

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
a bullet with you know fire which when

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.180 
a bullet with you know fire which when
you<00:04:58.660> get<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:58.870> four-time<00:04:59.260> ones<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.949> pretty

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
you get the four-time ones to pretty

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.689 
you get the four-time ones to pretty
much<00:05:00.389> almost<00:05:01.389> guarantee<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.169> shoot<00:05:02.699> fire

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
much almost guarantee to shoot fire

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:12.050 
much almost guarantee to shoot fire
almost<00:05:03.910> every<00:05:04.300> time<00:05:05.070> which<00:05:06.070> is<00:05:06.100> great<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:10.889> as

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
almost every time which is great and as

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.390 
almost every time which is great and as
well<00:05:13.060> over<00:05:13.300> 200<00:05:15.210> damage<00:05:16.770> yes<00:05:17.770> I<00:05:17.919> know<00:05:17.950> there's

other<00:05:18.910> guns<00:05:19.270> that<00:05:19.450> are<00:05:19.510> way<00:05:19.720> better<00:05:19.900> in<00:05:20.229> fact

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
other guns that are way better in fact

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.450 
other guns that are way better in fact
when<00:05:20.830> you<00:05:20.889> get<00:05:21.100> really<00:05:21.700> ranked<00:05:22.479> really<00:05:22.660> high<00:05:23.460> I

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
when you get really ranked really high I

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.529 
when you get really ranked really high I
have<00:05:25.090> a<00:05:25.120> weapon<00:05:25.389> that<00:05:25.570> has<00:05:25.990> like<00:05:26.320> 800<00:05:26.889> damage<00:05:27.220> a
