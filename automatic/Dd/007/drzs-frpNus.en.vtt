00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.690 
and then what you do is you get take out
the<00:03:00.620> head<00:03:00.830> which<00:03:01.070> mine<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.300> an<00:03:02.420> EVO<00:03:02.780> head<00:03:03.700> like

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
the head which mine is an EVO head like

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.590 
the head which mine is an EVO head like
that<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:07.310> then<00:03:07.460> it's<00:03:07.700> kind<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:08.000> messy<00:03:08.360> on<00:03:08.480> the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
that and then it's kind of messy on the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.600 
that and then it's kind of messy on the
back<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:09.020> what<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.320> do<00:03:09.500> is<00:03:09.710> you<00:03:09.980> take<00:03:10.010> out<00:03:10.430> the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
back so what you do is you take out the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.980 
back so what you do is you take out the
winds<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:12.110> not<00:03:12.440> take<00:03:12.680> out<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.980> wings<00:03:13.190> but<00:03:13.400> leg

winds and not take out the wings but leg
spin<00:03:14.990> them<00:03:15.170> around<00:03:17.170> try<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.230> get<00:03:18.440> them<00:03:18.590> out<00:03:18.740> of

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
spin them around try and get them out of

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.809 
spin them around try and get them out of
the<00:03:19.070> way
