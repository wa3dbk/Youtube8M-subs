00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.450
 and the outlet then you have 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.060

 you plug it in here if you want 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.420
 connect to your computer you 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.750
 would connect with those directly to 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.979
 USB jack of your mac or pc 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.869
 we will then go to others 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.979
 accessories provided in the box so 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.280
 that however accessories it will rather 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.739
 the user manuals so this little 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.899
 booklet contains some manuals so 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.380
 as the user guide for for the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.060
 boot with the few buttons here 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.100
 information guarantee notes 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.690
 stars and apple stickers that 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.050
 found in all products in 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.950
 general 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.290
 so here we will immediately go to the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.710
 presentation of the ipad which is the thing 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.210
 the most interesting 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.150
 look here at our poet like these 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.110
 and we will put our ipad 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.770
 so as you can see the ipad 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.080
 here is really very fine so I think 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.970
 that if you took an ipad you know 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.070
 why did you choose this one is 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.450
 not another brand for example so I 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.310
 will not mention other brands 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.680
 we will stay in the apple domain 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.960
 so if you have your ipad with it 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.030
 screen and his desires if you have the 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.530
 camera of your ipad so you need it 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.570
 not very well 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.850
 all the way down here with the curry we see 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.830
 here is the home button that you 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.230
 will leave the applications of 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.240
 return to the menu etc 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.510
 to make it simple in the back we have here 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:16.030
 our ipad of the ability the apple logo 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:19.340
 of course the camera we see here 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.310
 little trick here is the microphone and we 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.459
 here is the cable so the jack for 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.160
 plug your headphones on top 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.760
 so here you have the sleep button or 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.680
 lock for the screen here you 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.970
 have rotation lock or mode 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.540
 silence so it's up to you to choose 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:43.010
 here the volume buttons + and - in 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.320
 below you have here years 1 this 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.640
 small grid and then the connector 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.800
 dock that will allow you to recharge 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.080
 your ipad or mans at itunes 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.550
 so this part 2 is already over 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.050
 because the presentation is really 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.250
 very fast you have the ipad them 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.100
 some buttons etc 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.930
 we will go to party the longest and 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.160
 the most interesting that is the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.330
 starting your ipad 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.810
