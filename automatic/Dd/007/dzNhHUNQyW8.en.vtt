00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:09.120
 the habit 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:12.120
 [Music] 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.120
 i 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.290
 Y 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.920
 Well , Christmas is coming and 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.770
 here in Mexico it is customary to give away 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.119
 sweet in the inns is something like 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.130
 that something that is what we call bowling is 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.699
 give away at parties in the inns and 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.309
 at Christmas and well then I bring a 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.879
 original and different way of doing 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.940
 these bowls or confectioners and as already the 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.610
 they saw they are penguins recycling 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.220
 bottles are super nice super 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.280
 easy to make and are ideal for giving 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.890
 the bowling in these next inns that 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.570
 they are already around the corner and if 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.269
 teachers and you are going to encourage 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.670
 make the bowls of all his students 30 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.979
 or 40 students because the truth that my 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.830
 respect and if not then put each 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.360
 of your students to do their own or what 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.500
 well then let's see how it's done 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.920
 and I see them on Tuesday in the city of 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.130
 Mexico at the first flower meeting and 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.030
 crazy people already know at 2 in 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.180
 the forest of chapultepec in section 1 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.640
 source of the average frogs will be there 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.320
 from 2 to 6 and a half of the actor so hopefully 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.450
 that some of you can go to 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.829
 talk for a while to live and take the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.829
 fotitos bay 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.510
 first let's cut one of the 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.510
 bottles below the label 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.040
 since we cut it we match the 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.040
 borders 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.110
 we cut the other bottle by the base 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.380
 so the greatest will be the body and the 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.310
 base will be the cap which is the body 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:40.530
 must fit inside the hat 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:40.530
 [Music] 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.170
 the next thing is to paint everything with a layer 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:03:00.030
 of white 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:03:03.120
 [Music] 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.400
 while dry we will make a mold for the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.400
 penguin body that will be shaped like 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.240
 fat heart but no beak down more 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.230
 all right 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.319
 rounding should measure approximately 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.080
 10.50 long or 13 lines if the 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.110
 you do on a sheet and width measures on the 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.300
 Largest part 11.5 centimeters 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.999
 approximately 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.999
 [Music] 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.510
 now we paint the hat of the color that 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.620
 we want and we decorate it 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.620
 [Music] 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.060
 then we put the mold that we made 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.450
 in the body part and we mark it with 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.450
 pencil 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.150
 we painted everything out of black and if 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.070
 it is necessary we give one more layer of 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.070
 white in what we paint with the mold 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.220
 since I know that with the back of the 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.290
 brush we mark two black dots that 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.660
 will be the eyes and we paint a peak 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.380
 orange 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.380
 and 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.770
 when we have finished painting everything 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:48.230
 and it has dried we will cover with varnish or 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.870
 lacquer to protect and polish the 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.440
 painting 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.100
 [Music] 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.320
 since it is dry we add a strip of 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.350
 approximately 50 felt 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.740
 centimeters and the width that you want and 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.060
 this will be the scarf and we cut strips in 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.740
 the extremes 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.830
 finally you can paste some pompoms 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.710
 hat and buttons to the scarf or 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.660
 decorate it as you like and we have ready 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.100
 finished these confectioners or bowls that 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.500
 you can use at these parties 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.870
 Christmas I hope that this tutorial will 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.660
 have liked and do not miss the 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.400
 previous Christmas tutorials that 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.550
 will be at the end of the video 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.550
