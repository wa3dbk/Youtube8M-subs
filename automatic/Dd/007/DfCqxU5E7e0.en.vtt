last and that's the problem with

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.770 
last and that's the problem with
teaching<00:03:02.239> by<00:03:02.599> patterns<00:03:03.230> too<00:03:03.980> many<00:03:04.159> people<00:03:04.489> get

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
teaching by patterns too many people get

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.270 
teaching by patterns too many people get
mixed<00:03:05.780> up<00:03:05.900> with<00:03:06.109> concentrating<00:03:06.950> on<00:03:07.069> what

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
mixed up with concentrating on what

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.860 
mixed up with concentrating on what
their<00:03:07.430> feet<00:03:07.670> are<00:03:07.790> doing<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.090> whole<00:03:08.269> time<00:03:08.540> and

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
their feet are doing the whole time and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.440 
their feet are doing the whole time and
that<00:03:09.319> comes<00:03:09.829> last<00:03:10.280> when<00:03:11.000> you're<00:03:11.150> really

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
dancing for real the top goes and that

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.089 
dancing for real the top goes and that
tells<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:15.109> feet<00:03:15.290> where<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.590> go<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:15.950> they

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
tells the feet where to go and they

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.479 
tells the feet where to go and they
