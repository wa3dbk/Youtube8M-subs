00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
out too but yeah I'm not really much to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.529 
out too but yeah I'm not really much to
say<00:00:22.050> about<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.800> value<00:00:23.160> pack<00:00:23.400> instead<00:00:24.390> of

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
say about this the value pack instead of

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.880 
say about this the value pack instead of
getting<00:00:24.779> 118<00:00:25.500> dark<00:00:25.740> lip<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.400> 1890<00:00:27.269> get<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.890> 18

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
getting 118 dark lip and 1890 get to 18

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.269 
getting 118 dark lip and 1890 get to 18
dart<00:00:29.099> clips<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.699> 36<00:00:30.420> darts<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:30.900> that's<00:00:31.279> pretty

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
dart clips and 36 darts so that's pretty

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.979 
dart clips and 36 darts so that's pretty
cool<00:00:34.430> here's<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.579> back<00:00:35.820> not<00:00:36.300> really<00:00:36.570> much<00:00:36.750> to

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
cool here's the back not really much to

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.260 
cool here's the back not really much to
say<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.410> not<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.920> elite<00:00:38.190> XD<00:00:38.700> blasters

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
say it's not like the elite XD blasters

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.690 
say it's not like the elite XD blasters
where<00:00:40.160> it<00:00:41.160> shows<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:43.399> ranges<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
where it shows you the ranges of the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.319 
where it shows you the ranges of the
darts<00:00:45.469> but<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.739> too<00:00:47.039> big<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.460> deal<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:47.700> it's

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
darts but not too big of a deal so it's

00:00:48.329 --> 00:01:01.360 
darts but not too big of a deal so it's
just<00:00:48.600> start<00:00:49.530> opening<00:00:49.739> this

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.579 

so<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.210> open<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.930> it's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
so you can see here you open it and it's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.730 
so you can see here you open it and it's
pretty<00:01:04.830> much<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.070> doubled<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:05.880> instead<00:01:06.330> of

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
pretty much just doubled up instead of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.460 
pretty much just doubled up instead of
one

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.630 

so<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.729> clip<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
so that just one clip here you get to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
so that just one clip here you get to
set<00:01:14.640> up<00:01:14.759> one<00:01:14.970> smaller<00:01:15.360> pack<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.869> darts<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.259> get

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
set up one smaller pack of darts you get

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.870 
set up one smaller pack of darts you get
of<00:01:17.160> giant<00:01:17.670> big<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:21.740> Fox<00:01:22.740> itself<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> little

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
of giant big one Fox itself is a little

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.040 
of giant big one Fox itself is a little
dinged<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.300> but<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:26.430> instructions<00:01:27.300> and<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.960> I

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
dinged up but the instructions and if I

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.749 
dinged up but the instructions and if I
didn't<00:01:28.229> mention<00:01:28.409> before<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> flywheel

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
didn't mention before this is a flywheel

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.600 
didn't mention before this is a flywheel
breast<00:01:30.210> black<00:01:30.690> flip-flop<00:01:31.369> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.580> a

breast black flip-flop this is a
flywheel<00:01:33.539> blaster<00:01:34.080> so<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:34.619> need

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
it to feel different since they're clear

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.810 
it to feel different since they're clear
but<00:02:54.070> really<00:02:55.070> like<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:56.800> that's<00:02:57.800> if<00:02:58.640> the

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
but really like that that's if the

I really like that really great purchase
in<00:03:37.190> my<00:03:37.340> opinion<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.030> haven't<00:03:38.330> even<00:03:38.390> shot<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:38.930> at

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
in my opinion I haven't even shot it at

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.729 
in my opinion I haven't even shot it at
all<00:03:39.410> yet<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:41.269> we<00:03:41.390> got<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.720> stock<00:03:42.079> adjustment
