grill area around the subwoofers but I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.130 
grill area around the subwoofers but I
made<00:01:54.870> it<00:01:54.900> out<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.230> really<00:01:55.470> thin<00:01:55.800> let's<00:01:56.070> pinch

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
made it out of really thin let's pinch

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.910 
made it out of really thin let's pinch
masonite<00:01:58.430> so<00:02:00.080> no<00:02:01.080> matter<00:02:01.200> how<00:02:01.440> much<00:02:01.650> I<00:02:01.800> would

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
masonite so no matter how much I would

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.100 
masonite so no matter how much I would
brace<00:02:02.160> this<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.360> would<00:02:03.540> try<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:03.750> stretch

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
brace this if I would try to stretch

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.180 
brace this if I would try to stretch
cloth<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.830> this<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:06.560> like<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.740> normally<00:02:07.800> would

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
cloth on this and like I normally would

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.030 
cloth on this and like I normally would
do<00:02:08.430> to<00:02:08.580> fiberglass<00:02:08.880> apiece<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.750> would<00:02:10.710> distort

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
do to fiberglass apiece I would distort

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.030 
do to fiberglass apiece I would distort
it<00:02:11.220> i<00:02:11.510> watch<00:02:12.510> how<00:02:13.110> obviously<00:02:13.590> because<00:02:13.830> you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
it i watch how obviously because you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.730 
it i watch how obviously because you
know<00:02:14.160> there's<00:02:14.400> really<00:02:14.610> no<00:02:14.820> way<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:16.110> adhere

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
know there's really no way to to adhere

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.980 
know there's really no way to to adhere
to<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.130> just<00:02:17.490> kind<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.000> temporary<00:02:18.660> things

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
to it just kind of temporary things

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.230 
to it just kind of temporary things
really<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:20.100> with<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> tape<00:02:20.550> when<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:20.970> put<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
really but with the tape when I put the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.840 
really but with the tape when I put the
tape<00:02:21.420> one<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.900> do<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:23.010> manner<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.340> it

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
tape one I do it in a manner that it

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.060 
tape one I do it in a manner that it
doesn't<00:02:24.180> warp<00:02:24.420> anything<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.020> there's<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.920> lot

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
doesn't warp anything and there's a lot

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.460 
doesn't warp anything and there's a lot
of<00:02:26.100> flex<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.610> tape<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.780> know<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.260> do

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
of flex in the tape and you know you do

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.840 
of flex in the tape and you know you do
you're<00:02:28.950> going<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.130> get<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.250> lot<00:02:29.340> more<00:02:29.370> wrinkles

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
you're going to get a lot more wrinkles

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.930 
you're going to get a lot more wrinkles
doing<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.270> way<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.260> did<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.220> hello

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
doing it this way but I did it hello

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.080 
doing it this way but I did it hello
which<00:02:33.750> means<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.170> can<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:35.430> know<00:02:35.550> putty<00:02:35.790> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
which means I can you know putty and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.080 
which means I can you know putty and
build<00:02:36.840> up<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.959> surface<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.489> then<00:02:38.850> sand

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
build up the surface and and then sand

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.310 
build up the surface and and then sand
it<00:02:39.209> like<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.450> normally<00:02:39.600> would<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:41.870> see<00:02:42.870> the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.820 

resin<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.530> putty<00:02:46.890> mixture<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.060> used<00:02:48.830> with

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
resin and putty mixture that I used with

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.390 
resin and putty mixture that I used with
the<00:02:50.209> fiberglass<00:02:51.209> strands<00:02:51.709> does<00:02:52.709> not<00:02:52.980> stick<00:02:53.370> to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
the fiberglass strands does not stick to

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.450 
the fiberglass strands does not stick to
the<00:02:53.910> even<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.330> back<00:02:54.480> side<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.989> tank

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.600 

this<00:03:02.460> is<00:03:02.820> really<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.360> only<00:03:06.230> problem<00:03:07.490> it<00:03:08.490> could

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
this is really the only problem it could

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.370 
this is really the only problem it could
happen<00:03:08.850> doing<00:03:09.300> this<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:12.170> resin<00:03:13.170> will

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
happen doing this is that the resin will

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.010 
happen doing this is that the resin will
sometimes<00:03:13.800> go<00:03:14.070> underneath<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:15.660> it's<00:03:15.810> not<00:03:15.990> a

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
sometimes go underneath and it's not a

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.730 
sometimes go underneath and it's not a
real<00:03:16.290> big<00:03:16.410> deal<00:03:18.080> I'll<00:03:19.080> just<00:03:19.350> hit<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.590> with

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
real big deal I'll just hit that with

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.590 
real big deal I'll just hit that with
some<00:03:19.770> coarse<00:03:20.160> sandpaper<00:03:20.760> with<00:03:21.060> my<00:03:21.180> mini<00:03:21.390> da

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
some coarse sandpaper with my mini da

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.890 
some coarse sandpaper with my mini da
and<00:03:22.070> that'll<00:03:23.070> come<00:03:23.190> right<00:03:23.220> off<00:03:23.660> as<00:03:24.660> well<00:03:24.810> as

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
and that'll come right off as well as

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.390 
and that'll come right off as well as
these<00:03:25.080> runs<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.620> little<00:03:25.800> hop<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.190> few

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
these runs the little hop of the few

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.710 
these runs the little hop of the few
high<00:03:26.550> spots<00:03:31.070> with<00:03:32.070> this<00:03:32.280> basically<00:03:33.210> extra

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
high spots with this basically extra

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.940 
high spots with this basically extra
step<00:03:33.960> and<00:03:34.820> taking<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.940> care<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.390> did

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
step and taking the care that I did

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.340 
step and taking the care that I did
peace<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:39.120> say<00:03:39.300> fits<00:03:40.910> fits<00:03:41.910> right<00:03:42.180> in<00:03:42.350> no

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
peace and say fits fits right in no
