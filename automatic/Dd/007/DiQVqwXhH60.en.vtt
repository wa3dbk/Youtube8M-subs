00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:08.967
Hello!

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.802
Dude! Hello!

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.097
Paul Reggio?
I did high school with you.

00:00:14.263 --> 00:00:16.516
- Oh, right.
- So what are you up to now?

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:19.574
Come on, give me the rundown.
Make me jealous!

00:00:20.027 --> 00:00:22.356
You can basically take
the last three years of my life

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:23.962
then light 'em on fire.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.946
I lost all of my money
and a lot of other people's money.

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:30.515
You can hear in my voice
how pissed I am!

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:33.951
So, my sister is pregnant, so I'm like,
helping her out a little bit.

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:36.228
- Kids!
- Yeah, they're the future.

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:38.778
- We'll see, but...
- No, they are.

00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:40.363
- They will be.
- We'll see.

00:00:40.488 --> 00:00:42.542
No it's undoubted,
the children are the future.

00:00:44.012 --> 00:00:45.629
- How long do you need to stay?
- 3 months.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:46.672
3 months?!

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.091
- I have to talk to Danny.
- Like ask him permission?

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:51.193
Like have a conversation
because he's my husband.

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.650
- I need to stay here for a few months.
- Yeah, sure.

00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:57.043
I didn't have a chance
to talk to him yet.

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.995
- I can help around the house.
- You want to watch Teddy?

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.979
I'm talking about buying groceries,
build stuff.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.939
I need you to make me feel better.

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:07.442
- This is Teddy's nanny.
- I'm actually his uncle.

00:01:07.608 --> 00:01:08.986
Teddy!
Let's go crazy!

00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:11.571
Good afternoon, ladies.

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:14.729
What? You never seen a kid
in a suitcase before?

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.618
I'll tape everything up
so he wont hurt himself.

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:19.871
You wouldn't believe
what happened here last Friday.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.165
- This hooker hit a vein.
- Teddy, you wanna go to the park?

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.500
It bled everywhere.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.545
- Good day?
- I went and got some frozen yogurt

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.464
waiting for that bar to open.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.217
I wish you came to visit
because you were happy.

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:36.869
Are you happy?

00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:39.452
You think you got it
all worked out now?

00:01:39.577 --> 00:01:42.310
After three months.
You don't really live here.

00:01:42.476 --> 00:01:45.188
The only reason that you stick around
is when you need something.

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:47.747
Is this too much?

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.068
Hi, dad.

00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:53.572
Oh! Is that Bruce Willis
and his new hot young wife?!

00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:55.532
Miss Jenn's Adult Beginners?

00:01:56.232 --> 00:01:59.077
If you want Teddy to have confidence
in the water you need to have it too.

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:00.651
We're very confident, thank you.

00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:03.206
- Why are you holding onto me?
- I'm not comfortable here.

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.207
Me neither.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.006
Screw her!
I'm not an Adult Beginner.
