posh Colossus HD video recorder which
actually<00:00:22.630> is<00:00:22.750> a<00:00:22.779> much<00:00:22.990> better<00:00:23.200> thing<00:00:23.349> than<00:00:23.619> the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
actually is a much better thing than the

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.900 
actually is a much better thing than the
USB<00:00:24.460> version<00:00:24.669> because<00:00:25.739> instead<00:00:26.739> of<00:00:26.800> being<00:00:27.009> USB

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
USB version because instead of being USB

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.919 
USB version because instead of being USB
it's<00:00:28.740> pci-e<00:00:29.939> which<00:00:30.939> means<00:00:31.210> it<00:00:31.480> picks<00:00:31.750> the

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:31.929 
it's pci-e which means it picks the

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.970 
it's pci-e which means it picks the
short<00:00:32.529> little<00:00:33.089> W<00:00:34.089> looking<00:00:34.589> slots<00:00:35.589> and<00:00:35.920> you

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
short little W looking slots and you

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.079 
short little W looking slots and you
have<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.190> keep<00:00:36.339> it<00:00:36.460> in<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:36.580> static<00:00:36.910> bag

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:37.089 
have to keep it in the static bag

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:38.820 
have to keep it in the static bag
because<00:00:37.390> I<00:00:37.480> haven't<00:00:37.600> installed<00:00:37.960> it<00:00:38.140> yet<00:00:38.199> but

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
because I haven't installed it yet but

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.270 
because I haven't installed it yet but
I've<00:00:39.339> played<00:00:39.550> with<00:00:39.760> it<00:00:39.879> before<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.530> it's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
I've played with it before and it's

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.689 
I've played with it before and it's
great<00:00:42.519> because<00:00:42.760> it<00:00:43.059> has<00:00:43.350> HDMI<00:00:44.350> in<00:00:44.860> it<00:00:45.280> also<00:00:45.489> has

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
great because it has HDMI in it also has

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.460 
great because it has HDMI in it also has
the<00:00:45.850> AVN<00:00:46.299> so<00:00:46.600> that<00:00:46.720> you<00:00:46.809> can<00:00:46.930> still<00:00:47.140> run<00:00:47.260> be<00:00:47.440> a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
the AVN so that you can still run be a

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.619 
the AVN so that you can still run be a
component<00:00:47.830> and<00:00:48.190> it's<00:00:48.430> got<00:00:48.640> component<00:00:49.180> hours

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
component and it's got component hours

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.750 
component and it's got component hours
so<00:00:50.559> that<00:00:50.589> it<00:00:50.769> will<00:00:50.920> run<00:00:51.070> in<00:00:51.190> pass-through<00:00:51.430> mode

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
so that it will run in pass-through mode

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.100 
so that it will run in pass-through mode
just<00:00:52.150> like<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.540> old<00:00:52.809> pop<00:00:53.739> on<00:00:54.070> USB<00:00:55.030> DVR<00:00:55.780> did

USB<00:02:21.010> version<00:02:21.480> did<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.510> couple<00:02:23.139> of

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
USB version did a couple of

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.680 
USB version did a couple of
Editions<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.070> still<00:02:25.370> limited<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:26.120> 1080i

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
Editions it is still limited to 1080i

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.290 
Editions it is still limited to 1080i
and<00:02:26.780> 720p<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:28.070> will<00:02:28.220> not<00:02:28.430> do<00:02:28.760> 1080p<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:31.300> so

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
and 720p it will not do 1080p and so

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.330 
and 720p it will not do 1080p and so
there's<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.780> couple<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.080> limitations<00:02:33.680> but<00:02:34.130> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
there's a couple of limitations but the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.830 
there's a couple of limitations but the
most<00:02:34.580> part<00:02:34.910> though<00:02:35.090> shouldn't<00:02:35.420> affect<00:02:35.630> you

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
most part though shouldn't affect you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.110 
most part though shouldn't affect you
for<00:02:36.080> playing<00:02:36.440> your<00:02:36.560> games<00:02:36.830> because<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.700> can't

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
for playing your games because I can't

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.580 
for playing your games because I can't
think<00:02:38.210> of<00:02:38.390> any<00:02:38.510> games<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:38.930> actually<00:02:39.020> run<00:02:39.500> at

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
think of any games that actually run at

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.130 
think of any games that actually run at
1080p<00:02:39.740> 60<00:02:40.550> anyway<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.600> you<00:02:41.690> probably<00:02:42.020> be

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
1080p 60 anyway so you probably be

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.870 
1080p 60 anyway so you probably be
better<00:02:42.260> at<00:02:42.380> playing<00:02:42.620> 1080i<00:02:43.130> or<00:02:43.400> 720p

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
better at playing 1080i or 720p

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.270 
better at playing 1080i or 720p

comes with a crackling of cables comes

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.570 
comes with a crackling of cables comes
with<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.400> really<00:02:52.720> nice<00:02:53.720> fairly<00:02:54.410> long<00:02:54.800> component

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
with a really nice fairly long component

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.270 
with a really nice fairly long component
cable<00:02:55.940> like<00:02:56.120> that's<00:02:57.020> got<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.380> five<00:02:57.590> bundled

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
cable like that's got the five bundled

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.480 
cable like that's got the five bundled
in<00:02:58.400> one<00:02:58.610> it's<00:02:59.060> pretty<00:02:59.720> heavy<00:02:59.870> duty<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:01.010> that's

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
in one it's pretty heavy duty so that's

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.010 
in one it's pretty heavy duty so that's
a<00:03:01.580> fairly<00:03:01.760> nice<00:03:01.940> cable<00:03:02.270> that's<00:03:02.570> probably

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
a fairly nice cable that's probably

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.270 
a fairly nice cable that's probably
almost<00:03:03.530> worth<00:03:03.710> the<00:03:03.800> price<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.070> admission

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
almost worth the price of admission

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.260 
almost worth the price of admission
right<00:03:04.760> there<00:03:05.210> that's<00:03:05.450> probably<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.470> Frey<00:03:06.860> is<00:03:06.920> a

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
right there that's probably it Frey is a

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.500 
right there that's probably it Frey is a
twelve<00:03:08.270> dollar<00:03:08.360> cable<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:10.520> Colossus<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.180> good

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
twelve dollar cable the Colossus is good

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.330 
twelve dollar cable the Colossus is good
price<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:12.200> don't<00:03:12.410> remember<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.770> price<00:03:12.980> but<00:03:13.250> I

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
price I don't remember the price but I

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.430 
price I don't remember the price but I
didn't<00:03:13.520> think<00:03:13.580> I<00:03:13.730> was<00:03:13.850> getting<00:03:14.000> shafted<00:03:14.900> on<00:03:15.260> it

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
didn't think I was getting shafted on it

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.280 
didn't think I was getting shafted on it
so<00:03:15.740> I'll<00:03:16.010> post<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.460> link<00:03:16.490> to<00:03:16.820> both<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.900> hogwash

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
so I'll post a link to both the hogwash

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.210 
so I'll post a link to both the hogwash
Colossus<00:03:18.950> on<00:03:19.190> Amazon<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:21.050> swell<00:03:21.440> HDMI

setup for doing video game captures and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.110 
setup for doing video game captures and
it's<00:03:30.860> one<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.130> few<00:03:31.280> solutions<00:03:31.550> it's<00:03:31.940> going

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
it's one of the few solutions it's going

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.570 
it's one of the few solutions it's going
to<00:03:32.209> let<00:03:32.300> you<00:03:32.420> do<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.570> with<00:03:32.660> HDMI<00:03:33.230> so<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.100> don't

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
to let you do it with HDMI so you don't

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.060 
to let you do it with HDMI so you don't
pick<00:03:34.760> up<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.060> component<00:03:35.630> noise<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.980> a

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
pick up that component noise and a

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.860 
pick up that component noise and a
couple<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.400> other<00:03:37.550> things<00:03:37.790> so<00:03:38.030> generally<00:03:38.720> it's

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
couple of other things so generally it's

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.250 
couple of other things so generally it's
just<00:03:38.930> going<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.320> look<00:03:39.470> playing<00:03:40.100> better<00:03:41.260> so

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
just going to look playing better so

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.680 
just going to look playing better so
yeah<00:03:42.470> Colossus<00:03:43.280> from<00:03:43.489> Akash<00:03:43.880> and<00:03:44.180> this<00:03:44.570> is<00:03:44.660> a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
yeah Colossus from Akash and this is a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.980 
yeah Colossus from Akash and this is a
