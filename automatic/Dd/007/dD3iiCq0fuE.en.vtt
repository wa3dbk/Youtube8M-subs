for the head so head shape I don't think

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.750 
for the head so head shape I don't think
they've<00:00:36.750> been<00:00:36.899> error<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.160> mean<00:00:38.550> no

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
they've been error like I mean no

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.750 
they've been error like I mean no
literally<00:00:39.149> okay<00:00:40.020> he<00:00:40.739> sent<00:00:41.010> me<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> sketch<00:00:41.489> and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
literally okay he sent me a sketch and

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.970 
literally okay he sent me a sketch and
that's<00:00:41.940> what<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.210> looked<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.140> think

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that's what it looked like and I think

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.069 
that's what it looked like and I think
personally<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.629> would<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.870> very

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
personally that this would be very

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900 
personally that this would be very
effective<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.100> hit<00:00:47.309> directly<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
effective if you hit directly on the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.569 
effective if you hit directly on the
point<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.989> would<00:00:49.260> crack<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> skull<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.340> sure

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
point it would crack a skull for sure

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.189 
point it would crack a skull for sure
which<00:00:50.850> unfortunately<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.690> melons<00:00:52.050> we

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
which unfortunately we have melons we

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.369 
which unfortunately we have melons we
can't<00:00:52.440> crack<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> skull<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.960> but<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.110> wouldn't

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
can't crack a skull but but it wouldn't

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.720 
can't crack a skull but but it wouldn't
work<00:00:55.440> very<00:00:55.500> well<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.890> throwing<00:00:56.309> because

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
work very well for throwing because

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.279 
work very well for throwing because
there's<00:00:56.910> only<00:00:57.090> two<00:00:57.449> points<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> could

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
there's only two points that I could

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.340 
there's only two points that I could
actually<00:00:58.410> hit<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.980> stick<00:00:59.690> yes<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.140> those

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
