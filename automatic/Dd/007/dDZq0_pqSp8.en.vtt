Grandmaster so one has to be very

careful<00:00:38.899> about<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.410> opening<00:00:40.800> moves<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:42.059> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
careful about the opening moves and of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.760 
careful about the opening moves and of
course<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.629> play<00:00:42.840> playing<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> middle

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
course the play playing in the middle

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.350 
course the play playing in the middle
game<00:00:45.950> but<00:00:46.950> opponents<00:00:47.280> play<00:00:47.760> very<00:00:48.030> quickly

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
game but opponents play very quickly

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.170 
game but opponents play very quickly
because<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.079> well-known<00:00:50.180> opening

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
because it's a well-known opening

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.150 
because it's a well-known opening
variation<00:00:53.809> it<00:00:54.809> was<00:00:55.050> familiar<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.559> me

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
variation it was familiar to me

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.560 
variation it was familiar to me
so<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.969> I'm<00:00:57.090> choosing<00:00:57.420> between<00:00:57.570> h4<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.649> g4

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
so here I'm choosing between h4 and g4

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.360 
so here I'm choosing between h4 and g4
and<00:01:00.570> choose<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.250> prince

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
and choose the prince

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.710 
and choose the prince
oh<00:01:02.550> one<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.890> here<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> could<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.760> played<00:01:09.060> H

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
oh one so here I could have played H

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.530 
oh one so here I could have played H
takes<00:01:10.409> g6<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> same<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.700> my<00:01:14.880> game

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
takes g6 and it was the same in my game

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.749 
takes g6 and it was the same in my game
with<00:01:15.780> Natalie<00:01:16.229> Polk<00:01:16.439> arena<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.040> Samara<00:01:17.490> last

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
with Natalie Polk arena in Samara last

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.300 
with Natalie Polk arena in Samara last
year

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.780 

so<00:01:25.850> now<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.270> game<00:01:26.810> is<00:01:27.310> transporting<00:01:28.310> from<00:01:28.520> one

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
so now the game is transporting from one

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.450 
so now the game is transporting from one
variation<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.570> another<00:01:29.920> that's<00:01:30.920> why<00:01:31.220> probably

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
variation to another that's why probably

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.649 
variation to another that's why probably
my<00:01:31.880> opponent<00:01:33.820> took<00:01:34.820> some<00:01:35.030> time<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.299> think

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
my opponent took some time to think

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:43.420 
my opponent took some time to think
about<00:01:35.840> it

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.450 

so<00:01:44.000> I<00:01:44.030> played<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:44.480> for<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:45.200> zero<00:01:45.500> was<00:01:45.980> possible

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
so I played you for it zero was possible

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.770 
so I played you for it zero was possible
to<00:01:46.520> take<00:01:46.850> on<00:01:47.090> g6<00:01:47.870> and<00:01:49.090> transposed<00:01:50.090> into<00:01:50.390> my

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
to take on g6 and transposed into my

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.300 
to take on g6 and transposed into my
against<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.380> typical

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.490 

this<00:01:59.310> position<00:01:59.760> was<00:01:59.910> familiar<00:02:00.480> to<00:02:00.990> me<00:02:01.170> because

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
this position was familiar to me because

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.380 
this position was familiar to me because
in<00:02:01.620> 2001<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.690> already<00:02:03.690> played<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.200> game<00:02:05.390> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
in 2001 I already played the game the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.100 
in 2001 I already played the game the
same<00:02:06.600> variation<00:02:08.210> that's<00:02:09.210> actually<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.960> I

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
same variation that's actually and I

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.080 
same variation that's actually and I
want<00:02:10.380> that<00:02:10.800> game<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.950> was<00:02:14.160> quite<00:02:14.610> surprised

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
want that game and I was quite surprised

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.300 
want that game and I was quite surprised
at<00:02:15.270> my<00:02:15.420> opponent<00:02:16.280> that's<00:02:17.390> actually<00:02:18.390> thinks<00:02:19.310> so

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
at my opponent that's actually thinks so

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.030 
at my opponent that's actually thinks so
much<00:02:20.600> about<00:02:21.600> this<00:02:21.780> position<00:02:23.660> because<00:02:24.830> if<00:02:25.830> you

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
much about this position because if you

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.890 
much about this position because if you
play<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.610> dragon<00:02:26.820> variation<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.600> need<00:02:27.750> to

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
play the dragon variation you need to

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.870 
play the dragon variation you need to
know<00:02:28.190> theory<00:02:29.190> very<00:02:29.610> well<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:33.750> still

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
know theory very well and it's still

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.880 
know theory very well and it's still
theory

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:55.690 

that<00:02:41.890> doesn't<00:02:42.280> have<00:02:42.460> a<00:02:43.500> choice<00:02:44.500> here<00:02:45.160> so

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:17.730 

and<00:02:56.210> everything<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.660> almost<00:02:56.840> forced

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.120 

so<00:03:18.740> in<00:03:18.860> this<00:03:19.010> variation<00:03:19.810> at<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.990> ending<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.740> rat

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
so in this variation at the ending a rat

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.910 
so in this variation at the ending a rat
is<00:03:22.280> almost<00:03:22.670> forcibly<00:03:25.090> it's<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.540> better<00:03:27.230> ending

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
is almost forcibly it's a better ending

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.140 
is almost forcibly it's a better ending
for<00:03:28.370> white<00:03:30.040> say<00:03:31.120> don't<00:03:32.120> risk<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.930> lot<00:03:33.940> they<00:03:34.940> have

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
for white say don't risk a lot they have

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.280 
for white say don't risk a lot they have
an<00:03:35.780> extra<00:03:36.200> phone<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:39.940> it's<00:03:40.940> only<00:03:41.480> question

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
an extra phone and it's only question

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.890 
an extra phone and it's only question
because<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.070> black<00:03:43.640> can<00:03:44.030> hold<00:03:44.390> this<00:03:44.660> position

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
because a black can hold this position

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:53.410 
because a black can hold this position
or<00:03:45.470> not

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.400 

and<00:03:53.990> as<00:03:54.350> you<00:03:54.500> can<00:03:54.680> see<00:03:55.180> I'm<00:03:56.180> already<00:03:58.300> forehead

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
and as you can see I'm already forehead

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.869 
and as you can see I'm already forehead
my<00:04:00.410> opponent

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.630 

and<00:04:06.879> here<00:04:07.180> my<00:04:07.450> opponent<00:04:07.870> just<00:04:08.049> made<00:04:08.290> to

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
and here my opponent just made to

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.750 
and here my opponent just made to
blunder<00:04:09.870> after<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.230> route<00:04:11.409> cb7<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.459> be<00:04:12.730> a

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
blunder after the route cb7 to be a

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.040 
blunder after the route cb7 to be a
normal<00:04:13.180> traditional<00:04:13.360> tea<00:04:14.110> they<00:04:14.560> just<00:04:14.829> lost
