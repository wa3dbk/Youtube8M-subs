00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
be taken off that job just like anyone

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
else who doesn't do their job they

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.750 
else who doesn't do their job they
should<00:00:50.050> be<00:00:50.170> taken<00:00:50.469> off<00:00:50.589> the<00:00:50.739> job<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.100> people

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
should be taken off the job and people

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.729 
should be taken off the job and people
should<00:00:51.879> be<00:00:51.940> put<00:00:52.210> there<00:00:52.359> who<00:00:52.480> will<00:00:52.659> do<00:00:52.929> it<00:00:53.079> we

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
should be put there who will do it we

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.829 
should be put there who will do it we
don't<00:00:54.010> think<00:00:54.370> that<00:00:54.699> it's<00:00:54.850> inevitable<00:00:55.479> that<00:00:55.659> we

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
don't think that it's inevitable that we

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.229 
don't think that it's inevitable that we
have<00:00:56.079> such<00:00:56.289> a<00:00:56.319> low<00:00:56.589> conviction<00:00:57.129> rate<00:00:57.519> we<00:00:57.999> think

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
have such a low conviction rate we think

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.270 
have such a low conviction rate we think
it<00:00:58.359> can<00:00:58.569> be<00:00:58.600> changed<00:00:59.229> but<00:00:59.649> we<00:00:59.829> think<00:00:59.979> that<00:01:00.100> the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
it can be changed but we think that the

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.889 
it can be changed but we think that the
first<00:01:00.519> step<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:00.969> that<00:01:01.120> is<00:01:01.359> making<00:01:01.749> people

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
first step to that is making people

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.899 
first step to that is making people
actually<00:01:02.530> feel<00:01:02.769> accountable<00:01:03.159> for<00:01:03.670> what<00:01:03.789> they

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
actually feel accountable for what they

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.149 
actually feel accountable for what they
do<00:01:03.969> and<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.870> have<00:01:05.050> to<00:01:05.170> say<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.500> since<00:01:05.740> nobody

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
do and I have to say that since nobody

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.710 
do and I have to say that since nobody
has<00:01:06.250> been<00:01:06.490> doing<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:06.940> no<00:01:07.180> one<00:01:07.330> has<00:01:07.540> been

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
has been doing that no one has been

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.680 
has been doing that no one has been
