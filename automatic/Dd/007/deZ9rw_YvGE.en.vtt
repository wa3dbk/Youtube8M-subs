00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
in the blogs I don't know if others have

been able to

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.229 
been able to

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
heating device let's see if we can I

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.319 
heating device let's see if we can I
think<00:03:18.260> it's<00:03:18.590> like<00:03:18.890> this<00:03:19.220> is<00:03:19.579> pretty<00:03:19.940> pretty

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
think it's like this is pretty pretty

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.660 
think it's like this is pretty pretty
production<00:03:20.989> or<00:03:21.109> pretty<00:03:21.380> release<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:22.070> don't

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
production or pretty release I don't

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.849 
production or pretty release I don't
when<00:03:22.760> they<00:03:22.790> were<00:03:22.940> releasing<00:03:23.180> exactly<00:03:23.859> but

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
when they were releasing exactly but

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.030 
when they were releasing exactly but
let's<00:03:25.730> see<00:03:25.910> what<00:03:26.060> we<00:03:26.180> can<00:03:26.209> do<00:03:26.420> down<00:03:26.540> here<00:03:27.040> in

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
let's see what we can do down here in

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.360 
let's see what we can do down here in
your<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.220> next<00:03:28.430> page<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:30.500> needed<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.190> download

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
your the next page I needed to download

I<00:03:33.700> didn't<00:03:34.700> set<00:03:34.970> up<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.180> Meyer<00:03:35.359> Eric's<00:03:36.130> account

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
I didn't set up a Meyer Eric's account

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.069 
I didn't set up a Meyer Eric's account
let's<00:03:38.209> go<00:03:38.450> in<00:03:39.160> over<00:03:40.160> here<00:03:40.660> sort<00:03:41.660> by<00:03:41.720> towel

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
let's go in over here sort by towel

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:49.680 
let's go in over here sort by towel
author<00:03:43.239> he<00:03:44.239> was<00:03:44.359> a<00:03:44.389> list<00:03:44.920> looks<00:03:46.690> there's<00:03:47.690> list

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
author he was a list looks there's list

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:57.340 
author he was a list looks there's list
so<00:03:51.130> it's<00:03:52.130> really<00:03:52.400> really<00:03:52.670> cool<00:03:53.540> design<00:03:56.350> huge

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
so it's really really cool design huge

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
so it's really really cool design huge
frame<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:59.440> the<00:04:00.440> screen<00:04:00.680> is<00:04:00.709> basically<00:04:01.010> the

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
frame and the screen is basically the

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.280 
frame and the screen is basically the
size<00:04:01.579> of<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.850> device<00:04:02.120> there<00:04:02.510> isn't<00:04:02.959> much<00:04:03.049> more

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
size of the device there isn't much more

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.809 
size of the device there isn't much more
around<00:04:03.650> like<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:04.010> Kindle<00:04:06.130> so<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.579> don't<00:04:07.730> get

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
around like the Kindle so you don't get

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.780 
around like the Kindle so you don't get
a<00:04:07.880> keyboard<00:04:08.120> but<00:04:09.819> you<00:04:10.819> could<00:04:11.590> type<00:04:12.590> in<00:04:12.739> type<00:04:13.670> in

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
a keyboard but you could type in type in

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.690 
a keyboard but you could type in type in
some<00:04:14.000> text<00:04:14.030> with<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.660> with<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.019> stylus<00:04:15.700> if

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
some text with the with the stylus if

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.400 
some text with the with the stylus if
you<00:04:16.789> just<00:04:16.970> need<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.239> type<00:04:17.419> in<00:04:17.539> a<00:04:17.600> title<00:04:17.750> is<00:04:18.019> fine

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
you just need to type in a title is fine

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.610 
you just need to type in a title is fine
and<00:04:18.970> if<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:20.120> want<00:04:20.330> to<00:04:20.419> do<00:04:20.659> circles<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:21.380> do

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
and if you want to do circles and do

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.920 
and if you want to do circles and do
handwriting<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.940> status<00:04:23.330> is

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
handwriting the status is

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.469 
handwriting the status is
better<00:04:24.259> and<00:04:24.530> faster<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.310> it's<00:04:25.940> perfect<00:04:26.419> for

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
better and faster and it's perfect for

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.320 
better and faster and it's perfect for
students<00:04:27.460> professionals<00:04:28.460> I<00:04:28.759> think<00:04:29.000> it's

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
students professionals I think it's

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.749 
students professionals I think it's
pretty<00:04:29.509> perfect<00:04:29.960> for<00:04:30.020> that<00:04:30.229> and<00:04:30.560> if<00:04:31.490> there<00:04:31.669> was

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
pretty perfect for that and if there was

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.300 
pretty perfect for that and if there was
a<00:04:31.820> way<00:04:32.030> that<00:04:32.060> they<00:04:32.479> would<00:04:32.690> combine<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:33.310> reduce

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
a way that they would combine the reduce

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.610 
a way that they would combine the reduce
keyboard<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:35.120> enter<00:04:35.240> text<00:04:35.690> maybe<00:04:36.110> that<00:04:36.530> could

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
keyboard to enter text maybe that could

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.890 
keyboard to enter text maybe that could
be<00:04:38.259> the<00:04:39.259> ultimate<00:04:39.550> solution<00:04:40.570> if<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:41.630> would

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
be the ultimate solution if you would

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.110 
be the ultimate solution if you would
like<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.199> enter<00:04:42.410> text<00:04:42.830> as<00:04:43.039> well<00:04:43.190> or<00:04:43.639> what<00:04:43.820> could

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
like to enter text as well or what could

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.879 
like to enter text as well or what could
be<00:04:44.180> perhaps<00:04:44.660> just<00:04:44.900> cool<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.289> that<00:04:45.500> you<00:04:45.650> just

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
be perhaps just cool is that you just

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.850 
be perhaps just cool is that you just
synchronize<00:04:46.430> your<00:04:46.820> your<00:04:47.720> e-reader<00:04:47.990> with<00:04:48.500> your

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
synchronize your your e-reader with your

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.430 
synchronize your your e-reader with your
laptop<00:04:49.220> perhaps<00:04:49.970> over<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.330> internet<00:04:50.630> so<00:04:50.840> you

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
laptop perhaps over the internet so you

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.170 
laptop perhaps over the internet so you
can<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:51.889> can<00:04:51.919> type<00:04:52.400> in<00:04:52.550> all<00:04:52.699> the<00:04:52.850> text<00:04:53.090> you

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
can you can type in all the text you
