this<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.350> an<00:00:04.500> alpha<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.400> game<00:00:05.580> called<00:00:05.850> mini

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.179 
this is an alpha of a game called mini
Metro<00:00:06.359> it's<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.200> very<00:00:07.379> simple<00:00:07.589> game<00:00:07.710> but<00:00:08.160> I

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
Metro it's a very simple game but I

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.020 
Metro it's a very simple game but I
enjoy<00:00:08.550> it<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.700> lot

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
enjoy it a lot

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.690 
enjoy it a lot
because<00:00:09.300> I'm<00:00:09.630> kind<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.110> nerd<00:00:10.320> as<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.490> might

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
because I'm kind of a nerd as you might

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.200 
because I'm kind of a nerd as you might
imagine<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.809> game<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.500> make<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:14.210> train

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
imagine so the game is you make a train

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.859 
imagine so the game is you make a train
system<00:00:15.570> basically<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.580> not<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> good

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
system basically and this is not a good

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.740 
system basically and this is not a good
start<00:00:19.189> this<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.369> just<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.699> silly<00:00:21.180> drawing

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
start this is just a silly drawing

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.750 
start this is just a silly drawing
things<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.109> line<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.800> randomizes<00:00:23.220> these

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
things in a line and it randomizes these

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.779 
things in a line and it randomizes these
stations<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.449> basically<00:00:24.810> you're<00:00:25.050> just

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
stations but basically you're just

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.820 
stations but basically you're just
drawing<00:00:26.789> lines<00:00:27.449> between<00:00:27.840> your<00:00:28.109> things<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.769> I

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
drawing lines between your things and I

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.700 
drawing lines between your things and I
have<00:00:28.949> three<00:00:29.480> train<00:00:30.480> lines<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:31.050> work<00:00:31.170> from<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
have three train lines to work from to

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.979 
have three train lines to work from to
work<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.579> moment<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:33.960> a

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
work with for the moment and we have a

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.290 
work with for the moment and we have a
timer<00:00:34.559> here<00:00:34.890> counting<00:00:35.579> through<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> week<00:00:36.059> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
timer here counting through the week and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.729 
timer here counting through the week and
at<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> end<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> week<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> get

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
at the end of the week I'm going to get

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.549 
at the end of the week I'm going to get
an<00:00:37.800> upgrade<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> river<00:00:40.140> here

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
an upgrade and then we have a river here

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.560 
an upgrade and then we have a river here
and<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> limited<00:00:41.670> number<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> tunnels

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and we have a limited number of tunnels

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.660 
and we have a limited number of tunnels
that<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.379> use<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.590> cross<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.460> river<00:00:46.670> this

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
that we can use to cross that river this

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
that we can use to cross that river this
is<00:00:47.820> not<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> good<00:00:48.239> layout<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.530> I've<00:00:49.649> started<00:00:49.950> out

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
is not a good layout so I've started out

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.970 
is not a good layout so I've started out
horribly<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.110> okay<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.860> all

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
horribly here but it's okay this is all

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.090 
horribly here but it's okay this is all
learning<00:00:53.309> experience<00:00:54.500> now<00:00:55.500> let<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.860> train

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
learning experience now let this train

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.720 
learning experience now let this train
go<00:00:57.020> alright<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.469> need<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.800> line<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.670> I'm

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
go alright so we need that line so I'm

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.340 
go alright so we need that line so I'm
going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.879> take<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.270> red<00:01:00.660> line<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.109> I'm

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
going to take this red line and I'm

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.319 
going to take this red line and I'm
going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.559> loop<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> around<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.239> be

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
going to loop it around it's going to be

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.709 
going to loop it around it's going to be
great

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
great

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.030 
great
so<00:01:04.229> now<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.650> yellow<00:01:04.890> line<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:06.210> can

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
so now I have this yellow line and I can

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.710 
so now I have this yellow line and I can
let<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.280> go<00:01:10.880> let's<00:01:11.880> connect<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.540> this

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
let this one go let's connect it this

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.359 
let this one go let's connect it this
way<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:14.000> then<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.479> go<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.750> way<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
way and then that can go this way and

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.210 
way and then that can go this way and
then<00:01:17.369> oh<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:18.240> don't<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.780> any<00:01:18.930> more<00:01:19.020> towels

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
can do that and then we'll let this one

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.359 
can do that and then we'll let this one
go<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.290> fantastic<00:01:28.860> at

go up here I'm not fantastic at

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.160 
go up here I'm not fantastic at
designing<00:01:30.409> subway<00:01:31.409> systems<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:33.170> enjoy

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
designing subway systems but I enjoy

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.200 
designing subway systems but I enjoy
staring<00:01:34.710> at<00:01:34.829> all<00:01:34.860> these<00:01:35.189> pretty<00:01:35.490> lines<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
staring at all these pretty lines and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.410 
staring at all these pretty lines and
thinking<00:01:37.170> about<00:01:37.409> what<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> person<00:01:39.000> who<00:01:39.180> was

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
thinking about what a person who was

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.020 
thinking about what a person who was
good<00:01:39.659> at<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.900> would<00:01:40.200> would<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> can

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
good at this would would do so I can

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.330 
good at this would would do so I can
undo<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.570> one<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.680> loop<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.070> around

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
undo this one here I can loop it around

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.700 
undo this one here I can loop it around
here<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:46.020> from<00:01:46.320> New<00:01:46.470> York

the number of people that we have

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.209 
the number of people that we have
delivered<00:02:00.450> safely<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.380> their<00:02:01.469> destinations

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
people who need to go to a circle

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.370 
people who need to go to a circle
station

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
station

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.780 
station
so<00:02:13.530> they're<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.830> go<00:02:14.220> all<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.460> way<00:02:14.580> down

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
so they're going to go all the way down

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.120 
so they're going to go all the way down
here<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.300> when<00:02:15.810> these<00:02:15.960> build<00:02:16.410> up<00:02:16.590> they<00:02:16.860> start

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
here and when these build up they start

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.450 
here and when these build up they start
to<00:02:17.310> get<00:02:18.090> angry<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.690> shake<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:20.070> things<00:02:20.310> like

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
to get angry and shake and things like

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.810 
to get angry and shake and things like
that<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:20.700> oh<00:02:21.470> no<00:02:22.470> how<00:02:22.920> do<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.100> connect<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.670> this

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
that so oh no how do I connect to this

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.240 
that so oh no how do I connect to this
one<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.240> can't<00:02:24.810> make<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.110> train<00:02:25.410> any<00:02:25.800> longer

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
one I can't make this train any longer

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.920 
one I can't make this train any longer
all<00:02:26.790> right<00:02:27.030> hold<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.330> we're<00:02:27.510> at<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.720> end<00:02:27.840> of

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
all right hold on we're at the end of

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.080 
all right hold on we're at the end of
the<00:02:27.990> way<00:02:28.080> here<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.250> get<00:02:29.430> an<00:02:29.580> extra<00:02:29.700> line

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
the way here so I can get an extra line

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
the way here so I can get an extra line
so<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:30.870> can<00:02:30.960> make<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> new<00:02:31.440> train<00:02:32.220> line<00:02:32.430> here<00:02:33.110> so

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
so I can make a new train line here so

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.430 
so I can make a new train line here so
let's<00:02:34.440> make<00:02:34.740> this<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:34.980> go<00:02:35.310> here<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.260> then<00:02:37.260> it

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
let's make this one go here and then it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.670 
let's make this one go here and then it
can<00:02:37.620> go<00:02:37.830> oh<00:02:38.190> we<00:02:39.090> can't<00:02:39.330> cross<00:02:39.600> train<00:02:40.470> lines

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
can go oh we can't cross train lines

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.480 
can go oh we can't cross train lines
there<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.130> go<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.930> that's<00:02:43.860> okay<00:02:44.190> that's

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
there we go so that's okay that's

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.280 
there we go so that's okay that's
something<00:02:44.700> right<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.270> then<00:02:46.760> go<00:02:47.760> away<00:02:48.290> get

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
something right and then go away get

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.020 
something right and then go away get
this<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.100> then<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.340> can<00:02:50.490> loop<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.820> run

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
this one and then I can loop this run

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.280 
this one and then I can loop this run
here<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:51.600> that's<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.960> loop<00:02:52.110> and

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
here and then that's in a loop and

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.990 
here and then that's in a loop and
that's<00:02:52.470> pretty<00:02:52.680> cool<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.490> we<00:02:53.580> got<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> little

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
that's pretty cool so we got a little

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.230 
that's pretty cool so we got a little
loop<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.590> trains<00:02:55.590> everything's<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.790> far<00:02:57.000> so

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
loop and trains everything's so far so

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.790 
loop and trains everything's so far so
good

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
good

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.040 
good
so<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.700> an<00:02:59.820> alpha<00:02:59.970> it's<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:00.660> got<00:03:00.870> bugs

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
so this is an alpha it's it's got bugs

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.150 
so this is an alpha it's it's got bugs
it<00:03:01.290> has<00:03:01.440> no<00:03:01.620> audio<00:03:01.800> as<00:03:02.100> you<00:03:02.190> can<00:03:02.340> see<00:03:03.770> but<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:05.010> is

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
it has no audio as you can see but it is

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.040 
it has no audio as you can see but it is
is<00:03:05.460> still<00:03:05.760> pretty<00:03:06.000> fun<00:03:06.240> game<00:03:06.270> it's<00:03:06.660> on<00:03:06.780> Steam

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
is still pretty fun game it's on Steam

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.780 
is still pretty fun game it's on Steam
greenlight<00:03:07.260> right<00:03:07.710> now

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
greenlight right now

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.910 
greenlight right now
and<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:10.380> kind<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.620> like<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:12.620> don't<00:03:13.620> know<00:03:13.800> what

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
and I kind of like it I don't know what

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.400 
and I kind of like it I don't know what
to<00:03:14.010> do<00:03:14.160> with<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.400> arrow<00:03:14.670> station<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:16.290> other

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
to do with this arrow station the other

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.460 
to do with this arrow station the other
thing<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:17.360> these<00:03:18.360> stations<00:03:19.140> kind<00:03:19.410> of

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
thing is that these stations kind of

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.590 
thing is that these stations kind of
represent<00:03:20.010> things<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.520> figure<00:03:21.270> out<00:03:21.330> which<00:03:21.450> is

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
represent things I figure out which is

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.500 
represent things I figure out which is
which<00:03:21.740> but<00:03:22.740> like<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.160> squares<00:03:23.520> I<00:03:23.880> think<00:03:24.240> are

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
which but like the squares I think are

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.590 
which but like the squares I think are
commercial<00:03:25.050> areas<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.940> triangles<00:03:27.450> are

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
commercial areas the triangles are

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.450 
commercial areas the triangles are
residential<00:03:28.020> areas<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.740> that<00:03:29.160> kind<00:03:29.400> of

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
residential areas and that kind of

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.550 
residential areas and that kind of
affects<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.030> frequency<00:03:30.570> of<00:03:30.870> how<00:03:31.050> many<00:03:31.290> help

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
affects the frequency of how many help

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.690 
affects the frequency of how many help
how<00:03:31.830> many<00:03:32.130> people<00:03:32.460> need<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.700> go<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.840> area

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
how many people need to go to that area

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.740 
how many people need to go to that area
so<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:35.730> don't<00:03:35.910> have<00:03:35.970> another<00:03:36.150> train<00:03:36.420> what<00:03:36.600> do<00:03:36.660> I

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
so I don't have another train what do I

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.610 
so I don't have another train what do I
do

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
do

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.800 
do
what<00:03:38.070> if<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.250> undo<00:03:38.640> this<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.420> go<00:03:39.600> like<00:03:39.750> that

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
what if I undo this and I go like that

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.440 
what if I undo this and I go like that
all<00:03:40.650> right<00:03:40.800> at<00:03:40.950> least<00:03:40.980> that'll<00:03:41.340> be<00:03:41.460> doing

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
all right at least that'll be doing

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.080 
all right at least that'll be doing
something<00:03:42.780> for<00:03:42.960> for<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.380> moment<00:03:43.710> and<00:03:43.910> we<00:03:44.910> can

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
something for for the moment and we can

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.590 
something for for the moment and we can
