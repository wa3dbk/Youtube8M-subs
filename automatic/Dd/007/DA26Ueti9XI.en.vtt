00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
know what it was it was at the beginning

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.720 
know what it was it was at the beginning
and<00:04:46.750> ending<00:04:47.080> were<00:04:47.230> so<00:04:47.590> much<00:04:47.770> better<00:04:48.040> yeah

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
and ending were so much better yeah

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.060 
and ending were so much better yeah
that's<00:04:49.150> what<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.390> was<00:04:49.480> his<00:04:50.200> style<00:04:50.590> from<00:04:50.800> that

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
that's what it was his style from that

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.400 
that's what it was his style from that
like<00:04:51.250> I<00:04:51.460> respect<00:04:52.300> his<00:04:52.420> verse<00:04:52.900> because<00:04:53.290> it

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
like I respect his verse because it

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.620 
like I respect his verse because it
sounded<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.710> lot<00:04:53.860> like<00:04:54.070> 90<00:04:54.640> styles<00:04:55.090> like<00:04:55.420> two

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
pockets it's to see there's something

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.950 
pockets it's to see there's something
that<00:04:57.850> needs<00:04:58.210> to<00:04:58.390> be<00:04:58.420> said<00:04:58.720> there's<00:04:58.900> a

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
that needs to be said there's a

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.380 
that needs to be said there's a
difference<00:04:59.050> between<00:04:59.530> you<00:05:00.190> know<00:05:00.340> this<00:05:00.520> rap<00:05:01.090> and

difference between you know this rap and

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.650 
difference between you know this rap and
like<00:05:02.020> club<00:05:02.680> rap<00:05:02.950> open<00:05:03.700> house<00:05:03.850> rap<00:05:04.180> oh<00:05:04.360> yeah

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
yeah hardcore like straight-up rap is

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.330 
yeah hardcore like straight-up rap is
that<00:05:07.300> because<00:05:07.690> all<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.080> is<00:05:08.200> is<00:05:08.530> basically<00:05:08.710> one

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
that because all it is is basically one

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.340 
that because all it is is basically one
type<00:05:09.580> of<00:05:09.610> instrumentation<00:05:10.420> liner<00:05:10.900> like

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
type of instrumentation liner like

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.140 
type of instrumentation liner like
simple<00:05:11.680> beat<00:05:11.890> yes<00:05:12.460> I'm<00:05:12.700> saying<00:05:12.880> in<00:05:13.030> the

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
background and then it's just like okay

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.700 
background and then it's just like okay
go<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:15.880> that's<00:05:16.450> exactly<00:05:16.780> what<00:05:17.080> he<00:05:17.140> did<00:05:17.320> and

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
go and that's exactly what he did and

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.840 
go and that's exactly what he did and
you<00:05:17.770> don't<00:05:17.980> really<00:05:18.070> see<00:05:18.250> that<00:05:18.280> a<00:05:18.430> lot<00:05:18.580> in<00:05:18.610> like

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
you don't really see that a lot in like

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.800 
you don't really see that a lot in like
the<00:05:19.060> Korean<00:05:19.900> industry<00:05:20.530> of<00:05:20.980> sorts<00:05:21.400> so<00:05:21.730> it<00:05:21.910> it

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
that's we we only got the fact that he

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.280 
that's we we only got the fact that he
was<00:05:32.260> like<00:05:32.440> a<00:05:32.470> phoenix<00:05:33.300> went<00:05:34.300> through<00:05:34.540> damages

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
was like a phoenix went through damages

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.580 
was like a phoenix went through damages
yeah<00:05:36.010> is<00:05:36.250> that<00:05:36.970> like<00:05:37.150> his<00:05:37.450> like<00:05:37.870> I<00:05:38.050> guess<00:05:38.410> what

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
yeah is that like his like I guess what

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.909 
yeah is that like his like I guess what
it's<00:05:38.710> maybe<00:05:39.070> it's<00:05:39.400> a<00:05:40.390> weak<00:05:40.660> debut<00:05:41.110> like<00:05:41.470> as<00:05:41.680> rap

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
it's maybe it's a weak debut like as rap

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.460 
it's maybe it's a weak debut like as rap
monster<00:05:42.430> I<00:05:42.610> think<00:05:43.180> it<00:05:43.300> this<00:05:43.600> one

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
monster I think it this one

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.620 
monster I think it this one
really<00:05:44.830> is<00:05:44.950> fairly<00:05:45.370> straightforward<00:05:45.880> yeah

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
really is fairly straightforward yeah

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.230 
really is fairly straightforward yeah
it's<00:05:47.560> just<00:05:47.950> simple<00:05:48.310> music<00:05:48.580> video<00:05:48.820> it's<00:05:49.180> just

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
it's just simple music video it's just

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.050 
it's just simple music video it's just
him<00:05:49.540> rapping<00:05:50.260> and<00:05:50.440> then<00:05:50.500> yeah<00:05:50.890> Bernie<00:05:51.220> that's

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
him rapping and then yeah Bernie that's

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.760 
him rapping and then yeah Bernie that's
what<00:05:52.420> I'm<00:05:52.480> confused<00:05:52.720> was<00:05:53.110> it<00:05:53.230> going<00:05:53.470> in<00:05:53.590> bet

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
what I'm confused was it going in bet

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.320 
what I'm confused was it going in bet
like<00:05:53.950> it<00:05:54.100> looked<00:05:54.280> like<00:05:54.400> the<00:05:54.550> fire<00:05:54.760> was<00:05:55.000> coming

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
like it looked like the fire was coming

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.720 
like it looked like the fire was coming
like<00:05:55.450> inward<00:05:56.050> like<00:05:56.440> if<00:05:56.590> it<00:05:56.710> was<00:05:56.800> rewinded<00:05:57.370> yeah

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
like inward like if it was rewinded yeah

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:58.890 
like inward like if it was rewinded yeah
I<00:05:57.760> think<00:05:57.910> that's<00:05:58.180> just<00:05:58.330> because<00:05:58.450> I<00:05:58.810> think

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
I think that's just because I think

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.780 
I think that's just because I think
that's<00:05:59.110> the<00:05:59.260> effect<00:05:59.770> but<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.160> purpose<00:06:00.610> is

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
that's the effect but the purpose is

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.360 
that's the effect but the purpose is
he's<00:06:01.060> being<00:06:01.270> reported<00:06:01.690> yeah<00:06:02.080> yeah<00:06:02.710> like<00:06:03.250> the

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
he's being reported yeah yeah like the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.630 
he's being reported yeah yeah like the
fire's<00:06:03.900> changing<00:06:04.900> him<00:06:05.050> right<00:06:05.590> and<00:06:05.860> through

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
fire's changing him right and through

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.670 
fire's changing him right and through
the<00:06:06.760> fire<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.030> flame<00:06:07.540> it's<00:06:07.840> about<00:06:08.050> we<00:06:08.410> carry

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
the fire and flame it's about we carry

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.640 
the fire and flame it's about we carry
on<00:06:08.860> yeah<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.640> conduit<00:06:10.120> and<00:06:10.660> emerging<00:06:11.260> from<00:06:11.530> it

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
on yeah the conduit and emerging from it

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.170 
on yeah the conduit and emerging from it
stronger<00:06:12.040> than<00:06:12.190> ever<00:06:12.370> before<00:06:12.760> I<00:06:12.910> agree
