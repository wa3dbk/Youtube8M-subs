00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
think I believe this probably was you

something<00:03:14.910> like<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:17.630> let's<00:03:18.630> try<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.930> again

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.470 

zero<00:03:29.610> my<00:03:29.819> hangout<00:03:30.750> again

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.270 

okay<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.780> 69<00:03:37.260> 70<00:03:37.650> grams<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.660> giant<00:03:39.989> one

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
okay so 69 70 grams and the giant one

aluminum a little bit lighter 47 grams

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.080 
aluminum a little bit lighter 47 grams
versus<00:03:47.580> 70<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:48.380> substantially<00:03:49.380> lighter<00:03:49.590> and

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
versus 70 so substantially lighter and

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.850 
versus 70 so substantially lighter and
this<00:03:51.090> one<00:03:51.300> I<00:03:51.540> don't<00:03:51.930> have<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.110> clue<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.650> is

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
this one I don't have a clue this is

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.830 
this one I don't have a clue this is
probably<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.310> cheap<00:03:54.090> one<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.569> can<00:03:54.690> get

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
probably a cheap one that you can get

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.300 
probably a cheap one that you can get
anywhere<00:03:55.160> at<00:03:56.160> least<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.519> sells<00:03:56.790> giant<00:03:58.310> so

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
anywhere at least that sells giant so

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.400 
anywhere at least that sells giant so
why<00:04:00.090> would<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.330> want<00:04:00.569> to<00:04:00.630> choose<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.170> more

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
why would I want to choose the more

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
down on the down tube it probably worked

down on the down tube it probably worked
fine<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:38.669> don't<00:04:38.940> recommend<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.450> on<00:04:39.539> a<00:04:39.570> mountain

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930

today I came along and found this giant
now<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.800> found<00:04:56.070> a<00:04:56.250> previous<00:04:56.729> version<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.330> this<00:04:57.600> I

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
don't know if it was giant it looked

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.810 
don't know if it was giant it looked
similar<00:04:59.910> but<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:01.080> was<00:05:01.110> just<00:05:01.440> too<00:05:01.740> small<00:05:02.160> to<00:05:02.550> fit

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
similar but it was just too small to fit

found<00:05:05.729> this<00:05:05.910> today<00:05:06.210> saw<00:05:06.630> it<00:05:06.810> try<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.650> water

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
found this today saw it try to water

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.800 
found this today saw it try to water
bottle<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:08.370> it<00:05:08.460> fit<00:05:08.729> perfect<00:05:09.270> now<00:05:09.479> the<00:05:09.539> big

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
bottle and it fit perfect now the big

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.270 
bottle and it fit perfect now the big
thing<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:10.139> I<00:05:10.320> really<00:05:10.620> like<00:05:10.830> about<00:05:10.860> it<00:05:11.100> is

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
thing that I really like about it is

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.060 
thing that I really like about it is
it's<00:05:11.789> not<00:05:11.850> an<00:05:12.110> open-mouth<00:05:13.110> design<00:05:13.590> like<00:05:13.889> this

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
it's not an open-mouth design like this

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.370 
it's not an open-mouth design like this
one<00:05:14.310> and<00:05:14.520> it's<00:05:15.450> very<00:05:15.870> stiff<00:05:17.930> so<00:05:18.930> I'm<00:05:19.020> not<00:05:19.229> going

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
one and it's very stiff so I'm not going

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.500 
one and it's very stiff so I'm not going
to<00:05:19.440> have<00:05:19.620> bottles<00:05:20.070> popping<00:05:20.850> out<00:05:20.970> of<00:05:21.000> this<00:05:21.270> and

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
to have bottles popping out of this and

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.430 
to have bottles popping out of this and
I<00:05:22.350> happen<00:05:22.650> to<00:05:22.680> really<00:05:22.889> like<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.550> matte<00:05:24.440> carbon

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
I happen to really like the matte carbon

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.320 
I happen to really like the matte carbon
fibre<00:05:25.710> weave<00:05:26.510> now<00:05:27.510> is<00:05:27.690> it<00:05:27.780> worth<00:05:27.960> $50<00:05:29.060> well<00:05:30.060> if

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
fibre weave now is it worth $50 well if

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.760 
fibre weave now is it worth $50 well if
it<00:05:30.450> keeps<00:05:30.600> you<00:05:30.750> from<00:05:30.810> losing<00:05:31.289> your<00:05:31.320> bottles

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
it keeps you from losing your bottles

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.610 
it keeps you from losing your bottles
and<00:05:31.830> you<00:05:31.950> have<00:05:32.130> to<00:05:32.280> constantly<00:05:32.610> be<00:05:33.260> stopping<00:05:34.260> I

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
and you have to constantly be stopping I

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.120 
and you have to constantly be stopping I
think<00:05:34.919> it<00:05:35.039> is

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.260 

but<00:05:39.130> that's<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.460> main<00:05:39.639> thing<00:05:39.910> is<00:05:40.030> it's<00:05:40.180> a

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
but that's the main thing is it's a

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.900 
but that's the main thing is it's a
really<00:05:40.540> stiff<00:05:41.110> carbon<00:05:41.620> cage<00:05:41.860> it's<00:05:42.400> very<00:05:42.670> light

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
really stiff carbon cage it's very light

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.770 
really stiff carbon cage it's very light
25<00:05:45.910> grams<00:05:46.300> and<00:05:47.340> it's<00:05:48.340> not<00:05:48.520> an<00:05:48.639> open<00:05:48.760> friend<00:05:49.240> so

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
25 grams and it's not an open friend so

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.970 
25 grams and it's not an open friend so
I<00:05:49.810> don't<00:05:49.990> have<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.230> worry<00:05:50.410> about<00:05:50.500> bottles

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
I don't have to worry about bottles

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.250 
I don't have to worry about bottles
popping<00:05:51.400> out<00:05:54.270> so<00:05:55.270> yep<00:05:55.510> when<00:05:55.720> you<00:05:55.810> get<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:55.960> pair

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
popping out so yep when you get a pair

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.480 
popping out so yep when you get a pair
of<00:05:56.320> these<00:05:56.530> you'll<00:05:56.830> end<00:05:56.950> up<00:05:57.010> spending<00:05:57.250> a

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
of these you'll end up spending a

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.120 
of these you'll end up spending a
hundred<00:05:57.850> bucks<00:05:58.500> versus<00:05:59.500> say<00:05:59.710> if<00:05:59.830> I<00:05:59.950> were<00:06:00.040> to

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
hundred bucks versus say if I were to

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.379 
hundred bucks versus say if I were to
get<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.370> bell<00:06:00.550> wine<00:06:00.850> and<00:06:01.120> while<00:06:01.210> you're

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
get the bell wine and while you're

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:08.690 
get the bell wine and while you're
spending<00:06:01.990> probably<00:06:02.200> $12<00:06:02.889> for<00:06:03.100> two<00:06:03.250> of<00:06:03.400> them

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.150 

but<00:06:09.700> for<00:06:09.760> the<00:06:10.090> look<00:06:10.300> for<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:10.930> stiffness<00:06:11.470> for

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
but for the look for the stiffness for

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.280 
but for the look for the stiffness for
the<00:06:12.220> weight<00:06:12.430> I<00:06:13.800> think<00:06:14.800> it's<00:06:14.950> pretty<00:06:15.100> cool<00:06:15.400> and

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
the weight I think it's pretty cool and

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.620 
the weight I think it's pretty cool and
once<00:06:17.290> again<00:06:17.440> that<00:06:17.830> is<00:06:18.040> the<00:06:18.340> giant<00:06:19.000> gateway

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
once again that is the giant gateway

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:26.550 
once again that is the giant gateway
pearl<00:06:20.200> 1<00:06:20.560> carbon<00:06:21.040> bottle<00:06:21.550> cage<00:06:24.960> so<00:06:25.960> yeah<00:06:26.290> post

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.640 
in the comments let me know what you use
if<00:06:28.360> you<00:06:28.480> found<00:06:28.690> anything<00:06:28.960> lighter<00:06:29.410> I<00:06:29.530> know

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
if you found anything lighter I know

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.520 
if you found anything lighter I know
there's<00:06:29.890> some<00:06:30.040> lighter<00:06:30.280> stuff<00:06:30.610> out<00:06:30.790> there<00:06:31.000> but

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
there's some lighter stuff out there but

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.990 
there's some lighter stuff out there but
they<00:06:32.530> may<00:06:32.740> not<00:06:32.890> hold<00:06:33.130> as<00:06:33.310> well<00:06:33.490> because<00:06:33.820> what

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
they may not hold as well because what

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.400 
they may not hold as well because what
happens<00:06:34.330> is<00:06:34.479> you<00:06:34.600> build<00:06:34.780> something<00:06:34.990> really

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
happens is you build something really

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
happens is you build something really
really<00:06:35.620> light<00:06:35.830> it<00:06:35.979> tends<00:06:36.160> to<00:06:36.250> be<00:06:36.400> very

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
really light it tends to be very

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.540 
really light it tends to be very
flexible<00:06:36.760> and<00:06:37.210> very<00:06:37.389> flimsy<00:06:38.220> and<00:06:39.220> it<00:06:39.340> won't

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
flexible and very flimsy and it won't

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.390 
flexible and very flimsy and it won't
hold<00:06:39.850> a<00:06:40.000> bottle<00:06:40.150> cage<00:06:40.419> especially<00:06:41.280> mounted<00:06:42.280> to

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
hold a bottle cage especially mounted to

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.890 
hold a bottle cage especially mounted to
the<00:06:42.490> back<00:06:42.640> of<00:06:42.820> a<00:06:42.880> seat<00:06:43.120> post<00:06:43.390> and<00:06:43.600> one<00:06:43.750> of<00:06:43.840> the

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
the back of a seat post and one of the

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.770 
the back of a seat post and one of the
arrow<00:06:44.110> holders<00:06:44.590> I<00:06:44.970> fully<00:06:45.970> plan<00:06:46.060> on<00:06:46.360> using<00:06:46.540> this

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
arrow holders I fully plan on using this

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.969 
arrow holders I fully plan on using this
in<00:06:46.960> the<00:06:47.050> back<00:06:48.120> and<00:06:49.120> I<00:06:49.210> think<00:06:49.419> it<00:06:49.510> will<00:06:49.570> work

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
in the back and I think it will work

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:51.630 
in the back and I think it will work
fantastic<00:06:50.979> and<00:06:51.100> I<00:06:51.130> don't<00:06:51.190> have<00:06:51.400> to<00:06:51.490> worry

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:51.640 
fantastic and I don't have to worry

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.900 
fantastic and I don't have to worry
about<00:06:51.729> losing<00:06:52.150> my<00:06:52.240> bottles<00:06:52.600> anymore
